<HEADLINE> General Strike Affects Public Life in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The nation-wide general
strike called by a leftist movement group today in Nepal in
protest of the treaty with India on a border river development had
mixed impact on different parts of the country, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu area, which comprises three towns including the
capital city, were virtually deserted for the whole day with
almost all commercial activities remaining stopped and much fewer
vehicles running on the streets.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation was generally normal in the Kathmandu
valley despite some sporadic incidents of stone-throwing at
private vehicles, according to a spokesman of the Home Ministry
here.
</P>
<P>
About 10 vehicles were damaged from these incidents in the
capital area, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, police arrested some 250 people throughout
the country today when they were trying to halt traffic and close
down markets by force.
</P>
<P>
The arrested, except those involved in vandalism activities,
were released later after being scrutinized, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reports from different parts of the country said the general
strike affected the normal public life in some areas but bore no
impact to others.
</P>
<P>
The leftist National Democratic Front had called for the
one-day general strike to protest the Nepal-India treaty on the
integrated development of the Mahakali river, which is under
discussion in the Nepali parliament these days.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali river is Nepal's western border river with India.
The two countries signed the treaty on the development of the
river last February in new Delhi.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Nepali parliament would vote on the
controversial treaty within a few days.
</P>
<P>
Rejection of the treaty by the parliament would pose a threat
to the survival of the coalition government, political observers
here said.

<HEADLINE> White-fly Attacks Urban Areas in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- White fly, the pest
notorious for damaging cotton crop, has now diverted its attack
towards urban areas in central Punjab in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
After rigorous sprays of pesticides in agriculture fields in
Punjab, Pakistan's main cotton producing province, the pest have
moved to towns and cities, especially in the central area of the
province.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan said city doctors have found a
number of patients suffering from different skin diseases in
various hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Doctors believe that the main cause for the skin diseases is
the attack by white flies, which moved to the populated areas.
</P>
<P>
The present viral conjunctivitus, a viral disease which causes
severe itching, is also caused by the same attack.
</P>
<P>
A large number of patients of such disease have also been
reported.
</P>
<P>
Local agro-experts observed that the white fly attack this year
is much higher than the previous years following high temperature
coupled with long dry spell.
</P>
<P>
On remedy of the diseases, experts said that the pest might
come back to the fields after some time or it may die in urban
areas due to lack of food.
</P>
<P>
But nobody could specify the time period or life of the
attacking flies.
</P>
<P>
Experts said as it is the first time that the insect attacked
the urban areas, so they are unable to advise any immediate
treatment.

CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Demark signed on Thursday an agreement under
which Denmark will offer a grant of 5.16 Egyptian pounds (about
1.52 million U.S. dollars) to develop an Egyptian anti-pollution
plan, the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The grant is part of the two countries' agreement on
environmental conservation and prevention of oil spills in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government have prepared new energy
projects for beyond the year 2020 in line with the projections
for Turkey's energy needs in the next period, according to Weeky
Probe which was published here today.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that the total value of the projects has
been calculated at about 24 billion dollars. Almost 9.8 billion
dollars of that amount will be used for build-operate-transfer
(BOT) projects, in which the natural gas power plants have the
lion's share.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that Turkey's general energy needs
increases twofold in each 10-year period, which means Turkey is
becoming much more dependent on foreign sources to meet its
energy needs.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is to announce cotton export prices Saturday in
line with its cotton trading liberalization policy amid signs of
rapprochement of prices between the Egyptian and corresponding
American varieties.
</P>
<P>
An extra L.E. 10 (about three U.S.dollars) will be disbursed
for every qantar of choice plucking cotton upon ginning to
encourage crop growers and in the quest for expediting the
delivery of choice plucking cotton exceeding one million qantars.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- Kuwait and Egypt would soon open discussions on the
establishment of a joint free zone. Egypt's Minister of the
Business Sector Atef Ebeid would lead a ministerial delegation to
visit the kingdom Saturday for this purpose among other things.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Sino-Japanese Ties Must Not Deviate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of Japanese
right-wingers landed on Beixiao island, one of China's Diaoyu
Islands on Monday to rebuild a lighthouse, the fourth time
Japanese right-wing groups have seriously infringed China's
sovereignty over the islands since July.
</P>
<P>
The acts, which defy China's solemn and just representations,
cannot but arouse the indignation of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The chain of Diaoyu Islands has been part of Chinese territory
since ancient times. China, out of consideration for
Sino-Japanese friendly relations, has always maintained that the
two sides, on the basis of respecting facts, should solve the
dispute over the islands through consulation and dialog.
</P>
<P>
When China and Japan normalized diplomatic relations in 1972
and signed a treaty of peace and friendship in 1978, the two sides
agreed to shelve the issue for future solution.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that the understanding reached between the two sides
was very important, as it was conducive to the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
China has long proposed "putting aside disputes and carrying
out joint development" of the islands. It has always abided by
the proposal and exercised restraint over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, Japanese right-wingers have caused trouble by
landing on the islands. These illegal activities violate China's
territorial sovereignty and hamper Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government should ban such activities to reverse
the adverse impact they have produced.
</P>
<P>
However, it is incomprehensible that the Japanese government
has taken no effective measures to prohibit such activities.
Instead, it has taken a laissez-faire attitude and even connived
at these activities, which have damaged Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said in Hong Kong
recently that building a lighthouse, sending warships or planes to
patrol the islands has nothing to do with any territorial dispute
so long as the Japanese government exercises effective
jurisdiction over the islands.
</P>
<P>
These erroneous and irresponsible words not only violate
previous understandings between the two countries, but also
bolster and encourage the right-wingers who are intentionally
provoking China.
</P>
<P>
People wonder whether the illegal activities of the Japanese
right-wingers have the government's tacit support and whether
there are ulterior motives for stirring up these incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side have claimed that the activities of the
right-wingers "do not violate Japan's laws and so it is hard to
take actions against them legally or politically." They have even
had the nerve to ask the Chinese side to show understanding.
</P>
<P>
What absurd logic! The chain of Diaoyu Islands is an intrinsic
part of Chinese territory, and this is an indisputable fact.
</P>
<P>
Members of Japan's right-wing groups have set foot on Chinese
territory, infringed China's sovereignty and violated
international law, and the Japanese government claims it is
powerless to act!
</P>
<P>
People must now suspect that Japan's claim to be "a nation with
adequate legal institutions" is a lie or a boast. Japan's excuses
are untenable.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has the duty and obligation to handle
the serious situation over the Diaoyu Islands responsibly.
</P>
<P>
It has said verbally that it does not want to see the situation
deteriorate, but then takes a laissez-faire attitude and even
connives at the activities of the right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
This has led to the now distressing position of Sino-Japanese
relations, which was quite clearly started unilaterally by Japan.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Japanese friendship has not come easily and embodies the
efforts of several generations of Chinese and Japanese. It should
be cherished and safeguarded by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Any attempts to lead Sino-Japanese relations astray will do
neither side any good.
</P>
<P>
We urge the Japanese government to take the interests of
Sino-Japanese relations as a whole into account and act
immediately to eliminate the adverse consequences and influence of
these illegal activities and prevent similar incidents from
happening in future.

<HEADLINE> First Exhibition of Chinese Relics Opens in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 of China's
cultural relics, dating from the New Stone Age some 6500 years
ago, went on display today, the first such exhibition at the
British Museum since 1949.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 Britons attended the opening day of the "Mysteries
of Ancient China" exhibition at the Museum which, along with the
Louvre in France and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,
is one of the world's top three museums.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes a colorful ceramic bowl made in the
upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River during the Neolithic
Age, a suit of clothes made of jade and gold, bronze ware, a
bronze human image and Chinese calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
All the treasures on display date from the period during and
before the Han dynasty which ended in AD 220.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which will end in January 1997, also shows the
new discoveries and results achieved by Chinese scholars in the
study of ancient relics over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars will hold a series of lectures on Chinese
culture at the exhibition, said the organizers.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,000 British celebrities were invited to preview the
exhibition Wednesday and Thursday ahead of today's opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Health praised China for its
achievement on relic protection.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition will enhance the mutual understanding and
friendship between the Chinese and British people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Author Graham Greene, chairman of the British Museum Trustees,
described the exhibition as "a landmark event in the process of
deepening contacts and greater understanding between China and
Britain".
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which got 750,000 pounds (1.2 million
U.S. dollars) of investment from the Times newspaper, has already
been to Germany and Switzerland since 1995 and is due to open in
Denmark in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Northern Iraqis Flee to Iran to Escape War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Between 35,000 to 40,000
people in northern Iraq have fled to neighboring Iran to escape
the raging war between opposition Kurdish groups, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated today.
</P>
<P>
The figures confirm the Iranian government's report on
Wednesday that some 39,000 Iraqi refugees fled to Iran, a UNHCR
official said at a press briefing Friday.
</P>
<P>
Civilians began fleeing the northern Iraqi town of Sulaimaniyah
on Monday just before the town, previously a stronghold of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, fell into the hands of its rival
Kurdish faction, the Kurdistan Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Iranian authorities were running out of
relief supplies such as tents and blankets and that food for the
refugees was also running out.
</P>
<P>
However, the biggest danger was the mining of areas along the
Iraq-Iran border area.
</P>
<P>
To relieve Iran's burden brought by the influx of Iraqi
refugees, UNHCR pledged on Thursday to provide emergency funds to
buy and transport relief items.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Iran accepted more than 3
million Afghan refugees and another 1 million Iraqis. It still
shelters 2 million refugees today, the biggest number in any one
country in the world. Among the refugees still in Iran now, 1.4
million are from Afghanistan and 600,000 from Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) today ordered a senior
leader of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) to publicly apologize
for her remarks against the integration of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE, the organizer of the Bosnian elections, said in a
statement that Acting President of Republika Srpska Biljana
Plavsic has to make an apology on Srpska Television during the
evening news today, which will be repeated twice on the same
night.
</P>
<P>
Failing to do so will result in the removal of three of the
first five candidates from the SDS list for the elections to the
National Assembly of Republika Srpska, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the OSCE Elections Appeals
Sub-Commission which found that the speeches by Plavsic and other
SDS officials at a Banja Luka rally Wednesday "clearly represent
an immediate threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
The OSCE considered such statements a serious violation of the
Dayton peace accords, the statement said.

PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- As many as 12 million Moroccan
voters cast their ballots today for a new constitution for the
kingdom which will create a new chamber of parliament through
direct elections on the basis of one-man one-vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution, the new chamber will consist of
representatives from cities, professional trades and wage-earners
whom King Hassan called "living forces who work and produce."
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) news agency said that no
surprise is expected from the result of the vote called by King
Hassan on August 20, which is expected to give 99 percent, if not
100 percent, approval to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Three of the four main parties in the country -- the Istiqlal,
the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and the Party of Progress
and Socialism - have urged their supporters to vote in favor of
the change.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Democratic and Popular Action said it is
still wavering between "yes" and abstention.
</P>
<P>
The participation rate is predicted to be very high, since in
the 1992 referendum on the constitution, 97.4 percent of Moroccans
went to polls despite opposition group calls for a boycott.

<HEADLINE> Japan's April-June Real GDP Shrinks 0.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economy shrank in the
three months to June after extremely strong growth in the previous
quarter, the government said today.
</P>
<P>
Real gross domestic product (GDP), a key gauge of the economy's
health, shrank 0.7 percent between April and June from the
previous quarter, when the economy grew at 2.9 percent, the
Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The figures show the Japanese economy is on track for a
"moderate recovery" after four years of negligible growth, the EPA
said.
</P>
<P>
"The figures for the January-June period are consistent with
the agency's assessment that the economy is staging a moderate
recovery," Vice EPA Minister Shimpei Nukaya said.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth forecast of 2.5 percent for the year to March
1997 was "fully attainable" with the economy expected to resume
expanding in the September quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the June quarter, domestic demand contributed 0.5 percentage
points of the 0.7 percent fall, with external demand pushing GDP
down by 0.2 percentage points, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
There have been demands for an additional budget to stimulate
the economy, but the EPA said after releasing the figures that no
such move was necessary.
</P>
<P>
The EPA will ask the Bank of Japan to maintain the present easy
credit policy, said Nukaya.

Masahide Ota said today he would take the legal steps necessary
to go ahead with expropriation of land, putting and end to his
year-long battle with the central government, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Ota announced his decision at a press conference in the
Okinawan capital Naha after the prefectural government gave the
final go-ahead to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The decision paved the way for the renewal of leases on plots
belonging to about 3,000 local landowners. These contracts for 11
U.S. military facilities on the island expired in May. The lease
for one plot ran out in March.
</P>
<P>
Ota's announcement, however, will not solve the problem
surrounding the transfer of U.S. troops and facilities on the
island after the planned closure the U.S. Marine Corp's Air
Station Futenma in five to seven years' time.
</P>
<P>
Municipal governments near Kadena Air Base on the island's west
coast, a prospective site for the Futenma transfer, have staunchly
opposed having to house more troops and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa's retreat on its refusal to cooperate with compulsory
land leasing three days after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
extended an olive branch to the island's people Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
He offered 5 billion yen (50 million U.S. dollars) in initial
funding and other measures to help develop the local economy in
return for Ota's pledge to cooperate in the military bases issue.
</P>
<P>
The people who took part in a prefectural referendum in Okinawa
on Sunday voted overwhelmingly in favor of downsizing
U.S. military bases in the prefecture. Just under 60 percent of
eligible voters took part in the poll.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hashimoto today praised Ota's decision to retract
his previous refusal and cooperate with the state on the U.S.
military use of local land.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also said he will go to Okinawa next Tuesday to seek
further reconciliation with the island's people.
</P>
<P>
Following Ota's announcement, the central government decided to
withdraw two lawsuits Hashimoto had filed against the governor
demanding that he act as a proxy in the forced land use.
</P>
<P>
The state will continue to strive for a reduction in the huge
U.S. military presence in Okinawa and boost the economy in the
prefecture, which has lagged behind the rest of the country partly
due to the American forces' occupation of land, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said.
</P>
<P>
Ota's original refusal to cooperate with the government came
amid a surge of anger among local residents over the
disproportionately large U.S. military presence fueled by the rape
of a 12-year-old schoolgirl on the island by three U.S. servicemen
last September.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, about 1,600 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, harbors
some 75 percent of all U.S. military facilities based in Japan,
although the prefecture occupies only 0.6 percent of the nation's
land area.

<HEADLINE> US Top Advisers Meet on Showdown With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's top national security advisers met at the White House
today to discuss the showdown with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
U.S. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States continued to beef up its firepower
in the Persian Gulf by adding a new contingent of F-16 fighter
planes, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has flown back to Washington from his Californian
campaigning and is in his residence, meeting with National
Security adviser Anthony Lake, whom were joined by Secretary of
State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
"They are getting down to specifics. They are trying to firm up
options for the president both militarily and diplomatically,"
said a senior U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, a Pentagon spokesman said 18 F-16Cs from
Moody Air Force Base in Georgia were being dispatched to Saudi
Arabia. They had been scheduled to relieve a group of F-16s from
Hill Air Force Base in Utah that had been on station there. But
the Utah aircraft are being kept in the region, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, campaigning in California Thursday, vowed to keep up
the pressure on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow anybody anywhere to believe they are not bound
by the rules of civilized behavior," he said. "We're going to do
whatever it takes to keep Saddam Hussein from threatening his
neighbors, threatening our pilots."
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said his country would
not bow to the United States saber-rattling and threats of use of
force.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we are much smaller than America which has a great power.
But what shall we do? Shall we surrender? Definitely not because
American greed knows no limit," he told a private Russian
television station in a interview in Baghdad Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Iraq fired missiles on U.S. aircraft patroling the skies of
both the northern and southern parts of Iraq in two consecutive
days beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States has dispatched four B-52 bombers to the
island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Eight F-117 stealth
radar-evading fighter-bombers are on their way to Kuwait and
expected to arrive there Friday. Aircraft carrier USS Enterprise
has been ordered to leave the Adriatic Sea for the Red Sea via the
Suez Canal. Now a new contingent of F-16Cs are expected to arrive
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
All this signals that a third confrontation between the United
States and Iraq is closer since last week's two U.S missile
strikes on Iraqi air defense sites.

<HEADLINE> No S.Africa-Iran Deal on Oil Storage: Rafsanjani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- No deal has been
finalized on Iran's renting an underground oil tank at Saldanha
Bay in Western Cape Province to store Iranian crude oil, visiting
Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said today.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who arrived in South Africa on Thursday, is paying
a two-day official visit to the country on the final leg of his
six-nation African tour, which has taken him to Kenya, Sudan,
Uganda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting President Nelson Mandela
at the union buildings in Pretoria, Rafsanjani said: "The oil
storage matter belongs to the past."
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Africa and Iran reportedly signed an
agreement allowing Iran to store 15 million barrels crude oil at
Saldanha Bay.
</P>
<P>
By securing storage facilities in South Africa, the National
Iranian Oil Company could consolidate its position as a leading
oil supplier to Europe and also move some of its crude previously
sold to the customers in the United States to South African
refiners.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is currently imposing economic sanctions against
Iran, accusing Iran of sponsoring international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Rafsanjani said the oil storage facilities at
Saldanha Bay were attractive for Iran in the event of its oil
trade routes being disrupted.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the matter would solely depend on South
Africa. "Should they find it to be in their interests or
those of the region, we will be available to sign an agreement to
work that out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani spoke highly of his talks with South African
President Nelson Mandela, describing the talks as having opened
new fields of potential cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran could, for example, benefit from South African mining
expertise, and its experience in processing coal and gas.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Mandela listed several bilateral
agreements being under discussion, including treaties on double
taxation and the mutual protection of investments.
</P>
<P>
"We hope some of these will be signed before the president
leaves," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani is scheduled to leave South Africa for home on Friday
evening.

<HEADLINE> PC Speaker Places High Hope on A.L. Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the legislative
Palestinian Council (PC) Ahmed Queria expressed hope that the
coming emergency session of the Arab League (AL) would yield
resolutions that could support the position of the "Palestinian
negotiator."
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the AL countries are scheduled to
meet here Saturday to discuss the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Sawt El-Arab (Voice of Arabs) radio today,
Queria pointed out that the current stage of the Arab-Israeli
peace process was experiencing what he called an acute turn.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries can offer much to the Palestinians, he said,
pointing out that the Arabs are of reliable support for the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The emergency session will discuss the developments of the
Middle East peace process in general and decide the necessary
measures to put the peace talks back on track, the PC speaker added.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of Arab coordination at the
current stage to face up to the Israeli moves that run counter to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli hardline government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu
since its formation last June has indefinitely delayed the
redeployment of its troops from Hebron, the last major city it still
occupies in the West Bank, embarked on the expansion of Jewish
settlement in the occupied Arab land, and strongly opposed the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The prevalent state of frustration in the Palestinian
self-ruled areas over the stalemate in the peace process has
cornered the Palestinian National Authority to seek more
regional and international backing.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Consider More Use of Solar Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Solar energy should be
considered seriously as a suitable alternative for Africa as most
third world governments cannot afford total electrification in
their countries, a European Commission official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Energy Technology Director of the European Commission Sampaio
Nunes said the European Union had fixed a policy aimed at
promoting the use of renewable sources of energy worldwide and
maximizing the impact of solar energy to the people.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 35 delegates attending a one-day workshop on global
education and training program for renewable energies 1996-2005,
Nunes said that in many countries people support the use of
renewables.
</P>
<P>
Danish Secretary General for the Forum for Energy and
Development, Rene Karottki said non-governmental organizations
should introduce training programs targeted at specific groups
which should include decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
"It is in regional cooperation that the launching of the
global solar education should be made to create a concrete
thing," Karottki said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important to include the local people for
development programs to succeed.

<HEADLINE> Britain Faces EU Court Action Over BSE Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
facing the threat of European Union (EU) court action over its
unilateral measures on the beef crisis that break the EU's single
market rules, according to a BBC television report today.
</P>
<P>
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fishchler is preparing
infringement proceedings over Britain's unilateral ban on imports
of cattle over 30 months from other EU member states, EU officials
were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
They argued that Britain's action has not been agreed with the
EU and it also breaks the EU single market regulations.
</P>
<P>
Under EU single market rules, EU member states are allowed to
adopt higher standards for their own products but forbidden to
impose national bans on other member states' products.
</P>
<P>
Other EU countries are also likely to face similar EU actions
over unilateral trade bans. France has reportedly announced an
import ban on products which did not remove suspect sheep and
cattle tissue.
</P>
<P>
Spain has banned import of meat and bonemeal feed from other EU
states and there is a ban on British diary products in Germany,
according to separate press reports.
</P>
<P>
EU Agriculture spokesman Geard Kiely was quoted as saying
earlier today in Brussels that if a political agreement proves
impossible, then the EU Commission will have no hesitation in
going to the European Court of Justice.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China beat South Korea 3-1 to
snatch the first victory at a World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix
preliminary leg here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China, silver medalist at the Atlanta Olympic Games this year,
won the first set comfortably 15-6 but had to stage a dramatic
comeback before winning the second set 16-14.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women rallied from 4-12 behind to level the score
at 14-all as Chinese coach Lang Ping replaced the setter with
teenager Zhu Yunying to set up quick attacks.
</P>
<P>
After losing the third set 11-15, China relentlessly took
advantage of the defensive mistakes of the opponents and never
looked back on way to the 15-5 win in the last set.
</P>
<P>
Ace spiker Sun Yue led the Chinese scorers with 12 points,
followed by Wu Yongmei at 10. The most South Korean points came
from Kim Nam-soon, who had 11.
</P>
<P>
Coach Lang Ping said, "We performed quite well today, with
service and blocking exceptionally good."
</P>
<P>
South Korean coach Kim Cheol-yong said the Chinese service gave
too much pressure on South Korea's defense, which contributed much
to their loss.
</P>
<P>
In the other match, Brazil overcame a first-set deficit to
defeat Russia 14-16, 15-10, 15-7 and 15-12 in a hard and
aggressive match.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian head coach Bernardo Rezende said, "Even though our
blocks were not ideal, we had good serves. I am happy with this
victory and feel that the team played well overall."
</P>
<P>
Rezende's Russian counterpart Nikolai Karpol said, "There are
new players in the team which need more international experience.
We had inadequate receptions and Brazil blocked too well."

<P>
DAMASCUS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
Al-Assad received a message from his U.S. counterpart Bill
Clinton, said a Syrian official here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Syria Christopher Ross handed the missage
to Al-Assad who, in turn, gave him a reply message to Clinton,
according to the source who declined to elaborate on the contents
of both messages.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here believe that the Clinton's message
dealt with the results of the recent talks between U.S.
officials and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly reached a verbal agreement in his
talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the
formula of resuming the peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"Any new formula constitutes a return to the zero point, which
is unacceptable," according to Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
El-Shara.
</P>
<P>
El-Shara said Thursday that Syria would never accept the idea
of resuming the talks "without reference," and accused Israel of
non-commitment to the U.N. Security Council resolutions, the
previous undertakings, the Madrid peace conference and the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Israel's hardline government has appealed for the resumption of
peace negotiations with Syria "without precondition."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A national debate on
land reform policies is going on in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
A national land conference is planned to be held in November
on land reform, according to reports reaching here from Windhoek,
capital of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Namibia inherited a colonial and apartheid land policy from
apartheid South Africa at independence in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The white minority rulers own nearly all the rich and arable
land, leaving the poor tracks of land to the majority blacks.
</P>
<P>
Since independence, the Namibian government has been seeking
ways to abolish the policy and introduce its own, in efforts to
end injustice.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A one-day round table
discussion on private partnerships for renewable energy
development was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy Minister Simon Moyo said
strategies should be worked out now as 75 percent of the world
population have no access to conventional energy supplies.
</P>
<P>
He said decision makers should understand there is massive
deforestation and environmental degradation worldwide, hence it
is needed to prepare for future generations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to conserve energy, particularly in
industry, cannot be overemphasized with the ever increasing
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
Gian Guido Fassino from Italy, representing energy experts and
industrialists said the world, which will have a total population
of over eight billion by 2020, is suffering from "energy famine".
</P>
<P>
According to the World Energy Council, world energy demand
will rise by between 33 and 102 percent by the year 2020, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If we wish to guarantee jobs and food and promote sustainable
development, reduce the pressure on the climate and halt the
flight from the land and the trend toward urbanization, we need
to define and promote a new energy policy," said Fassino.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was attended by more than 30 delegates
representing various organizations and countries that will be
participating in the world's first ever solar summit which begins
in Harare on September 16.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Faces Serious Threat of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Botswanan
government has expressed concern over rising infection of the
AIDS virus HIV in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Broadcasting Association today quoted a
statement issued by the Ministry of Health as saying that
Botswana is one of the worst AIDS-affected countries in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The statement said 180,000 people, about 12 percent of
Botswana's two million population, are reported to be suffering
from AIDS last year.
</P>
<P>
Some government hospitals are reported to be turning away AIDS
sufferers because they have no room for other patients.
</P>
<P>
President Ketumile Masire recently described the AIDS epidemic
as devastating.
</P>
<P>
He said the answer to the problem is not condoms, but to
change sexual attitudes and habits to save the nation from
perishing.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Botswanan leader said 40 percent of hospital
beds are occupied by AIDS patients in his country, and doctors
can no longer cope with the increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
The center for human rights in Gaborone said it has begun a
public education campaign, through workshops, against widespread
ignorance about the disease.

Mahachi said his ministry has reduced the army to 40,000 from

all the modern and sophisticated equipment with a small army than
to have a big army with old equipment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Serb Leader to Make Apology on TV for Nationalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic has agreed to apologize on TV for separation policies in
the election campaign, the Serb news agency SRNA said today.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leader would make a televised statement of regret for
secessionist rhetoric this evening on Serb TV, the news agency
quoted the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic's statement "will be repeated two times during the
evening of September 13 before 11 p.m. (2100 GMT)," said the OSCE
in a statement issued by its Elections Appeals Subcommission on
the eve of the first post-war elections to be held Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a delay in making the statement, or if the
presentation of the statement in any way seeks to change or disown
its content, three of the first five candidates will be removed
from the SDS party list for the elections to the National Assembly
fo the Serb republic, and their candidates for public office
terminated," the OSCE statement added.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaigns in the past two months, the Serb
leaders have publicly said they would strive for a separate state
and finally join the neighboring Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the last rally Thursday afternoon in Pale, Plavsic said
Saturday's vote was vital for the survival of the Serb state
Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
"The vote would be for democracy and for Republika Srpska that
we created and the Dayton accords confirmed," said Plavsic, who
runs for the presidency of the Serb republic in the general
elections.

BAGHDAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq would suspend firing at

parts of the country, vowing to resume the attempts if the
U.S.-led allies fail to reciprocate.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali remained committed to implementation of the
oil-for-food formula for Iraq, a senior U.N. official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Under-Secretary-General Chinmaya Ghrekhan said at a press
briefing here that Ambassador Alfredo Lopes Cabral, president of
the Security Council for this month, called the secretary-general
Thursday and conveyed the message of the council members who asked
the secretary-general to implement resolution 986 as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali assured the council president that he remained
committed to implementation of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was a misconception that the secretary-general
had suspended the implementation of the oil-for-food formula
though he decided to delay the deployment of U.N. inspectors in
Iraq early this month.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.N. Under-Secretary-General Joseph Conner and
Pierre Schneider, head of the New York office of the Banque
National de Paris, signed a contract Thursday, with which the bank
can apply for opening an escrow account to receive proceeds of
Iraqi oil sale.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. The six-year sanctions have
resulted in tremendous hardships of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
In order to alleviate the severe humanitarian situation, the
Security Council adopted resolution 986 in April 1995, allowing
Iraq to export oil worth 2 billion dollars in six months for
import of food, medicine and other civilian goods. The U.N.
Secretariat and Iraq reached an accord on implementing the
oil-for-food plan on May 20. The recent confrontation between Iraq
and U.S. may delay the implementation process.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Reiterates Adherence to Land-for-Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz reiterated here this afternoon his country's demand
for an Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands in return for
peace with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz left here this afternoon for Cairo to attend a
conference of Arab Foreign Ministers due to open on Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure from the Lebanese capital Beirut, the
foreign minister underlined Lebanon's insistence on the formula
adopted at the Madrid Mideast peace conference in October 1991.
</P>
<P>
Israel was represented at the peace conference by the then
Likud Party leader and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his close
aide Benjamin Netanyahu, the current prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We are upholding clear and definite principles, that are
the land-for-peace principle and the principle of the (Israeli)
withdrawal from the occupied Arab lands and the implementation
of international decisions," said the Lebanese foreign minister at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
Warning against any attempt to abandon the Madrid formula
and to change the contents of the peace process, he said,
"The attempt will push us backward and lead us to unknown
corridors."
</P>
<P>
On the 106th foreign ministers conference of the Arab League,
Boueiz described the session as a follow-up to the Arab
summit held in Cairo last June, which tried to coordinate Arab
stands toward changes in Israeli government and policies.
</P>
<P>
"The conference will be a continuation of this new Arab
path which is focused on clear Arab positions refusing a
deviation from the Madrid basis and rejecting the Israeli
proposals aimed at terminating the peace process by replacing
it with hollow topics of propaganda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has upheld coordination with Syria in its peace
negotiations with Israel, and refuses to sign any peace accord
with the Jewish state before Syria does.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu put forward a "Lebanon First" proposal soon after he
took office last June, which provided an Israeli troops' pullout
from south Lebanon if security arrangements work.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Lebanese Moslem
guerrillas constitute a daily scene on the Lebanese-Israeli
border, the last active battle front of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party
of God, frequently launch military operations against the Israeli
troops in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah militants are reportedly trained and financed by Iran,
and their activities are encouraged by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched a 17-day blitz against Lebanese guerrillas in
south Lebanon in April, killing some 200, mainly civilians.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: TUC, Labor Set Apart at Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Trade Unions Congress
(TUC) conference ended its five-day gathering in Blackpool,
England, today with mounting speculation that the Labor Party and
TUC are setting apart.
</P>
<P>
The conference under the slogan "New Unionism -- The Road to
Growth" was the last gathering of Britain's trade unions before
the general election next May.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address to delegates on the first day of the
conference, John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, spelt out
what New Unionism meant in a deregulated market where nearly 80
percent of private sector employees were no longer union members.
</P>
<P>
In a clear endorsement of new Labor, the general secretary
called on unions to work with companies as well as for their
members' interests. He said, "For l7 years trade unions have been
painted as part of Britain's problem. Our challenge is to be part
of the solution."
</P>
<P>
John Monks also urged union leaders to lift the movement out of
opposition and prove they could be part of Britain's recovery.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here noted that for the past two years,
union leaders as well as Labor leader Tony Blair, have been
signaling a drift away from the party. What Monks claimed was a
voice, not a veto, in policy making, they added.
</P>
<P>
Blair told this week's conference that a Labor government had
to maintain relationship with the TUC, but it would be based on
"fairness not favors."
</P>
<P>
The annual conference was overshadowed by a series of rows over
Labor's proposals to limit strikes by a system of binding
arbitration and wage restrictions.
</P>
<P>
There was anger among the unions leaders during the conference
at the prospect of a further round of laws that would compel
unions to hold a fresh ballot whenever an employer put forward a
"significant" new offer in a dispute.
</P>
<P>
Lew Adams, general secretary of the Train Drivers' Union,
ASLEF, said he was "dumbfounded and dismayed" that Blair should be
engaged in "bashing" the unions. Ken Cameron, leader of the
firemen, accused Labor of constantly "slagging off the unions to
the media."
</P>
<P>
In order to refrain from deteriorating their relations with the
unions, Tony Blair toned down proposals for radical curbs on
public sector strikes, and said he would not impose arbitration or
re-balloting in disputes.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Blair's statement, Monks said, "Blair's confused
statements on the serious issues of avoiding and resolving
disputes takes us backwards, not forwards."
</P>
<P>
BBC described Monks' remarks as an "unprecedented" statement
for a TUC head previously loyal to the Labor leader.
</P>
<P>
TUC officials said Monks had been aggrieved that his attempts
to build bridges during his keynote speech to the conference had
been undermined.
</P>
<P>
David Blunkett, shadow employment secretary, said in a
newspaper article that a Labor government would not tolerate
"armchair revolutionaries whose only interest is disruption."
</P>
<P>
The dispute on a national minimum wage rate also showed that
the relations between Labor and the unions had reached a new low.
The TUC defied Blair in voting for a national minimum wage of 4.26
pounds (6.4 U.S. dollars) an hour, when he had asked it not to set
a specific rate.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the vote, Blair made it clear that he would
disregard the call for a 4.26 pound rate and seek to distance
Labor from the TUC, saying they were separate bodies with separate
constitutions and if they disagreed, "so be it."
</P>
<P>
"The trade unions have put their case. It is their right to do
so. But in the end, a Labor government will decide in the
interests of the whole country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the relationship between Labor and the TUC at the
moment, the British paper the Daily Telegraph said, "Tony Blair is
letting it be known that he wishes to sever Labor's links with the
trade unions."
</P>
<P>
"As yet he has no blueprint for bringing this strategy to
fruition. Nevertheless, it appears to be neither an empty threat
nor a ruse to restore pre-election discipline, but an intention,"
the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Eight US Stealth Planes land in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Eight U.S. F-117A stealth
fighter-bombers landed in Kuwait today amid reports of escalations
of the tension in the Gulf region, local news reports quoted
military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the radar-evading aircraft arrived at the
Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed Airbase in the southwestern part of Kuwait
this afternoon after a 20-hour non-stop flight from their base in
New Mexico in the United States.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. and other military officials were unable to confirm
the reported landing of the U.S. planes.
</P>
<P>
The eight stealth fighter-bombers were deployed Thursday by the
Pentagon in response to Iraq's firing of missiles at U.S. F-16
fighters patroling the no-fly zone in northern Iraq Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, U.S. President Bill Clinton's top security and
foreign affairs advisers met at the White House to discuss the
showdown with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
No information was available now about the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for More Houses for Common People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian minister urged
here today African governments to build more houses for common
people.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Tanzanian Local Government Minister Mussa Nkhangaa
said it is very important for the African governments to build
more houses to enable the common people to have their own
shelter.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is impressed with Zambia's policy to encourage
sale of government and council houses to sitting tenants.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian minister will meet Zambian Local Government and
Housing Minister Bennie Mwiinga to discuss local government
activities to learn Zambia's urban management experience.
</P>
<P>
With a new housing policy being implemented in Zambia,
provision of houses for employees by employers is no longer a
must, instead government and council houses are being sold to the
sitting tenants so that they can have their own houses.
</P>
<P>
In the past when people were employed, they enjoyed housing,
but once retired, they had to move out of the houses provided
by their employers.

<HEADLINE> (UPdated) Iraq Suspends Its Military Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq decided today to suspend
its military reaction to the U.S. aggression on the no-fly zone as
from 2400 (2000 GMT)) today.
</P>
<P>
The joint session of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council
and the leadership of the Arab Socialist Baathist Party, under
President Saddam Hussein, made the decision in response to a
Russian initiative, according to an Iraqi spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The suspension of the military reaction is meant to give our
friends in Russian and other countries an opportunity to evaluate
things properly in line with international law," the Iraqi News
Agency quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of preserving the Iraqi
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"If the Americans continued their aggression after that
deadline and attacked the Iraqi troops, Iraq will retaliate
proportionately," the spokesman warned.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will not let go any manipulation of its security by the
U.S. administration to achieve electoral gains in the coming
presidential elections in the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the current confrontation in the Gulf region was
imposed by certain conditions, rather than by Iraq only, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq decision to suspend its military reactions follows,
according to political observers here, the U.S. threats to launch
new blows against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Decides to Halt Military Action in No-Fly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said here today that it
will stop military actions in the no-fly zones in the south and
north of the country as of midnight local time in response to
calls made by Russia and "other friends."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Iraq's supreme authority, the Revolution Command
Council, said that the Iraqi move has been decided in order to
provide Russia with an opportunity to help calm down the events
in the region and maintain the Iraqi rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman warned that if the United States
continues to attack Iraq after the set time Baghdad will respond.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq does not want to make trouble during the
current U.S. presidential election campaign, adding it is the
U.S. who has triggered the military confrontation between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Military confrontation between Iraq and the U.S. has
intensified following two salvos of the U.S. missile attacks early
this month and the U.S. attempts to enforce the expanded no-fly
zone in the south.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has announced that Iraq no
longer recognizes the no-fly zones and ordered to shoot down any
airplanes breaching its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has fired several times at U.S. aircraft flying over two
no-fly zones in the country, but missed the targets. However,
Washington has confirmed only three missile attacks so far.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is moving its sophisticated warships and bombers
closer to the Gulf region for further strikes at Iraqi military
targets which pose a threat to the U.S. patroling airplanes.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- No country has the
right to play policeman in Iraq, South African President Nelson
Mandela said today in reaction to a question about the United
States' recent missile attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting visiting Iranian President
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in Pretoria, Mandela said it is
disturbing that any country should allocate itself the role of
world police.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said he did not condone Iraq's offensive against
rebel Kurdish groups.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any problem they have with any country, I would
expect them to respect the United Nations Charter and to seek to
resolve those problems by peaceful means," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United States launched missile attacks
on military targets in Iraq in retaliation of what US President
Bill Clinton described as acts of brutality against Kurdish
rebels in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rafsanjani, for his part, accused the US of wanting
to preserve what he called its illegitimate presence in the
Persian Gulf and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani arrived in South Africa on Thursday for a two-day
official visit to the country on the final leg of his six-nation
African tour, which has taken him to Kenya, Sudan, Uganda,
Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani is scheduled to leave South Africa for Iran on Friday
evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers paid 1.4
percent more in August than the same month of last year,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Since August 1995, consumers have faced a 1.4 percent increase
in the price of the goods and services," the federal
fact-gathering agency said.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate for July was 1.2 percent, an 18-month
low in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The August price increase came mainly from new cars and trucks,
gasoline, telephone services, travel services and meat other than
beef, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Canadian consumers benefited from declines in
mortgage interest rates, new house prices and beef prices, it

ADDIS ABABA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Social

<HEADLINE> Ireland Issues Possible Last Punt Banknote before EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Ireland
launched a new 100 punt (pound) banknote in Dublin earlier today
and it is possibly the last Irish banknote to be issued if the
European Economic and Monetary Union is established on time,
according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony of launching the new banknote, Irish
Central Bank governor Maurice O'Connell said: "If the European
integration moves ahead according to plan, this will be the last
Irish banknote to be issued."
</P>
<P>
"The timetable for Economic and Monetary Union provides that
the Euro banknotes will be in circulation by the beginning of the
year 2002," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Governor stressed that his country was making various
preparations for the changeover on the assumption that Ireland
would participate in the European single currency named Euro.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth banknote in a series which has seen the
security features of Irish banknotes greatly upgraded and the size
of the notes reduced for greater convenience.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Reducing Conflicts in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today urged reducing conflicts in Africa
through diplomacy, disarmament, regional cooperation and
peace-building.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Congressional Black Caucus Forum on conflict
resolution in Africa in Washington D.C., Boutros-Ghali called
upon the international community to engage actively in the
resolution of African conflicts before they escalate and exact a
terrible toll on human life.
</P>
<P>
"The security of African states, and of Africa as a whole, needs
to be understood as significant for world peace and security.
Policy makers in government, those in the private sector, and in
the international news media, need to be challenged to address
conflicts in Africa, and seek their solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that diplomacy was an option though it could not work
miracles. In this aspect, the United Nations, an impartial body
with a global mandate and without the need to publicize its role,
could achieve a great deal, such as its success in South Africa,
Sierra Leone, and resolution of territorial disputes between Libya
and Chad and between Nigeria and Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament was an essential confidence-building measure, both
among states and within them. With signing in April of the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, it was urgently necessary now to
stem the uncontrolled flow of small conventional arms and
landmines, he said.
</P>
<P>
On regional cooperation, he stressed that the Organization of
African Unity must play an ever more active role in resolution of
African conflicts.
</P>
<P>
As for peace-building, Boutros-Ghali said that democracy, and
respect for the rule of law helped guard against division, conflict
and war while development was crucial.
</P>
<P>
"Without it, the competition for scarce resources will condemn
Africa to continual conflict. The unbearable burden of debt must
be lifted from African shoulders. And development assistance
levels must rise so that Africans can be enabled to participate in
the new global economy," he said.

<TEXT>

inflation and retail sales data, and finished the week 15 points
higher on the CAC-40 share index after reversing early losses, a
rise of 75.62 on the week.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Guinean Trade Union Heads Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China's trade union leader
today said he hopes that trade unions in China and the African
state of Guinea will continue to support each other in the
international workers' movement.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, president of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, was speaking in Beijing during a meeting with a delegation
of Guinea's National Confederation of Laborers, headed by its
general secretary Mohamed Samba Kebe.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wei, also a member of the political bureau
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said that
despite the distance between the two countries, the peoples of
China and Guinea have forged a deep friendship in their long
struggles against imperialism and colonialism.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that there exists good cooperative relations
between the trade unions of the two countries, and he hopes the
two union bodies will continue their mutual understanding and
support in the international workers' movement.
</P>
<P>
Wei also briefed the guests on the present political and
economic situation in China, as well as the major tasks facing
China's trade unions. The president stressed that even in the new
circumstances of building the socialist market economy, the
essential political principle of relying on workers
whole-heartedly should still be upheld firmly and unshakeably.
</P>
<P>
Kebe spoke highly of the achievements China has made in its
reform and opening up, as well as the work the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions has performed in the new situation,
noting in particular the federation's efforts in safeguarding the
legal rights and interests of workers in overseas-invested
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary said the Guinean confederation will step
up its friendly ties with China's trade unions, and enhance its
cooperation with their Chinese colleagues in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Guinean delegation arrived in Beijing on September 6 for a
9-day visit to the country, as guest of the All-China federation.

</P>
<P>
The Russian-born Australian knocked Bergman down with a left

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Defends Presence of Western Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait reaffirmed that the
presence of the Western coalition forces is "legal and
legitimate" and that Kuwait is entitled to take all the measures
and precautions necessary to ensure its security, sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued by the Information Center of
the Kuwaiti Embassy in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Kuwait is not to blame for the crisis
currently experienced by Iraq, holding Iraq responsible for its
current confrontation with the Western coalition.
</P>
<P>
The statement denounced Iraq's failure to implement the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, pointing out that
this gives rise to the current crises.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has not abandoned its fancies and its evil ambitions to
Kuwait. Kuwait's security comes under constant threats, and so
its has concluded a number of defense cooperation agreements
with friendly countries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
denied Friday that he had directed any threats to Kuwait and that
the threat which Iraq is coming under comes from Kuwait which has
allowed the American Stealth aircraft to be stationed on its
territory in order to launch attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is reported to boost its military presence in the
Gulf region, preparatory to entering into a confrontation with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, The United States was moving
sophisticated weaponry to the Gulf, including the F-117A, a
stealth attack bomber that will be based in Kuwait. Four planes
landed Friday evening in Kuwait and four more were expected later.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz has described Kuwait's move to
allow some U.S. jets to be based on its territory as a "flagrant
act of aggression against the people of Iraq and an act of war
against the Iraqi state."

<HEADLINE> IFOR Troops Dispatched To Control Impatient Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led Implementation
Force (IFOR) on Saturday dispatched troops to control crowds of
voters impatient with the slow process at some polling stations in
Sarajevo, IFOR spokesman Brett Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
Eight polling stations in Novi Grad district of Sarajevo were
temporarily closed after the crowds waiting outside became
impatient and violent, breaking one window of the polling station
buildings, but the stations were reopened a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
The slow processing was caused by confusion of names in the
voters' list, which has become the major problem for the election
officials.
</P>
<P>
Except for a few minor incidents, the first elections since the
end of the 43-month old war in Bosnia seem to proceed normally.
</P>
<P>
According to UN and IFOR, there were attempts to set up
checkpoints or block the return of refugees to their former home
villages or town to vote, but these problems were later solved
with IFOR and UN police intervention.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that near Stolac, on the Federation side,
three refugees buses were stoned, without causing injuries.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for UN international police, said
that there was one shooting incident in suburbs of Sarajevo and
the Bosnian Federation is investigating it.
</P>
<P>
About 4,400 polling stations in Bosnia opened at 7 a.m.(local
time) to estimated 2.6 million eligible voters, and will close at
7 p.m.(local time). But in Sarajevo, voting hours in some reopened
stations could be extended to 10 p.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
According to the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), which organizes the elections, 2.9 million
Bosnians, including 850,000 refugees living abroad, can vote and
the turnout for the absentee voting for refugees earlier this
month is 80 percent
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 IFOR soliders and UN police were scattered around
Bosnia to prevent any incident of violent clashes between hundreds
of thousands of refugees returning to home towns or villages and
ethnic groups which now control these areas.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen roads have been designated as special routes for
refugees returning home, which will be heavily protected by IFOR,
while OSCE has also sep up polling stations along the former front
lines for refugees if their return is blocked.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Boudreau said that by noon time, about 200 buses
of refugees have crossed the boundary lines without incidents.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement signed by Bosnia's three
ethnic factions, Bosnians will elect a three-member presidency, a
national assembly, as well as governing institutions in the two
entities -- the Bosnian Federation and the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
There are 29 political parties and coalitions competing in the
election and the initial results will not be available until
September 17, the OSCE said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Plans to Wipe Out Garbage Cans in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of south
China's Guangdong Province has launched a "garbage revolution" to
rid rubbish from its streets within three years.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 community waste bins are scattered around
Guangzhou, designed to deal with over 4,000 tons of domestic
garbage that the city produces every day, and there are more than
1,500 waste storage stations.
</P>
<P>
Refuse workers load the garbage onto trucks at the storage
stations every day, before taking it to dumping grounds.
</P>
<P>
The mountain of garbage caused constant complaints from
residents because of the traffic congestion and environmental
problems it caused.
</P>
<P>
Under the "garbage revolution" plan, the streetside waste bins
will be replaced by garbage treatment centers, where the rubbish
will be compressed before it is sent to the rubbish tips.
</P>
<P>
Eighty such treatment centers will be enough to replace the
existing 30,000 waste bins. At present, six such treatment centers
have already been put to use. Residents living around the centers
put plastic rubbish bags outside their homes every day, and these
will be collected by refuse workers, who will take them to the
treatment centers.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, 19 garbage treatment centers will be built in
Guangzhou this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city is researching the replacement of
traditional dumping grounds with power plants fueled by burning
refuse. Schedules for three such power plants are already under
way, and the construction of the first garbage power plant is
expected to start by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Increased HK Exports to South America Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Significant new trade and
business opportunities are expected for Hong Kong manufacturers
and exporters with the signing of a wider Southern American market
trade agreement, according to a research by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
The new accord between the South Common Market -- or "Mercosur"
 -- and Chile, effective from October 1 this year, creates a
potential market of 218 million consumers, covering around
two-thirds of the area of South America and with access to both
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, according to a TDC research
report released today.
</P>
<P>
The original free-trade agreement between Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay is to stimulate trade and investment
opportunities within the region as well as international trade.
</P>
<P>
Trade among the agreement's four original member countries has
been growing at an average annual pace of 20 percent since
1991. And Mercosur's total exports to the rest of the world rose
by 8.2 percent per year between 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The new deal has paved the way for swift inclusion of other
South American countries. The on-going negotiations with Bolivia
are likely to be concluded next year and Colombia, Peru and
Venezuela are expected to follow, according to the TDC report.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has already seen rapid growth of its total export to
the region. Hong Kong's total export to the original four
Mercosur members increased more than six-fold from 284 million
U.S. dollars in 1990 to two billion U.S. dollars in 1995, rising
at an annual rate of 49 percent.

<HEADLINE> Finn Makinen Grabs Rally Australia Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PERTH, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Finn Tommi Makinen, runaway
leader of the World Championship, forged into a comfortable lead
on the first day of Rally Australia, the seventh round of the
series, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubishi driver swept past early leader Carlos Sainz
of Spain to build up an advantage of more than half a minute.
</P>
<P>
"I can go faster if I want, but it is a difficult rally and
still there are a lot of long stages," said Makinen.
</P>
<P>
Ford driver Sainz came under mounting pressure from Swede
Kenneth Eriksson and Britain's Colin McRae as the Subaru team
made amends for a bad start.
</P>
<P>
Eriksson said an electronic problem that affected his car's
four-wheel drive system slowed him on one stage, but he ended
the just three seconds behind Sainz, who lost ground with a
misfire.
</P>
<P>
World Champion McRae, desperate to finish after three
accidents in his last four rallies, was not happy with his choice
of tyres in the morning.
</P>
<P>
However, fastest times on two of the afternoon stages hinted
that he could make a bigger impact during the rest of the rally.
</P>
<P>
Briton Richard Burns, driving the second Mitsubishi, was in
fifth place after pulling clear of Belgian Bruno Thiry when the
Ford driver ran into trouble with his handbrake which made the
car difficult to drive on hairpins.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Piero Liatti received a nasty shock on his first
visit to Australia, crashing into a kangaroo that jumped out in
front of him when he was driving his Subaru with a jammed
accelerator. The 1,560-kilometre rally finishes on Monday.

<HEADLINE> China Outspikes Russia 3-2 at World Women's GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalist China
edged Russia 3-2 on Saturday to keep unbeaten in a World Women's
Grand Prix preliminary leg match here.
</P>
<P>
China raced to a 2-0 lead after winning the first two sets 15-2
 and 15-8 on powerful attacks from ace spikers Sun Yue and Wu
Yongmei.
</P>
<P>
But the Russians waked up to dominate the net in the third and
fourth sets, with Elena Godina unleashing high-point smashes and
key blocker Natalia Morozova stopping many Chinese spikes.
</P>
<P>
In the both sets, Russia staved off a late Chinese comeback
that drew the score as close as 13-14 to win 13-15.
</P>
<P>
In the explosive deciding set which saw the two teams exchanged
spectacular spikes, China gradually earned an upper hand before
starter Wang Ziling delivered a quick and sharp smash to seal the
game 15-11.
</P>
<P>
Spiker Li Yan scored three of her 16 points while Sun Yue had
four of her 14 in the last set to inspire China to the victory,
which came after their 3-1 loss to the same opponent in a grand
prix leg in Sendai, Japan, two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Lang Ping said, "We played superbly in the
first two sets when the blocking and services were so effective.
Russia was in their top form in the following three sets."
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Nikolai Karpol attributed their loss to poor
preparation and weak psychology of the players.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the match, over 4,000 spectators at Macao Forum
offered tremendous vocal supports to the Chinese women, especially
in the critical fifth set.
</P>
<P>
In the other match, Brazil scored a comfortable 15-2, 15-12,
15-5 win over South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ana Moser scored nine points to lead the Brazilians, followed
by Virna Dias at seven and Ana Sanglard at five.
</P>
<P>
On the last day of the Macao leg Sunday, China meets Brazil and
South Korea faces Russia.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Diplomat Says US Might Attack Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi diplomat today
rejected Iran's condemnation over its military operation in
northern Iraq and hinted that Americans might attack Iran.
</P>
<P>
Salah Noori Samarmad, Charge D'affaires of Iraqi Embassy in
Tehran, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua here today
that the Iraqi government is not satisfied with the Iranian
stance.
</P>
<P>
"Iranians are against the American aggression and at the same
time they blame the Iraqi government for movements in northern
Iraq and they said it is a collusion between Washington and
Tehran," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian leaders, including President Hashemi Rafsanjani and
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, have criticized Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein for his "blunder" giving a good pretext
to the U.S. to once more exhibit its hegemonic and arrogant
attitude.
</P>
<P>
The senior Iraqi diplomat said "Iran is not in the right way
when it blames both sides. We refuse it. We don't like it. We need
the Iranian government to be more bright."
</P>
<P>
"I think it is not in their interest. And in the end the
American aggression will not be just against Iraq. Another
aggression may be directed against Iran, or any other country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi people and Iraqi government are struggling to face
this aggression. We are moving in many ways, including politically
and militarily, to resist American aggression," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi diplomat also defended his government stands toward
the northern Iraq, saying that the Iraqi forces went to the city
of Erbil after Saddam Hussein received a letter seeking Iraqi help
from Masoud Barezani, leader of Kurdistan Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
As to the refugee issue, he said, "most of refugees have
returned. There are a few thousands in the borders on the Iraqi
side, and most of them returned back to the city and their homes."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the buffer zone announced by the Turkish
government, he said, the Iraqi government has negotiated with
Turkey. "The Turkish government has stopped this and they made an
announcement."
</P>
<P>
He said that an Iraqi delegation returned Tuesday and they
announced an agreement between Iraqi and Turkish governments
because all governments around the world rejected the buffer
zone.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Security Team to Haiti to Protect President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has sent
a crack team of special security agents to Haiti to help protect
President Rene Preval amid rising political violence, senior U.S.
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team was dispatched after the newly-formed and
inexperienced Haitian police force proved incapable of controlling
rising violence believed to be linked to discharged former members
of the Haitian armed forces, said a U.S. official who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
Preval, who took office in February, became convinced by August
that the presidential security force he inherited from his
predecessor Jean-Bertrand Aristide was tainted and some members
would have to be removed.
</P>
<P>
Preval asked for U.S. help to protect him while new agents to
replace those expelled from the guard force are trained and those
kept on are retrained, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. assignment was described as a "top-secret mission" by
American news reports. The force, reportedly consisting of about
40 people, left for Haiti late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The team will join 15 U.S. agents already in Port-au-Prince in
screening Haiti's presidential guard members to decide which ones
are "clean" enough to keep.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks to Use King Hussein Bridge as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel has requested Jordan to
allow Israelis to enter the kingdom through the King Hussein
Bridge, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
An informed source, quoted by today's edition of the
English-language daily Jordan Times, said that the government is
studying the issue, given that the bridge connects Jordan and the
Palestinian territories rather than the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan allows the King Hussein Bridge to be used by
palestinians, foreign tourists, diplomats and U.N officials,
while Israeli tourists and all others have to use the Sheikh
Hussein Bridge in the north or the Wadi Araba crossing in the
south.
</P>
<P>
Foreign residents of Jordan could use the bridge to enter the
West Bank with prior permission obtained from the Ministry of
Interior.
</P>
<P>
The request was presented to Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti by Israeli Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav during a
meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
There was no clear indication of how Jordan would treat the
request.
</P>
<P>
However, sources here noted that it was unlikely that Jordan
would accept the Israeli request since it would raise Palestinian
objections based on the argument that the West Bank is
Palestinian territory and that the King Hussein Bridge should not
serve as a conduit between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that the Palestinians are also demanding
that the access to the bridge should be under their Jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The status of the West Bank, which is to be discussed in the
final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, is
also a hurdle in Jordan's request to modernize the bridge, access
roads and terminal facilities.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua Correspondent Li Huailin) --
China Building at the Central on Hong Kong Island has become a
focus for all sectors today.
</P>
<P>
From early morning, nearly a hundred of reporters and
photographers gathered on the 15th floor of the building which
houses the Office of Secretariat of Preparation Committee (PC) of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to greet the
last batch of applicants for the membership of the Selection
Committee for the first government of HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
It was raining hard at about 12:30 p.m., half hour before the
deadline for accepting the application forms, a dozen applicants
appeared at the office in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
Guinea Leung, one of the late comers, smiled while she was
handing in her form, saying, "thank God, I did not miss the
opportunity today."
</P>
<P>
Leung, general manager of Country Club Publishing Co. Ltd.,
told an officer of the PC Secretariat that to catch up the
opportunity, she rushed back to Hong Kong from the United States
last night.
</P>
<P>
She said that she does not mind whether she will be a member of
the Selection Committee or not, what she has desired is to
contribute to the formation of the committee for the sake of Hong
Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Lai King-tim, chairman of the Hong Kong Residents
Federation, Kwun Tong district, hurried to the office with five
forms filled by the people of his association.
</P>
<P>
Lai was the first person to hand in his filled form to the
office in the early morning on August 16 and he dramatically
re-appeared at the office in the last-minute rush.
</P>
<P>
He said that the six people, including himself, have been
recommended by his association to fill the forms.
</P>
<P>
He said the active participation of the residents in the
formation of the Selection Committee reflects their will to play a
role in running Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
When time struck 1:00 p.m., the deadline hour, the office was
still full of the people with their forms. As the serial number
of 5,833 was typed on the last form, it was 1:30 p.m..
</P>
<P>
Fei Fih, deputy director of the Office, said that since August
15 when the Application Form for Candidate for Membership of the

<HEADLINE> IFOR Troops Sent in to Control Impatient Voters in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) today sent in troops to control crowds
of voters impatient with the slowness of processing at some
polling stations in Sarajevo, IFOR spokesman Brett Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
Eight polling stations in the Novi Grad district of Sarajevo
were temporarily closed after crowds waiting outside became
impatient and violent, breaking windows of the polling station
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The slow processing was caused by confusion over names in the
voters' list, said Jeff Fisher, spokesman for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe which is organizing the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The stations were due to reopen later and opening hours would
be extended to make up for the lost time.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this latest incident in Sarajevo, Bosnia's first
nationwide elections since the end of the country's 43-month
ethnic war seemed to be proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
NATO peacekeepers had been put on full alert for possible
violence between the different ethnic groups as they traveled to
polling stations to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring Yugoslavia
and Croatia were expected to come back for the polling and IFOR
was braced for possible clashes between refugees returning to
their homes and ethnic groups which now control these areas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, IFOR ground troops commander Lt. General
Michael Walker said that about 25,000 IFOR soldiers and
international policemen would be assigned for the security of
elections.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen roads have been designated as special routes for
refugees returning home, which will be heavily protected by IFOR,
while the OSCE has also set up polling stations along the former
front lines for refugees if their return is blocked.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations and IFOR, there were initial
reports of blockages along certain roads resulting from logistical
problems, but these were later cleared up.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the U.N. international police,
said that there was one shooting incident near Sarajevo and the
Bosnian Federation is investigating.
</P>
<P>
Brett Boudreau said the stopping of refugees by Serb police in
Brcko was due to some refugees going by private car to vote
instead by bus as previously agreed.
</P>
<P>
About 4,400 polling stations in Bosnia opened at 7 a.m. (local
time) and will close at 7 p.m..
</P>
<P>
Some 2.9 million Bosnians are entitled to vote and more than
300,000 who are refugees did so in absentee ballots between August
28 and September 3.
</P>
<P>
Fisher said that turnout for some 3,000 military voters who
cast their ballots one day earlier, was 60 percent. The remaining
97,000 military personnel in Bosnia are expected to vote on
Saturday in civilian clothes.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord signed by Bosnia's three ethnic
factions, Bosnians will elect a three-member presidency, one from
each ethnic group, a national assembly, as well as governing
institutions in Bosnia's two entities -- the Muslim-Croat
Federation and Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
There are 29 political parties and coalitions competing in the
elections and the initial results will not be available until
September 17.
</P>
<P>
The western media has been critical of the conditions for the
Bosnian elections, fearing the poll would legitimize the
nationalist parties calling for the partitioning of the country,
thus further destabilizing its shaky peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government has been pushing for the elections,
arguing that setting up common institutions is the necessary first
step towards national reconciliation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, even U.S. officials admit privately that the
efficiency of the common institutions will hinge on which parties
and candidates win the elections.

<HEADLINE> China, US to Jointly Tap Yunnan Iron Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Kunming Iron and Steel
Corporation has linked with a US-based steel giant to tap a large
iron mine in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang, and John J. Connelly, vice
president of U.S. Steel Group, attended an agreement-signing
ceremony in Kunming today, on behalf of the two sides in a joint
project at the Dahongshan iron mine.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to provide two million tons a year of
iron ore, with an average grade of 60 percent, to Kunming Iron and
Steel Corporation, one of China's key steel manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Steel Group will invest 30 million US dollars into the
first phase of the project. The Chinese and American sides are to
make joint investments once the prospective reserves are assured,
according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The total investment will reach 200 million US dollars, experts
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Dahongshan iron mine, 210 kilometers from the steel works,
has proven reserves of at least 450 million tons of iron ore.
</P>
<P>
New supplies of iron ore will help the steel corporation to
raise its annual steel output from the current 1.5 million tons to
2.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
He Zhiqiang and John J. Connelly both expressed the strong wish
for further co-operation in exploitation of rich mineral resources
in Yunnan.

<P>
SHENYANG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- An MD-90 aircraft arrived at
Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, this
afternoon to start demonstration flights in China.
</P>
<P>
One of 11 MD-90s ordered by China Northern Airlines, it will be
delivered to the airline later this month.
</P>
<P>
"It is the newest mid-size, medium-range twin jet available
today," said Donald Black, vice-president-general manager of sales
and marketing for the Douglas Aircraft division of McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
The MD-90 is powered by two International Aero Engines' V2500
tubofans, which combined with the aircraft design, help make the
MD-90 the quietest commercial aircraft in the skies.
</P>
<P>
The MD-90, which left Long Beach, California on August 28, has
had demonstration flights in Britain, Finland, Turkey, India and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
It will give demonstration flights in Taiyuan, capital of north
China's Shanxi Province; Urumqi, capital of northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; and Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The MD-90's maiden flight took place in February 1993. Since

<HEADLINE> Capobianco Condemns IAAF Delay on Drug Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian sprinter Dean
Capobianco has criticised the International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF) for the delay in setting a date for his
arbitration panel hearing.
</P>
<P>
"It is dragging on and the IAAF do not seem to have
considered it very important from the start but I still have to
clear my name in the eyes of the Australian public," said
Capobianco in a telephone interview from his training base in
Bedford, England.
</P>
<P>
Traces of the steroid stanozolal were found when Capobianco
was tested at a meeting in Hengelo, Holland, in May. He
subsequently competed in Atlanta after his national federation,
Athletics Australia, found the collection procedures in Hengelo
were seriously flawed and cleared him.
</P>
<P>
The Athletics Australia management board meets in Melbourne
on Sunday discuss the athlete's demand that the Australian
federation pays his legal costs, estimated by his manager John
Bicourt to stand at $70,000.
</P>
<P>
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reinari admitted there had been
problems assembling an arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that the arbitration panel will meet before
October. We might be able to announce when it will be at the
Calendar Congress in Dublin (which starts October 9)," he said.

<P>
ATHENS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Olympic Airways, Greece's
state-owned airline, made a profit for the first time in 18 years
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, profits for 1996 are likely to fall nearly a quarter
to 33 million U.S. dollars as increasing competition and fewer
passengers take their toll.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Airways' 43 million-dollar profit last year came as the
company underwent a massive re-structuring program agreed with the
European Union. As part of the deal, most of the company's debts
have been written off and staff have been made redundant.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 1,201 people, or 11.6 percent of Olympic's 10,360
employees left the company. A further 461 employees will be made

<HEADLINE> China Has More Ethnic Minority Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of China's ethnic
minority officials has exceeded 2.48 million, accounting for 6.48
percent of the total of the country's officials.
</P>
<P>
This was released at an on-going meeting on selecting ethnic
group officials, sponsored by the State Nationalities Affairs
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, China held its first national meeting on selecting
ethnic minority officials. During the meeting, an eight-year plan
was drawn up to promote the task.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of governments in the country's 156 localities of
regional autonomy of minority nationalities are from ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that by the end of last year, the total
number of ethnic group officials above the level of section chief
was 33,000, accounting for 7.47 percent of the total number, and
4,000 more than the figure before 1993.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic minority officials have accounted for 11.96 percent of
all the officials at ministerial level, 8.07 percent at
prefectural level and 7.39 percent at county level.
</P>
<P>
Of all the minority officials, more than 40 percent are below
the age of 40, and over 75 percent who have diplomas above the
senior middle schools level.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds, or over 1.64 million minority officials, have
professional technical titles.

<HEADLINE> Price Waterhouse to Increase Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Price Waterhouse, the leading
international accounting company headquartered in London and New
York, plans to spend 100 million US dollars on the training of
Chinese accountants over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Dominic Tarantino, world chairman of Price Waterhouse,
addressed the company's world board meeting, which was held in
Beijing on September 13. He said that Price Waterhouse will hold
to its stated objective of being the leading professional services
firm in China, as the Chinese market is advancing on a soaring
growth rate for years.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, Price Waterhouse signed an advisory
agreement with the Bank of China yesterday. Under this agreement,
Price Waterhouse will act as financial adviser to the bank in a
wide range of areas, including strategic planning, credit risk,
market risk, and liquidity risk management, information
technology, internal audit, and international taxation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such agreement that the bank has entered into
with an overseas consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
The firm will also expand its professional and consulting
services to major foreign companies in China, aiming at helping
them solve financial and commercial problems on the emerging
China market.
</P>
<P>
Entering China as early as 1979, Price Waterhouse employs more
than 600 people in China, and has launched two cooperative
accountancy agencies in Shanghai and Beijing, as well as four
representative offices in Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai and
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
"We have built our successful worldwide network by establishing
strong national practice owned, managed and led by highly
qualified individuals, who are citizens of the respective
countries," said Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
"Our intentions in China are to replicate that model, and Price
Waterhouse in China is committed to further growth -- to have a
strong professional services firm with more than 2,000 people by
the year 2000," he said.

<HEADLINE> Little Violence Seen in Bosnian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's first national
election since the end of 43-month ethnic war last December
started today in an attempt to bring peace and unity to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Although NATO peacekeepers were on high alert for possible
ethnic violence, organizers and security services reported only
minor incidents half way through the day.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,400 polling stations opened at 7 a.m.(0500 GMT) today to
allow 2.9 million Bosnians to vote for a three-member presidency
-- one from each ethnic faction, a national assembly, as well as
governing institutions in the two entities of Bosnia -- the
Muslim-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
The election is part of the Dayton peace agreement signed by
leaders of the warring sides in Bosnia in December 1995 and which
ended the bloody conflict in the country.
</P>
<P>
There are 29 political parties and coalitions competing in the
elections. Initial results will not be available until September
17, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is organizing the election, said.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the U.N. international police,
said voting was proceeding normally by 11 a.m. local time (0900
GMT) except for a few minor incidents.
</P>
<P>
There were initial reports of blockages on certain roads due to
logistical problems, but these were later cleared up.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko said that there was one shooting incident near Sarajevo
and the Muslim-Croat Federation is conducting investigations into
this incident.
</P>
<P>
Brett Boudrou, spokesman for the NATO-led Implementation Force
(IFOR), said that the stopping of refugees by Serb police in Brcko
was due to some refugees taking private cars to get to the polling
stations instead of buses as previously agreed.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Fisher, the OSCE's general director of the elections, said
Croat polling workers have also agreed to return to the
Muslim-controlled town of Bugojno, where they withdrew from after
the home of one Croat election official was bombed.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring Yugoslavia
and Croatia are expected to come back for the polling and IFOR was
braced for possible violence arising from clashes between refugees
returning to home towns or villages and ethnic groups which now
control these areas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, IFOR ground troop commander Lt. General
Michael Walker said that about 25,000 IFOR soldiers and

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on USA to Obliterate Idea of Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's military has
called on the United States to "obliterate from their minds
imagination of aggression against Iran."
</P>
<P>
Rahim Ebrahimi, deputy commander of the ground forces for
intelligence and operation, said that Iranian forces would stand
up to any aggression against Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
"By its military presence in the Persian Gulf and its recent
attacks on Iraq, the United States is in quest of nothing but its
own interest," the deputy commander was quoted today by the
English-language daily Tehran Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said:"Iran did not lean towards any aggression or
expansionist policies," adding that Iran followed a defensive
stance towards the potential military attack by the American
forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement by the high-ranking
military officer reflects Iran's opposition to the massing of
U.S. military forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes, warships and thousands of troops were heading
to the Gulf in a show of force even as Iraq suspended Friday its
attempts to fire at U.S. jets enforcing "no-fly" zones in northern
and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iranian military forces have been at a red alert for over
one month since U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry made a
threat to launch military attack against Iran in early August.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said that all Iranian military personnel
have been ordered to stick to their posts without any leave or
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Rahim stressed that "defense is the legitimate right
of all Moslems and they are religiously bound to uphold their
rights."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian military forces are ready to enter the
scene, whenever and wherever there is any possible aggression
against Iran, upon the permission of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Rezaie, commander of the Revolutionary Guards, said that
the Islamic Republic is an undeniable reality in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, the Central Asia and the Caucasus, he
said, the main issue is the struggle between Iran and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has not succeeded in the struggle against
Iran. If the U.S. wins, it would establish its sovereignty in the
region overnight, and U.S. troops would be stationed in the
region as far as to the borders of Russia," Rezai said.

<HEADLINE> Hyatt Tapping China's Hotel Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Hyatt, a big name in the
world hotel industry, is taking a steady move into China instead
of rushing in to snap a big share of the lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
"Hyatt is not aimed to be the largest, but the best," said
Edward Tai, who oversees Hyatt business in North Asia, including
China's inland areas and Taiwan province.
</P>
<P>
Hyatt now operates two hotels in the Chinese inland areas, one
in Xi'an, famous for its unearthed life-size terra cotta warriors
and horses, and the other in Tianjin, the largest port city in
north China.
</P>
<P>
Tai recognized that Hyatt's expansion in China is slower than
its pace in other Asian areas though it has entered the country
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
"Our philosophy of management more or less made it difficult
to find an appropriate partner," said Tai. Hyatt has not a single
penny of investment in any of the 173 hotels it runs throughout
the world; it has only management know-how and a brand name.
Usually the hotel owners give a free hand to Hyatt managers and
than pocket the profits.
</P>
<P>
The way of doing business does not work well in China, where
people prefer to such forms of cooperation as awarding franchises
or injecting direct investment to build hotels.
</P>
<P>
But things are changing. Currently, the third Hyatt hotel in
China is under construction in the country's largest metropolis --
Shanghai. When opened in 1998, the 88-storeyed building will be
the highest Hyatt hotel in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Grand Hyatt Shanghai will become a flagship,
showcasing the best hotel management," said Tai, who believed
that the example will make it easier for Hyatt to develop its
subsidiaries in China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hyatt's development plan in the country, the
manager said: "We target secondary cities, such as Hangzhou,
Nanjing and Xiamen. Hyatt wants to rank first or second among
hotels in the very city as it does in other places in the world."
</P>
<P>
In his view, Beijing and Guangzhou are oversupplied with
hotels, where the average occupancy rate is lower than 75 percent.
Having been working in Hyatt for 23 years, the manager wished he
could open a Hyatt hotel in the capital city of China before he
retires.
</P>
<P>
Tai believed that more and more people will travel to China
either for business or leisure to cash in the country's fast
growing economy or go sightseeing at numerous tourist attractions.
The demand for hotels will increase with the growth of inbound
arrivals, bringing good news to the country's hotel industry, he
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 39 Hyatt hotels are under development, of which 20
are located in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Voters Begin to Cast Ballots in Historic Bosnian Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALE, Bosnia, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited
historic moment for Bosnia has finally come as 2.9 million voters
across the country began to cast their ballots at 07:00 (local
time) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The first voter at No.2 polling station in the Serb capital
Pale was 64-year-old Kijiundzic Boro who arrived at the post
office-turned polling station at 06:40 (local time).
</P>
<P>
"This election will make our authority legalized and I can't
wait any longer," said Boro, a retired mechanical professor. More
than 20 people were standing in a queue before the door opened.
</P>
<P>
There are 4,400 polling stations opened across Bosnia on
Saturday until 19:00 (local time) to allow eligible voters to
exercise their right and decide their future. In Pale, there are
35 polling stations opened for 16,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
Voters will choose a three-member joint presidency, a
Bosnia-wide House of Representatives, assemblies of both entities
-- Republika Srpska and Muslim-Croat Federation, a Serb president,
and regional assemblies in both entities.
</P>
<P>
The queue controller standing by the door used UV light to
check Boro's hand for invisible ink that would have indicated he
had already voted. After that, Boro went into the small room and
showed his ID card to get ballot materials.
</P>
<P>
He then held out his hands and the ink applicator sprayed
invisible ink on his right index finger. He went to a makeshift
booth, wrote down his choice and sealed his ballot envelope before
going to four cardboard boxes and dropping four ballots with
different colors.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
which is responsible for organizing and monitoring the first
post-war crucial election in the war-torn country, hopes the
voting will bring together again the Serbs, Muslims and Croats now
split into nationalist-ruled sectors.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to tell you whom I voted for, but I can tell you
the Serbs can never live with Muslims and Croats any more after
nearly four years of war," Boro said.
</P>
<P>
"I voted for the SDS, I have nothing to hide," another
middle-aged woman said excitedly. "All the voters standing there
will vote for the SDS," she added, pointing to the queue in front
of the station.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) was created in 1990 by
former Serb President Radovan Karadzic who resigned as the
president and the chairman of the ruling party in July under
foreign pressure. The acting SDS chairman is Aleksa Buha, the
Serb foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"How can we live together with the Muslims and Croats who have
killed several of my family members?" said the woman, who declined
to tell her name. She lived in Croatia until 1991 when a war
between the Croats and Serbs broke out. She was a social
scientist and is now a babysitter.
</P>
<P>
"It is ridiculous to force the ethnic groups which kill and
hate each other to live in one state," she added.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say the elections, held under poor conditions,
will help strengthen the positions of the ruling parties which
were responsible for the start of the civil war in the spring of
1992 and make the three ethnic groups, Serbs, Croats and Muslims,
further apart.

SEOUL, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Defense
Ministry plans to buy United States-made Harpoon anti-ship and Sea
Sparrow anti-aircraft missiles by 1999, a ministry official said

</P>
<P>
The missiles are among various military items South Korea
decided to purchase during the July-August period of this year for

dollars, according to the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on

problems. He did not said if his proposal was heeded positively.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Elections Kicked Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(updated with first press briefing)
</P>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's first elections
since the end of its 43-month-old war started on Saturday, with
NATO peacekeepers on high alert to prevent possible ethnic
violence.
</P>
<P>
About 4,400 polling stations in Bosnia opened at 7 a.m. (local
time) to an estimated 2.6 million eligible voters and will close
at 7 p.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
According to the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), which organizes the elections, 2.9 million Bosnians
can vote and more than 300,000 refugees did so via absentee
ballots between August 28 and September 3.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Fischer, the OSCE director general of elections, said that
a survey of Sarajevo polling stations found that by 8 a.m. (local
time) the voter turnout has been light, with no lines nor crowds
and there were a few people complaining that their names could not
be found on the electorate lists.
</P>
<P>
He said that the turnout for some 3,000 voters in uniforms,
which was held one day earlier, was 60 percent, while other
military personnel in Bosnia are expected to vote on Saturday in
plain clothes.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring Yugoslavia
and Croatia are expected to come back for the polling and the
NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) are braced up for possible
violence arising from clashes between refugees returning to home
towns or villages and ethnic groups which now control these areas.
</P>
<P>
Brett Boudreau, an IFOR spokesman, said that Serb police were
blocking the return of refugees to Brcko this morning in violation
of the previously agreed security arrangement among the three
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Fisher also reported that a hand grenade was thrown at a Croat
official of the local election committee in the Muslim-controlled
town of Bugojno, forcing the Croat side to withdraw their polling
workers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, IFOR ground troop commander Michael Walker
said that about 25,000 IFOR soldiers and international policemen
would be assigned for the security of elections.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen roads have been designated as special routes for
refugees returning home, which are heavily protected by the IFOR,
while the OSCE has also set up polling stations along the former
front lines for refugees if their return is blocked.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement signed by Bosnia's three
ethnic factions, Bosnians will elect a three-member presidency,
with one from each ethnic group, a national assembly, as well as
the governing institutions in the two entities -- the Bosnian
Federation and the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Western media have been critical of the conditions for the
Bosnian elections, for fear that they would legitimize the
nationalist parties calling for partitioning the country, thus
further destabilizing the shaky peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government has been pushing for holding elections
on time, arguing that setting up common institutions is
necessarily the first step toward national reconciliation in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, even U.S. officials admitted privately that the
efficiency of the common institutions will hinge on which parties
and candidates may win the election.
</P>
<P>
There are 29 political parties and coalitions competing in the
elections and the initial results will not be available until
September 17, the OSCE said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investments in
South Korea in the first eight months of this year amounted to
1.645 billion U.S. dollars, up 36 percent from the same period
last year, the ministry of finance and economy said today.
</P>
<P>
Investments in the country's manufacturing sector jumped 42.2
percent to 916 million dollars during the January-August period
while those in the non-manufacturing sector rose 28.8 percent to
729 million dollars, according to the ministry
</P>
<P>
Direct investments from European Union nations zoomed 86.6
percent to 472 million dollars and investments from Asia and
countries elsewhere increased 2.5 times to 554 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, direct Japanese investments in South Korea plummeted
38.5 percent to 179 million dollars and direct U.S. investments
declined 13.7 percent to 440 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the increase in direct foreign
investments during the January-August period to government efforts
aimed at improving the domestic investment environment and
simplifying investment procedures.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last month, the total direct foreign
investments in South Korea had reached 16.05 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Airways' Profits Close to 10 Billion Drachmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athens, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Olympic Airways, Greece's
state-owned airliner, made profits of 9.963 billion drachmas (43
million U.S. dollars) in 1995, after 18 years in the red, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Airways is under a strict restructuring program, agreed
with the European Union, under which most of its massive debts
have been forgiven and which obliges it to shed excess staff.
</P>
<P>
During 1995, 1,201 Olympic Airways employees left the company,
of whom 1,048 took advantage of the bonuses offered for early
retirement. This had left Olympic Airways with 9,159 employees at
the end of 1995, from 10,360 at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
This year, 461 more employees will leave the company.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Airways made most of its revenue from its international
flights (146.2 billion drachmas or 640 million dollars). Ground
handling services brought in more money than domestic flights --
42.1 billion drachmas (180 million dollars) to 35.5 billion
drachmas (154 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, profits are estimated to fall to 7.7 billion drachmas
(33 million dollars), mainly because of a drop in passengers, in a
climate of increased competition.

PARIS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- More than two million Bosnians are voting today to elect
their common institutions: a three-headed presidency and a
parliament. The historic elections are supposed to consolidate
peace, but also risk to endorse partition, because the nationalist
parties are certain to come out the winners.
</P>
<P>
-- There are five questions being posed by observers on the
Bosnian elections:
</P>
<P>
I. Are these elections free and honest?
</P>
<P>
II. Is it necessary to delay the voting?
</P>
<P>
III. Will the future common institutions work?
</P>
<P>
IV. Should the IFOR stay after December 20?
</P>
<P>
V. Will the war resurrect?
</P>
<P>
-- Sejfudin Tokic, a member of Bosnia's Union of
Social-Democrats, is presenting himself as a pilgrim for national
reconciliation by urging the cohabitation of three entities of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly three million Bosnians are voting today to
consolidate peace in their country. But the Serbs have been
defying the international community to the end by calling for a
separation. The Serb leader Bijana Plavsic is due to speak on
television today to explain her reasons for separation.
</P>
<P>
The United States is doing all it can to let the elections move
on as scheduled, in order to withdraw its 16,000 troops from
Bosnia on time. The Europeans hope the maintenance of NATO forces
in Bosnia while making it clear that they would not stay in the
absence of Americans.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fanatic Buying Dominates Dhaka Share Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- With an increasing number of
new investors flocking to the stock market, the already bullish
Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) witnessed an unprecedented rise in all
major indicators for the last trading week ending Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Stock sources said hundreds of new investors, mostly middle
class people, were crowding the offices of the stock brokers every
day, desperately trying to buy securities in Bangladesh's main
bourse which opens on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
The key DSE ALL Share Price Index rose to 1,622.26 points on
Monday after gaining 293.45 points over just three days' brisk
trading. The market quickly showed the signs of correction and
slid 106.29 points in the subsequent two sessions.
</P>
<P>
Although the correction was welcomed by market observers, the
bears' attack was repulsed and the index gained again, ending at
1,527.50 on Thursday with a net rise of 198.69 points during the
week.
</P>
<P>
The bull market has been mainly attributed to a stable
political situation brought by the three-month-old new government,
said DSE Chairman Imtiaz Hossen, adding that the investors gained
more confidence after the smooth holding of the September 5
by-election.
</P>
<P>
Before the Awami (People's) League led by Sheikh Hasina won the
June 12 election and brought to an end this country's longstanding
political turmoil, the DSE All Share Price Index just hovered
around 900 points.
</P>
<P>
The Index strongly climbed over 1,200 points at the beginning
of this month, evoking the enthusiasm among the people in
different income sectors.
</P>
<P>
The onrush of money from the new investors pushed the demand
well above the poor supply of shares, when both operators and
regulators were thinking about the ways of augmenting supply of
good scripts to the market.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
regulator of the capital market, said the commission had already
taken steps so that supply of shares in the market could be
augmented on an urgent basis.
</P>
<P>
At least six companies are going to float their shares in the
market within next one to two months. More companies are expected
to be listed on the DSE to satisfy the present huge demand.
</P>
<P>
However, some stock analysts argued that the market was going
to be overheated, warning that the small investors might suffer
when the market starts correction.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate sufferers will be the new investors who are
buying without considering the basic fundamentals of a company,"
said Professor Abu Ahmed, a distinguished stock expert in this
country.
</P>
<P>
DSE Chairman Hossen also admitted that heavy speculation caused
the sudden rise in prices of some issues, but he ruled out any
immediate crash as the buying pressure is higher than the selling
pressure which pushed the price hike in the market.
</P>
<P>
Increases in the turnover both in volume and value during
recent sessions demonstrated that the share market was booming as
a large number of new investors came with huge money, the DSE
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
When the flow ends, the market will take a pause and then it
will take a turn-about, "But nobody knows when that point will
come," he added.

<HEADLINE> Canada May Downgrade Mission in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- An option to downgrade the
Canadian high commission in Nigeria favored by senior Cadandian
officials has become a hot topic among diplomats here, according
to press report today.
</P>
<P>
The option to downgrade the diplomatic mission is not only
being favored in retaliation for the closure of Nigerian high
commission in Ottawa, capital of Canada. It is also to protest to
the Nigerian government the deterioration of human rights
condition in Nigeria and the slow pace of the military's
transition program to civil rule, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria announced last weekend it was closing down its high
commission in Canada as part of its efforts to rationalize
existing missions abroad and bring down their personnel to a
manageable and cost effect size.
</P>
<P>
But observers widely believe that the measure was politically
motivated, suggesting that the measure was the Nigerian
government reprisal at Canada's virulent pro-democracy campaign
against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Canada is the most active in the Commonwealth and has insisted
that the organization should impose toucher sanction against
Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM's Win in Election Boosts Confidence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri's victory in the current general election has
boosted confidence in Lebanon's economy and greatly activated
local financial markets, a Beirut banking source said here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Outcomes of the polling in Beirut, the constituency of the
billionaire premier, at the beginning of this month has
increased local investors' trust in the Lebanese currency and
stimulated sales of long-term treasury bills, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who has based his economic policies on strengthening
the Lebanese pound in the past four years, trumped on September
1 when he and his supporters won 14 of Beirut's 19 seats in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
His victory was welcomed by local investors as a guarantee of
political stability and of the pound, and they were now selling
dollars to buy pounds for investment in the two-year treasury
bills, the banking source said.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of the two-year bills in the first week
following the election amounted to 117 billion Lebanese
pounds (75 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lebanese investors came to regard the two-year bills as a
"safe shelter in a foreseeable future" due to a number of
reasons, including the high interest rate of the bills and an
expectable continuity of the government's fixed economic
policies, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The two-year bills are the longest-term paper offered by
Lebanon, which currently yield 21.76 percent a year compared
with 17.85 percent for the 12-month bills, 16.92 percent for the
six-months and 14.61 percent for the three-months.
</P>
<P>
The brisk purchasing of the treasury bills has led to an
increase in demand of the Lebanese pound.
</P>
<P>
The banking source noted that the investors were buying
the pound at a rate of 15 to 20 million dollars a day, sharply
contrasted with 4-5 million dollars a day before the
elections.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for Hariri, the mastermind of
Lebanon's multi-billion reconstruction projects, to run for the
general election since Lebanon's civil war ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
After the victory, the Sunni prime minister has a
dual-capacity as deputy in the house and head of the government.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming parliament's four-year term will expire in
October 2,000, and the present house was elected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
After the last 23 deputies of the 128-member parliament are
elected in the eastern Beqaa on Sunday, Lebanon's five-phased
general election will come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Some local economic experts said that the general election
would give the government an important opportunity to consider
the financial and economic policies in order to review its
rehabilitation plan and the agenda of its high public debts and
to adjust the public expenditure and interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Arab Foreign Ministers Open Meeting in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers opened
a regular meeting here today to discuss implementing the
resolutions adopted at the Arab Summit in June.
</P>
<P>
The 106th session of the Arab Foreign Ministers Council
will deal with a number of issues with emphasis on setting
up an Arab court of justice, drafting a code of honor on
Arab security and cooperation and the creation of an Arab
League mechanism for the peaceful settlement of inter-Arab
disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Summit held in Cairo on June 22-23 endorsed in
principle the establishment of these mechanisms, which Arab
leaders have hoped will provide Arab countries with new legal
means to contain crisis and settle differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The regular meeting would also deal with ways to free the
Middle East from all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Arab states have repeatedly called on Israel to join the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Jewish state is
believed to be the only country in the Middle East that
possesses nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being held amid grave tension between Iraq
and the United States. But Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid said earlier that it would not tackle the current
situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid said that the Iraqi government did not request
that the Iraq-U.S. tension be included in the agenda, but
"if it is raised by the Iraqi delegation, then it is their
right."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Friday
in Cairo that Iraq will not try to enlist support from
other Arab states in its confrontation with Washington.
</P>
<P>
The regular meeting, the first to be held after the Cairo
Arab Summit, would be followed by an emergency meeting of
the foreign ministers later today.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting, called by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, would focus on the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here this morning, was expected to try
to persuade Arabs to reconsider normalizing relations with
Israel if it fails to keep its peace pledges.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry will travel to the Gulf region this weekend to try
to persuade Gulf states in supporting U.S. military action against
Iraq, government officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The countries on the Perry itinerary include Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrein and "maybe Turkey," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The trip was made after a meeting of President Bill Clinton's
top national security advisers at the White House on Friday
morning, which discussed the possible consequences of a showdown
with Iraq both militarily and diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
Gulf states have expressed their "grown unease" with the
current American military buildup in the region to launch a
sustained attack on Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the Perry trip would be to talk to regional
players (about) providing the support we would need to carry out
various operations in the region and to explain exactly what
possible missions might be, in this case to keep the no-fly zone
effectively in force," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Although Iraq announced it would suspend firing missiles at
U.S., British and French aircraft patrolling the skies of no-fly
zones in the northern and southern parts of Iraq, the United
States said it would watch whether its actions match its words,
and continued to strengthen its military capacities for another
possible strike against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> UN Places High Hope on IPU Beijing Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has placed
high hopes on the 96th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
(IPU) to be convened here next Monday, expecting progress to be
made here in protecting the rights of women and children and in
combating hunger and starvation, a senior UN official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
UN Under-Secretary-General Joseph Werner Reed, who is special
representative of UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for
this conference, made the remark here in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The UN and the IPU, both as important political organizations
in the world, have a wide range of common interests in maintaining
world peace and promoting human development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The topics on enhancement of the rights of women and children
and providing foods for all included in the conference agenda this
time have also been focus of attention of the United Nations for a
long time, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Boutros-Ghali's own view, parliaments and
parliamentarians have great potentials in dealing with the issues
mentioned above. They can enact laws to protect the rights and
interests of women and children, they can approve projects to
offer economic and technical assistance to the developing
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they can initiated new ideas and plans for action for
the realization of many UN goals, he said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the IPU has been the first international
organization to urge the governments to ratify the UN convention
on the rights of children, which is most universally implemented
today.
</P>
<P>
Reed said that the UN Secretary-General himself would very much
like to come to attend this conference because of the close
relations with the IPU and with the hosting country, the People's
Republic of China, to which he has paid many official visits, but
he could not spare himself from the 51st UN General Assembly to
open next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But he has taken with him a message from Boutros-Ghali and will
read it at the opening ceremony on Monday, Reed said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Elections Kick off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnians begin casting
their votes at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) Saturday at more than 4,000
polling stations across the country for the first post-war
elections.
</P>
<P>
The election is widely regarded as the critical juncture for
the country's future.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2.6 million eligible voters are due to cast their
ballots before closure at 7 p.m., with NATO peace keepers on high
alert to prevent possible ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 Bosnian refugees voted in absentee ballots
between August 28 and September 3, according to the Organization
of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which organized the
election.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring Yugoslavia
and Croatia are expected to return for the polling, and the
NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) is braced for possible
violence arising from clashes between refugees returning to home
towns or villages and ethnic groups now controlling these areas.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing earlier this week, IFOR ground troops
commander Lt. General Michael Walker said about 25,000 IFOR
soldiers and international policemen would be assigned for the
security of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen roads have been designated as special routes for
refugees returning home. They will be heavily protected by IFOR,
while OSCE has also set up polling stations along the former front
lines for refugees if their return is blocked.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement signed by Bosnia's three
ethnic factions, which put an end to the 43-month war, the
Bosnians will elect a three-member presidency, with one from each
ethnic group, a national assembly as well as governing
institutions in the two entities -- the Bosnian Federation and the
Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
The western media has been critical of the conditions for the
Bosnian elections, fearing they would legitimize the nationalist
parties call for partitioning the country, thus further
destabilizing its shaky peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government has been pushing for holding elections
on time, arguing that setting up common institutions is the
necessarily first step towards national reconciliation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, even U.S. officials admit privately that the
efficiency of the common institutions will hinge on which parties
and candidates win the elections.
</P>
<P>
There are 29 political parties and coalitions competing in the
elections and the initial results will not be available until
September 17, the OSCE said.

<P>
ROME, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini today discussed with visiting NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana the peace process in Bosnia and NATO's expansion
plan.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on the upcoming elections in mid-September
in Bosnia, the mission of peace-keeping troops and the relations
between NATO and Russia and the Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the current focus in Bosnia was the
elections which would exert a great and direct influence on not
only the future of Bosnia but also the security and stability of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the mission of peace-keeping troops in Bosnia, both sides
agreed that the peace-keepers have devoted a lot to the peace
process in Bosnia. If the situation in Bosnia goes toward
stability and normal after the elections, all the troops should be
withdrawn from the region, if not, they should continue to stay
there until peace and stability become the daily convention of the
region.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's expansion plan, both sides agreed that there would be
no security guarantee in Europe without the cooperation of Russia
and the Mediterranean countries. NATO views its southward
expansion as the same importance as its eastward expansion. Both
sides agreed that the issue should be on the agenda of next year's
summit of NATO's member countries.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Defense Minister
Beniamino Andreatta today also met with Sonala on separate
occasions. Solana will left for Bosnia the next day to visit the
peace-keeping troops there.

<HEADLINE> India's State Bank Seeks Ceiling on Public Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has warned the government against the present practice of
enlarging gross borrowings to repay public debt and has sought a
legislative ceiling on public debt.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the current financial year, net liabilities of
the government would be about one-fifth of the country's GDP
(gross domestic product) in monetary terms. "Any further
deterioration in this position would seriously undermine the
credibility of fiscal policy," said the RBI in its 1995-96 annual
report.
</P>
<P>
The quantum of government borrowing from the market has
remained excessively high. Gross market borrowings amounted to as
high as 405,090 million rupees (12.7 billion US dollars) in
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The government of India has budgeted for gross market
borrowings of 352,940 million rupees (10.6 billion US dollars) in
1996-97. In net terms, ( i.e. after allowing for repayment
obligations), market borrowing in 1996-97 would be 254,980 million
rupees (7.7 billion US dollars), the RBI report said.
</P>
<P>
Large market borrowing would necessarily have the potential
adverse effects of keeping nominal interest rates at a level which
would result in very high real rates of interest in view of the
distinctly lower inflation rate. With the decline in inflation,
the real rates of interest are in double-digits. This is
unsustainable, given the expected growth of the economy at 6.5
percent, the RBI report further said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Second Board counters
dominated trading on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) this
week as the market ended higher in fairly active trading.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index (CI) rose 12.22 points to 1,117.55, the
Industrial Index was up 21 points to 2,114.21, while the Emas
Index edged up 4.32 points to 324.24.
</P>
<P>
Though fairly active, it was overall a quiet week, with fears
among institutional players of an impending US attack on Iraq over
the weekend weighing down on sentiment.
</P>
<P>
During the week, two new issues were listed on the KLSE second
board.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the local bourse was expected to remain sideways
with slight upward bias next week with interest continuing to be
tied to second board counters.
</P>
<P>
On the KLSE, the main board volume this week rose to 757.029
million shares valued at 5.257 billion ringgit (about 2.103
billion US dollars) from 622.558 million shares worth 4.549
billion ringgit (about 1.820 billion US dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 492.773 million shares worth
5.712 billion ringgit (about 2.285 billion US dollars), compared

<HEADLINE> Economic Prospects for 1996-97 Favorable: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 14 ( Xinhua) -- While the performance of
the Indian economy in 1995-96 was satisfactory in several
respects, the prospects for 1996-97 also appear favorable, said a
report for 1995-96 of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
</P>
<P>
The recent experience of growth and inflation suggests that
macroeconomic management could help move towards higher growth
along with non-accelerating inflation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the performance during 1995-96, the RBI annual
report said that it was markedly different from that of the past
in more than one sense. First, the sharp improvement in economic
growth coincided with a very substantial decline in inflation rate
as measured by the wholesale price index. Second, the problems in
raising resources in support of the government's market borrowing
program proved to be immense in the face of competing demands for
resources for financing economic activities. Third, the external
sector faced pressures in the wake of heightened import demand and
reduced capital flows which were quickly transmitted to the
domestic financial markets.
</P>
<P>
On the economic prospects for 1996-97, the RBI report said
industrial growth could be sustained in view of the continued
buoyancy in both domestic and export spheres. The real GDP growth
could be about 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
It would not be possible to sustain a 6 to 7 percent growth
without accelerating agricultural growth much beyond the 2.4
percent recorded in 1995-96, the RBI report added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government to Connect Schools to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 14 ( Xinhua ) -- The Union government has
chalked out a blueprint to connect schools across the country to
the Internet, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The program will, however, be open only for government-run and
recognized institutions with a major focus on those in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The scheme involves linking a cluster of eight to ten schools
in a region to a very small aperture terminal (VSAT), which would
in turn be connected to a hub in the nearest town through the
Indian satellite, INSAT-2C.
</P>
<P>
"Financial aid will be provided for the first three years,
after which the school would have to take care of operational
expenses," said Minister of State for Planning and Program
Implementation and Science &AMP; Technology Y.K. Alagh.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have a VSAT in each school, when it becomes
feasible," he said.

TOKYO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's All Nippon Airways
(ANA) will resume its flights between Nagoya and Honolulu next
February after a four-year interval, according to news reports
today.
</P>
<P>
ANA hopes to win the approvals from Japan and the United States

resumption of the Nagoya-Honolulu route, said the Nihon Keizai

Airlines and Northwest Airlines of the U.S., said the Kyodo News

</P>
<P>
The aviation company, which opened the flight route in
September 1991 for three flights a week, is expected to apply to

<HEADLINE> Independence Torch Tours Central American Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central American Torch,
symbol of regional unity, went today from Nicaragua to Costa Rica,
the last stop in a marathon race to mark the 175th anniversary of
the independence of Central America, which falls on September 15.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Education Minister Humberto Belli handed today at
3:00 p.m. local time the Fire of Independence to his Costa Rican
counterpart Eduardo Doryan Garron, in Penas Blancas, on the
southern Nicaraguan border.
</P>
<P>
The torch is being carried by a group of young runners in a
marathon that goes through Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,
Nicaragua, and ends in Costa Rica. Mexico also starts celebrating
its independence the night of September 15.
</P>
<P>
The patriotic fire was received Thursday morning by the
Nicaraguan education minister at the border post of El Espino,
from his Honduran colleague, Xenobia Ruedas de Leon, in a solemn
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran minister said during the ceremony that the torch
represents the highest desire of Central Americans for peace,
which is in turn a fundamental condition to establish the basis
for the unity and the development of the nations of the region.
</P>
<P>
Belli, the Nicaraguan minister, stressed in his speech the
unity and fraternity yearning of the peoples of the region and
pointed out that when these borders start losing their element of
division, "we will strengthen our economies, our progress and will
consolidate ourselves in the concert of the nations."
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Education Ministry ordered its department
delegates to station the students along the way to pay homage to
the torch and to the National Flag, as a tribute to the Motherland.
</P>
<P>
The torch arrived in Managua at 8:30 p.m. Thursday and was
received by the capital city Mayor Miriam Fonseca at the "Juan
Pablo II" plaza.
</P>
<P>
The flame continued on its way to Masaya, Granada, and other
municipalities in the south of Nicaragua.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin and Rubber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO), rubber and tin ended the week lower or mixed
to lower.
</P>
<P>
CPO physicals ended sharply lower this week in moderately
active trading, in line with the weaker CPO futures contract and
uncertainty in the Chicago market.
</P>
<P>
Talks that palm oil production for end-August would be 15
percent firmer over July contributed to a bearish sentiment on the
cash market.
</P>
<P>
Estimates by private crop forecaster Ivan Wong that end-August
palm oil production would increase by 11 percent to about 800,000
tons from July while palm oil stocks would grow to 775,000 tons
from the official figure of 754,634 tons in July were, however,
factored in by the market.
</P>
<P>
A lack of fresh leads and uncertainty over the market's trend
in the immediate and near term contributed to lackluster trading
on the cash market.
</P>
<P>
In physicals, September-South contract settled lower on Friday
at 1,195 ringgit (about 478 US dollars) against last week's close
at 1,265 ringgit (about 506 US dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) also settled this week 11
sen (about 4.4 US cents) lower at 15.02 per kg from the previous
Friday's close at 15.13 ringgit (about 6.05 US dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
This was resulted from overall higher offerings and volatility
on the London Metal Exchange (LME), dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Local, European and Japanese buyers dominated activities this
week.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the week decreased to 657 tons against 721 tons
last week.
</P>
<P>
And the Malaysian rubber market closed mixed to lower this week
in overall quiet trading despite brokers regaining confidence to
trade actively in the market.
</P>
<P>
The International RSS One was unchanged from last Friday at
329.00 sen (about 131.6 US cents) per kg while SMR 20 declined by
one and a half sen to 314.00 sen (about 125.6 st in the
immediate term following traders' response to what he described as
"comfortable" price levels.
</P>
<P>
This week, the market seesawed in a tight range owing to the
uncertainty in regional markets and lack of fresh factors.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- France has signed a five-year
accord with Vietnam to help it gain knowledge for launching its
own nuclear energy program in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
France's Atomic Energy Agency (CEA) said the accord signed here
on Friday involved "the peaceful application of advanced nuclear
technology".
</P>
<P>
Vietnam wanted to acquire the capability of producing nuclear
energy around 2010, the CEA said.
</P>
<P>
Yannick d'Escatha, general administrator of the CEA, and
Ngyuyen Tien Nguyen, head of Vietnam's atomic energy commission
(Vinatom), signed the document.
</P>
<P>
The accord covered nuclear physics, reactor physics and
technology, production of radio-isotopes, safety and protection
against radiation and access to computer data bases.
</P>
<P>
The CEA will help Vietnam in the areas of information and
personnel exchange, seminars and training sessions, and joint
research and development projects.
</P>
<P>
About 700 Vietnamese are reportedly working at four nuclear
institutes in Hanoi, Dalat and Ho Chi Minh City. The Dalat
facility has an experimental reactor and is capable of handling
radioactive waste.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Elections Vital to Regional Peace, Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran
Lilic said here Friday that Bosnian elections are of great
significance to the peace and stability in the former Yugoslav
region.
</P>
<P>
The elections would change the situation in the region, which
would prove the whole value of the Dayton peace accord, Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, which was signed in the United
States last December, after ending the three-and-half-year war in
Bosnia, elections would be held in this former Yugoslav republic
on September 14 with the monitoring of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Dayton agreement, which paved the way for substituting war
with peace, damage with creation, as well as nationalism with
respecting people's interests, opened the door for democracy of
the former Yugoslav region, especially for the regional economic
cooperation, human rights and mutual respect," Lilic added.
</P>
<P>
Any set-back of the peace process in Bosnia would lead to an
unpredictable result to the region as well as more extensive
areas, the Yugoslav president added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia also expressed its hope for the U.N. to totally lift
sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
In an address on the Yugoslav Radio today, Deputy Foreign
Minister Radoslav Bulajic said that Yugoslavia expected its
sanctions to be lifted up soon.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dayton peace accord, sanctions imposed on
Yugoslavia should be lifted 10 days after the elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to hold back Yugoslavia to become a member
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
United Nations and international financial organizations, as
Yugoslavia has cooperated successfully so far with the
international organizations," Bulajic said.

The two countries can work in cooperation in many fields,

<P>
Ukraine is cooperating with NATO within the framework of the
"Partnership for Peace" program, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wilecki said that the aim of his visit is to set up cooperation
with the Ukrainian military in the field of military technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and Kenya, two of
the biggest tea producers in the world, have signed an agreement
on marketing tea products of the two countries on a
non-competitive basis, according to Trade Ministry sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that under the agreement, Kenya and Sri Lanka
will supply tea to the world market at the same price.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is a result of a discussion held between Kenyan
Ambassador J.K. Tayrror and Sri Lankan Minister of Trade, Commerce
and Food K. Wickramaratna in Colombo recently, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that tea prices vary in the world
market due to the lack of mutual co-operation and understanding
among the tea producing countries in the world. This has resulted
in a constant drop in the prices of tea.
</P>
<P>
As a remedial measure to overcome this price fluctuation, tea
producing countries in the world should enter into a joint
agreement to stabilize tea prices, the sources quoted the minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Total Sri Lankan tea exports in the first four months of this
year are 75 million Kg, down slightly from 77 million Kg in the
same period last year.

PANAMA CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Panama will negotiate
free trade agreements with Chile and the Andean Pact for its
products to enter a market with 98 million people.
</P>
<P>
The move, announced by Miguel Heras, vice finance and treasury
minister of this Central American country, is under preparation
now, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government will receive next week the first
draft document of the free trade agreement to be signed with Chile
at the end of 1997, Heras was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Perez Balladares and the Panamanian Foreign
Trade Council are also promoting the signing of a free trade
agreement with the Andean Pact, he said.
</P>
<P>
Andean Pact is a regional group comprising of Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Panamanian Association
of Company Executives, Heras said his country has "a very well
defined foreign trade strategy" for the private sector.
</P>
<P>
After efforts made by the Panamanian government, he noted,
Ecuador promulgated two days ago a decree eliminating the
"discrimination" against Panamanian exports.
</P>
<P>
About the entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
focal topic of the seminar, Heras said Panama's negotiations to
gain WTO membership "will not result in very specific or big
custom tariffs reductions."

<HEADLINE> International Court Seeks Arrest of Croat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- An international court
issued an arrest warrant today for Ivica Rajic, a Bosnian Croat
militia leader charged with killing Muslims in a Bosnian village
in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia,
based in the Hague, the Netherlands, issued the warrant after a
two-day hearing of evidence against Rajic.
</P>
<P>
The hearing, in April this year, was called because Rajic could
not be arrested by the U.N. court, which was set up by the
U.N. Security Council in 1993, because it had no force to hunt
down suspects.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant effectively brands Rajic an international
fugitive from justice and empowers states to arrest him if they
find him on their territory, say reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Rajic, 38 and one of the 18 Croats indicted by the court, has
reportedly been living in a luxury bungalow owned by the Croatian
Defense Ministry, and has continued to work in central Bosnia
since his August 1995 indictment.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with leading the attack on Stupni Do, a remote
Muslim village in central Bosnia, killing at least 16 civilians
and forcing the survivors to flee.
</P>
<P>
"The trial chamber finds that there are reasonable grounds for
believing that Rajic committed ... wilful killing of civilians in
the village of Stupni Do, ... and the wanton destruction and
devastation of Stupni Do unjustified by military necessity," Judge
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
The international arrest warrant will be sent to all
U.N. members and the NATO-led peace-keeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Similar warrants were also issued in July for ousted Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko
Mladic, both twice indicted for genocide. Neither has been
arrested so far.

<HEADLINE> Work on Nanning-Kunming Railway Accelerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 650 kilometers of
track has been laid along the Nanning-Kunming rail line, an
important transport artery in southwest China. So far 576 km has
opened to trial traffic.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi section of the railway has track stretching to
Bose, and track along the Guizhou section has now reached Weishe.
</P>
<P>
The tracks are expected to meet at Badu, a station on the
boundary of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guizhou Province,
by next March.
</P>
<P>
The full rail line is expected to go into operation by the end
of next year, with an annual transport volume expected to reach 20
to 30 million tons, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
The electrified railway linking the capitals of Guangxi and
Yunnan Province will have a total length of 898 km, while the
combined length of bridges and tunnels makes up about one third of
the total, creating many engineering difficulties for builders.
</P>
<P>
The railway is anticipated to play a major role in
poverty-relief efforts and development of natural resources in
southwest China.

<HEADLINE> White House Releases Clinton's Medical Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Faced with continuing
pressure from Republican challenger Bob Dole and reporters, the
White House late Friday released U.S. President Bill Clinton's
medical history, which showed he tested negative in 1990 for AIDS
virus and is in good health.
</P>
<P>
In the 12 pages of medical information, Clinton's personal
physician, Dr. Connie Mariano, stated that the president has "no
history of hypertension, diabetes, tuberculosis, sexually
transmitted disease, cancer, stroke or heart disease."
</P>
<P>
The medical history, which includes statements from seven
military doctors who examined Clinton in May and an ear, nose and
throat specialist in Little Rock, Arkansas, who previously
examined him, also shows the president has a series of allergies,
has had some "pre-cancerous" skin growths and suffers from bouts
of hoarseness -- all of which was previously known.
</P>
<P>
Callers last week began lighting up telephone lines at talk
radio shows around the country, raising the question of why the
White House was holding out on providing the president's medical
records.
</P>
<P>
Cyber-surfers in recent days have posted their questions and
opinions on the Internet, the computer network spreading
worldwide. Some members of the White House press corps also
received form letters questioning why the medical records had not
been released.
</P>
<P>
White House officials have accused the Republicans of being
behind the telephone calls, Internet postings and apparent
letter-writing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore's office also released his medical
history.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, the American Health Information Management
Association issued a statement saying it "regrets that the current
political environment greatly pressures political candidates to
release their complete medical records."
</P>
<P>
"Our Congress recently passed, and the president signed, a bill
that ultimately could help maintain the confidentiality of
Americans' medical records. Even though we have taken this step
forward, and acknowledge the importance of medical privacy, it
appears the erosion of that privacy continues," the association
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar reached
two-month highs against the German mark and Japanese yen in late
New York trading today.
</P>
<P>
At closing, the U.S. currency traded at 1.5134 German marks, up
from Thursday's 1.5125 marks; and at 110.35 Japanese yen, up from
Thursday's 110.20 yen.
</P>
<P>
Dollar was strengthening in part by rising stock and bond
prices as foreign investors bought dollars to invest in U.S.
securities, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The recent dollar rise followed the news that increases in
August consumer prices and retail sales in the United States were
much smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
The government data further quenched the speculation about an
interest raise by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The statistics indicated inflation was in check, creating less
need for the Fed to raise rates at its meeting later this month to
moderate inflation.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has no
intention of stopping providing aid to Indonesia and other ASEAN
member countries, an American government official said here.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific
Affairs Winston Lord said Friday that his country would continue
giving aid to ASEAN members for selected areas.
</P>
<P>
The region covered by ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) has become very interesting to the U.S. because of its
dynamic economic growth, Lord said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. aid to Indonesia and other ASEAN members would never stop,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
But he added that ASEAN countries should not expect an increase
in U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
Lord also said that Washington would proceed with the sale of
nine F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The sale has been delayed because of U.S. concerns over the
Indonesian government's crackdown against its opponents in the
aftermath of the riots in Jakarta on July 27.

BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Teacher training colleges

standards in computer science, biotechnology, engineering and
other rapidly developing technical fields, a senior education
official said.
</P>

Liu Bin, vice-minister of the State Education Commission (SEC),

<P>
The new requirements are part of a State effort to improve
teacher training and produce educators with specialized skills.

<P>
Details will be released soon, so local governments can make
teacher education a priority, Liu said.

<P>
Last year, SEC statistics indicated that 66 percent of senior
normal schools didn't meet State construction standards.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves Welfare Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite protests by trade unions
and some church officials, the German Parliament today approved a
package of controversial welfare spending cuts which is expected
to become effective on October 1.
</P>
<P>
With the support of all 341 deputies from the ruling Christian
Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union and the Free
Democratic parties, the package received four more votes than the
minimum 337 votes needed to get it through the 672-member
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the austerity package, which embodied a cut in
sick-pay for workers, raising retirement ages for women and men
and reductions in workers' protection against firing, was the only
choice to help the country reduce soaring joblessness and boost
business.
</P>
<P>
But the package triggered condemnation from trade unions and
the opposition Social Democrat Party (SPD) and the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
The SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine described it as an unwise
choice of the ruling parties and said Germany needed a new
government to maintain social justice and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions called today a black Friday for the welfare
state. They indicated that they might organize demonstrations to
protect workers' rights and interests.

BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday proposed that
Thailand allow its flights to transit on Samui Island in the gulf
of Thailand before heading to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made during a meeting between Malaysian
Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik and his Thai counterpart Wan
Muhamad Nor Matha, local newspaper the Bangkok Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Ling Liong Sik was quoted as saying transit flights to Samui
Island, if Thailand agreed to, would help boost tourism in
southern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
But Wan Muhamad Nor Matha said the issue had yet to be
considered because Thailand was itself thinking about opening new
flights from Narathiwat, southern Thailand, to Langkawi in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia minister has also asked for an increase in land
transportation of goods from Malaysia to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also briefly discussed the trans-Asia railway
network being pushed for by Malaysia.

According to Wan Muhamad Nor Matha, Malaysia was seeking funds

<HEADLINE> Former White House Employees Sue Over FBI Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A 90-million-dollar
class-action lawsuit accuses White House, the FBI and others of
harming White House employees of previous administrations by
mishandling their background files.
</P>
<P>
"Invasion of privacy is a serious matter involving reputation,
emotional well-being, time and expense," Larry Klayman, general
counsel and chairman of Judicial Watch Inc., said today.
</P>
<P>
The group filed the lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
Klayman said Judicial Watch expects the legal proceedings to
show that misconduct "was orchestrated from the highest levels."
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs are five former low-level White House employees
suing the FBI and White House under the federal Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also invokes common-law invasion of privacy in
naming as defendants Hillary Rodham Clinton and former White House
counsel, Bernard Nussbaum; David Craig Livingstone, former
director of the office of personnel security; and his employee,
Anthony Marceca.
</P>
<P>
No evidence has come to light indicating that Mrs. Clinton was
involved in the handling of the FBI personnel files.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit said more than 700 former White House employees are
members of the class entitled to financial compensation.
</P>
<P>
"The contents of the FBI file of each member of the class were
improperly disclosed by the FBI to Rodham Clinton, Nussbaum,
Livingstone, Marceca and the White House," the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
It said Nussbaum, Livingstone and Marceca, went beyond what
they were authorized to do in asking the FBI to release
confidential files to the White House. Livingstone and Marceca
made the actual request, approved by Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
The three counts in the complaint charge violation of the
privacy act by the FBI and the White House and invasion of privacy
by Mrs. Clinton, Nussbaum, Livingstone and Marceca.

<HEADLINE> Japan Considers Taking Car Dispute to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan renewed its threat
Friday against Indonesia's car policy, saying it was considering
taking Indonesia to the World Trade Organization (WTO), official
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
"At this time we are discussing the problem and will continue
to talk over the issue," Japanese Minister of Trade and Industry
Shunpei Tsukahara said after meeting with Indonesian President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Tsukahara, who was here to attend the fifth meeting between
Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said
that Indonesia's national car policy breached WTO free trade
principles.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the chance for Indonesia to solve the issue
under a bilateral arrangement was still open, even if his
government decided to take the dispute to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Under the car policy, producers of a "national car" are granted
exemption from import duties and luxury taxes, which add about 60
percent to the car prices in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which holds a 90-percent share of the Indonesian auto
market, has joined the United States and the European Union in
criticizing Indonesia's auto policy which was introduced in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Minister of Industry and Trade Tunky
Ariwibowo said that the government's policy to grant special
incentives to national car producers would not be changed even
though there was opposition from the Japanese government.

<HEADLINE> China Has Cleaner Railway Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Rail passengers in China
generate an incredible 150,000 tons of garbage every year and how
to deal with it is a big problem.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of millions of discarded food trays were hurtled by
the trackside from moving trains, by both passengers and train
attendants, according to a report.
</P>
<P>
Now China's railway lines have become cleaner since a national
campaign to reduce garbage was launched.
</P>
<P>
Improved sanitation facilities and garbage treatment methods
have helped get rid of rubbish and waste along railway lines,
according to a recent meeting called to discuss the problem. The
meeting was held in the capital city of south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the Ministry of Railways urged railway
transportation departments to clean existing garbage along
railways, and put new garbage into plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
Designated garbage collection places increased from 17 to 151,
so that garbage could be collected and treated in time.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1 this year, new food boxes were put into use in
passenger trains to reduce the source of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Passengers were also talked into not casting garbage out of the
windows to keep railway lines clean.

BERLIN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Swiss chefs competing against
others from more than 30 countries and regions won the gold medal
at the 19th International Olympic Cooking Competition held here.
</P>
<P>
The results were announced Friday at the grand victory ceremony
following the five day contest competed for by about 1000 cooks.
</P>
<P>
The final result for the Swiss team was 554.4 points. Norway
ranked second with 546.57 points and Hong Kong got the bronze only
0.40 points behind Norway.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cuisine attracted a lot of tasters including overseas
Chinese as well as foreigners.
</P>
<P>
However, because the judges were experts on Western food, they
knew next to nothing about Chinese cooking and they judged Chinese
cooking by the standards for Western food.
</P>
<P>
The results for the Chinese team -- three bronze medals in
single items of cold dishes, bread baking and frying -- showed
that more efforts were needed by Chinese cooks in popularizing
their food in the West.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Warrant for Graf's Father Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The arrest warrant was lifted
surprisingly by the German local court on Friday after Steffi
Graf's father was jailed for 13 months.
</P>
<P>
Started its trial on tax evasion from September 5, the local
court of Landgericht Mannheim decided that both Peter Graf and tax
advisor Joachim Eckardt could be bailed out on 3 million (2
million U.S. dollars) and 300,000 marks (200,000 dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Presiding judge Joachim Plass said the decision was made
because both the accused were considered of no intention to escape
from the trial, although they had to report to the authorities
twice a week and were banned from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the procuratorate was in a different mood and had
requested the local court not to lift the warrant until the higher
court of the Oberlandesgericht Kahlsruhe made its rule.
</P>
<P>
Both older Graf and Eckardt were accused of evading tax of 19.6
million marks (13.3 million dollars) as they failed to declare
Steffi Graf's income of 42 million marks (28 million dollars) from
1989 to 1993 through advertising and match bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Graf's father and Eckardt were arrested in August and September
last year respectively, both faced sentences of up to 10 years in
prison if convicted.

LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Spaniard Sergi Bruguera was
defeated by Swedish unknown player at the quarterfinal stage of
the England Tennis Open in Bournemouth, England on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera, twice French Open champion, blew his 5-1 lead in the
final set, a repetition of the first one where he lost five points
in a row from a 5-2 lead to Magnus Norman.
</P>
<P>
On a disputed baseline call, Bruguera was given a warning for
his verbal obscenity. Despite his lead 5-3 in the first set, he
then blew all the way with wild and angry shots to concede the
first set.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the second set, Bruguera displayed the other side
of his talents in the court by winning 11 of the next 13 games to
lead 5-7, 6-1 and 5-1 for his first semifinal of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, Swedish Norman found his rhythm in the last moments by
varifying his attacks from either wing with groundstrokes and
approach shots.
</P>
<P>
Norman was in higher spirits when he emerged as the final
winner, saying "this is the biggest win of my career, the biggest
name I have beaten, and I would never dreamed of beating Sergi
like this, especially not on clay."

NEW YORK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average soared to its new record today as two new economic reports
quelled concerns about inflation and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rose 66.58 points to 5,838.52, smashing its previous
best close, 5,778.00, set May 22. For the week, Wall Street's
best-known indicator climbed 178.66 points, a gain of more than 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rally also boosted the Standard &AMP; Poor's list of 500 larger
companies to its first new high since May, rising 9.41 to 680.54.
The NYSE's composite index rose 3.97 to 363.70, just 4 cents shy
of its all-time best.
</P>
<P>
The government reported earlier today that the August consumer
price index edged up just 0.1 percent and retail sales rose by
only 0.2 percent. Both were below analyst expectation and caused
bond prices to soar, pushing the interest rate yield on the
30-year Treasury bond below 7 percent for the first time in two
weeks.

<P>
MACAO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China beat South Korea 3-1 to
snatch the first victory at the World Women's Volleyball Grand
Prix preliminary leg here on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
China, silver medalist at the Atlanta Olympic Games this year,
won the first set comfortably 15-6 but had to stage a dramatic
comeback before winning the second set 16-14.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women rallied from 4-12 behind to level the score
at 14-all as Chinese coach Lang Ping replaced the setter with
teenager Zhu Yunying to set up quick attacks.
</P>
<P>
After losing the third set 11-15, China relentlessly took
advantage of the defensive mistakes of the opponents and never
looked back on way to the 15-5 win in the last set.
</P>
<P>
Ace spiker Sun Yue led the Chinese scorers with 12 points,
followed by Wu Yongmei at 10. The most South Korean points came
from Kim Nam-Soon with 11.
</P>
<P>
Coach Lang Ping said, "We performed quite well today, with
service and blocking exceptionally good."
</P>
<P>
South Korean coach Kim Cheol-Yong said the Chinese service gave
too much pressure on South Korea's defence, which contributed much
to their loss.
</P>
<P>
In the other match, Brazil overcame a first-set deficit to
defeat Russia 14-16, 15-10, 15-7 and 15-12 in a hard and
aggressive match.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian head coach Bernardo Rezende said, "Even though our
blocks were not ideal, we had good serves. I am happy with this
victory and feel that the team played well overall."
</P>
<P>
Rezende's Russian counterpart Nikolai Karpol said, "There are
new players in the team which need more international experience.
We had inadequate receptions and Brazil blocked too well."

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Dips to 2.1 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Annual inflation rate in
Britain fell to 2.1 percent last month from 2.2 percent in July,
but the underlying inflation rate was stuck at 2.8 percent for the
fourth month running, Official figures published today shows.
</P>
<P>
According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), retail
prices rose 0.5 percent last month after a 0.4 percent fall in
July.
</P>
<P>
City analysts were disappointed that the overall annual rate,
which includes all items, had shown only a modest decline, as many
had expected a fall to two percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the underlying rate, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, failed again to make any progress towards the
government target of 2.5 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
Seasonal foods made the biggest contribution to the improvement
of the overall annual rate, with prices rising by 5.3 percent
between July and August compared to a sharp increase of 13.1
percent last year after the long dry summer.
</P>
<P>
Housing costs also pushed inflation downward. A fall in
mortgage interest payments canceled rising property value, the
ONS said.
</P>
<P>
The only upwards pressure on overall prices came from a 2.6
percent increase in motoring costs during August. This was largely
due to a sharp rise in petrol prices and an increase in the
selling price of second-hand cars.
</P>
<P>
The inflation figures left City economists warning that any cut
in interest rates from their current level of 5.75 percent could
boost inflation.

<HEADLINE> Liu Huaqing Praises Chirac for His China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of
the Central Military Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
today praised French President Jacques Chirac for adopting a
friendly and strategically wise policy towards China.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette
in Paris, Liu said that China is expecting President Chirac to
visit Beijing next year, which he said would surely have a deep
impact on Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that China and France have overturned an
unhappy page in their relations caused by France's sale of
armaments to Taiwan a few years ago, and bilateral cooperations
are fully developing in political, economic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the two countries have begun resuming
cooperations in military field.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that President Jacques Chirac has reiterated
France's promise of not to sell weapons to Taiwan any more, and
French-Chinese relations have enjoyed "a big jump forward" since
Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng made a successful visit to France
in April.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France is willing to push forward its
military cooperations with China, and that Paris calls for the
abolition of EU arms embargo on China.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China hopes its relations with France will not be
bothered by such a problem as arms sale to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Liu and de Charette both agreed that China and France should
strengthen their contact over major international issues.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Leaders of Two Major Greek Parties Hold Televised Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister and
leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement Costas Simitis and
main opposition New Democracy leader Miltiadis Evert held a
televised debate tonight on domestic and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The debate, first of its kind in Greece, was broadcast
nation-wide by all television channels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on national issues and Greek-Turkish relations, Evert
criticized Simitis for lowering the flag on the Imia Islet during
a military standoff between two neighboring countries in January,
adding that he would have searched for alternative solutions.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the prime minister emphasised that he would follow
the same tactics on the Imia crisis again so as not to fall into
what he described as "Turkey's trap of direct dialogue between the
two countries". The Greek government has maintained that the
country's sovereign right is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the economy, Simitis stressed that his party was
aiming for development with social justice and an improvement of
the state's services for the citizens. He added that the
convergence program with EU will continue and said discussion on
its renegotiation will begin when the issue is raised by other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Evert said, however, he would renegotiate the programme and
noted that growth is the means for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cyprus issue, the main opposition party leader
predicted a slackening in U.S. interest after the U.S. elections
in november, while Simitis estimated that Cyprus' entry into the
European Union will help in the search for a solution, although he
added diplomatic efforts from all sides are needed for this to
take place.
</P>
<P>
The debate took place when the last opinion polls before the
September 22 general elections showed the ruling party running
neck and neck with the main opposition party.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Campaigns for Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson on
Friday told black leaders that the real battle in the elections
will be for control of Congress, not just the White House.
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leader Jackson told participants at the annual
convention of the Congressional Black Caucus, "This thing, to me,
is a package deal."
</P>
<P>
Jackson called on blacks to rally together and take back
leadership from the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
He also warned blacks against being swayed by overtures from
the Republican Party, particularly vice presidential nominee Jack
Kemp and retired General Colin Powell, referring to them as
"bookends" used to hide the Republican agenda.
</P>
<P>
Jackson warned blacks against staying away from the ballot box
in November in a "cynical" protest against any single issue.
</P>
<P>
An outspoken critic of the new welfare reform law, Jackson
expressed his dissatisfaction at the Democratic National
Convention in Chicago last month.
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the Democratic Party should be judged by its
"cumulative score," not by individual issues.

<HEADLINE> White House Says It Will Judge Iraq on Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The White House, in
responding to Iraq's statement that it would suspend its military
challenges to allied no-fly zones, said today it would judge
Baghdad on its actions, not its words.
</P>
<P>
"The president himself has said it is actions that speak louder
than words and we'll be looking at actions not statements from
Baghdad," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Defense Department said that the Iraqi statement
was "an encouraging move."
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is an encouraging move toward reducing tensions
in the Gulf if his (Iraq President Saddam Hussein's) words are
followed by actions," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said earlier today it would halt its attacks on U.S. and
allied warplanes flying over its north and south as of midnight
local time (2000 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"The Revolutionary Command Council has decided today to suspend
our military reaction (until further notice) to the parallel lines
("no-fly" zones) which are not set on any legitimate basis in
international law or (U.N.) Security Council resolutions, as of
2400 local time," the Iraqi News Agency (INA) said, quoting a
spokesman for the Revolutionary Command Council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq made the statement after the United States sent a second
aircraft carrier to the Middle East Thursday, expanding American
firepower in the region as the United States is preparing for a
new attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department officials said the United States has
significantly strengthening its military capability in the
Middle East in the face of Iraq's defiance of U.S warning.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Iraqis fired another three surface-to-air
missiles at allied patrolling aircraft over southern Iraq in two
consecutive days, the officials said.
