TROUBLED POWER SYSTEMS DIVISION AT GE IS NOW A SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Five years ago, Robert Nardelli took over
GE's troubled Power Systems Division in this upstate city.
</P>
<P>
   Power Systems had a profit of $700 million on sales of $6.4
billion. But the outlook for the division was anything but
optimistic. The market for turbines and generators was stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Schenectady's economy is still hurting, but Nardelli's division
is a success story in a company that has been remarkable in its own
right for growth and profitability.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the division is expected to post profits of $1.7
billion on sales of $9.7 billion. Nardelli is talked about as a
possible successor to GE Chairman Jack Welch, one of the most
admired businessmen in the world. Welch is scheduled to retire at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nardelli turned the Power Systems business practically on its
head. ``You can either be victimized or be very proactive in
shaping the market,'' Nardelli said in a wide-ranging interview at
the division's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Like Welch, his mentor, Nardelli is excited about business. He
gets animated when he recites numbers and talks about the
power-generating industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers speak for the whole strategy,'' Nardelli said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's on the short list to succeed Welch. Nardelli,
51, is said to be in the running alongside Jeffrey R. Immelt,
43-year-old head of GE's medical systems business, and W. James
Mcnerney Jr., 50, head of the aircraft-engine business. Nardelli is
considered a dark horse candidate largely because of his age. Welch
is said to favor someone closer to his age when he took over 18
years ago at 45.
</P>
<P>
   Nardelli, who lives in a $1.4 million home in Colonie, won't say
much about the succession issue, but few who know him doubt his
competitive nature and ambition.
</P>
<P>
   When Nardelli came to Power Systems, its business was almost
exclusively turbines and generators for the utility industry. Now,
Power Systems has lots more pieces of equipment it can sell. As a
result, it has developed a lucrative global service business to
operate the equipment for its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shape the market, instead of the market shaping us,''
Nardelli said. Stock analysts who follow GE practically rave about
the unit's performance now that it's a $9.7 billion business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doing astro-phenomenonally well,'' said Nicholas Heymann
an analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Nardelli is ``extremely successful,'' said Kent Newcomb, analyst
at A.G. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Nardelli's strategy was to cut hundreds of jobs over his
years here. He had a reputation for toughness at his previous job
as president and chief executive officer of GE Transportation
Systems in Erie, Pa., which makes locomotives. He revived that
business in part by cutting jobs and outsourcing work.
</P>
<P>
   Nardelli faced a dismal U.S. market for utilities when he came
here. Utilities in the United States weren't buying much new
equipment, Nardelli recalled. Energy deregulation was still on the
horizon, and the utilities were stalling their buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The utility executives didn't really know how much or what kinds
of equipment they'd need, and they didn't want to make the wrong
purchasing decisions and be stuck with costs later.
</P>
<P>
   Nardelli didn't know the energy business then, but in his 10th
posting in a GE job he'd learned the drill. Go in and assess the
situation and see what needs to be changed. Communicate those
changes and take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, we were pretty focused on gear,'' Nardelli said. The
company sold gas turbines for customers who use natural gas as an
energy source, and steam turbines for customers who rely on coal,
oil or nuclear power. That was it _ a turbine to match your fuel
source to help turn your fuel into energy.
</P>
<P>
   Not much thought was given, he said, to finding out what else
the customer might want in additional products, services or
consulting. It was: ``Yep, here's your order.'' And that posture
made the company too vulnerable to economic ups and downs, he said,
both in business sectors and in geographic markets.
</P>
<P>
   So he added other products to GE's toolbox _ often by buying
other companies, entering into joint ventures or distributions
agreement. The company made more than 30 acquisitions and embarked
on a course that created a global empire. It bought one company in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   GE Power Systems headquarters is still in Schenectady, but its
business interests are served from many countries.
</P>
<P>
   So even as Power Systems has grown, Schenectady hasn't regained
many of the jobs lost in firings earlier in the decade. Power
Systems' local employment was as high as 7,700 in early 1995. After
3,400 jobs were eliminated, some 4,300 people now work for Power
Systems locally, among the overall GE work force of 9,000 in this
region.
</P>
<P>
   But customers and shareholders seem to be gaining.
</P>
<P>
   Now GE can sell turbines up and down a range of sizes to meet
the needs of the biggest industrial customers to smaller business
sites. Cities grappling with temporary power shortages or rock
concert promoters planning huge events can rent portable energy
sources for short-term use. Soon, homeowners will be able to get
dishwasher-size fuel cells made by local Plug Power to create all
the electricity a home needs.
</P>
<P>
   And Power Systems is now locking customers into long-term
service contracts, generating an additional profit stream.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment sales tend to create service sales, and then service
sales generate more equipment sales _ and so the cycle goes on,
Nardelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Heymann said, service is higher profit. Building
hardware is not where the big profits are in the market, he said.
Across the corporation, in fact, GE is pumping service sectors for
new sources of income, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Power Systems was in the midst of this transformation, the
U.S. energy market bounced back in the last couple of years. Energy
deregulation became a reality, and utility companies became clearer
on what they needed to buy. And they got more eager to buy too, by
1998, as hot weather and brownouts created more demand for power.
</P>
<P>
   Now things are smoking, Heymann said. Power Systems has plenty
of orders to carry it into 2002, he said, and is far ahead of
competitors Westinghouse, Mitsubishi, Siemens and Alstom.
</P>
<P>
   Power Systems, he said, also is doing well implementing GE's
productivity improvement program, called Six Sigma. That's an
initiative that spans the corporation, and is intended to help
employees cut waste and steer customer requests into GE products
and services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not all of Nardelli's decisions were popular as they came
along, especially among residents of the region. Some work was
outsourced, for example, to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Nardelli defends that decision by saying that GE risked losing
some customer business if it didn't outsource, and instead, waited
to gear up U.S. supplies and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   GE officials said the same logic works looking at a recent
string of global acquisitions in the gas-turbine business. The gas
turbine business is up, as more global customers select cleaner,
more efficient natural gas over other fuels. Gas turbines are made
in North Carolina and Europe, not in Schenectady, which focuses on
steam turbines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an upsurge in gas turbine orders can indirectly prompt
orders for generators made in Schenectady, GE pointed out, as well
as boosting the health of the overall business.
</P>
<P>
   Service operations, though, were headquartered in Atlanta, not
Schenectady. That decision meant the relocation of 350 jobs from
Schenectady to Atlanta. The new service business needed a brand-new
environment, Nardelli said, and Atlanta offered more convenient
flight routes to international markets. The decision, Nardelli
said, ``wasn't so much for my people as for our customers. You've
got to make sure the customer doesn't find it so difficult to visit
us.''

COMPUTER MAY SOON REPLACE THE PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL COPPOLA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's been rotary and touch tone, cordless and cell and a pair
of Spaghetti-O's cans on a string. So what's next?
</P>
<P>
   It may sound strange, but the home computer is fast becoming the
telephone of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, users are booting up their personal computers and
making long distance PC-to-PC phone calls over the Internet for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they have to have a computer and Internet access,
which generally means paying monthly fees that can range from about
$10 to $50 for Internet access. But most users were doing that
already.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, some are attaching inexpensive Netcams and
communicating face-to-face with faraway friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   To start making phone calls and bypassing the usual
long-distance telephone charges, all you need is a decent
multimedia PC, a connection to the Internet (a 28.8K modem will do,
but 56K or cable modems are preferable) and a $10 microphone.
</P>
<P>
   For the most natural conversation it's also best to have a
full-duplex sound card in your machine and to wear headphones so
the person you're calling doesn't hear his voice echo back through
the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Once your hardware is in place, you and a friend simply need to
download an Internet telephony program off the Web and register
yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there are many programs that are
completely free to choose from, including MediaRing Talk
(http://www.mediaring.com), FreeTel (http://www.freetel.inter.net/)
and NetMeeting (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/netmeetinLine is
overdrawn g/), so you can experiment to see which has the best
voice quality and comes with the bells and whistles you desire.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites also feature detailed cyber instructions to help new
users install and operate software.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the best piece of advice for optimum results is to
make sure your computer meets the product's system requirements
before you start to download.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Buckley is the product manager of Professional Services at
VocalTec, which offers a telephony software called Internet Phone
(http://www.vocaltec.com). According to Buckley, telephony software
usage is increasing. Some 2 million people have downloaded Internet
Phone since VocalTec launched it in 1996, and currently about
450,000 people use it on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet Phone is not completely free users must
purchase the software for $50 after a free two-week trial period
Buckley said he's seen a tremendous growth in callers over just
three years, especially among those who want to reach out and
kibitz with family in distant places.
</P>
<P>
   As with any telephony software that relies on the Internet,
Buckley said, ``Voice quality can vary, depending on the network
that you're using.''
</P>
<P>
   Audio may be clear during one call, but online traffic jams can
produce packets of choppy sound that get delayed. However, Buckley
said, most people are willing to tolerate changes in a familiar
voice from call to call as long as it means saving a bundle on
their phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   Those are Adnan Zia's sentiments exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Zia, who lives in Toronto, has been making long-distance phone
calls to Pakistan, Canada and the U.S. from his home computer for a
year now and he said he will continue using the technology as long
as it's free.
</P>
<P>
   Zia doesn't have any super-fancy, turbocharged hardware. He
makes his calls using ``an average Pentium PC'' that's almost a
year old and is hooked up to a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   He bumped into telephony technology while he was looking through
the different program files included in his Microsoft Office 97
suite and found NetMeeting, one of the first tele/videoconferencing
programs to appear on the scene, about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He then spoke to friends about it and learned they already had
been making computer phone calls for some time. A banner ad on a
Pakistani newspaper finally led him to the MediaRing Talk software,
which he thinks is the best program he's tested so far.
</P>
<P>
   To dial out with MediaRing, he simply clicks on a person listed
in his ``speed dial''-like drop-down menu. Other programs allow you
to type in a friend's e-mail address or his personal Web ``phone
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Zia usually sends an e-mail to his folks in Pakistan to
designate a convenient time to call, but impromptu calls are
welcome, too his computer will produce a light beep, and a dialog
box will pop up identifying who's on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The MediaRing window resembles a floating cell phone on your
desktop and, like similar products, the software sports a slew of
useful features. A handy answering machine keeps a log of all
incoming calls and stores virtual ``Voizmail'' messages, while a
pop-up window for text-based chat is just a click away when the
Internet gets congested and calling clarity disintegrates.
</P>
<P>
   Zia said, ``It's a pretty cool software.''
</P>
<P>
   Behaviorally speaking, it seems impossible that generations will
ever be able to unplug the device they have grown up gabbing on,
slamming down and noodling around their fingers, but Internet
telephony and videoconferencing are pointing us down a new
technological road whether we're ready or not.
</P>
<P>
   According to Buckley, at least, they indicate the trend of the
future: convergence, where everything from phone to data to cable
TV will enter the home through the same pipeline and the quality of
voice and video via the Internet will start to improve.

PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY, ONCE BOOMING, IS NOW IN PERIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TICONDEROGA, N.Y. _ The public schools in Ticonderoga are only
five miles from the massive International Paper mill that churns
out copier paper and supports the local economy, but teachers and
administrators last year used paper made in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper executives weren't surprised when they found
out. ``It could just as easily have been Indonesia,'' noted Donna
Wadsworth, spokeswoman for the IP mill in Ticonderoga.
</P>
<P>
   Once a booming industry that helped define New York's North
Country, the pulp and paper industry is in peril. Even as the
region begins to enjoy what some label an economic recovery, the
outlook for workers making paper and pulp is bleak.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 positions have been cut or are being eliminated at the
International Paper plants in Ticonderoga and Corinth, reducing the
combined work force to around 1,170. And 300 workers in St.
Lawrence County will soon lose their jobs making glossy, coated
paper unless a new owner is found for the mill in Newton Falls.
</P>
<P>
   But all the blame can't be placed on Indonesia, Brazil and the
global economy because managers and executives have missed
opportunities that could have put the industry on a different
course.
</P>
<P>
   Blame a manufacturing mindset more geared to production than
profitability, some say, or a slowness among some companies to
shift into new product lines. Analysts also say that instead of
attempting to specialize in niche markets, domestic paper companies
tried to compete with developing countries on volume.
</P>
<P>
   The industry isn't dead yet, but to save it, major resuscitation
efforts must start now, these analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The paper industry has been in decline for most of this decade:
Paper jobs numbered more than 40,000 in New York in 1990. Now,
thousands more of the 32,000 or so paper-related jobs remaining in
New York _ comprising about 3.5 percent of the state's
manufacturing work force _ are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   New York's economy _ even part of its ecosystem _ relies far
more heavily on the health of the paper industry than industry
employment numbers alone reveal, paper's promoters said.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the situation, start with the jobs themselves.
Working in a pulp or paper mill isn't glamorous. It's hot and humid
and noisy near the assembly lines of machines that squeeze vast
amounts of water from pulp to produce giant rolls of dry paper.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who run the paper machines, work in the business
offices, package the finished goods and drive the forklifts in the
warehouses are earning solid middle-class incomes at union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Many mill workers earn $50,000 to $60,000 a year with a high
school education, said Kevin King, executive vice president of the
Empire State Forest Products Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best money in the area,'' agreed Jim Jenkins, who
works at IP's Hudson River Mill in Corinth. His wife, Angela, also
works at the mill, which has concentrated on making coated, glossy
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, only professionals and employees of Niagara Mohawk
Power Corp. can match the $14- to $19-an-hour earnings the mill
provides them, said Jenkins, a father of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared, not just for our mill but for our children,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the loss of paper-mill jobs in places like Corinth or
Ticonderoga can be even more devastating than the seepage of
manufacturing jobs from cities such as Schenectady and Troy.
</P>
<P>
   The July unemployment rate in Essex County was 5.7 percent,
compared with 3.3 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively, in
Schenectady and Rensselaer counties. Smaller industrial cities in
the area at least have more than one source of manufacturing
employment, even if the overall number of industry jobs is
declining.
</P>
<P>
   Paper mills are a different creature _ often the only source of
manufacturing jobs in the remote river towns they inhabit. In the
early days of the industry, a century or more ago, King said, it
made sense for the paper companies to put mills in spots that were
isolated: up in the woods and along the rivers and lakes that could
provide the enormous amounts of water needed in the pulp mixing.
</P>
<P>
   The paper industry has come a long way in operating
environmentally cleaner mills, helping to erase a dated image of
mill towns as grubby places, said Ticonderoga town Supervisor Mike
Connery.
</P>
<P>
   But not many industries fit in the wilderness. Manufacturers of
other goods don't have any economic incentive to put big plants in
places like northern Saratoga, Essex, or Warren County, King noted.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that new warehouse jobs are moving into Saratoga
County, from Ace Hardware and Target Department stores, Jenkins
noted, but they pay more like $7 to $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Paper mill jobs, once lost, probably can't be replaced, at least
in this generation, experts say, making the spread of rural poverty
a real threat in upstate communities where paper has been king.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs outside the mills are affected, too. International Paper
estimates that each mill job creates enough economic activity to
support five other jobs in the community.
</P>
<P>
   More financial pressure on paper and forest products companies
could also prompt them to sell off large tracts of forest land,
rather than holding the property for selective cutting and having
to pay property taxes and other carrying costs, noted Hugh Canham,
an expert in forest economics at the State University of New York's
College of Environmental Science and Forestry at Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be a regional concern,'' said Canham.

 &HT;    Mark McKinnon contemplates spending money earned from creating
Bush's TV ads
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In his basement offices, Mark McKinnon is
wrapping up work on the answer to the most perplexing question of
the presidential campaign: How can George W. Bush possibly spend
the giant buckets o' cash he is collecting for his White House bid?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as it is to too many questions about
turn-of-the-century America, is television.
</P>
<P>
   And McKinnon _ former lead singer for Lazlo Frink and the Odd
Sofa Review featuring the Lazlettes, former short-term jailbird,
former media guru for big-name Democrats _ is the man making the TV
ads that will mold Bush's national persona as well as consume much
of his political cash. So far, that is $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   For McKinnon, 44, spending the Bush money is the latest stop in
a magical mystery tour that has taken him from music to politics to
swearing off politics to media man for the front-running
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my political flame was completely burned out, but he
reignited the pilot,'' McKinnon said of Bush. ``I genuinely believe
in him, and that was a hard thing for me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the just-north-of-downtown basement offices of his Maverick
Media, which exists for the sole purpose of making TV ads for the
Bush campaign, McKinnon has a firm grip on the ups and downs of his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Up: He's working for a front-running candidate with gobs of
money and a winning way.
</P>
<P>
   Down: Up frequently foreshadows down. ``One thing I'm worried
about is we've got nowhere to go but down, and the TV is going to
go up and we could go down, and everybody is going to say it's
because of the TV,'' McKinnon said. ``There is no way we are going
to put TV up and the numbers are going to go up. They can't go any
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of following Bush around with a 30-year-old Bell
and Howell film camera, McKinnon has almost all the shots he needs
(though the campaign recently staged a phony speech in downtown
Austin for a more controlled atmosphere). Most of the ads _
including responses to anticipated attacks _ are in the can. A
schedule, carrying through the primary season, has been set, though
McKinnon would not reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   It's all kind of amazing to McKinnon, whose financial rewards
from the campaign will begin to flow when the ad buys begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, if you would have told me I'd be making
commercials for a Republican I'd have been in shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a converted Republican,'' said
McKinnon, who never worked for a GOP candidate before the Bush 1998
gubernatorial campaign. ``I'm a Bush man.''
</P>
<P>
   The long, strange trip
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon has navigated a peculiar path to the Bush camp. Born in
Colorado, he ran away from home just before his senior year in high
school to get to Nashville, Tenn., and Kris Kristofferson, who had
been impressed by a band fronted by McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kristofferson sort of put up with me, and I just hung out with
him and hung out at the studio and wrote songs,'' McKinnon said.
``Then I decided I was going to spend the rest of my life trying to
be Bob Dylan or Kris Kristofferson.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon later returned to Denver and completed high school
before heading back to Nashville to pursue the musical dream,
complete with dishwashing for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a bunch of songs. I had songs cut by, like, the Miss
Mississippi 1964 beauty queen. It entered and left the charts at
160,'' he said. ``There was a song that Elvis was going to cut and
then he died the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Music brought McKinnon to Texas when he won a songwriting
contest at the 1975 Kerrville Folk Festival. A year later, he moved
to Austin and lived off gigs at a variety of now-defunct venues.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his intellectual clock ticking, McKinnon decided to
check out the local big state university. He enrolled at the
University of Texas and became editor of The Daily Texan.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors looked for Iranian students who had disrupted a
campus speech by a Shah ally, they asked McKinnon to turn over
unpublished photos. He refused, and spent a day in jail until the
case moved forward without the photos.
</P>
<P>
   Apropos for McKinnon's long, strange trip, the prosecutor who
had him jailed is now a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him and wave at him all the time across the street,''
McKinnon said. ``I bet he still doesn't know why he has a flat tire
every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   With a UT education, if not a degree, under his belt, McKinnon
moved on to politics.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop was a house that served as headquarters for
then-Texas state Sen. Lloyd Doggett's 1984 U.S. Senate race.
Inside, McKinnon encountered some folks heading for the big time.
Cajun James Carville was the campaign manager and Paul Begala was a
top hand. Both later hit the big time after signing on with
then-Arkansas governor Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the rascal like a wayward stepchild,'' Begala said of
McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   Begala believes Bush may be McKinnon's little red sports car.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a friend, I think maybe it's a bit of a mid-life crisis,''
he said of McKinnon's current job.
</P>
<P>
   For McKinnon, the Doggett campaign led to a stint as a press
aide to Democratic Texas Gov. Mark White and a string of Democratic
candidates, including Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer and Texas Gov.
Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1987 Roemer win, McKinnon moved to New York to work
with political media mogul David Sawyer's firm. He returned to
Austin in 1990 and became communications director for Richards' bid
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. He left after Richards
won the primary, moving on to 17 other clients he had across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, McKinnon, whose operation was folded in with Public
Strategies, an Austin-based consulting firm, was very good at what
he did and very unhappy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd learned how to manipulate the system, and I used all the
tricks of the trade to help elect my candidates,'' he wrote in
Texas Monthly. ``There's a bottom line to political consulting:
winning. Nothing else matters.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon went corporate, concentrating his talents on Public
Strategies' non-political clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was good,'' he said of not dealing with candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The seduction of Mark McKinnon
</P>
<P>
   Life was so good that McKinnon was doing things like dining with
his Public Strategies cronies and Bush in the fall of 1997. From
afar, McKinnon was intrigued by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a Republican governor who was for things instead of
against everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McKinnon headed to the dinner ``prepared not to
like him.'' He failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disarmed almost instantaneously by his humanity, by his
integrity. I expected to meet a great politician. I just was
unprepared to meet such a great human being,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, McKinnon was approached to do the ads for Bush's
1998 re-election campaign. His coming-out party came at the GOP
state convention in June 1998. McKinnon strolled into the Tarrant
County Convention Center, surveyed the crowd and joked about
needing a flak jacket.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush bio-video he prepared was warmly received. The best
reaction came to a scene, shot during a Bush fishing trip, in which
the governor doffs his cap after catching a big one and then puts
the fish, instead of the cap, on his head.
</P>
<P>
   In that simple image of a governor acting goofy, according to
McKinnon admirers, is evidence of his talent. Begala says McKinnon
makes ads that connect on a personal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands politics is an affair of the heart,'' Begala
said of his buddy on the other side. ``If you grab them by the
heart, their head will follow. Voting is a powerful act of
self-definition. It can't be devoid of intellectual content, but it
goes to something more important. It goes to emotion and values.
Mark is comfortable speaking that language. That's why he is so
comfortable with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But Begala sees a potential point of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has surprised me with his caution, his timidity. He is
playing not to lose. A classic front-runner,'' Begala said. ``Mark
is a throw-deep kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, McKinnon helped concoct ads for U.S. Sen. Bob Krueger's
longshot effort to hold the seat to which he had been appointed by
Richards. Krueger threw deep. The Shakespearean scholar donned dark
sunglasses and a leather jacket and poked fun at his own dull image
by appearing on an ad saying, ``Was it Shakespeare who said, `Hasta
la vista, baby?'''
</P>
<P>
   The ad got a lot of attention. Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison
got the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, undefeated as a GOP adman, McKinnon is content being in a
place he never expected to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character and independence are really much more important to
me than ideological purity,'' he said. ``Because those who are most
ideologically pure are most often hostage to those interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He proceeds with the heartfelt wishes of his old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he fires him,'' Begala said of Bush. ``If there is
anything I can do I'd be happy to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The big gig
</P>
<P>
   The Bush ad campaign for the primary season is mostly in the can
and ready to run. McKinnon said it is long on Bush and short on
production gimmicks. Thanks to who he is and where he's from, Bush
doesn't have to spend much time introducing himself; he can quickly
move to his message, McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that where he is going is more important than where
he has been, and that's what people want to hear about,'' McKinnon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is a schedule in place, changes could be forced by
well-heeled GOP foe Steve Forbes, who Bush officials expect to come
out early with a full-frontal TV assault on the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has reminded voters that Bush's unsuccessful 1995 attempt
to cut property taxes included a long list of proposed tax hikes. A
Bush ad featuring the candidate and defending the failed tax plan
is ready to air on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, McKinnon said, voters will see relatively simple ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people when they make political ads try to add
filters like logos and voice-overs. A lot of layers of things to
distract or influence viewers,'' he said. ``We try to take filters
away, particularly with Governor Bush because he is so good
completely unfiltered, one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon said he's striving for a documentary feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot of ribbons and bows,'' he said. ``The only way I can
really screw this up is if I forget to put film in the camera.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: INCREASINGLY, AMERICA'S SWEET TOOTH IS TIED TO
SOUR HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

<P>
   The American diet: how sweet it is. Far too sweet.
</P>
<P>
   That we load up with more sugar than ever is unquestionable _
156 pounds of added sugars per person last year, up from 144 pounds
in 1994, which in turn was up from 127 pounds in 1986. The average
American now consumes more than 20 teaspoons of added sugars a day,
twice the amount recommended by health experts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In our frenzy to cut back on fats (which, incidentally, we have
yet to do), we have turned to sugar with a vengeance as our
feel-good food. Our consumption of fructose alone has risen tenfold
since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Is all that sugar good for us? Growing evidence says an ever
louder no. By squeezing out more nutritious foods like fruits,
vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products that can help
to prevent disease, a high-sugar diet may be making an important
contribution to health problems like osteoporosis, cancer, high
blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease, not to mention the
time-honored association between sugary foods and tooth decay.
</P>
<P>
   And by contributing so many easy-to-consume empty calories to
our daily diets, added sugars are undoubtedly a major factor in the
precipitous rise in obesity among both children and adults. To make
matters worse, most heavily sweetened foods are also high-fat
foods.
</P>
<P>
   The mounting health concerns associated with a high-sugar diet
have prompted the Center for Science in the Public Interest to
petition the Food and Drug Administration to change food labels.
</P>
<P>
   The center, supported by dozens of leading health and nutrition
authorities, wants labels to list separately the grams of added
sugars in a serving of the food and to indicate how this amount
compares to intakes of added sugar recommended by bodies like the
World Health Organization and the United States Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades sugar has become a pervasive added ingredient
in many processed foods, including some that most people think are
good for them. These include fruit snacks, flavored yogurt, frozen
yogurt, granola bars, frozen fruit bars, juice drinks, sorbet, bran
and fruit muffins and breakfast cereals. Yet because food labels
now list only total sugars _ a combination of sugars naturally in
foods and those added by processors _ most people have no idea how
much extra sugar they consume. Looking at the ingredients list may
offer few clues to the amount of caloric sweeteners that have been
added to the product, since manufacturers can list separately items
like high-fructose corn syrup, honey, fruit syrup, molasses and
barley malt, and not ever use the word sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Sodas are the largest single source of added sugars _ 33 percent
of the total _ and recent studies have linked the frequent
consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks to obesity. People
apparently do not compensate for the excess calories they consume
as liquids as effectively as they do for the calories in solid
foods. One 12-ounce can of soda supplies 160 sweet calories, or 40
grams of sugar. Nearly a tenth of the calories consumed by American
teen-agers come from nutritionally empty soda, which they drink at
the expense of calcium-rich milk and vitamin-rich fruit juices. As
a result, many young Americans today are reaching the age of
maximum bone growth with bones highly prone to osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   The other major sources of added sugars are sweet baked goods
(cookies, cakes, pies, muffins), which account for 14 percent of
added sugars as well as lots of fat, and fruit drinks, which
account for 10 percent of added sugar. Dairy desserts like ice
cream and frozen yogurt are the source of 6 percent of added
sugars, candy 5 percent and breakfast cereals 4 percent, according
to the Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   A nutritionally sound diet should derive no more than 10 percent
of its calories from added sugar; American children now consume
nearly twice that amount. The average teen-ager derives 19 percent
of calories from added sugar, with the average boy consuming 34
teaspoons and the average girl consuming 24 teaspoons of added
sugar daily, according to Federal surveys. Younger children, too,
have diets far sweeter than desirable: 6- to 11-year-olds get 18
percent of their calories from added sugars.
</P>
<P>
   A high-sugar diet causes special problems for people with
so-called insulin resistance, who account for 10 percent to 25
percent of the population. When such people consume sugars and
refined starches, their bodies are forced to produce more than the
normal amount of insulin, which can eventually wear out the
pancreas and result in diabetes. Two recent Harvard studies have
linked diets high in sugars and refined starches to an increased
risk of developing diabetes. Insulin resistance is also associated
with high blood levels of triglycerides and low levels of
protective HDL-cholesterol, which increases their risk of a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The usual argument against listing added sugars on food labels
is that the human body makes no distinction between the sugars that
occur naturally in foods and those that are added in factories or
at the table. It processes all sugar in pretty much the same way,
whether it was formed in fruit as it ripened or was added when it
was canned.
</P>
<P>
   But this metabolic fact ignores important nutritional and health
concerns. The sugars naturally present in fruit and milk, for
example, come in a package laden with essential nutrients. The
sugar added to canned fruit or frozen yogurt brings in nothing but
calories. And if enough added sugar calories are present in a
person's diet, there is less room for the nutrient-rich foods that
can help to prevent serious chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   As things now stand, the consumer has no way to know how much
sugar was naturally present in a food or drink before it was
processed and how much sugar the manufacturer added. Look, for
example, at the nutrition information on a container of skim milk.
It states that an 8-ounce serving contains 11 grams of sugar, which
may create the impression that it is no worse for a person, in
terms of sugar content, than a sweetened breakfast cereal with the
same amount of sugar per serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sugar in milk (lactose) is put there by the cow, along
with lots of calcium, protein and other nutrients; the sugar in the
cereal (sucrose), which amounts to nearly a tablespoon of sugar,
was added by the manufacturer and serves only to dilute the
nutrient value of the grain, which contains little or no sugar.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most sweetened breakfast cereals have nearly four
teaspoons of sugar (14 or 15 grams) per serving, making them as
sweet as a dessert. Such cereals are most popular with children,
whose sweet tooth is primed very early in life by parents and
caretakers who offer them fruit juices (in place of milk or water),
sugar-coated cereals that are as sweet as candy, and sweet treats
like fruit roll-ups, which are especially damaging to teeth because
they are so sticky. Sweetened cereals are best used as a garnish
rather than as the main ingredient in the bowl. For additional
sweetening, a more nutritious alternative would be sliced fruit,
fresh berries or raisins.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, there is no caloric sweetener other
than molasses that is any more nutritious than sucrose (ordinary
table sugar). Although the body processes fructose more slowly than
sucrose, none of the commercially used sweeteners, including
high-fructose corn syrup, contain enough fructose to make a
significant difference to the body's need for insulin.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be fooled by products that claim to contain ``all
natural'' sweeteners. Added ingredients like brown sugar, raw
sugar, fruit sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, honey or maple syrup
are treated no differently from table sugar once they enter the
bloodstream.

   Lump in the Throat
</P>
<P>
   Q. What causes you to get a lump in your throat?
</P>
<P>
   A. If the ``lump'' is stress-related and does not involve
serious difficulty in swallowing, it is probably just an
exaggerated awareness of the epiglottis or spasms of muscles
surrounding the throat.
</P>
<P>
   After ruling out physical ailments that can cause the feeling of
a lump in the throat, like throat cancer or esophageal reflux, in
which some stomach contents are released upward, doctors call the
condition globus hystericus.
</P>
<P>
   Globus hystericus can be a small component of a larger set of
symptoms that psychiatrists call generalized anxiety disorder,
which may require psychiatric treatment or anti-anxiety drugs. But
for such a diagnosis, the sufferer would have multiple,
long-lasting symptoms from several of these groups: motor tension
(jumpiness, shakiness, etc.); hyperactivity of the autonomic
nervous system (sweating, pounding heart, clammy hands, dry mouth,
the lump in the throat, etc.); apprehensive expectation (fear,
rumination, anticipation of misfortune, etc.) and vigilance and
scanning, with results like distractibility, insomnia, etc.
</P>
<P>
   If you can identify the stress that leads to the lump, and it is
something as simple as a sad movie or a glimpse of an old boyfriend
or girlfriend, you can probably avoid the sensation by avoiding the
source of the stress or finding a better way to deal with stress,
like meditation, breathing exercises, yoga, etc.

HAND-TRANSPLANT PATIENT SHOW SIGNS OF PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky., N.J.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year after he received a new right hand and forearm in a
transplant operation in France, Clint Hallam of Australia has
gained a sufficient grip to ride a motorcycle and even write with a
pen, his doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   After the experimental transplant was performed on Sept. 23,
1998, many doctors predicted failure, saying a body would reject
the combination of skin and dozens of muscles, tendons, nerves and
blood vessels in the donor arm. They added that even if the foreign
tissue was accepted, Hallam's brain could not power nerves that had
been severed in a prison accident 14 years earlier, and the new arm
would be a useless stump.
</P>
<P>
   But substantial nerve regeneration has occurred, more is
expected in the months ahead, and Hallam, 49, has not experienced a
serious rejection reaction, said Dr. Earl Owen, the hand surgeon in
Sydney, Australia, who headed the international team that performed
the transplant in Lyons, France.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam's new hand has about 25 percent of normal grip strength
and the pinch grip between his index finger and thumb is good, Owen
said in a telephone interview last week, during a visit to Lyons to
review Hallam's progress in the last year. Hallam could not be
reached for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   If he continues to do well, the operation will prove to be the
world's first successful hand transplant.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Dr. Warren C. Breidenbach's team in Louisville, Ky.,
performed the first hand transplant in the United States, on
Matthew David Scott of Absecon, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Scott can bend his fingers and hand to grasp and release
objects, and can open doors, drive a car, and pick up and hold his
children, a spokeswoman for the Louisville team said. And he can
detect hot, cold and other sensations in much of his new left hand.
But the spokeswoman said he had ``reached a plateau in the function
and range of motion at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott has had three rejection episodes that were controlled by
drugs. He is expected to return to Louisville in about three months
for monitoring tests and possible surgery to loosen tendons to gain
more function and mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's experimental surgery in France, for which a team of
doctors was assembled from four countries and the patient flew
halfway around the world, was an effort with few rivals in the
annals of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam underwent extensive psychological testing in Australia
and France. But Owen's team was embarrassed to learn only at the
time of the transplant that Hallam had lost his hand and forearm in
a circular saw accident while in prison in New Zealand, and not in
a logging accident, as he told the doctors earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The postoperative care and rehabilitation have strained
relations between the doctors and Hallam, who travels frequently
and skips appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam now lives in Perth, Australia, and has not followed the
team's recommended schedule of exercise, rehabilitation, and blood
tests and skin biopsies to monitor rejection, Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he does go for physical therapy, Hallam suffered a
setback, his doctors believe, when he skipped supervised therapy
sessions while he traveled in Europe and the United States for
weeks instead of returning directly to Australia for such care.
</P>
<P>
   Communication between Hallam and the doctors is often by fax and
e-mail, and ``it is impossible to tell where the faxes originate
from,'' Owen said. For example, Hallam recently sent e-mail
messages to two members of the transplant team informing them that
he was considering a job with ``a charity organization'' in Las
Vegas, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Owen said he had been unable to reach Hallam to ask him to
``meet for a major follow-up'' when three members of the team from
France and Italy were in Sydney for a scientific meeting in late
August.
</P>
<P>
   In mapping the areas where a patient has feeling, doctors often
insure objectivity by blindfolding and misleading him, saying, for
example, that they are going to apply a light touch when they stick
a pin into a hand. In Hallam's case, the doctors also put a curtain
in front of him because, as Owen has said, ``We do not believe this
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors used such objective measures in Hallam's recent
checkups, the last in Perth on Sept. 14, when a skin biopsy showed
no evidence of rejection and confirmation of an improved range of
hand movements, Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   The new hand has settled into a normal position instead of being
bent with respect to the wrist. Muscles powered by the ulnar nerve,
which is in the hand below the pinky finger, are starting to
function. For example, Hallam could weakly move his little finger
outwardly.
</P>
<P>
   Sensation reached his fingertips at eight months and has
improved since. Standard tests of nerve function show that he can
detect a doctor touching his hand and exerting pressure on it, and
can discriminate hot and cold sensations in all fingers and thumb.
But the degree of sensory feeling in the digits varies.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam has stopped taking steroids and now takes two
anti-rejection drugs. A serious rejection reaction can occur at any
time after any transplant. The immune suppression resulting from
the anti-rejection therapy and mild diabetes leaves Hallam at
increased risk of infection.
</P>
<P>
   Owen's team plans to do four more hand transplants. No suitable
donors became available during Owen's current weeklong visit to
Lyons, but a number of potential donors were available while he was
at home in Australia, he said.

   &UR; Salamander Courtships &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In human courtship, some males say it with flowers. Plethodon
jordani, a type of terrestrial salamander, is more direct, if less
romantic: when a male pitches woo, it places a chemical compound
from a gland under its chin directly on a female's nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   That compound belongs to a class called pheromones, which help
one creature identify others of the same species, their sex and
whether they are ready to mate (in short, they are nature's love
potions). While the effects of pheromones on behavior have been
widely studied, few of the compounds in vertebrates have been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   A research team led by a scientist at the University of Chicago
has now identified the main component of the salamander pheromone.
The researchers, whose work was reported in the journal Science,
also showed that this component, a protein, directly affects how
receptive the female is.
</P>
<P>
   Males use the pheromone during a phase of courtship,
``tail-straddling walk,'' in which the happy couple strolls, not
arm in arm, but with the female straddling the male from behind.
Using males whose chin glands had been removed, researchers tested
the effect of the protein during the walk by placing it on the
females' nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   Females who got the protein spent a shorter time straddling the
males than did those who got a control substance. And in
salamanders, at least, less time spent strolling with a male means
that the female is more receptive.

</P>
<P>
   There may be a bright side to air pollution, after all.
Scientists from Italy and the United States have shown that organic
compounds from some pollutants can increase the number of water
droplets in clouds. More droplets mean the clouds are brighter,
reflecting more sunlight, and as a result less light reaches the
earth below, making it cooler. And that may offset some of the
effects of global warming, at least locally.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds are created when water vapor condenses on tiny aerosol
particles to form droplets. How likely this is to occur depends
partly on the surface tension of the water _ the lower the surface
tension, the easier it is for droplets to form.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who reported on their study in the journal
Nature, collected water from fog _ actually ground-level clouds _
in the Po River valley in northern Italy. They found that organic
compounds in the water, from sources like the burning of
agricultural waste, act like soap, reducing the surface tension by
up to 30 percent, as compared with pure water.
</P>
<P>
   They calculated that the number of droplets would increase by 20
percent, with the result that 1 percent more sunlight is reflected
away from the earth. That would be enough to affect temperatures
locally or perhaps regionally, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Killer in the Sky &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has given a lot of attention to killer asteroids in
recent years, and people who work in science have followed suit.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is coordinating a
project to identify up to 90 percent of asteroids with a diameter
of one kilometer or more that are approaching Earth. Asteroids of
that size could cause a civilization-altering catastrophe if they
struck Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The project has a rather significant hole: it does not have any
telescopes that can look for asteroids across the entire Southern
sky. To rectify that, the University of Arizona and the Australian
National University are collaborating to refurbish a telescope near
Coonabarabran, in southeastern Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The refurbished telescope, like all modern asteroid-seeking
instruments, will use a charge-coupled device, which makes
electronic images of the sky. Astronomers take images of the same
part of the sky over several minutes and then compare them. An
asteroid's position will shift, evidence that a potential killer is
on the loose.

QUESTIONING THE `DEADLINE' FOR WEANING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ill., Fla., N.C.)   (af)  
 By RANDI HUTTER EPSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martha, my 3-year-old daughter, is a drinker. She
craves breast milk and she just won't quit. On the other hand, her
twin brother as well as her older brother weaned themselves at 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   I never intended to nurse a toddler. Martha and I have tried
cold turkey. We didn't do well. The plan was to endure the
withdrawals (in other words, let her scream) until she learned to
enjoy a breast-milk-free life. That was suitable for the privacy of
our own home, but it didn't work in restaurants or other public
places.
</P>
<P>
   As my feeble attempts to wean failed, I began to wonder why
weaning mattered so much. I wondered whether there was any medical
evidence to support the popular deadline, six months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   And what I discovered from interviews with specialists and a
review of the medical research on breast-feeding was that though
Martha and I may be an oddity on the Upper West Side of Manhattan,
in the world at large we are the norm. The global average is about
three years.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, data extrapolated from nonhuman primates suggest
that humans might be wise to nurse their young for several years,
said Katherine A. Dettwyler, an associate professor of anthropology
and nutrition at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dettwyler has investigated chimpanzees, gorillas, seals,
moose and other large animals. She related certain milestones, like
gestation period, full-grown size and age at sexual maturity, to
the age of weaning. She concluded that a more natural age for
weaning in humans would be somewhere between 2.5 and 7 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the world, there are lots of cultures where people
nurse three, four or five years on average,'' added Dr. Dettwyler,
co-editor of ``Breast-Feeding: Biocultural Perspectives'' (Aldine
de Gruyter, 1995). ``All cultures have various ideas about how
short is too short and how long is too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dettwyler is now examining the consequences of long-term
nursing in a group of 1,429 American children. One category
includes three children who nursed until they were 9 or 10, and
another includes seven children who nursed until they were 8 or 9.
The study is in its early stages, she said.
</P>
<P>
   I had assumed most pediatricians encouraged women to stop
nursing within a year. Not so. Dr. Lawrence M. Gartner, a professor
emeritus at the University of Chicago and chairman of the American
Academy of Pediatrics' task force on breast-feeding, said, ``There
is no contraindication to extending breast-feeding and no evidence
that it causes psychological harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy recommends that women breast-feed for at least one
year or longer; ideally, Gartner said, babies should get breast
milk exclusively for the first six months.
</P>
<P>
   He reassured me that there was nothing wrong with Martha. ``The
impression a number of us have from seeing a large number of
children breast-feed for two or three years is that, if anything,
they are more self-confident and can handle crowds and people
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the 1950s, Niles Newton, a research psychologist at
Northwestern University, studied a group of children who were
breast-fed at least three years. ``Her hypothesis was that if you
nursed a child more than one year, you would tie that baby to your
apron strings,'' explained Ruth Lawrence, a professor of pediatrics
and obstetrics at the University of Rochester and author of
``Breast-Feeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession'' (C.V. Mosby,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   But Newton found quite the opposite. Nursing toddlers blossomed
into children who were more assertive, advanced physically and
mentally, and more at ease in social situations compared with those
who had weaned earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to weed out objective findings from wishful
thinking by researchers who are promoting breast-feeding. Still,
Gartner suspects breast-feeding provides some toddlers a sense of a
security with their mothers. ``It's important that children feel
safe and secure,'' he said, ``and they will choose different routes
to feel this way. That is why the recommendations from the academy
are very open-ended.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A baby sucking at the nipple triggers a flurry of chemical
messages from breast to brain. The two main hormones sent from the
brain are prolactin, which helps to make milk, and oxytocin, which
helps to release it.
</P>
<P>
   When prolactin soars, ovarian hormones like estrogen plummet.
That is why women who nurse newborns usually do not menstruate or
become pregnant. They may also feel the other uncomfortable effects
of a lack of estrogen _ vaginal dryness and a decreased sense of
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   But the longer a woman nurses, the less her prolactin spikes and
the more likely her other hormones bounce back to normal. That
means that a mother who is nursing a baby has a very different
hormonal response from one who is nursing a toddler. And that means
that my prolactin still rises a bit as Martha latches on, but it
does not soar the way it used to.
</P>
<P>
   What has intrigued me is whether prolactin causes any other
chemical reactions in my body. The hormone was named in 1922 when
investigators believed its sole role was synthesizing milk. But now
they suspect it is much more versatile.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary evidence suggests that prolactin fortifies the
immune system, helps to regulate water and salt, and may influence
behavior, said Marc E. Freeman of the department of biological
sciences at Florida State University.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's studies on rats have demonstrated that mother rodents
deprived of prolactin ignore their young, while those satiated with
the hormone build nests, nurse and gather their scampering
offspring. And there are hints, he said, that oxytocin has similar
effects but not quite as intense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a big leap to predict human maternal behavior from
a pride of rats. Some scientists say the animal studies prove that
prolactin and oxytocin induce a sense of relaxation in mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Others studying the same data believe the hormones promote a
hypervigilant state that can make some women irritable.
</P>
<P>
   The potential links to irritability are probably why some
doctors suspect that for some women, nursing increases the risk of
postpartum depression. But there is no scientific evidence to prove
the connection.
</P>
<P>
   As any mother can vouch, it is virtually impossible to know what
part of an emotional response is hormonal. And some women may be
more sensitive to hormonal changes during delivery and
breast-feeding than others, said Dr. Diana Dell, assistant
professor of psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology at Duke
University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to make blanket statements about the way one
hormone will affect well-being, or whether breast-feeding is
guaranteed to relax or stress a woman.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I know that I relaxed when I nursed my newborns. It
was a peaceful time to stare into the eyes of my tiny babies and
dream about them romping around as young children. But a toddler
latching onto the breast for a few minutes to appease crankiness is
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   There is no bonding. It is more like a quick fix to stop a
tantrum. Maybe for other mothers the experience is different.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing I do know is that my prolactin has subsided enough
to kick my ovaries back into gear. I became pregnant while nursing.
My new maternal state has made me think more seriously about
weaning Martha in time to start nursing a newborn again.

STUDY DETECTS EARLY SIGNS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA

<P>
   Schizophrenia, the devastating mental illness that afflicts an
estimated 2.7 million Americans, is rarely diagnosed until it
becomes full-blown. But a new study suggests that young men who
will develop the disease may be identifiable even before any
symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, some mental health experts say, lend support to
the idea that doctors will eventually be able to offer preventive
treatment to people who are judged to be at high risk for
schizophrenia but have not yet fallen ill.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the researchers, led by Dr. Michael Davidson,
professor of psychiatry at Tel Aviv University, took advantage of
the Israeli Draft Board Registry, which archives the results of
compulsory screening of Israeli adolescents aged 16 and 17. The
teen-agers take tests measuring their intellectual, medical and
psychiatric fitness for military service.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the screening, the adolescents were asked about their
personal relationships, their general level of maturity and
autonomy, and their ability to organize their lives. The questions
included: How many good friends do you have? How often are you late
for school? Who cleans your room? Do you tend to be the center of
attention at parties?
</P>
<P>
   Young men who were deemed healthy by the draft board but were
later hospitalized for schizophrenia, the researchers found, had
shown subtle abnormalities in intellectual and social functioning
on the screening tests. Their scores on all the measures included
in the study were significantly lower than those of a comparable
group of teen-agers who did not fall ill.
</P>
<P>
   Using the test scores, Davidson and his colleagues were able to
classify 87.5 percent of the adolescents correctly according to
whether they would become ill. The study appears in this month's
issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said in an interview that while more research needed to
be done, his study and others documenting early warning signs of
schizophrenia were raising ``major issues'' about how early
treatment should begin.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Yale University and in Australia are already
using antipsychotic drugs experimentally to treat subjects who are
at high risk for schizophrenia and display early signs of the
illness, though they do not have definitive symptoms. But though a
new generation of drugs for psychosis have fewer side effects than
older medications, the treatments are not without risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe five years from now we'll have drugs with even fewer
adverse effects,'' Davidson said. ``The issue is that if my
findings and other people's findings are true, at a certain point
we have to begin treating people who have very mild symptoms. In a
way, it's like finding a gene _ do you treat asymptomatic people
who have a gene for breast cancer?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Davis, chairman of psychiatry at Mount Sinai
Hospital in New York City, said the study offered the possibility
``that we might really be able to identify people with a high risk
and be able to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said studies showed that the longer a first episode of
schizophrenia went untreated, the poorer patients did in the long
run. ``You don't want to label people inappropriately,'' he said.
But providing ``aggressive and effective treatment may result in a
better long-term course.''

TECHNIQUE RELIEVES ANGINA, BUT WHY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Pa., N.Y., Calif., Fla.)   (af)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is, quite simply, a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers treated 182 people with angina, the agonizing and
debilitating pain that is often a precursor to a heart attack, with
a laser that drills holes in the walls of their heart muscles. Half
of the patients got better, even though they had not responded to
standard treatments for angina. And a year after the laser surgery,
many who had been in pain even when resting could walk for blocks
without discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   The results, reported in the Sept. 11 issue of The Lancet, the
British medical journal, were surprising _ all the more so because
the researchers admit they have no idea why the surgery seems to
have worked.
</P>
<P>
   Angina occurs when the heart muscle receives less blood than it
needs, and scientists thought the laser treatment might improve
blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original idea was to vaporize a channel through the heart
muscle to the cavity so that blood within the cavity could seep
directly into the muscle, as it does in reptiles, without having to
detour through the arteries,'' said an author of the study, Dr.
James W. Jones, chairman of the department of surgery at the
University of Missouri, who performed 42 of the surgeries reported
in The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we measured no increase in blood flow,'' he went on.
``It's a paradox. The surgery relieved the angina, but did not
improve the underlying conditions that cause it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Previous work had claimed benefits for the laser therapy, known
as transmyocardial revascularization and intended for people who
cannot undergo treatments like bypass surgery or angioplasty to
clear their arteries. But many researchers had been skeptical of
those claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many earlier reports were more like testimonials than careful,
comparative studies,'' said Dr. Timothy Gardner, chief of
cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, who was
not involved in the Lancet study. ``This is the first study using
scientific methods to show clinical benefits.'' Gardner is chairman
of the American Heart Association's council on cardiac, thoracic
and vascular surgery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, the findings should be viewed with caution.
``This study had only a 12-month follow-up,'' he said. Ischemic
heart disease, the kind that results from reduced blood flow and is
often preceded by angina, is a chronic condition that progresses
slowly. ``We won't know for another 12 months whether the results
are a transient phenomenon or not,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 182 patients in the Lancet study, recruited at 16 medical
centers, had been taking maximum doses of at least two anti-angina
drugs and had high scores on a common measurement of angina pain.
Patients were randomly assigned either to continued medication for
their angina or to laser surgery in addition to the medication. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A small incision to the chest gave the surgeons access to the
surface of the heart. A laser was applied to make 15 to 30 small
holes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year later, patients who underwent laser surgery could
exercise an average of 65 seconds longer on the treadmill than they
could before the operation; the medication-only group had
deteriorated and could exercise 46 seconds less. The pain of angina
was reduced substantially for about half the laser-treated group,
as against one in seven in the medication-only group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the laser surgery did not improve blood flow, why did the
patients improve? Some researchers speculate that the lasers
destroyed the nerve fibers that transmit the pain. Others think
that the laser created microinjuries to the heart that somehow, in
healing, led to the growth of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this type of response is not specific for
lasers,'' said a co-author of the study, Dr. Daniel Burkhoff, an
associate professor of medicine at Columbia University. ``It
probably reflects a general response to any kind of microinjury
that in turn incites this inflammatory and healing response.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers say many different factors may be at work.
``It is naive to believe a single mechanism is responsible for the
reduction in angina,'' said Dr. Peter Whittaker, a researcher at
the Heart Institute at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, who
has performed animal studies using ultraviolet lasers rather than
the infrared laser used in the Lancet study. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of laser surgery for intractable angina will
be done through a catheter, a thin plastic tube that can be eased
through an artery in the leg, Burkhoff said. ``Instead of making an
incision through the chest wall, we'll push the tube through and
deliver the energy of the laser through the catheter, with no major
incision or general anesthetic necessary.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, patients treated by the lasers say they are still
doing well, One of Jones' patients, Jack Harren of West Palm Beach,
Fla., who had the treatment two years ago, has returned to his life
as a sea captain and professional diver, although he is considering
giving up the diving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the surgery I got angina just going up the stairs,'' he
said, ``and medication was all they could do for me'' after two
bypasses 10 years apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to take three to four nitroglycerin tables a day,'' he
said. ``Now I take that many a year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such results are encouraging to researchers, even if they do not
fully understand what is going on. ``It's no trivial matter to
eliminate these severe, debilitating chest pains in patients who
often can't walk across a room,'' Whittaker said. ``Yes, we don't
know the mechanism, but on the other hand, it seems to work. If we
can get such good results when we don't have a clue, just think how
amazing it is going to be when we do.'' &QL;

<P>
   Left to its own devices, the human spinal cord cannot memorize a
Beethoven sonata, solve a quadratic equation or conjugate a Russian
verb. No spinal cord, detached from its neighboring brain, will
ever win a spelling bee or appear as a featured contestant on
Jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But neither is the spinal cord _ the length of nerve fibers,
neural machinery and blood vessels that constitutes the southern
extension of the central nervous system _ as much of a dullard as
scientists have long believed. An increasing number of studies
demonstrate that far from being a passive conduit, slavishly
ferrying information to and from the brain, or a repository of
unchanging reflexes, the spinal cord has its own contribution to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Spinal cord neurons, researchers are finding, are capable of
learning in simple ways, and show changes in response to
environmental cues that many investigators interpret as a form of
memory. Intriguingly, these abilities remain even when the spinal
cord is cut off from the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spinal cord,'' said Dr. James Grau, a professor of
psychology at Texas A&AMP;M University who studies spinal cord
learning, ``is a lot smarter than you think.''
</P>
<P>
   The conception of the spinal cord as an active partner in
learning comes from a convergence of work in a variety of
scientific disciplines, including physiology, behavioral
neuroscience, psychology and physical therapy. Knowledge gained
from animal studies of spinal cord learning is already helping some
patients with debilitating spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Pagell, for example, a German schoolteacher paralyzed from
the waist down as a result of a car accident in 1989, has gained
new mobility and now walks with a walker, thanks to a novel therapy
that grew out of work on spinal cord learning in animals.
</P>
<P>
   New understanding of the spinal cord's abilities is also helping
researchers study the biological underpinnings of learning and
memory and offering clues to the understanding and treatment of
chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have championed the spinal cord's cause over the past
century have had something of an uphill battle. Philosophers and
theologians of the 18th and 19th century drew a strict distinction
between the lofty brain, considered the seat of the soul, and the
lowly spinal cord, capable only of reflexive behaviors. Learning,
in their view, required consciousness, the exclusive province of
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, work with patients with spinal cord injuries
indicated that the cord retained some flexibility in functioning
after cortical connections were damaged or severed. And researchers
periodically offered evidence suggesting that in animals the spinal
cord could be conditioned to respond to cues, much as Pavlov's dogs
were led to salivate at the sound of a tone. But such studies were
often criticized or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   That many scientists are now giving the spinal cord more credit
is a result, in part, of sophisticated new technologies for
examining the brain at work, and significant advances in
neuroscientific research. These developments have shown that the
nervous system is much more flexible and responsive to the
environment than anyone thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now clear from a lot of areas that the whole nervous
system changes continually in response to development, to learning,
to trauma,'' said Dr. Jonathan Wolpaw, chief of the laboratory of
nervous system disorders at the Wadsworth Center of the New York
State Department of Health. ``There is plasticity and the capacity
for change throughout the central nervous system, and that includes
the spinal cord.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same structures and chemical processes that seem to
underlie learning and memory in the brain are present in the lower
nervous system as well, scientists point out. NMDA receptors, for
example, molecules that receive signals from other cells and are
thought to be important in memory formation in the brain, are also
active in the spinal cord. And NMDA receptors trigger the same
neurochemical changes in spinal cord neurons as in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking the action of NMDA receptors in the spinal cord appears
to interfere with simple learning, according to studies by Dr.
Russell Durkovic, a professor of neuroscience and physiology at the
State University of New York in Syracuse and by Grau and a
colleague, Dr. Robin Joynes, now at the University of California at
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In studies by Grau and Joynes, for example, rats whose spinal
cords have been transected in the middle region _ cutting off
communication to the brain and leaving the animals unable to move
their hind legs voluntarily _ learn to keep one leg raised to avoid
a shock, just as normal animals do. But when the injured rats are
given a drug that blocks NMDA receptors, they are no longer able to
learn the response.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even learning that starts in the brain changes the
structure and function of the spinal cord, researchers are finding.
Wolpaw and his colleagues, for example, have shown that training
monkeys and rats to alter the size of a simple reflex _ a tendon
jerk _ produces lasting changes, both anatomical and physiological,
in the spinal cord itself, and the changes persist when connections
to the brain are severed.
</P>
<P>
   The same appears true in humans, Wolpaw said, and may explain
why training takes so long for athletes and, in particular, ballet
dancers, who execute finely tuned movements with their legs. Such
skills, he said, ``involve changes at many levels in the nervous
system, including the spinal cord, and many of these changes occur
gradually.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of understanding more about pain perception,
researchers are studying changes in spinal cord neurons that
transmit pain messages to the brain. By recording electrical
activity from pain neurons in the spinal gray matter, Dr. William
D. Willis, of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston,
and his colleagues have shown that these nerve cells respond
intensely not only to sensory signals from an injury site, but also
to messages from sensory receptors in adjacent uninjured areas.
</P>
<P>
   These hyperactive responses last for some time, Willis said,
suggesting that the spinal cord neurons have been sensitized, a
process that looks a lot like short-term memory. ``These neurons
have learned something, just as much as neurons in other higher-up
systems have,'' Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   In people who suffer from chronic pain after an injury or
illness, he said, the new patterns established in the spinal cord
may for some reason persist long after damaged tissue has healed,
as the neurons continue to send distressed, but now inaccurate,
reports to the brain.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It is in the treatment of spinal cord injury patients, however,
that the new wave of research is already paying off. An estimated
250,000 Americans live with spinal cord injuries, according to
national support groups. For some, the novel therapy used by Pagell
may offer increased mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Pagell, 52, a high school teacher, said he was driving his car
early one morning in 1989 when he fell asleep ``for one second.''
The ensuing accident left him mostly paralyzed from the waist down,
except for limited movement in his left leg and sensation in both
legs.
</P>
<P>
   He considers himself lucky, because he did not have to give up
his job, as many patients with spinal cord injuries do. ``I like to
work with young people,'' Pagell said.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also fortunate in another way: About six years after
his accident, he became a participant in an experimental program
directed by Dr. Anton Wernig, a professor of physiology at the
University of Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   At Wernig's clinic, near Karlsruhe, Pagell was strapped into a
harness and, with a specially trained physical therapist helping to
position his legs, began to take steps on a motorized treadmill,
gripping the bars on either side with his hands. Before starting
the three-month program, he was confined to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   But as the weeks passed, he was able to walk increasing
distances on the treadmill, and at the end of the training he had
greater movement and could use a walker, an ability he retains
today, four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Wernig's technique was based on animal studies conducted in the
1980s by two researchers, Dr. V. Reggie Edgerton, a professor of
physiological science at the University of California at Los
Angeles, and Dr. Serge Rossignol at the University of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had long known that the spinal cord contains groups
of neurons that, when chemically activated, generate rhythmic
flexing and extension of the legs in an alternating pattern. But no
one thought that adult animals with longstanding spinal cord
injuries could be taught to activate these pattern generators.
</P>
<P>
   The learning of locomotor skills, it was believed, could not
occur without the participation of the cerebellum, the area of the
brain involved in coordinating motor movements.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA and Montreal researchers proved otherwise. Designing a
special training program in which experimenters provided animals
with partial body support, they trained cats whose spinal cords had
been severed in the middle region to step on a treadmill. After
three to six months of daily sessions, the researchers found, the
animals were able to walk, correctly positioning their hind legs
and readily adjusting to the speed of the machine.
</P>
<P>
   What was occurring, the researchers theorized, was a type of
activity-dependent learning: practicing a specific series of
movements provided sensory information that somehow re-educated the
spinal cord. But most experts were skeptical about whether such
recovery was possible in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just been this strong underlying viewpoint that the
human nervous system is unique and special, and that the brain was
essential for everything,'' Edgerton said.
</P>
<P>
   Wernig's success in Germany, however, is changing many people's
minds. In one of his studies, for example, 44 German patients with
chronic spinal cord injuries were trained on the treadmill for 10
to 12 weeks. At the beginning of the study, only 6 could walk with
a rollator or walker; the rest were confined to wheelchairs. But at
the end of the training program, 38 patients could walk unassisted,
using a walker or canes.
</P>
<P>
   Wernig's work is stirring great interest in the United States,
not only for the potential it has to increase mobility for some
patients but also because scientists hope the training might
eventually be combined with transplants of spinal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Research on spinal cord regeneration is still in its infancy,
but experts say one obstacle is that when nerve tissue is
transplanted, neural connections are unlikely to reattach in the
right places. If the spinal cord could be retrained, however, using
the locomotor therapy, it might improve the chances for success of
such surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Locomotor training of the type developed by Wernig is not yet
widely available in this country, although clinical trials are
about to begin in five American cities. And researchers caution
that the therapy is not suitable for every patient with a spinal
cord injury, that not everyone is helped by it and that the
benefits vary widely from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   They stress that it also involves far more than just getting on
a treadmill. ``It's not enough to have a treadmill and a harness
and suspension, and you hang the patient there and tell him `Now
go!,''' Wernig said. ``You have to apply certain rules.''
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible for the studies, participants must have
``incomplete'' injuries, in which connections with the brain have
not been completely destroyed. Experts believe that such patients
are more likely to benefit from the training.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to find out more about learning in human spinal
cords, Dr. Susan Harkema at UCLA is also using the therapy with
``complete'' injury patients like Tony Scott, who was walking his
dog in downtown Los Angeles one Friday afternoon last April when a
palm tree fell on him, virtually severing his spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old patient, who began the training last month,
reports to the clinic three times a week. He undergoes a vigorous
stretching routine, then is hoisted onto the treadmill, where he
works for about an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who jogged regularly and played basketball before his
injury, may or may not be helped by the locomotor therapy. But he
said: ``To see myself up and breaking a sweat is very good
psychologically. To be confined to this wheelchair is eating me
alive.''

   &UR; AT RISK: High Blood Pressure and Osteoporosis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis, a loss in bone density that can lead to
brittleness and fractures even from everyday activities, is a major
cause of crippling disability in women past menopause. Now, a new
study of 3,676 elderly women in Britain and the United States has
shown that the higher their blood pressure, the more severe their
bone density loss.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published last week in The Lancet, a British medical
journal, followed up on measurements of the women, whose mean age
was 73, over three and a half years and found that the higher the
women's blood pressure, the greater and faster their loss of bone
minerals, regardless of age, weight, initial bone density, smoking,
exercise or whether they used hormone replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francesco P. Cappuccio of St. Georges Hospital Medical
School in London, who led the research team, said in a telephone
interview, ``We think if you have high blood pressure, you lose
more calcium in your urine.'' Although calcium loss is faster after
menopause, when the ovaries stop producing estrogen, Dr. Cappuccio
said, the loss from high blood pressure might start earlier and
accumulate over time.
</P>
<P>
   Women can help reduce the threat of brittle bones by reducing
salt intake, giving up smoking, keeping physically fit and
considering hormone replacement therapy, he said. And such measures
have an added benefit: guarding against cardiovascular disease, a
major killer of elderly women.

   &UR; PROGNOSIS: Welcoming Mom and Dad to the ICU &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When children are treated in an intensive care unit, their
parents are often asked to wait outside. But a new study by
researchers at a Rochester children's hospital suggests that
allowing parents to stay may be better for them and for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in the September issue of The Archives of Pediatrics
and Family Medicine, focused on 16 children who underwent one or
more invasive procedures, like insertion of an intravenous tube, in
the intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital at Strong.
</P>
<P>
   Of the parents who were present during the procedures, nearly
all said they would choose to be there again, and most said they
thought their presence was helpful to their children and to the
medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a control group of parents who had to wait outside
while their children were treated were significantly more anxious
during the procedures. And of 16 nurses interviewed, 15 said the
presence of parents was helpful to the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, there's a lot of mistrust of the health care
profession,'' said Dr. Karen S. Powers, associate director of the
children's critical care center at the hospital and an author of
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents wonder if we're letting medical students do the
procedure, or if their child was scared,'' she said. ``By letting
them be present, we take away a lot of the mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Powers said that as a result of the findings, the hospital
had adopted a 24-hour open-door policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents can now sleep in the ICU in the same room as their
children,'' she said. ``Some parents choose to leave, but they
recognize they can walk in or out at any time.''

   &UR; SAFETY: Many Fear Drug Mistakes in Hospitals &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you worry about the medicine you may be getting during a stay
in the hospital, you are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   In a new survey for the American Society of Health-System
Pharmacists, the association that represents pharmacists who
practice in hospitals, 1,008 adults were asked their level of
concern about 10 issues related to hospitalization. Sixty-one
percent replied that they were ``very concerned'' about being given
the wrong medicine, 58 percent about getting drugs that react
negatively in combination, 53 percent about not having enough
information about medicines, 49 percent about bad side effects and
49 percent about getting too much medicine. Bruce Scott, president
of the association, attributed the public's ``heightened
sensitivity'' to greater media coverage of medical errors and said
many drug mix-ups result from simple human error that could be
eliminated by using computers to monitor the dispensing of
medication in hospitals. A bar code system could help insure that
the right patient receives the right medication at the right time,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the organization also favors involving
pharmacists more directly in the care of hospitalized patients. A
study it co-sponsored, in the July issue of The Journal of the
American Medical Association, reported that problems caused by
drugs declined by 66 percent in one hospital when a pharmacist
began accompanying physicians on their rounds.

<P>
   &UR; CONSEQUENCES: Cocaine's Grip on the Blood and the Brain &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is not exactly news that cocaine is bad for the health. But
in two new studies released last week, researchers documented still
more detrimental effects of the drug, both immediate and long-term.
</P>
<P>
   In the first study, reported in The Archives of Internal
Medicine, a team led by Dr. Arthur Siegel, chief of internal
medicine at McLean Hospital near Boston, found that cocaine causes
blood to thicken by increasing the number of red cells and by
touching off an increase in a protein that causes platelets to
stick together.
</P>
<P>
   This study may explain why cocaine users have heart attacks at
24 times the rate of the general population in the first hour after
taking the drug, as a previous study reported. The Associated Press
quoted Siegel as saying that the thickened blood has 4 percent to 6
percent more red cells and must circulate through constricted
vessels _ a potentially dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
   The second study, by a team led by Dr. Eric Nestler of Yale
University, found that frequent use of cocaine may lead to
addiction by causing changes in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   In tests on mice, the researchers found that one protein,
delta-FosB, appeared in very high levels after sustained, prolonged
cocaine use and that it sharply increased sensitivity to cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that this protein is part of the molecular switch
that causes the behavioral switch from casual cocaine use to
compulsive addiction,'' Nestler said. ``We can now look for ways to
block that switch so that we can develop more effective treatment
for cocaine addiction.''

`GOT MILK' AD MAY HAVE HALTED DECLINE IN CONSUMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After using the ``Got Milk?'' slogan for six
years, the milk industry says 9 of every 10 consumers recognize the
advertising message.
</P>
<P>
   That finding comes from a new study by the Berkeley-based
California Milk Processor Board, a group of business people who
receive milk from dairy producers, put it in cartons and bottles
and send it to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The question has been posed in 31 television commercials and on
countless outdoor advertising posters. ``It probably is the most
recognized ad line right now,'' said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman and
creative director of Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, which produced
the ads.
</P>
<P>
   But here are the statistics that mean even more in advertising:
Per capita milk consumption in California was 29 gallons in 1980,
and by 1993 it had fallen to 23 gallons. After that year, when the
ad campaign began, the decline was halted and sales have remained
fairly steady, ranging between 21 and 23 gallons per person each
year, said Jeff Manning, executive director of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Manning calculates that had the consumption decline continued at
its rate in the 1980s and early 1990s, sales would have fallen by
85 million gallons annually in California. At $3 a gallon, that's a
$255 million yearly loss that, Manning argues, is prevented by
spending $23 million on the Goodby, Silverstein advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   Manning says the slogan is ``short, and it's memorable. ... More
important, it's a question. Think how different this would look if
everything said, `Get Milk!' It's a non-combative, open-ended
question that does not attack anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``What right does an advertiser have to tell you want to do?''
asked Manning. He has taken the campaign nationwide via licensing
deals with the dairy industry and has struck deals to place the
``Got Milk?'' trademark on more than 40 products, from kitchenware
and clothing to Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   He has also signed marketing deals with partners including
Nestle, Nabisco, Pillsbury, General Mills, Kellogg, Quaker Oats,
Keebler and Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Another licensing agreement, with the national Milk Processor
Education Program, joins the ``Got Milk?'' tag line with another ad
campaign by Bozell Worldwide Inc., creators of the ``milk
mustache'' print ads.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, ``Got Milk?'' is on virtually every piece of paper
connected to the dairy industry, and it's part of American culture,
said Manning.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the milk board and the Girl Scouts of
the San Francisco Bay area is a good example of ``Got Milk?''
synergy: Images of Bay Area Junior Girl Scouts and Girl Scout
cookies have been used in cross-promotional billboard and bus stop
shelter advertising since 1997 and appear during the cookie-selling
period in March.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion is duplicated nationwide in similar partnerships
between Girl Scout councils and dairy associations _ but always
features the Bay area scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, said Manning, the Girl Scouts _ wearing ``Got
Milk?'' buttons _ sell more cookies in March than Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the ``Got Milk?'' spots turn on people who suffer the
agony of milk deprivation, often when eating foods that are married
to milk, such as Oreo cookies, Trix cereal or chocolate cake.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in ``Aaron Burr,'' the host of a radio contest
randomly calls an Alexander Hamilton specialist and asks him, ``Who
shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel?'' Unfortunately, the
Hamilton scholar _ he even has the bullet from the duel among his
Hamiltonian paraphernalia _ has stuffed his mouth with a peanut
butter sandwich and is fresh out of milk. His correct response is
unintelligible. There goes the $10,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   If the message of the campaign is grounded in a simple human
truth _ that a cupcake without milk is no way to live _ this is by
any measure a sophisticated collection of 31 individual 60- or
30-second television mini-dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate advertising that talks down to people or over-sells,''
said Goodby. ``I think `Got Milk?' treats you like an equal. It
assumes you are intelligent. It assumes that you have a sense of
humor that is pretty well-developed. Ninety-nine percent of
advertising is pretty insulting, I think, and hopefully we keep
that thing to a minimum here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got Milk?'' has won 130 awards including the Clio and Cannes
International Advertising Festival awards. The slogan has helped
propel Goodby, Silverstein, which in 1993 was a relatively small
San Francisco ad agency, into prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it had fewer than 100 employees and under $100 million in
billings. Today it bills $500 million and has 280 employees
stretching the seams of its own six-story building here on
California Street.

   WHY WEN HO LEE MATTERS. Wen Ho Lee, a physicist, was fired last
March from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico after
20 years on the job. Wen Ho Lee isn't a celebrity, writes columnist
Amy Wu. So why should we care? Why does Lee's saga dominate the
headlines of international newspapers? And why did his story play a
role in the cooling of Sino-U.S. relations in May? Because the
Chinese-American scientist was fired for possibly leaking
information to the Chinese government. At the heart of the
controversy is whether or not FBI agents focused on Lee because of
his ethnicity. Wu, a new contributor to New America News Service,
explains how the controversy has affected her personally, and how
it affects most Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LEVEL THE PAYING FIELD FOR ATHLETES. Columnist Bill Maxwell
believes that those who run big-time college football need to come
clean about the corruption in the institution and the abuse of
young men who play. ``Fine-tuned, chiseled, testosterone-soaked and
egocentric, these young men are not STUDENT-athletes,'' he writes.
``They are ATHLETE-students.'' The corruption in the game was
brought to the public's attention in July when it was reported that
William ``Tank'' Black, an NFL Players Association agent, had been
caught giving cash and cars to football standouts at various
universities _ a standard operating procedure among many agents.
Maxwell's solution: ``The National Collegiate Athletic Association
needs to establish a uniform system to pay ATHLETE-students what
they deserve. If nothing is done, the system will continue to
corrupt players and their universities.''

   PUSHING AGAINST THE ODDS IN LOUISIANA. Rep. William Jefferson
(D-La.) hopes to become the first black governor in Louisiana's
history. He grew up in Louisiana's East Carroll Parish, one of the
poorest places in America. At age 7, he started picking cotton for
$3 a day. Despite his parents' humble earnings, all 10 Jefferson
children attended college. Bill Jefferson went to Southern
University and then Harvard Law School, and later established what
became the largest black law firm in the South. He was elected to
three terms in the Louisiana State Senate, and is now in his fifth
term as a congressman representing New Orleans. On Oct. 23, he will
be on the ballot as an underdog gubernatorial candidate, hoping to
unseat GOP incumbent Gov. Mike Foster. ``If I were to (become
governor), I think the message would be there's a chance for
opportunity everywhere,'' Jefferson says. A profile from Hispanic
magazine.

   WHEN LAWS AREN'T FAIR. This week, columnist Juan Gonzalez tells
the story of Jose Garcia, a 68-year-old Cuban immigrant who
succumbed to a heart attack on Aug. 22 in the state prison in Green
Haven, N.Y. Garcia had worked for most of his life as a waiter, was
married to the same woman for 41 years and put his son and daughter
through Catholic schools. But a decade ago, Jose Garcia made a
foolish mistake: He agreed to become a lookout for a drug gang on
his block _ a gang busted by the cops in 1989. Although already
very sick with a heart condition. Garcia refused to accept a plea
in exchange for a four-year sentence. Gang leaders had sent word
that if he sang they would go after his family. He received 15
years to life under the harsh mandatory-sentencing requirements of
the Rockefeller drug laws in New York State. Garcia's story, as
told by Gonzalez, leads readers to ponder the severity of such laws
_ and whether exceptions should sometimes be made.

   WHY WEN HO LEE MATTERS. Wen Ho Lee, a physicist, was fired last
March from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico after
20 years on the job. Wen Ho Lee isn't a celebrity, writes columnist
Amy Wu. So why should we care? Why does Lee's saga dominate the
headlines of international newspapers? And why did his story play a
role in the cooling of Sino-U.S. relations in May? Because the
Chinese-American scientist was fired for possibly leaking
information to the Chinese government. At the heart of the
controversy is whether or not FBI agents focused on Lee because of
his ethnicity. Wu, a new contributor to New America News Service,
explains how the controversy has affected her personally, and how
it affects most Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LEVEL THE PAYING FIELD FOR ATHLETES. Columnist Bill Maxwell
believes that those who run big-time college football need to come
clean about the corruption in the institution and the abuse of
young men who play. ``Fine-tuned, chiseled, testosterone-soaked and
egocentric, these young men are not STUDENT-athletes,'' he writes.
``They are ATHLETE-students.'' The corruption in the game was
brought to the public's attention in July when it was reported that
William ``Tank'' Black, an NFL Players Association agent, had been
caught giving cash and cars to football standouts at various
universities _ a standard operating procedure among many agents.
Maxwell's solution: ``The National Collegiate Athletic Association
needs to establish a uniform system to pay ATHLETE-students what
they deserve. If nothing is done, the system will continue to
corrupt players and their universities.''

   WHY WEN HO LEE MATTERS. Wen Ho Lee, a physicist, was fired last
March from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico after
20 years on the job. Wen Ho Lee isn't a celebrity, writes columnist
Amy Wu. So why should we care? Why does Lee's saga dominate the
headlines of international newspapers? And why did his story play a
role in the cooling of Sino-U.S. relations in May? Because the
Chinese-American scientist was fired for possibly leaking
information to the Chinese government. At the heart of the
controversy is whether or not FBI agents focused on Lee because of
his ethnicity. Wu, a new contributor to New America News Service,
explains how the controversy has affected her personally, and how
it affects most Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LEVEL THE PAYING FIELD FOR ATHLETES. Columnist Bill Maxwell
believes that those who run big-time college football need to come
clean about the corruption in the institution and the abuse of
young men who play. ``Fine-tuned, chiseled, testosterone-soaked and
egocentric, these young men are not STUDENT-athletes,'' he writes.
``They are ATHLETE-students.'' The corruption in the game was
brought to the public's attention in July when it was reported that
William ``Tank'' Black, an NFL Players Association agent, had been
caught giving cash and cars to football standouts at various
universities _ a standard operating procedure among many agents.
Maxwell's solution: ``The National Collegiate Athletic Association
needs to establish a uniform system to pay ATHLETE-students what
they deserve. If nothing is done, the system will continue to
corrupt players and their universities.''

   MULTIMEDIA PROJECT SPOTLIGHTS U.S. LATINOS. The brainchild of
actor Edward James Olmos, ``Americanos: Latino Life in the United
States'' began as a book project and quickly expanded to include a
traveling photo exhibition, an HBO documentary and even a CD of
related music. Under the direction of Olmos and Lea Ybarra,
executive director of the Institute for Academic Advancement of
Youth at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University, 31 photographers _
mostly Latinos _ spread out across the country last year to capture
the essence of what it means to be Hispanic in this country. Writer
Ana Radelat reports on this historic project in this feature
article from Hispanic magazine.

<P>
   PUSHING AGAINST THE ODDS IN LOUISIANA. Rep. William Jefferson
(D-La.) hopes to become the first black governor in Louisiana's
history. He grew up in Louisiana's East Carroll Parish, one of the
poorest places in America. At age 7, he started picking cotton for
$3 a day. Despite his parents' humble earnings, all 10 Jefferson
children attended college. Bill Jefferson went to Southern
University and then Harvard Law School, and later established what
became the largest black law firm in the South. He was elected to
three terms in the Louisiana State Senate, and is now in his fifth
term as a congressman representing New Orleans. On Oct. 23, he will
be on the ballot as an underdog gubernatorial candidate, hoping to
unseat GOP incumbent Gov. Mike Foster. ``If I were to (become
governor), I think the message would be there's a chance for
opportunity everywhere,'' Jefferson says. A profile from Hispanic
magazine.

   WHEN LAWS AREN'T FAIR. This week, columnist Juan Gonzalez tells
the story of Jose Garcia, a 68-year-old Cuban immigrant who
succumbed to a heart attack on Aug. 22 in the state prison in Green
Haven, N.Y. Garcia had worked for most of his life as a waiter, was
married to the same woman for 41 years and put his son and daughter
through Catholic schools. But a decade ago, Jose Garcia made a
foolish mistake: He agreed to become a lookout for a drug gang on
his block _ a gang busted by the cops in 1989. Although already
very sick with a heart condition. Garcia refused to accept a plea
in exchange for a four-year sentence. Gang leaders had sent word
that if he sang they would go after his family. He received 15
years to life under the harsh mandatory-sentencing requirements of
the Rockefeller drug laws in New York State. Garcia's story, as
told by Gonzalez, leads readers to ponder the severity of such laws
_ and whether exceptions should sometimes be made.

MEN'S FASHIONS `MORE SARTORIAL' THIS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The line between men's and women's apparel is so fuzzy this fall
it almost demands corrective lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion trend followers of both sexes will be wearing clothes a
little closer to the body, courtesy of stretchy fabrics, bias cuts
and geometric silhouettes _ rectangular and triangular to boxy.
</P>
<P>
   Fur, leather and fuzzy fabrics bridge the gender gap along with
blunt-toed shoes, turtlenecks and flat-front pants.
</P>
<P>
   When Donna Karan introduced her DKNY line for fall, models were
dressed for icy weather in off-white pants, hooded jackets and
coats. It wasn't until midshow that some in the audience figured
out both men and women were walking the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Among all these gender-neutral styles, however, there are some
things that distinguish fall '99 menswear.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jensen, director of men's apparel for Mario's in downtown
Seattle, says there's a ``more sartorial'' look to menswear this
year _ a look he translates as ``Italian does English.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen says Neapolitan clothing is currently hot _ a
British-gentleman kind of style borrowed from the English.
Traditional British fabrics are part of the picture: faint
windowpane patterns, pinstripes, muted Prince-of-Wales plaids.
</P>
<P>
   For years, menswear has been influenced by Italian designer
Giorgio Armani _ a look distinguished by longer jackets, lowered
armholes and big shoulders. Menswear trends are still coming out of
Italy, but the looks have been sleeked-down with higher armholes
and shorter three-button suit jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Even casual apparel is exhibiting less bulk. Cargo pants are
omnipresent, but they're not as baggy.
</P>
<P>
   Layering is still key to casuals, but even T-shirts contain
spandex for a trim fit, and fleece vests are sans bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Trinidad, spokesman for The Fashion Association (a
non-profit trade organization in New York that monitors fashion and
lifestyle trends), says men's clothes are looking different because
they're being designed for a more fashion-conscious consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are much more comfortable with being fashionable,'' he
says. ``They're seeking out apparel that's not only functional
(but) enhances their appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to Trinidad, gym workouts have become mainstream,
especially for men 20 to 40. All that exercise leads to bigger
shoulders, smaller waists.
</P>
<P>
   These men are key customers to contemporary menswear designers
such as Calvin Klein or Kenneth Cole, Trinidad says.
</P>
<P>
   But not everything is Italian/British inspired. Designer Tommy
Hilfiger presented the sleek look with an all American twist:
clothing inspired by leather-clad bikers.
</P>
<P>
   As Diane Sustendahl, a New York fashion authority, puts it,
``Men aren't spending all that time in the gym so they can hide in
L.L. Bean bags ... lumberjack looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask menswear experts to suggest five items that will update a
wardrobe, and they don't even pause before reeling off:
</P>
<P>
   _ Leather jacket _ One that's squared-off at the hem. Make sure
it's boxy or rectangular in silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   _ Something with a hood _ It can be on a sweater or jacket.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vest _ Options abound here. Choose a colorful fleece (extra
points if it's orange with plenty of zippers), a sleeveless
sweater, or a multipocket version favored by photographers and
fly-fishermen. Think of it as a layering item.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flat-front pants _ Forget about pleats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turtleneck sweaters _ ``They show you know what's really going
on,'' says Mark Jensen of Mario's.

   U.N.-ASSEMBLY (United Nations) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan
sounded a warning to a frequently paralyzed Security Council on
Monday, saying that it must act faster and more effectively to meet
the challenge of a world engulfed in civil wars that quickly
descend into the slaughter of helpless civilian populations.
Speaking to the General Assembly the day before President Clinton
is scheduled to address world leaders here, Annan did not single
out the United States, the Security Council's most powerful member,
or any other major nation, but his unusually strong criticism of
the council's initial failures to deal with genocide in Rwanda and
1994 and to agree on responding to Serbian atrocities in Kosovo
over the last year pointed obliquely at American policy decisions.

shelters in North Carolina and two thousand of them are being
housed in a high school gymnasium here where there is no running
water. Most of the people are from tiny village of Princeville,
population 2,000. Princeville was the first town in America
chartered by feed slaves and now is completely underwater. Not even
rooftops can be seen from helicopters overhead and there is no way
in or out by road. Signs of devastation are everywhere in North
Carolina. But even more rain is expected Monday night and this may
worsen flooding on eastern North Carolina rivers. At least 23
people were confirmed dead after 20 inches of rain inundated North

ferrying information to and from the brain, or a repository of
unchanging reflexes, the spinal cord has its own contribution to
make. Spinal cord neurons, researchers are finding, are capable of
learning in simple ways, and show changes in response to
environmental cues that many investigators interpret as a form of
memory. By Erica Goode.

TRAGIC SHOOTINGS CALL FOR SYMPATHY, ACTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush did what he should have done
upon learning of the tragic shootings at the Wedgwood Baptist
Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a point, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He scrubbed an out-of-state presidential campaign trip and came
home to offer sympathy to the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   His comments, essentially the same he has made in response to
previous episodes of senseless violence, didn't sound very
presidential. But they were doubtlessly heartfelt and honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no law _ I wish we could pass it. I would sign it _
that says people will love one another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Bush once again was unable to offer any hope
that government can do much to prevent the type of tragedy that has
occurred in several states with alarming frequency this year.
</P>
<P>
   He may be right. How do you stop someone who is deranged enough
and determined enough to wreak carnage that he is willing _ maybe
even eager _ to die in the process?
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments certainly made more sense than those offered by
a spokesman for Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, one of his longshot
opponents for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we made clear that anybody who used a gun in crime would be
severely punished ... that is what we need to be doing,'' the Hatch
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   His statement was absurd. It had absolutely no bearing on Larry
Gene Ashbrook, who shot himself to death after walking into the
Fort Worth church service and shooting 14 other people, seven
fatally.
</P>
<P>
   Or on recent random, well-publicized shootings that killed other
people in Colorado, Georgia and California.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of being punished was the last thing on those shooters'
tortured minds.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook, had he survived, could have been prosecuted for
capital murder in a state that has executed more convicted killers
than any other government in the Free World. But that possibility
didn't stop him from shooting up a church.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Hatch, Bush and other Republicans at one time or
another have made similar statements in the long-running debate
over gun control, but the Texas governor wasn't so simplistic on
his Fort Worth trip.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control issue, never far removed from presidential
politics, is revived every time there is a multiple shooting that
attracts national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidates, favor more gun control, while Republican
candidates generally oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as the Republican front-runner, receives a large share of
the attention on this issue, as he does on most other issues. And
his record is strongly supportive of gun-ownership rights.
</P>
<P>
   During his first year as governor, he signed the law allowing
Texans to legally carry handguns, a measure that his Democratic
predecessor, Ann Richards, had played a key role in defeating two
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has embraced some gun-control proposals, including
raising the minimum age for purchasing a handgun from 18 to 21 and
closing a loophole in federal law that allows people to buy guns at
gun shows without submitting to a criminal background check.
</P>
<P>
   But, so far, they have been little more than an afterthought in
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas legislators tried to pass a state law requiring
criminal background checks for gun show purchases. Bush said he
supported it when questioned by a reporter in the wake of the high
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., last spring. But he never
told any legislators that he supported the bill, and a House
committee killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook purchased one of the handguns he used in Fort Worth at
a gun show. But he didn't have a felony record, and his purchase
may not have been blocked by a criminal background check anyway.
</P>
<P>
   More gun-control laws won't stop people who are bent on
destruction from obtaining firearms. But the random, multiple
shootings are still the exception. Of more potential danger to most
Americans are the less-dramatic, everyday murderers, robbers and
rapists who still have all-too-easy access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   Although people realize that no amount of laws is going to keep
all firearms out of the wrong hands, they can stand some
reassurance that government is doing everything it can to address
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   As the front-runner for his party's presidential nomination,
Bush has a forum from which to actively promote the reasonable gun
restrictions that he passively supports.
</P>
<P>
   Offering sympathy in the wake of a tragedy is fine, and people
appreciate it. But they also expect their leaders to be leaders,
even on hot-button issues.

IN IOWA, RESTITCHING THE TORN FABRIC OF THE PRAIRIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(af) 
 By SAM HOOPER SAMUELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ecologists call them ``prairie remnants.''
</P>
<P>
   They are forgotten snippets of land along roadsides. Corners of
farm fields steep enough or wet enough to have escaped the plow.
The rough of an occasional midwestern golf course.
</P>
<P>
   These are the few remaining pockets of the American prairie,
once a vast sea of grasses, sedges, and flowering plants that
spanned three time zones.
</P>
<P>
   As habitats go, these prairie remnants do a poor job of
sustaining the diversity of life that a large, continuous stretch
of prairie once could. Plant populations have become isolated from
one another, turning a once-robust gene pool into a series of
shallow gene puddles.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated species die out in some remnants, leaving only a few
species in the mix. Large, nomadic creatures like buffalo and elk
lack the expanses of grazing land they need. The fact remains that
one of the defining features of prairie is vastness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the aptly named town of Prairie City, Iowa, 20 miles
east of Des Moines, vastness is making a comeback. So are buffalo,
elk, and a variety of plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Prairie City is the location of the Neal Smith National Wildlife
Refuge, a project of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service,
and at about 5,000 acres, the scene of one of the most ambitious
and unlikely efforts to restore a prairie ever tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, when we surveyed this area, it was a farmed
landscape,'' said Pauline Drobney, a biologist who works at the
refuge. ``There was no significance ecologically to this place. It
was just a big chunk of land available to start a refuge on.''
</P>
<P>
   The land, 3,600 acres at the time, was owned by Iowa Light and
Power, which had planned to use it for a nuclear power plant. When
that plan was abandoned, the acreage went on the market. Neal
Smith, who was then a congressman representing Prairie City,
managed to guide to passage legislation that called for the federal
government to acquire the land and create a refuge, at an initial
cost of about $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   An acquisition boundary was drawn that encompassed a total of
8,654 acres. To date, 5,000 acres have been acquired at market
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drobney was hired at first as a consultant to survey the
land, then later as refuge biologist in charge of transforming this
sizable parcel from farmland back to prairie.
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle was to find seeds. A mature prairie contains
150 to 200 species of plants, all of which have local variants.
Seeds are scarce, and when commercially available can cost as much
as $75 an ounce for the rarer species.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about 10 pounds of live seeds to replant one acre of
prairie. Hoping to gather seeds from authentic local sources, Ms.
Drobney consulted the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, which
maintains a database that includes prairie remnants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had records of eight remnants in the southern 40 percent
of Iowa,'' Ms. Drobney said. ``With that bad news, we decided to
get out there and find them ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drobney hired five people, who for two and a half months
traversed 38 Iowa counties in search of remnants and seeds. The
search yielded about 2,000 remnants of native prairie and savanna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them were very tiny,'' Ms. Drobney said. ``Others were
300 acres or more. You take bits of this gene pool and bits of that
gene pool, you bring these together, and then you have the genetic
exchange, that gene flow that's possible once again on at least
this piece of the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of restoration, the genes are indeed flowing
again in Prairie City. Over time, the refuge has had to rely less
and less on seeds from outside sources, instead harvesting its own
seeds for replanting. Over the last two years, 20,000 pounds of
seeds have been gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Where once uniform rows of corn and soybeans were grown, Ms.
Drobney now takes visitors wading, with difficulty, through prairie
grasses up to 12 feet high, trudging through Canada wild rye, big
bluestem, little bluestem, nut sedge and Indian grass.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere the eye lands, there is some different plant, spider,
snake, inchworm or bird. Plants of many heights and colors form the
mottled landscape of a healthy prairie. A pair of sand hill cranes
was spotted on the refuge in July of 1997. Indiana bats, a
federally endangered species, hang from the oaks. Short-eared owls,
once common in Iowa but now on the state's threatened and
endangered species list, find shelter on the ground under the tall
grasses.
</P>
<P>
   And there are buffalo. A herd of 42, including 10 calves born
last spring, graze on a 750-acre enclosure within the refuge.
Buffalo do not just need prairies; prairies need buffalo, too.
Their grazing action keeps tree seedlings like dogwoods from
growing up and turning the prairie into scrublands. This year, the
buffalo were joined by nine elk brought in from outside Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   With buffalo come tourists. Some might argue that the point of a
refuge is to protect plants and animals from the intrusion of
people, but Ms. Drobney considers Homo sapiens as important a
species as any on the prairie landscape.
</P>
<P>
   There are purely practical reasons for this. The refuge has far
to go. The original plan included a staff of 36; because of stiff
competition for federal financing, the refuge operates with a staff
of 12. The bulk of the planting, monitoring and seed gathering is
done by volunteers. There would be little public support without
public access.
</P>
<P>
   On a more philosophical level, Ms. Drobney explains, education
is part of the refuge's mission. Last year the center saw 50,000
visitors, including 18,000 schoolchildren, who can lose themselves
in a prairie maze, built to resemble gopher tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo and elk are what environmentalists call the
``charismatic macrofauna'' of the habitat, the animals that the
public will support and visit. To achieve true diversity, equal
attention must be paid to the ``enigmatic microfauna.'' Ants,
earthworms and butterflies are also the subject of much work at the
refuge.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the regal fritillary, a prairie butterfly
resembling a monarch but with a purple tint and large white spots
on its hind wings. In the words of Diane Debinski, an assistant
professor of animal ecology at Iowa State University, regals are
like canaries in a mine shaft: If they can survive, it is an
excellent indicator of high-quality prairie habitat. And like the
buffalo, regals do not do well on isolated patches of prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing a lot of research about the regal
fritillary's behavior at the edge of prairie,'' said Dr. Debinski,
who leads the regal fritillary project at the refuge. ``They really
don't like to leave a prairie. When they hit a cornfield, they
generally turn around and go back into the prairie.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when their habitat is cut up into small pieces,
they do not thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been studying these butterflies since 1994,'' Dr.
Debinski said. ``We looked for them across Iowa in 52 prairies, and
we only found them in 11 prairies. Only 5 of those 11 had
populations over 50 individuals. So they're really not doing well
in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters for these little creatures, their larvae
are finicky eaters. There are only four species of plants they will
eat, and the only one indigenous to Iowa is the blue prairie
violet, another species that is on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   At the refuge, Dr. Debinski is working to re-establish a
population of blue prairie violets. Next year, she will release
regal fritillaries over the violets, hoping they will breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most inspiring project for Iowa that I've seen
since I've been here,'' Dr. Debinski said about the refuge. ``The
scale of it is so immense. It gives us hope that the prairie could
become a functioning ecosystem in this area again.''

`MORE MATTER': MAKING A THING REAL BY PINNING IT DOWN IN WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If one sets up to be a writer,'' John Updike once declared in
a speech, ``one should be able to write anything, from a sonnet to
a sermon, or at least be willing to try.'' This industrious
Victorian ideal of an all-around man of letters seems daunting in
our current age of electronic distraction and willful
specialization, but Updike has succeeded in the course of his
five-decade career in taming if not mastering virtually every
literary form from the novel to the short story, from the poem to
the essay.
</P>
<P>
   In this, his 50th book, he brings together his most recent
nonfiction _ that is, the book reviews, essays, addresses, comic
feuilletons and random, autobiographical jottings written since
``Odd Jobs'' (1991) and ``Hugging the Shore'' (1983). Like those
earlier collections of prose, ``More Matter'' attests to Updike's
remarkable versatility (his familiarity not only with the world of
books but with the worlds of movies, paintings, photography and
cartoons as well) and to his ardent drive to turn all his
observations into glittering, gossamer prose. Indeed, the longtime
observer of his career cannot help but suspect that things only
seem real to Updike if they can be caught and pinned down in a net
of words, that his fascination with the muchness of the world is
matched only by his need to transform that interest into something
hammered and lovely and all his own.
</P>
<P>
   In this volume, Updike ranges freely across the cultural
landscape, tackling both large questions of religion, relations
between the sexes and the American Zeitgeist, and smaller, Andy
Rooney-like matters like the difficulty of opening childproof pill
bottles and the problems created by recalcitrant burglar alarms. He
gives us smart, sparkly profiles of Lana Turner and Gene Kelly,
grapples thoughtfully with the work of Herman Melville, Edith
Wharton and Henry Green, and amplifies the self-portrait he gave us
in his 1989 memoir (``Self-Consciousness'') with a series of
autobiographical asides. His classic study of Mickey Mouse's
evolution can be found in ``More Matter,'' as can a wonderfully
astute appraisal of Saul Steinberg's drawings and their darkening
vision of America and the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   As usual Updike's book reviews demonstrate his own interest as a
craftsman in the techniques employed by other writers and in the
limitations imposed on imaginative freedom by culture and
experience. He's able in passing to give the reader a sense of the
arc of an author's life (he describes Dreiser, for instance, as a
``writer of starts and stops, of elephantine gestation periods and
quasi-religious periods of hesitation and meditation''), and he can
just as easily map the spiritual geography of a writer's oeuvre. Of
Graham Greene, he writes: ``The entire climate and topography of
Greeneland is a kind of self-portrait; its features are pain,
guilt, ennui and lassitude.'' And of Edith Wharton, he observes:
``She learned from Proust the dignity of nostalgia and the value of
each character as a specimen, an index to the species and to broad
laws of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Updike tackles a wide variety of authors, from American
contemporaries like Norman Mailer and Philip Roth to such foreign
writers as Harry Mulisch, Ivan Klima, Manuel Puig and Orhan Pamuk,
he seems less willing in this volume than in ``Hugging the Shore''
or ``Odd Jobs'' to embrace writing that significantly departs from
his own conviction as a novelist that ``a fiction writer's life is
his basic instrument of perception _ that only the imagery we have
personally gathered and unconsciously internalized possesses the
color, warmth, intimate contour and weight of authenticity the
discriminating fiction-reader demands.'' He cavalierly lumps the
work of John le Carre together with that of Tom Clancy, Robert
Ludlum and Frederick Forsyth, and in a much debated review that
originally appeared in The New Yorker, he dismisses Tom Wolfe's
latest novel, ``A Man in Full,'' as ``entertainment, not
literature, even literature in a modest aspirant form.''
</P>
<P>
   This curmudgeonly tone also creeps into other pieces, which
lament the declining market for short stories, the embattled state
of literature in an age of electronic entertainment and the
coarsening of the American psyche. ``We feel bad,'' Updike writes,
``because a once-sinewy nation, exultant in the resourcefulness
that freedom brings, now seems bloated and zombified, pillaged and
crumbling, all around us. Enough of our original Puritanism remains
to generate self-disgust.''
</P>
<P>
   Updike himself points out that as he has gotten older, his
``thoughts have become not only fewer and smaller but more spiteful
and timorous,'' and this tendency makes ``More Matter'' a less
captivating book than his previous nonfiction collections, which
showcased his gifts as an enthusiast capable of using his own
knowledge of the alchemical processes of art to convey the magic of
others' creations.
</P>
<P>
   Matters are not helped in this volume by the author's decision
to include virtually every snippet of writing he has produced in
recent years _ including picture captions for a Playboy spread on
Marilyn Monroe, dutiful responses to questions posed by assorted
publications (like why does he live in New England?) and
one-paragraph-long reviews of books like ``The Hidden Life of
Dogs.'' An imaginary dialogue between Bill Gates and Johann
Gutenberg reads like a silly exercise in the obvious, while another
piece on the male body feels like weary vamping on old gender
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Read selectively, however, ``More Matter'' delights more often
than it disappoints. In his strongest pieces, Updike's awesome
pictorial powers of description combine with a rigorous, searching
intelligence to produce essays of enormous tactile power and
conviction. In such pieces, the author's sheer joy in writing, ``in
making sets of things and in bringing something imperfect closer to
perfection,'' is communicated to the reader. In this volume, Updike
suggests that for him writing provides the ``thrill of the fixed,
the interlocking,'' and a heinst disorder and death. And in
satisfying his own ``itch to charm'' and inform, his best pieces
manage both to edify and to beguile.

`SEEKING SOLUTIONS': SUCCESSES IN THE WAR ON CRIME AND HATRED
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hedrick Smith delivers two and a half hours of good tidings
Wednesday night. Wherever he goes, from Washington, D.C., to Kansas
City to the North Side of Chicago, from a penitentiary in Oregon to
churches in South Carolina to a school in Southern California, he
finds individuals, groups and entire communities working
successfully to battle crime and hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeking Solutions'' begins in Washington at Benning Terrace, a
public housing project with a bad reputation. At night residents
used to lock themselves in their apartments while bullets flew on
the streets. Eight young men were killed in eight months. Finally,
in 1991, the murder of a 12-year-old on his way home from school
roused the neighborhood to action against feuding drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
   A few residents, joined in the Alliance of Concerned Men, went
out proselytizing among gang members. Their credentials were their
own criminal records, which carried credibility on the streets.
Smith reports how in cooperation with a community organizer,
Housing Authority officials and the police, the volunteers
succeeded in brokering a truce that gave the former troublemakers
incentives to improve their neighborhood and train for real jobs.
As they worked together to scrub away the graffiti that marred
their homes, one gang member said it was as though they ``took the
past away.'' The bullets stopped flying.
</P>
<P>
   In another example of community action, neighborhood leaders in
the Blue Hills section of Kansas City joined with the police in
shutting down drug houses and other centers of criminal activity
and fixing up abandoned homes. The crime rate has gone down
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago and in San Clemente, Calif., students are being
taught to live together amicably and resist the lures of crime and
the poison of group antagonism. Smith is persuaded that youngsters
can learn tolerance and can benefit from the experience of others,
even the inmates of the Oregon State Penitentiary who now mentor
teen-agers who seem headed for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran reporter that he is, Smith is careful to note that the
success stories are never entirely successful. Crime has not been
abolished in Chicago or Washington, and pockets of racial
intolerance survive in South Carolina even after a jury awarded
$37.8 million to a rural black church in a decision against some Ku
Klux Klanners. A Washington youth, a father of eight, says, ``I'm
still where I'm at,'' and he fears that when ``my kids get older,
they're going to be right there, stuck just like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet these neighborhoods have changed for the better. What they
have in common by this account is their residents' steady
commitment to improve their lives. Their resolve comes through in
Smith's discussions with parents, teachers and officials around the
country. ``Seeking Solutions'' preaches that where there is a will,
determined folks can find the way.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A cold front will sweep to the East Coast on Tuesday with
showers followed by cooler winds. In the Northeast, clouds will
persist all day, but the rain will be intermittent and mainly
during the afternoon near the shoreline. More heavy rain is likely
along the Southeast Coast as tropical moisture streams north ahead
of Harvey. Sections of the eastern Carolinas could receive over 3
inches of rain, aggravating the cleanup from Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Harvey may strengthen to near hurricane force
before it moves into central Florida. Near and just south of the
storm center, tides will average 3 to 6 feet above normal. Squalls
will bring wind gusts to gale force well inland. The heaviest rain
should fall along and northeast of the storm track. Isolated
tornadoes are also possible near the point of landfall which should
be within 40 miles of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of much cooler air will push to the Gulf Coast.
Clouds will persist in much of Texas with showers likely along the
coast and in the western panhandle. Moisture from decaying
hurricane Hillary in the eastern Pacific will flow into the
Southwest helping to produce showers in sections of Arizona and
parts of southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Very cool air will cover a large portion of the nation from the
central Plains to western New England. Sprawling high pressure in
the Middle West will sponsor sunny skies and a milder afternoon. A
surge of warmer air should reach the Upper Plains Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest will stay bright and quite warm, but ocean clouds
will seep into the coastal valleys of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Autumn By The Bay
</P>
<P>
   Autumn's arrival signals waning warmth in most of the nation,
but in San Francisco, late September is typically the warmest time
of year. In mid-summer, the city by the bay is often cooled by
breezes from the 60-degree ocean water. With the jet stream far to
the north, weather systems are weak, so local winds are the primary
meteorological influence. In early fall, the jet stream shifts
south, steering lows and highs into the Pacific Northwest.
Clockwise flow around high pressure areas brings brisk winds from
the east, which temporarily push the maritime air out to sea.

SCHOOL WILL PUBLISH WEEKLY TABLOID, ONLINE UPDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco State University's longtime
student newspaper, the Golden Gater, is going the way of the
typewriter _ obsolescent.
</P>
<P>
   In a city considered the nation's center for online publishing,
the university's journalism department is making some high-tech
changes to an old publishing tradition to prepare students for the
so-called new media.
</P>
<P>
   Next fall the Gater, currently published twice a week, will
merge with the campus' magazine into a new weekly tabloid called
``Golden Gate Xpress'' and a parallel online version. The online
publication will be updated with breaking news three or four times
a week, said acting department Chairman Austin Long-Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of experience our students need to become
more competitive in the journalism field,'' Long-Scott said. ``More
and more news is online. The (Internet) is becoming the first place
many of our students go for information.''
</P>
<P>
   The move is an expansion of the university's popular journalism
elective, ``Introduction to Online Journalism,'' which has a
waiting list of students trying to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Scott believes San Francisco State is one of the first
colleges to focus on online publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The university's move is welcomed by companies in San
Francisco's Multimedia Gulch that are looking for new talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great idea. It's clear that job opportunities
of the future, of the present for that matter, are online,'' said
David Talbot, founder of Salon.com, an online magazine based in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is just one of many online publications launched from San
Francisco. The explosion also includes CNET's News.com, Wired and
Mother Jones online versions, and Women.com.
</P>
<P>
   Major print newspapers, whose numbers are dwindling nationwide,
also have launched their own online versions.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this means the death of the printed newspaper, local
media experts say, which is why San Francisco State will publish a
weekly news magazine, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is expand the ways in which news is
presented by our publications,'' Long-Scott said. ``We are trying
to do more of that, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   About 80 students a semester will work on Golden Gate Xpress and
the online version, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gater is an old tradition in San Francisco student
publishing and was a starting point for many who are now
journalists in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shame,'' said one of them, Gater alumnus and Examiner
copy editor Geoff Link. ``The Gater was a great paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad the Journalism Department has taken such an
elitist attitude about journalism. The online audience for news
does not include most of the people in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Link, the paper's editor in 1964-65, remembers when the Gater
was a 9,000-circulation daily that managed to cover news beyond the
campus' borders.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the Gater sent a reporter to Selma, Ala.,
and he and another Gater editor went to Mississippi and covered the
Freedom Summer civil rights campaign in 1964, and the Gater was the
first in the Bay Area to write about the 1963 protests at San
Francisco's Mel's Drive-In for its allegedly discriminatory hiring
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the best civil rights coverage in the city,'' said
Link.
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Gater'' first appeared on a campus publication in
1931, according to university archivist Helene Whitson. The
journalism department then used the name for the campus newspaper
in 1959, she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the student strike of 1968, the Associated Students took
over the Gater from the journalism department. Soon after, the
journalism department created the Phoenix as an alternative paper.
</P>
<P>
   Financial failings and lack of interest killed the Gater in
1972. From 1974-78, students formed another paper called Zenger's
to take its place, but in 1979 it was renamed the Golden Gater.
</P>
<P>
   The Gater and Phoenix, both run by the journalism department,
competed until they combined around 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sad about (losing the Gater),'' said retired
journalism advisor Jerry Werthimer, who worked with student
journalists from 1960 to 1995. ``I think it's got a great
tradition. And the campus deserves a first-rate paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the university's publishing changes are a sign of the times,
said Ben Bagdikian, former dean of the University of California at
Berkeley graduate journalism school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural thing for students interested in journalism to
be trained to do what obviously is going to be done in the
professional publications,'' he said.

THE ANIMATED BOOM DRAWS FROM ALL KINDS OF REAL LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Will somebody turn that freakin' music off!''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Langham is blowing out his voice again.
</P>
<P>
   On this August night, the comedic actor is sitting in front of a
microphone inside a roomy recording studio in Santa Monica, Calif.
He's belting out the lines of Andy French, a 25-year-old
two-dimensional denizen of the colorfully painted urban zone known
as ``Mission Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The animated sitcom of the same name has its premiere at 8
Tuesday night before moving to 7 p.m. Fridays Oct. 8. It's the WB
network's first entry into the increasingly crowded realm of
prime-time TV animation.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the L.A. recording studio this night are Scott Menville,
the voice of Andy's kid brother Kevin, whom Andy is forced to take
in when their parents move to Wyoming; Vicki Lewis, who voices one
of their roommates, a flower child aptly named Posey; Brian Posehn,
the voice of the other roommate, an extreme slacker named Jim; and
Nick Jameson, who has six different speaking parts on the episode.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind a table facing the actors is one half of the
show's creative team, Bill Oakley, and his wife, following along on
their scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Like many producers in animation, Oakley and his partner, Josh
Weinstein, earned their stripes on ``The Simpsons,'' the
long-running Fox series that brought cartoons back to prime time 10
years ago. And, like most, they like to record scenes over and
over, trying out a variety of voice inflections and then
cherry-picking their favorites in the edit room.
</P>
<P>
   This does not favor Langham, a regular on HBO's ``The Larry
Sanders Show'' and NBC's ``Veronica's Closet,'' who has never had
formal voice training. Not only does Andy have the most lines, but
he also has the most expectorations _ lines like ``Will somebody
turn that freakin' music off!'' And since this is TV, taping
sessions are marathon affairs. No wonder Langham is hoarse
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who was a regular on the sitcom ``NewsRadio,'' is having
an easier time. With her background in stage and song, Lewis' vocal
cords have no trouble standing up to hours of voice work. (It also
helps that Posey speaks in nothing but delicate tones.)
</P>
<P>
   Langham and Lewis were both hired for ``Mission Hill,'' in part
for their voices, but in part because viewers know who they are.
Ten years ago, when Fox decided to take a chance and turn Matt
Groening's animated shorts for ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' into the
Sunday-night series ``The Simpsons,'' the voices were performed by
relative unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   Most latter-day cartoons have a star or two on board, probably
for the same reason that Sprint pays David Duchovny to read its
commercials. Familiar is good.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Mission Hill'' is going to need all the star power it can
get. Animated sitcoms are one of the year's hottest programming
trends, but they are rapidly beginning to glut the airwaves. Fox
already has five prime-time cartoons: Sunday-night shows ``The
Simpsons,'' ``Futurama,'' and ``King of the Hill'';
Thursday-nighter ``Family Guy''; and ``The PJ's,'' which is
returning at midseason. UPN has one, ``Dilbert'' (Tuesdays), based
on the Scott Adams comic strip. NBC has two arriving at midseason,
and the WB has one planned for January and another for next fall
(see box).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Hill'' will stand out, say its creators, because it's
the only cartoon that revolves specifically around the culture of
teen-agers and young adults. The semi-neurotic Andy, for instance,
will move from one low-paying service job to the next in his
cartoon world, and an entire episode of ``Mission Hill'' will
satirize MTV's ``The Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   But will its intended audience of 20-something viewers even see
the show when it moves to Fridays? And is it provocative enough to
persuade them to stay home from dates and the movies to watch?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, behind animation's innocent-looking tableau, there
lurks a creative Trojan horse. Through it a comedy writer can sneak
in lots of sexual innuendo, black humor and social satire that
network censors wouldn't hesitate to strike from a live-action
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Hill'' does not go to the extremes of ``Family Guy,''
a cartoon that instantly enraged Jewish groups with its Nazi-themed
parodies. That show also features a talking baby with an advanced
Oedipal complex _ he wants to kill both his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Guy'' has done so well that Fox is moving it to
Thursday nights, where it will oppose ``Frasier'' on NBC. (The
network did the same thing nine years ago when it pitted ``The
Simpsons'' against ``The Cosby Show.'')
</P>
<P>
   In March ``Futurama,'' from Simpson's creator Matt Groening,
transported us to the year 3000, where anybody opting out of
everyday life could simply step into a portable suicide booth.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with those shows and such animated cable hits as
``South Park'' and ``Celebrity Deathmatch'' _ a grotesque MTV
series in which Claymation replicas of TV and movie stars dismember
each other _ ``Mission Hill'' is relatively tame.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its opening episode is likely to draw attention _ both
positive and negative _ for including what is probably network TV's
first gay make-out scene. It involves two middle-aged men who live
in the same building as the show's lead characters and will be
regular characters on the show. ``Mission Hill'' also has some
borderline-offensive humor, mostly sexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely push the envelope, which as an actor makes it
more fun, because we're able to get away with some really raunchy
stuff,'' said Menville, the voice of Kevin, who has had speaking
parts on Saturday-morning cartoons since he was 11.
</P>
<P>
   They make voices
</P>
<P>
   Back at the recording studio, Oakley's current concern is
getting the voice of the highway patrol radio announcer just right.
It's only one of 20 or so incidental parts that will be dropped
into the episode, but if they're done in just the right voice, each
one will be a bankable laugh.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Mission Hill,'' most of those voices are supplied by just
two men, Tom Kenny and Nick Jameson. In the main credits they are
listed as the voices of the older gay couple, Gus and Wally, but in
reality more than half the characters in every show are theirs. (On
``The Simpsons,'' the two main voice multipliers, Hank Azaria and
Harry Shearer, have become fan favorites.)
</P>
<P>
   In one episode Jameson has 13 speaking parts, and on the
mid-1990s cartoon ``The Critic'' he routinely furnished 20 to 30
voices per episode.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how Jameson does it, think of a celebrity
impersonator put through a karaoke machine. By taking a familiar
voice and modifying its tone, pacing and regional accent, a
professional voicer can create myriad variations.
</P>
<P>
   For the part of Mr. French, Andy and Kevin's dad in ``Mission
Hill,'' Jameson said, ``I did a sort of bad Jack Nicholson.
Actually, what I did was I had a Nicholson and then I said: What if
you took all the macho out of him? You'd get'' _ and out came the
voice of Jack on Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep a list of influences,'' said Jameson as he reached into
his briefcase. He pulled out a ``reference sheet,'' a two-page
single-spaced list of more than 200 names. Under ``H'' the names
included Jimi Hendrix, Katharine Hepburn, William Hickey, Alfred
Hitchcock, Dustin Hoffman, Sterling Holloway and Huckleberry Hound.
</P>
<P>
   H also stands for ``Hawaiian.'' In a recent episode Jameson
impersonated a Korean grocer, but when one of the producers said it
sounded too much like a voice he'd heard on ``King of the Hill,''
Jameson improvised, flavoring the Korean accent with what he called
``Hawaiian pidgin.'' The resulting hybrid was not only distinctive
but also politically correct: You couldn't tell what nationality it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from its first episode, ``Mission Hill'' lives up to the
pedigree of its talented producers (see review). But that may not
be enough to make it a hit. Despite its stated objective of
reaching the WB's target viewer (median age: 26), ``Mission Hill''
probably will live or die based on how many teens watch.
</P>
<P>
   Teens are the main audience for animation: ``Family Guy'' and
``The Simpsons'' were the No. 2- and No. 3-rated shows last season
among viewers ages 12-17, with ``Futurama'' at No. 12 and ``The
PJs'' No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Tooning up for midseason
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Hill'' is the first of all/ the current prime-time
animated shows to be launched in the fall TV season.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is bottom-line. Networks prefer to debut cartoons in
January because it makes good money sense. Animation takes months
of lead time to produce, so if a new animated show airs at
midseason and flops, the network is stuck with only 10 finished
episodes, not 20. If the show's a hit, the network has all summer
to crank out new episodes for the next fall.
</P>
<P>
   The WB plans another animated series at midseason, ``Baby
Blues,'' based on the popular comic strip. NBC also will air two
animated series at midseason: ``God, the Devil and Bob,'' with
James Garner supplying the voice of God; and ``Sammy,'' a vehicle
for ``Just Shoot Me'' star David Spade, based on his relationship
with his father.  &LR; tag2:_ Aaron Barnhart//The Star

CUBAN BAND LOS VAN VAN IN U.S. FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LISETTE GARCIA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Los Van Van _ Cuba's greatest dance band
under communist leader Fidel Castro _ will be in Kansas this week,
celebrating 30 years of innovative sound and the debut of its first
American album.
</P>
<P>
   The band's tour and album ``Llego Van Van'' _ which translates
``Van Van has arrived'' _ sidesteps tricky U.S.-Cuba trade
relations, whose history dates to President John F. Kennedy's
blockade on goods and services from the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just grateful to be here,'' said the group's musical
director Juan Formell in a phone interview with The Star. ``The
U.S. is the pinnacle of success.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is slated to play its salsa-funk fusion Tuesday night
at Liberty Hall in Lawrence, kan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Van Van has performed on U.S. soil for several years,
this anniversary series is the first time the group's music will be
sold under an American label: Havana Caliente of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Formell said another difference is that the 15-piece ensemble
will earn a cut of profits from the sale of recordings and tickets
in the United States. The musicians formerly were considered
24-hour employees of the socialist state and earned a fixed salary
until Castro recently loosened the reins on artists, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loopholes like this avert U.S. sanctions and ruffle some
government officials and anti-Castro Cuban exile groups.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami this month, community pressure forced the postponement
of the band's scheduled Oct. 9 concert. The concert has been
rescheduled for Oct. 11, pending an audit of Van Van's tour
finances. If concert records show that the band is sharing in U.S.
profits, a violation of the members' visas, Miami Mayor Joe Carollo
said he will cancel the show again.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Van controversy wasn't the only one last week involving
a Cuban band. Two members of another popular group, Sintesis,
requested political asylum Thursday at the office of U.S. Rep.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Democrat, while enroute to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Formell told The Star that interpreting Van Van's visit as
anything more than entertainment is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Castro rhetoric, reported in his nation's official daily, holds
that sold-out U.S. performances by Cuban artists are political
conquests in ``enemy Yankee territory'' and that ``culture is a
weapon of the revolution.'' Formell flatly refutes these slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that,'' Formell said. ``Art is art and a
universal act. Either you do it right, it transcends and you rise.
Or it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has increasingly depended on money from tourism and the
arts to support his regime, since losing its subsidy from the
fallen Soviet Union in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming the U.S. embargo for Cuba's marked demise in the last
decade is simply a device, Formell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marketing tool. Cuba is not even ranked among the
world's 10 poorest countries,'' Formell said. ``If it sells, so be
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites the recent example of ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' an
independent film hit in which Ry Cooder dusts off forgotten Cuban
troubadours and parades them at a Carnegie Hall recital in New
York. Formell said: ``All's fair in love and sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't allow myself to be used that way. But I might if I
was a has-been, trying to make ends meet on a measly retirement
check each month.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbarito Torres, Van Van's special guest tonight, was featured
in ``Buena Vista,'' jamming in Jimi Hendrix-fashion on the laud, an
ancient mandolinlike instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame them,'' Formell said. ``It's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Formell doesn't care who sits at the helm of one
country or another, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, I listen to Beethoven and I don't care who wasduring that period,'' Formell said. ``People should just listen to
me for me.''

   BBN-BRAVES-METS _ ATLANTA _ The Braves and Mets will play six
times over the next 10 days, both teams with an eye on the NL East
championship. As they prepare for the crucial stretch, the teams
are using extremely different pitching philosophies. The Mets have
used a six-man starting rotation in recent weeks and have been far
more reliant on their bullpen than the Braves, who have had bullpen
problems and have relied on the strong starting pitching of Greg
Maddux and Kevin Millwood. A look at the pitching staffs of the

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two American spacecraft are approaching Mars, the second wave of
economy-class robotic orbiting and landing parties in an ambitious
revival of exploration of the red planet.
</P>
<P>
   One spacecraft, scheduled for arrival on Thursday, is to orbit
the planet and study its atmosphere, prospect for water and
generally observe weather through the seasons of a full Martian
year (687 days). The second craft is on course for a landing on
Dec. 3 at the edge of the south polar ice cap, where the terrain is
thought to hold a layered record of the planet's climate history.
</P>
<P>
   Mission officials at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., said Monday that both spacecraft, Mars Climate Orbiter and
Mars Polar Lander, are in excellent condition and ready for their
arrival. Last week, the orbiter fired thruster jets to fine-tune
its aim on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Though relatively modest in cost and scope, the missions are
integral steps in a long-term strategy of sending small spacecraft
to Mars at each 26-month opportunity when the orbital relationship
is right. Orbiters, landers, roving surface vehicles, balloons and
miniaturized airplanes _ at all times over the next decade or more
there should be a robotic presence on and over Mars. Their
objectives are to map the entire planet and its resources and scout
out clues to conditions there in an earlier, more temperate epoch.
</P>
<P>
   Eventual objectives are to return samples of rock and soil,
perhaps by 2008, and someday send astronauts for a long visit.
Behind this methodical approach is the enduring question of whether
life ever emerged on Mars and left some fossil traces, and whether
it still exists in some moist recesses of this cold, arid world.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from the fictional travels to Mars that once
fired the human imagination. In the marvelous tales of Edgar Rice
Burroughs, also creator of Tarzan, the gentleman-adventurer John
Carter simply closed his eyes and wished himself all the way to
Mars (Barsoom in the novels), where he found spired cities,
eight-legged beasts of burden and, not least, the beautiful Dejah
Thoris, the princess he wooed and won.
</P>
<P>
   Real-life exploration of Mars has proved to be tame stuff by
potboiler standards. Long after the Martians of legend vanished,
two spacecraft landed there in 1976 in search not of a princess but
of the merest trace of microbial life in the red dust. Finding
nothing, and under tighter budget limits, scientists have turned to
the even more plodding operations of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do a whole lot more with less,'' said Dr. Sam
Thurman, flight operations manager of the current missions. ``The
public and Congress have told us, `Space is neat, but it's got to
be done at less than a billion dollars a pop.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was the price tag on the Mars Observer spacecraft, which
failed just before reaching the planet in 1992. The failure was
particularly devastating because the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration had put all its eggs in one basket, and was left
with nothing. The Viking life-seeking missions in 1976, though
operational successes, cost more than $2 billion, a figure no
longer acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, as a result of NASA orders to develop ``cheaper,
better, faster'' science missions, the complete cost of the present
Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander missions has been kept to $327.5
million, Thurman said. This represents a further paring of
expenditures over the first two missions in the current program.
The Pathfinder spacecraft, which landed with its little Sojourner
rover two years ago, cost $270 million. Another $300 million went
for the orbiting companion, Global Surveyor.
</P>
<P>
   Global Surveyor is still going strong, returning the most
detailed pictures ever for mapping the planet. The pictures of
widespread water erosion and magnetic data showing that in an early
period the planet churned with internal heat have further
encouraged planetary geologists in their view that ancient Mars was
a more Earthlike place, with abundant water, and could have
supported the beginnings of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to understand the history of that planet from a
biological perspective,'' Dr. Charles Elachi, director of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory's space and earth-science programs, said in
an interview with Sky &AMP; Telescope magazine. He has been in charge
of developing the current Mars exploration strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to answer some of the life and climate questions,
the orbiter is equipped to examine the temperatures, dust and
clouds in the planet's atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon
dioxide, and especially look for water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very important part of trying to understand Mars'
climate,'' said Dr. Richard W. Zurek, the chief mission scientist.
``We want to learn how water gets into the atmosphere, where it
comes from and where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched last December, the 1,387-pound Climate Orbiter is
approaching the northern half of Mars. A 16-minute firing of the
craft's main rocket should slow it down to enter a wide-ranging
elliptical orbit. The spacecraft will loop around Mars once every
14 hours, at first dipping in no closer than 130 miles from the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Then the craft will be maneuvered to a closest approach of 60
miles to use friction from the upper atmosphere to bring its orbit
down to a low circular course. This technique, known as
aerobraking, was first demonstrated by Mars Pathfinder in 1997. Its
advantage is economic: The reduction in the amount of fuel needed
for rocket braking means the spacecraft weighs less and could be
launched on its journey by a smaller, less expensive rocket.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of November, the spacecraft should be settled in a
262-mile-high orbit and ready to support the Polar Lander's planned
90-day operations on the surface. During that time, the orbiter is
to serve as a communications satellite, relaying radio
transmissions between the lander and Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,270-pound Polar Lander, 3.5 feet tall and 12 feet wide, is
targeted to touch down on a broad, gently rolling plain near the
south pole. Specifically, the landing site is a rectangular area
125 miles long and 12 miles wide, at 76 degrees south latitude, 195
degrees west longitude.
</P>
<P>
   At landing time, it will be the end of spring in the planet's
southern hemisphere. The site will be in 24-hour daylight, critical
to operations of the solar-powered craft's systems. The thick polar
ice cap, in seasonal retreat, will be farther south. But drilling
into the frozen surface, the spacecraft should be able to
investigate subterranean water ice and the details of the layers of
dust and ice deposited there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this layered terrain is a record of climate change
on Mars,'' Zurek said. ``In a sense, digging into the surface will
be like reading tree rings or layers in an ice core.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Greeley of Arizona State University, a member of the
lander science team, said a study of the thickness and geometry of
the polar layered terrain should test ``some of our ideas of how
the layers relate to the planet's climate history'' over millions
of years.
</P>
<P>
   The lander's 6.5-foot-long digging arm will probably take two
days to scoop up soil samples and deliver them to an oven. Gases
from the heated samples will be analyzed for any evidence of water
vapor, among other things. Then the lander's cameras and other
instruments are expected to collect data on atmospheric conditions
and weather patterns. A microphone is designed to capture the
sounds of Mars, perhaps the whistling of winds on the robot arm's
digging operation.
</P>
<P>
   To supplement some of its own explorations, the lander is
supposed to release two projectiles about 10 minutes before
touchdown. These probes are to crash at 400 mph and bury themselves
beneath the surface, where they will draw soil samples for heating
and another search for vaporized water ice.
</P>
<P>
   By March, when the lander's operations should be ending in the
approaching polar darkness, the Climate Orbiter is scheduled to
begin its own primary mission. One of its two science instruments
is an infrared radiometer for measuring temperatures, dust, water
vapor and clouds in the atmosphere from the surface to an altitude
of 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The orbiter also carries a color imaging system, combining
digital wide-angle and medium-angle cameras, developed by Dr.
Michael Malin of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego. The
wide-angle camera will be used for daily global pictures of the
Martian atmosphere and surface. The medium-angle instrument should
provide more detailed pictures of surface changes related to
weather and seasonal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Because temperatures on the planet rarely rise above freezing,
most water there is probably stored in the ground, chemically and
physically bound to the soil or as ice. This may be especially true
in the polar regions. Wherever water is, the orbiter's mission is
to investigate its distribution and search for possible surface and
subsurface reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Climate Orbiter cruises toward its encounter, all is
quiet for flight controllers. Their simulations are completed. All
instructions for maneuvers have been radioed to the spacecraft's
computers. And Polar Lander, with another two and a half months to
go before its arrival, is essentially flying on autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, the controllers will be busy operating two vehicles
at once, and the Global Surveyor as well. As another concession to
the budget crunch, said Thurman, the flight operations manager, the
ground support team has been trimmed to 80 people. Seven years ago,
Mars Observer had a team of more than 200. And in the 1970s, the
Vikings had 500.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The little boy is no more than 7 or 8. He's
telling me that his sister was shot the night before in the same
way one might declare the day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours earlier, his sister had been one of the 14
people hit by bullets sprayed into a Wednesday-night church service
in Fort Worth by a man who would then turn the gun on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people, mostly teen-agers, were killed. The little boy's
sister, though, was one of the lucky ones. She managed to cheat
death.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with my body folded into a little blue chair in front
of my daughter's third-grade class, I simply wanted to forget his
words.
</P>
<P>
   But I couldn't. Even in the midst of reading to the class ``The
Elephant Prince,'' an old Nordic tale about the power of love, the
little boy's voice echoed in my head like thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Job's age-old question posed in the Old Testament when he was
confronted by his friends Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar was my own:
``But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place for
understanding?''
</P>
<P>
   Not even a book, my great invincible companion, the one that all
of my life allowed me to travel the world without ever leaving the
room, could bring me peace. Indeed, it may as well have never been
written. The only words hanging onto me now belonged to the little
boy. They owned me, because they reminded me of how closely related
we all are.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know his sister, but I was face to face with a little
boy my daughter, Asha, knew as David. Before the day would end, I
would learn that another child's sister, Cassandra Griffin, was
familiar to me as well. She played clarinet in the North Crowley
High School band, as did my niece, Jana. And I'd cheered for her
when she played basketball with Jana.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Cassie,'' as her friends called her, was one of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   And now, even with a book in my hand, the world seemed so small
and no amount of words, not even ones that evoke the powerful
message that love conquers all, could choke the terrifying pain in
my throat.
</P>
<P>
   No, I needed answers. I needed to be able to explain to my
daughters why the world isn't safe anymore. Not front yards. Not
school. Not even church.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Job asked: ``But where shall wisdom be found? And where
is the place for understanding?''
</P>
<P>
   The grim irony in this tragedy, perhaps, is that for many of us,
that place is often the church.
</P>
<P>
   What we tend to forget, however, is that even the church isn't
perfect, if for no other reason than we _ human beings _ make up
its members.
</P>
<P>
   There's a song my church choir likes to sing that says whatever
one needs, it can be found in the house of God. It's a true saying.
There is love there. Peace. And joy. Whatever you need.
</P>
<P>
   But church can be a dark and lonely place, too. There, you can
also find bigotry and hatred, the kind 47-year-old Larry Ashbrook,
the gunman, brought with him last week to Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but wonder if this was the kind of place
Ashbrook found when he visited church; if that's why he drove
nearly 20 miles from his home in Forest Hill, a Fort Worth suburb,
before stopping in Wedgwood to unload his rage.
</P>
<P>
   That is as much an indictment against the church as it is a plea
for it to live up to its most basic principle, to love one another,
to treat others as we would have them treat us.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, Jesus told Peter if you love me, feed my sheep. And
he said this also: Insofar as you have done it unto the least of
these, you have done it unto me.
</P>
<P>
   People are always in great danger when they know what they
should do and refuse to act. And so you have to wonder if our
failure to keep God's first commandment has brought the church to
the dangerous place we find ourselves in today.
</P>
<P>
   News stories quoted neighbors as saying Ashbrook was a loner who
never talked to anyone. Wednesday night, he did a lot of talking,
spouting obscenities and demeaning worshippers' beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder what might have happened had people responded
before it got to that; if they had put aside their preconceived
notions and told him that God can replace even lost dreams.
</P>
<P>
   When the King learns in ``The Elephant Prince'' that his
daughter is sad, he declares that whoever can climb the hill and
bring her happiness will win her hand in marriage and rule half the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   God promises his kingdom to us if we accept his son as lord and
master of our lives. But it doesn't stop there. He said, if you
love me, feed my sheep.
</P>
<P>
   We may never be able to fully explain Wednesday night's tragedy
to our children. We may never find an answer to the violence
destroying them. But we will all have to give an account for those
moments when we had the opportunity to love, to do the right thing,
and chose not to.

   Seven people, mostly teen-agers, were killed. The little boy's
sister, though, was one of the lucky ones. She managed to cheat
death.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with my body folded into a little blue chair in front
of my daughter's third-grade class, I simply wanted to forget his
words.
</P>
<P>
   But I couldn't. Even in the midst of reading to the class ``The
Elephant Prince,'' an old Nordic tale about the power of love, the
little boy's voice echoed in my head like thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Job's age-old question posed in the Old Testament when he was
confronted by his friends Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar was my own:
``But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place for
understanding?''
</P>
<P>
   Not even a book, my great invincible companion, the one that all
of my life allowed me to travel the world without ever leaving the
room, could bring me peace. Indeed, it may as well have never been
written. The only words hanging onto me now belonged to the little
boy. They owned me, because they reminded me of how closely related
we all are.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know his sister, but I was face to face with a little
boy my daughter, Asha, knew as David. Before the day would end, I
would learn that another child's sister, Cassandra Griffin, was
familiar to me as well. She played clarinet in the North Crowley
High School band, as did my niece, Jana. And I'd cheered for her
when she played basketball with Jana.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Cassie,'' as her friends called her, was one of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   And now, even with a book in my hand, the world seemed so small
and no amount of words, not even ones that evoke the powerful
message that love conquers all, could choke the terrifying pain in
my throat.
</P>
<P>
   No, I needed answers. I needed to be able to explain to my
daughters why the world isn't safe anymore. Not front yards. Not
school. Not even church.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Job asked: ``But where shall wisdom be found? And where
is the place for understanding?''
</P>
<P>
   The grim irony in this tragedy, perhaps, is that for many of us,
that place is often the church.
</P>
<P>
   What we tend to forget, however, is that even the church isn't
perfect, if for no other reason than we _ human beings _ make up
its members.
</P>
<P>
   There's a song my church choir likes to sing that says whatever
one needs, it can be found in the house of God. It's a true saying.
There is love there. Peace. And joy. Whatever you need.
</P>
<P>
   But church can be a dark and lonely place, too. There, you can
also find bigotry and hatred, the kind 47-year-old Larry Ashbrook,
the gunman, brought with him last week to Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but wonder if this was the kind of place
Ashbrook found when he visited church; if that's why he drove
nearly 20 miles from his home in Forest Hill, a Fort Worth suburb,
before stopping in Wedgwood to unload his rage.
</P>
<P>
   That is as much an indictment against the church as it is a plea
for it to live up to its most basic principle, to love one another,
to treat others as we would have them treat us.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, Jesus told Peter if you love me, feed my sheep. And
he said this also: Insofar as you have done it unto the least of
these, you have done it unto me.
</P>
<P>
   People are always in great danger when they know what they
should do and refuse to act. And so you have to wonder if our
failure to keep God's first commandment has brought the church to
the dangerous place we find ourselves in today.
</P>
<P>
   News stories quoted neighbors as saying Ashbrook was a loner who
never talked to anyone. Wednesday night, he did a lot of talking,
spouting obscenities and demeaning worshippers' beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder what might have happened had people responded
before it got to that; if they had put aside their preconceived
notions and told him that God can replace even lost dreams.
</P>
<P>
   When the King learns in ``The Elephant Prince'' that his
daughter is sad, he declares that whoever can climb the hill and
bring her happiness will win her hand in marriage and rule half the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   God promises his kingdom to us if we accept his son as lord and
master of our lives. But it doesn't stop there. He said, if you
love me, feed my sheep.
</P>
<P>
   We may never be able to fully explain Wednesday night's tragedy
to our children. We may never find an answer to the violence
destroying them. But we will all have to give an account for those
moments when we had the opportunity to love, to do the right thing,
and chose not to.

WHEN IT COMES TO A TAX CUT, LET'S ACT LIKE A SMART FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress, take heed: Accept the veto. This is not the time for a
fat tax cut financed by borrowing from the future. Not if we're
serious about shoring up the Social Security trust fund for future
retirees. Not if we really want quality education for all of
America's children. Not if we're sincere about filling in the
glaring gaps in our health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Not if we meant it when we said we're ready to turn over a new
leaf with the new millennium, stop running deficits and begin
making payments on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly not if the big beneficiaries of this tax gift are
to be people like Bill Gates and the other instant billionaires
that our soaring prosperity has spawned. Not if it's a tax cut for
those who need one the least.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders of the House and Senate announced at the
beginning of the August recess that they were going to the people
with their plan for a $792 billion tax cut. They were going to
build up such a crescendo of public demand that President Clinton
would be bombarded with letters, petitions and phone calls to
convince him that America's millions want nothing else so much as a
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   From all accounts, the effort backfired. People said they'd
rather pay off at least some of our debts first. Cut the interest
payments that are eating our lunch. Replace inadequate school
buildings and hire more teachers so our kids have fewer in their
classrooms and get more attention. These, according to all the
polls, are the American peoples' priorities. Not a whopping tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Now a group of Senate Republicans is arguing that we can do all
these things and also have a hefty tax cut simply by tapping into
predicted future budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Where would they start? Well, they say, the first thing _ just
for this year, mind you _ would be to borrow from next year's
Social Security surplus. It would only be temporary, see, and then
when things got better we could ...
</P>
<P>
   Where've we heard that before?
</P>
<P>
   They'd call it an ``advance funding plan,'' says Sen. Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania, member of the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this wouldn't amount to yet another smoke-and-mirrors
gimmick, Specter replied that ``the real reality is how smoky is
the smoke and how reflective are the mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's pretty clear, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   What's clear is that if they have to resort to this kind of game
to justify a huge tax cut, we don't need the tax cut _ least of all
one at just this time.
</P>
<P>
   What makes sense is using a portion of the taxes that come in
during this unprecentedly prosperous year to retire some of the
debt we've been building up, so that it won't continue to mount and
drag us down in future years.
</P>
<P>
   It's Joseph's age-old advice to the pharaoh. Set something aside
in the seven years of plenty. There may be years of need ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It makes good sense for the Treasury, at President Clinton's
direction, to pay off and buy up as much as possible of the old,
high-interest-rate debt that's dragging us down.
</P>
<P>
   Families have done this over the years. When interest rates are
low, as they are now, it's a great time to retire old debt, by
refinancing if necessary, to lower the interest payments. But,
first and foremost, pay off as much debt as we can when we have
extra money, and sock some away for the kids' education.
</P>
<P>
   America's families have had to learn, among other things, the
ruinous cost of letting big debts accumulate to drain away precious
dollars in monthly interest payments. America, at its best, is
nothing less than one big, extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Once, years ago when I was mayor of Weatherford, Texas (which
was then a town of maybe 12,000), we came to the end of a very good
fiscal year. We'd done some good things _ built parks and paved
some streets, bought a small lake and modernized our waste-water
disposal system _ and still had some money left over.
</P>
<P>
   Our wise old city attorney, George McCall, pointed out that we
still had some old, unpaid bonds that were financed many years
earlier at outrageously high interest rates. Some were costing us
almost 5 percent a year! While others (George smiled benignly) had
been negotiated at rates as low as 1.75 percent!
</P>
<P>
   What we did was to use our surplus to buy up and retire as much
as possible of the highest-interest debt. We didn't worry so much
about the 1.75 percent bonds _ just kept paying on them.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials believe they could use a portion of our
expected surplus each year for such a selective buyback to trim the
total public debt from today's $3.6 trillion to less than $2
trillion in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   That would be like a $125 billion-a-year gift to American
taxpayers. It would cut at least that much from the present drag of
approximately $300 billion in carrying charges that we're obliged
to ante up to bondholders every year.
</P>
<P>
   Those interest charges come out first, remember, leaving that
much less for schools, roads, health, public safety, national
defense _ all those positive things that contribute to our
individual and collective wellbeing.
</P>
<P>
   These are things that a prudent family might do with an
unexpected surplus.

WORKING TOWARD A CITY THAT'S SAFER FROM GUN VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In October of last year, Fort Worth businessman Lee Bass called
Joel Glenn, the security chief for the Bass Companies, into his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Bass had heard about a program called Project Exile in Richmond,
Va., in which federal and local law enforcement officials were
combining forces to crack down on gun crimes. The idea was to focus
prosecution in federal courts, which were less clogged than state
courts and provided substantially longer prison time for
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Bass wanted to know what Glenn thought of the concept. Their
conversation led to talks with civic leaders and law enforcement
officials about launching a similar project here. That talk will
become reality on Sept. 29, when the launching of Safe City USA,
modeled after Richmond's strongly successful Project Exile, will be
announced in downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The Safe City program won't guarantee that there won't be future
tragedies like Wednesday night's carnage at Wedgwood Baptist Church
in southwest Fort Worth, in which a deranged loner named Larry Gene
Ashbrook killed seven people and wounded seven others in a
horrifying shooting spree that culminated with his suicide.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Safe City works as well as Richmond's Project Exile,
it likely will result in declines in gun-related crimes, including
murder and armed robbery. And the program won't require passage of
any new laws or any new local tax expenditures, according to its
backers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the year that Project Exile was just getting launched
in Richmond, the Virginia city recorded 140 homicides. Last year,
the number dropped to 94. And in the first eight months of this
year, the city has had only 47 homicides, compared with 67 for the
same period in 1998. Project Exile is given much of the credit for
that decline.
</P>
<P>
   Safe City will be somewhat different from any law enforcement
project ever seen here.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a public-private partnership in which donations from
businesses, foundations and individuals will pay the full cost of
several hundred thousand dollars for a ``media blitz'' designed to
publicize the program and intimidate gun-toting criminals.
Everything from billboards to 30-second TV spots will be employed
to spread the message that ``Gun Crime Means Hard Time.'' A similar
media focus accompanied Project Exile in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   The steering committee for Safe City includes Fort Worth Mayor
Kenneth Barr, Police Chief Thomas Windham, U.S. Attorney Paul
Coggins, Tarrant County District Attorney Tim Curry, the Bass
Companies' Glenn, and Patsy Thomas, executive director of the Crime
Prevention Resource Center, who will coordinate the program.
</P>
<P>
   Under Coggins' direction, the program will utilize resources of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI, the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Secret Service in support
of Fort Worth police.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Terri Moore, who has a wealth of
experience as a federal and state prosecutor, says the prospect of
working in the Safe City program is ``absolutely exciting'' because
of the potential to reduce gun violence and save lives.
</P>
<P>
   If a suspect is caught carrying a gun in the commission of a
crime and the case goes through the state court system, ``this guy
is probably going to be back on the street in a couple of hours''
after posting bail, ``and his case probably won't be heard for a
year or longer,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the suspect goes through the federal system, he will be
immediately jailed and likely denied bail, and his case probably
will be handled within 70 days, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said stiffer federal laws mean that a person who gets a
10-year prison sentence will likely serve nine years or more behind
bars. But a 10-year sentence from a state court may result in only
two years behind bars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Safe City, prosecutors are expected to utilize the federal
Gun Control Act of 1968. That law says it is illegal for felons,
fugitives from justice and others with a blighted status to possess
or sell a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   The boosters of Richmond's Project Exile program range from
President Clinton to the National Rifle Association, which has
touted stronger enforcement of existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Safe City program probably will prove a success. But
it will be difficult for the program to match Richmond's in terms
of the percentages of decline in violent gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Fort Worth already has achieved a dramatic
reduction in crime. While Richmond had 140 homicides in 1997, Fort
Worth had only 64 last year, compared with a record 202 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Safe City looks like a program that will have a
clearly beneficial effect. And in the wake of last week's
nightmarish church shootings, we ought to be looking for every
effective weapon against gun-related violence that we can find.

WE STILL DON'T NEED HATE-CRIME LAWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a fair question: If last week's murders at a Fort Worth
church were a result of the killer's loathing for Christians in
general or Baptists in particular, should the shooting spree be
labeled a hate crime?
</P>
<P>
   The question has come up frequently in the days since Larry Gene
Ashbrook walked into Wedgwood Baptist Church and shot 14 people,
killing seven and wounding seven before committing suicide. We may
never know precisely what motivated the attack, but there is
considerable evidence that he had an ax to grind where religion was
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   If Ashbrook gunned down churchgoers for no reason except that
they were engaged in the practice of religion, then the shootings
should qualify as a hate crime under any conceivable definition of
the term. But let's face it: The hate-crime laws that are so
popular nowadays are not being adopted for the benefit of Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   The laws have been prompted by violence against groups and
individuals that have historically been targets of violent bigotry:
racial minorities, Jews, homosexuals, women. ...
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Christian religious organizations simply aren't
thought of as victims of oppression in this country _ or they
weren't before Wednesday. Larry Ashbrook may have changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   A hate-crime bill failed to make its way through the Texas
Legislature this year, in part because of disagreements about which
groups should be designated for protection. If the legislation is
reconsidered in the next legislative session, the debate will
undoubtedly extend to the question of how specific the law ought to
be in its protection of religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   The argument could go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   And so could the argument about the entire concept of hate-crime
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that groups whose members are too often
targets of violence would favor laws that specifically prohibit
such violence. But there is no act of violence against a human
being that isn't already illegal _ and that doesn't subject the
perpetrator to severe penalties.
</P>
<P>
   One of the vicious bigots who dragged Texas resident James Byrd
Jr. to his death in 1998 has already been convicted. Another has
been convicted but not yet sentenced as of Monday. Would that
killer's eventual lethal injection be any more deadly if he had
been convicted under a hate-crime law?
</P>
<P>
   And if Ashbrook hadn't taken his own life after shooting 14
churchgoers, would Texas need a hate-crime law to prosecute him for
a mass murder that may have been motivated by his apparent enmity
for Christians?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. Capital murder is capital murder, no matter what
the motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many laws passed by legislative bodies in this country,
hate-crime laws are totally unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, on issue after issue, politicians pass laws for
no reason except to placate some individual or interest group that
can deliver votes or campaign contributions. Hate-crime laws are
not adopted to prevent or punish hate crimes; they are adopted for
the gratification of the groups that believe that they are
potential targets for hate.
</P>
<P>
   There's no disputing that we have put laws on the books for
flimsier reasons. But it's high time that we put a stop to the
practice of adopting redundant laws that serve no purpose except to
make somebody feel good.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush was criticized during the legislative
session for not going to bat for the hate-crime proposal, but his
position was perfectly reasonable. If the Legislature had sent him
a bill, he would have studied it and made a decision as to whether
it filled a void in Texas law enforcement or merely duplicated laws
that were already on the books.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way of knowing, of course, but I'm guessing that Bush
would have found the bill to be unnecessary and refused to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need a hate-crime law to prosecute the killers of James
Byrd Jr., and we wouldn't have needed a hate-crime law to prosecute
Larry Gene Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   We just plain don't need a hate-crime law.

 &HT;    Pick an insurance plan to keep you covered
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feel like gambling?
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of employers nationwide will be sending out
stacks of packets filled with pamphlets, brochures, charts and
forms in triplicate in the coming weeks. It's time for open
enrollment at larger companies, with workers rolling the dice on
what kind of health care they're going to get in Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Employees could learn through their packets how to guarantee
well-child care for their babies, brand-name drugs for chronic
conditions and physical therapy in the event of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most workers spend less time examining plans than they spend
ordering a pizza _ the result of being overwhelmed and confused
about what each plan covers. And although employers and insurers
have gotten smarter at explaining health benefits, most workers
still see that folder as a Big Mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found many of them never even read it,'' said David Settle
of Southern Co., which has more than 30,000 employees and recently
revamped its open enrollment package to include quick-comparison
charts of options.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you consider when picking a plan that will
provide _ and pay for _ the health care you need?
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1: Don't pick a plan on the basis of how much is going
to be taken out of your check each week. In recent years, health
plans have been raising their premiums to cover rising expenses. In
response, employers have raised the amount their workers pay in
deductibles and co-payments, and reduced the number of services
covered. So if you go with what looks like the most economical
plan, you might get a shock when you actually receive a medical
bill. ``What might appear to be the cheapest plan might not be the
most cost-effective plan,'' said Dr. Wayne Hoffman, vice president
of medical management at Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 2: Determine your health care patterns. Write down the
doctor and hospital visits you had this year and how the health
plan you picked worked out. Did your claims get paid promptly? Did
your doctors treat you with respect? Was it easy getting the
medications you needed? Decide whether you dealt with annoyances or
serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration: Are you making any life changes in the
coming year? Planning to get married? Will your new spouse need any
kind of treatment _ for diabetes, for example _ you haven't needed
in the past? Thinking about having children? You may want to
compare different plans' coverage of prenatal care. If you're
getting divorced _ and have children _ you will have to pick a plan
that covers their health care regardless of where they are living.
The same is also true for college students.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors to consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More companies are offering domestic partner health benefits,
so unmarried couples should investigate what might be available to
them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parents with chronically ill children should study each plan's
track record with that disease. For example, if you have a son with
asthma, you should check how well the plan educates its members and
whether it is willing to pay for the special medication and
equipment _ such as an inhaler _ needed for your child to be well.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure the network of the plan you pick includes the
doctors and hospitals you expect to use. You can also see if the
plan is accredited with the National Committee for Quality
Assurance (www.ncqa.org), which provides survey information about
patient satisfaction, doctor satisfaction and quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take a special look at prescription drug benefits. As more
medications swamp the market, insurers are ratcheting down what
they will cover, requiring that patients either pick from a certain
list of approved medications, known as a formulary, or pay more to
get drugs that aren't on the list. If you know you need a certain
brand-name medication, call the plan's customer service office to
find out whether that drug is covered. (And if you can't get
through on customer service lines, that is a sign of what you can
expect in the future.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you might want to call your doctors and ask them about
the plans you are considering. They probably know the hassle factor
of each of the plans and may be able to help you decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one-size-fits-all with health plans,'' said Arthur
Levin, director of the Center for Medical Consumers, a New York
nonprofit advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   So open that packet and uncap the ballpoint pen. This year, when
the health care game is over, the winner should be you.

 &HT;    What you should know about: Prostate cancer
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, and
the second deadliest behind lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But chances of survival are high _ if it is diagnosed early.
Tumors generally grow slowly on the prostate, a walnut-size gland
under the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate
surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine flows.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT'S DETECTED
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Digital rectal examination.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test.
</P>
<P>
   WHO SHOULD BE SCREENED
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  All men 50 years and older should get annual PSA tests and
digital rectal exams.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Men at high risk for prostate cancer, including those with
family history of prostate cancer and African-American men, may
want to consider starting screenings at 40.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENS
</P>
<P>
   DURING SCREENING
</P>
<P>
   Digital rectal exam
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The patient bends over, and the physician inserts a gloved
index finger into the patient's rectum. The bent position allows
the doctor to feel for bumps or nodules on the prostate through the
rectal wall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The procedure only takes seconds and is easily tolerated, says
Dr. Fray Marshall, chairman of the urology department at Emory
University School of Medicine (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About one in two detectable prostate bumps prove cancerous.
However, prostate cancer isn't always detectable via DRE.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The exam also can detect enlarged prostates, which are common
in older men, but aren't necessarily cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate-specific antigen test (PSA)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Requires drawing blood.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The test can't specifically diagnose cancer but can indicate
whether something may be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The test looks for antigens, molecules capable of stimulating
an immune response. Prostate-specific antigens are released only by
the prostate gland.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A higher than normal PSA level can reflect anything from an
infection to prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High PSA levels warrant a closer look by a urologist.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO GET SCREENED
</P>
<P>
   Several metro hospitals and clinics are offering free PSA tests
and rectal exams during the next two weeks. Call the American
Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345 or look up the Web site at
www.cancer.org.

BUDDHISM'S RENEWED APPEAL IS ROOTED IN AMERICAN RELIGIOUS HISTORY

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   We are witnessing an extraordinary moment in American religious
history. His Holiness the Dalai Lama has reached the pinnacle of
publishing success: two New York Times bestsellers at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Since a person is more likely to die in a plane crash than write
a New York Times bestseller, for an author to have two books on the
list is big publishing news.
</P>
<P>
   And it is big religion news. No Protestant or Catholic religious
leader has ever achieved such success. Not the pope. Not Billy
Graham. A single religious book, maybe. But not two. The honor has
fallen to the Dalai Lama -- a Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   A best-selling Buddhist in a nation historically tied to
Christianity?
</P>
<P>
   The fourteenth Dalai Lama is the spiritual and political leader
of the Tibetan people. As the reincarnation of the former Dalai
Lamas, he embodies the spirit of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 the Chinese hoped to eradicate Tibetan Buddhism by
taking over his county and forcing him into exile. For the last
forty years he has worked on behalf of his people. In 1989 he won
the Nobel Peace Prize and focused worldwide attention on Tibet's
plight.
</P>
<P>
   That Tibetan Buddhism, a complex philosophy demanding
disciplined meditation and study, should be gaining adherents in
the United States surprises most observers. But to true believers,
this only fulfills ancient prophecy: ``When the iron bird flies,
and horses run on wheels, the Tibetan people will be scattered like
ants across the world, and the Dharma (``truth'') will come to the
land of the Red Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Divinely appointed or not, Buddhism is coming into its own in
the United States. While the contemporary success of Buddhism may
seem something of a koan, its appeal is rooted in American
religious history.
</P>
<P>
   Americans first encountered Buddhism in the middle of the last
century. In 1844 the first European-language introduction to
Buddhism appeared. Combined with the founding of the American
Oriental Society that same year, Americans became aware of Buddhism
as a philosophy distinct from other eastern religions.
</P>
<P>
   In the years following, Asian immigrants brought Buddhism to the
United States and American missionaries encountered Buddhism
throughout the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Americans found Buddhism intriguing -- and a sophisticated
intellectual rival to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Thomas Tweed of the University of North Carolina notes
that between 1893 and 1907 Buddhism was ``in vogue.'' Americans
read about Buddhism in newspapers, magazines and novels. They
attended lectures given by Buddhists and formed Buddhist societies.
Prominent Americans, including the daughter of a Tennessee
governor, converted.
</P>
<P>
   One Baptist minister noted, ``There is great religious unrest
among us, and a growing dissatisfaction with Christianity, that
people are longing for another more satisfying faith, and that the
present is a most favorable time for the dissemination of
Buddhistic views: Shall we all become Buddhists?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1893 a newspaper reported, ``It is no uncommon thing to hear
a New Yorker say he is a Buddhist nowadays.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known Episcopal minister defended his visit to a Buddhist
shrine: ``In these days when a large part of Boston prefers to
consider Buddhist rather than Christian, I consider it to be a duty
of a minister who preaches to Bostonians.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, ministers worried that Buddhism would
displace Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1900, only a couple thousand Americans had converted to
Buddhism. But tens of thousands more were sympathetic to it. A
century later, the ratio is probably similar _ more Americans flirt
with Buddhism than actually embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal? Many late-nineteenth-century Americans sensed a
spiritual crisis. Traditional faiths, particularly Christianity,
failed to account for new scientific questions and social changes.
Buddhism offered alternate ways to understand these problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians believed Buddhism to be more rational than their
own faith and more compatible with science, particularly Darwinism.
Only last summer, conservative Christians in Kansas restricted the
teaching of evolution, thus causing their more thoughtful
co-religionists considerable embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much American Christianity, Buddhism allows for both
rigorous scientific inquiry and faithful spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism was also believed more tolerant than other faiths. With
religious diversity increasing _ both then and now _ Buddhist
insistence on the fundamental truths of all religious paths is
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent survey, Californians identified Buddhists as
``more Christian'' than Christians in their ability to accept
others. Accordingly, Buddhism opens optimistic possibilities for
inter-religious understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Buddhism is as Americans depict it, Americans have long
romanticized Buddhism as a way out of problems created by their own
history _ entangled as it is with western Christianity. Popular
interest in Buddhism tends to reemerge when inherited faiths appear
intellectually inadequate or overly restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, spiritual seekers are going outside tradition and
the question, ``Shall we all become Buddhists?'' seems more
relevant than ever.

 &HT;    Pick an insurance plan to keep you covered
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feel like gambling?
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of employers nationwide will be sending out
stacks of packets filled with pamphlets, brochures, charts and
forms in triplicate in the coming weeks. It's time for open
enrollment at larger companies, with workers rolling the dice on
what kind of health care they're going to get in Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Employees could learn through their packets how to guarantee
well-child care for their babies, brand-name drugs for chronic
conditions and physical therapy in the event of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most workers spend less time examining plans than they spend
ordering a pizza _ the result of being overwhelmed and confused
about what each plan covers. And although employers and insurers
have gotten smarter at explaining health benefits, most workers
still see that folder as a Big Mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found many of them never even read it,'' said David Settle
of Southern Co., which has more than 30,000 employees and recently
revamped its open enrollment package to include quick-comparison
charts of options.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you consider when picking a plan that will
provide _ and pay for _ the health care you need?
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1: Don't pick a plan on the basis of how much is going
to be taken out of your check each week. In recent years, health
plans have been raising their premiums to cover rising expenses. In
response, employers have raised the amount their workers pay in
deductibles and co-payments, and reduced the number of services
covered. So if you go with what looks like the most economical
plan, you might get a shock when you actually receive a medical
bill. ``What might appear to be the cheapest plan might not be the
most cost-effective plan,'' said Dr. Wayne Hoffman, vice president
of medical management at Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield of Georgia.

 &HT;    First lady wins over Esquire writer
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a quest for the real Hillary Rodham Clinton, Atlanta writer
Tom Junod hits the campaign trail with the first lady for an
insightful and irreverent profile in Esquire ($3). Junod examines
the myth and reality of the woman some consider to be the most
polarizing political wife since Marie Antoinette. ``The most
interesting fact about Hillary,'' Junod writes, ``is that so many
men absolutely hate her and that their hatred is not so much
political as sexual. Under the guise of political discontent, men
say things about Hillary they would never say about other women.''
Junod's assessment of the woman who would be senator? She has
pretty eyes, sexy lips and a wicked laugh, and, yes, Junod says,
``I would vote for her in a New York minute.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Teen scene: Teenagers have had such an impact on culture in
the last half of the century that it's hard to imagine a time when
they didn't exist. Actually, says Thomas Hine in American Heritage
($4.95), teenagers did not emerge as a defined group until the
Great Depression. Before then, they were simply young people who
went to work on farms or were sent into factories and mines to help
support their families. After World War II, Hine says, young people
became teenagers ``because we had nothing better for them to do. We
began seeing them not as productive but as gullible consumers. We
defined maturity primarily in terms of being permitted adult vices,
and then were surprised when teenagers drank, smoked, or had
promiscuous sex.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New on the rack: Finally, Architectural Digest has published a
slick magazine for car buffs that can be displayed on coffee
tables. The debut issue of Architectural Digest Motoring ($4)
features a cover shot of Kevin Costner with his 1966 Mustang, an
essay by John Updike, and a consumer article on collectible autos.
Says editor-in-chief Paige Rense: ``Our cars reveal our individual
triumphs, as well as our yearnings; in them we find a concentrated
form of design that is capable of transporting us emotionally even
as it transports us literally.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The newsweeklies: For a while, it looked as if the geeks were
going to inherit the earth. Now, Time ($3.50) reports, the
engineers who ruled Silicon Valley have been replaced by business
school graduates who are taking over what the engineers started.
... In a Newsweek ($3.50) cover story, scientists discuss new
research that suggests that health patterns are determined in the
womb, and that diabetes, obesity, cancer and heart attacks are not
necessarily the result of bad genes. A sidebar explains things
women can do, from preconception care to diet and exercise, to give
babies their best start.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  No pizazz: The New Yorker's ($3) Joe Klein examines the
presidential campaign so far and finds it sorely lacking in style.
That's right, style. There's plenty of substance, Klein writes, but
that's not what the public wants. ``There isn't much fun anymore in
politics,'' agrees former White House speechwriter Peggy Noonan.
``The prissy and the pious and the cautious have taken over.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Picture perfect: In a collector's edition, Life ($3.99)
presents the photographs that remain frozen in our minds, from the
picture of Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas to the
images of the Berlin Wall being torn down. One section is devoted
to celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor and Sally Quinn, who
explain their most memorable photographs of the century. Quinn's is
the picture of a naked Vietnamese girl fleeing a napalm attack.
``When people who had been for the war saw this picture, they
thought, `Oh my God, what are we doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Soccer star Brandi Chastain reveals almost all
(again) for Gear ($3.50) in an interview with Candace Bushnell.
Chastain defends her controversial sports bra exposure at the end
of the Women's World Cup championship match. ... Entertainment
Weekly ($3.95) continues its series on a century of pop culture
with the 100 greatest moments in movies over the past 50 years.
It's no surprise that ``The Godfather'' is No 1.

CALIFORNIANS DIVES INTO UNDERWATER HOCKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Minnesota transplant Dov Cohen was invited
to play hockey with some new friends here, his first thought was to
grab his skates. When the friend said forget the skates, bring the
fins, he figured the game was a ``crazy California thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to try it,'' says Cohen, 32, a scientist from Livermore,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   It took about three dives beneath the surface of the pool for
Cohen to turn this odd new game into a passion, and not much longer
to learn that underwater hockey is played worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Although the obscure sport was started 50 years ago by English
divers looking for something to do in the off-season, San
Francisco's club started just this past summer, with players
ranging from plumbers to management consultants whose ages run from
30 to 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing when compared to any other sport,'' says Andy
Dean, 42, of Santa Rosa, who gave up basketball and football to
play water hockey three years ago. ``The fact that you have to do
something athletic while holding your breath, there's an extra
level to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game that started in England as ``octopush'' involves six
players who don fins, masks and snorkels and dive for brightly
colored pucks at the bottom of the pool. Using only a 10-inch-long
sawed-off hockey stick, they swim to the puck, then compete to push
it to the end of the pool and, with luck, into a trough for a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the players' time is spent with their faces in the
water, and much of the time they are holding their breath.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they get bonked in the head with a fin or knocked with
a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this could be the friendliest sport on Earth. There are
few rules. Fouls are called on the honor system _ usually by the
people who made them. After all, it's not easy to see under water,
and there are no referees for local games.
</P>
<P>
   When a goal is made, almost nobody cheers, high-fives or dances
in the end zone. They're still treading water. In fact, at the end
of the game, often nobody is quite sure of the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no score because nobody cares,'' says Caroline Harris,
39, a member of San Francisco's team who got lured into the sport
15 years ago in her native England. ``And if it were one-sided we
would switch around the players to make it even.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent game, the players look _ from above the water at
least _ like disorganized dolphins having a romp. As colorful fins
and Speedos dart under and over the water in quiet splashes, it
quickly becomes evident when the puck is spotted.
</P>
<P>
   The swimmers swarm around it in what resembles a shark feeding
frenzy. They do this _ alternately holding then gasping breath _
for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Although the game is admittedly tough to follow from the
sidelines, for players the rules are simple. They can't use their
free hand, they can't block another player and they can't shoot the
puck behind the goal. Positions are determined by individual teams,
although there are generally six to a side _ three offense and
three defense. They line up at each end of the pool until someone
shouts, ``Sticks up!'' and then ``Go!''
</P>
<P>
   This sport has some obvious attractions for young and old.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanographer Sean Avent, 28, says he's lost up to 2 pounds in
one game. But he notes that because the game is played in water, he
has little chance of injuring himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no gravity to hurt yourself, so you won't blow a knee
or hurt your bones,'' he said. ``It's very rigorous exercise and
very exhausting. And the great thing about it is you don't realize
you're getting tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Anderson, 70, a retired social worker and veteran diver
from Santa Rosa, has played the game for 27 years. While he can't
get the puck into action as quickly as he'd like, his aim is sharp.
Then there's Cohen, the newcomer who took up the sport two years
ago and couldn't score a goal until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's no surprise that a game invented by divers _ who
live or die by the buddy system _ encourages such noncompetitive
camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good group of people,'' says Cohen. ``The nature of
the sport is very cooperative. They have to watch out for one
another so they're very conscientious.''
</P>
<P>
   He says veteran players always seem happy to show neophytes the
ropes, and are forgiving of the many inevitable errors that happen
in the first year of playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all a little bit crazy,'' says Avent. ``We get along
well.''

possibly spend the giant buckets o' cash he is collecting for his
White House bid? The answer, as it is to too many questions about
turn-of-the-century America, is television. And McKinnon _ former
lead singer for Lazlo Frink and the Odd Sofa Review featuring the
Lazlettes, former short-term jailbird, former media guru for
big-name Democrats _ is the man making the TV ads that will mold
Bush's national persona as well as consume much of his political
cash. So far, that is $50 million. For McKinnon, 44, spending the
Bush money is the latest stop in a magical mystery tour that has
taken him from music to politics to swearing off politics to media

<P>
   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   We are witnessing an extraordinary moment in American religious
history. His Holiness the Dalai Lama has reached the pinnacle of
publishing success: two New York Times bestsellers at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Since a person is more likely to die in a plane crash than write
a New York Times bestseller, for an author to have two books on the
list is big publishing news.
</P>
<P>
   And it is big religion news. No Protestant or Catholic religious
leader has ever achieved such success. Not the pope. Not Billy
Graham. A single religious book, maybe. But not two. The honor has
fallen to the Dalai Lama -- a Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   A best-selling Buddhist in a nation historically tied to
Christianity?
</P>
<P>
   The fourteenth Dalai Lama is the spiritual and political leader
of the Tibetan people. As the reincarnation of the former Dalai
Lamas, he embodies the spirit of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 the Chinese hoped to eradicate Tibetan Buddhism by
taking over his county and forcing him into exile. For the last
forty years he has worked on behalf of his people. In 1989 he won
the Nobel Peace Prize and focused worldwide attention on Tibet's
plight.
</P>
<P>
   That Tibetan Buddhism, a complex philosophy demanding
disciplined meditation and study, should be gaining adherents in
the United States surprises most observers. But to true believers,
this only fulfills ancient prophecy: ``When the iron bird flies,
and horses run on wheels, the Tibetan people will be scattered like
ants across the world, and the Dharma (``truth'') will come to the
land of the Red Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Divinely appointed or not, Buddhism is coming into its own in
the United States. While the contemporary success of Buddhism may
seem something of a koan, its appeal is rooted in American
religious history.
</P>
<P>
   Americans first encountered Buddhism in the middle of the last
century. In 1844 the first European-language introduction to
Buddhism appeared. Combined with the founding of the American
Oriental Society that same year, Americans became aware of Buddhism
as a philosophy distinct from other eastern religions.
</P>
<P>
   In the years following, Asian immigrants brought Buddhism to the
United States and American missionaries encountered Buddhism
throughout the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Americans found Buddhism intriguing -- and a sophisticated
intellectual rival to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Thomas Tweed of the University of North Carolina notes
that between 1893 and 1907 Buddhism was ``in vogue.'' Americans
read about Buddhism in newspapers, magazines and novels. They
attended lectures given by Buddhists and formed Buddhist societies.
Prominent Americans, including the daughter of a Tennessee
governor, converted.
</P>
<P>
   One Baptist minister noted, ``There is great religious unrest
among us, and a growing dissatisfaction with Christianity, that
people are longing for another more satisfying faith, and that the
present is a most favorable time for the dissemination of
Buddhistic views: Shall we all become Buddhists?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1893 a newspaper reported, ``It is no uncommon thing to hear
a New Yorker say he is a Buddhist nowadays.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known Episcopal minister defended his visit to a Buddhist
shrine: ``In these days when a large part of Boston prefers to
consider Buddhist rather than Christian, I consider it to be a duty
of a minister who preaches to Bostonians.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, ministers worried that Buddhism would
displace Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1900, only a couple thousand Americans had converted to
Buddhism. But tens of thousands more were sympathetic to it. A
century later, the ratio is probably similar _ more Americans flirt
with Buddhism than actually embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal? Many late-nineteenth-century Americans sensed a
spiritual crisis. Traditional faiths, particularly Christianity,
failed to account for new scientific questions and social changes.
Buddhism offered alternate ways to understand these problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians believed Buddhism to be more rational than their
own faith and more compatible with science, particularly Darwinism.
Only last summer, conservative Christians in Kansas restricted the
teaching of evolution, thus causing their more thoughtful
co-religionists considerable embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much American Christianity, Buddhism allows for both
rigorous scientific inquiry and faithful spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism was also believed more tolerant than other faiths. With
religious diversity increasing _ both then and now _ Buddhist
insistence on the fundamental truths of all religious paths is
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent survey, Californians identified Buddhists as
``more Christian'' than Christians in their ability to accept
others. Accordingly, Buddhism opens optimistic possibilities for
inter-religious understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Buddhism is as Americans depict it, Americans have long
romanticized Buddhism as a way out of problems created by their own
history _ entangled as it is with western Christianity. Popular
interest in Buddhism tends to reemerge when inherited faiths appear
intellectually inadequate or overly restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, spiritual seekers are going outside tradition and
the question, ``Shall we all become Buddhists?'' seems more
relevant than ever.

 &HT;    What you should know about: Prostate cancer
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, and
the second deadliest behind lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But chances of survival are high _ if it is diagnosed early.
Tumors generally grow slowly on the prostate, a walnut-size gland
under the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate
surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine flows.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT'S DETECTED
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Digital rectal examination.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test.
</P>
<P>
   WHO SHOULD BE SCREENED
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  All men 50 years and older should get annual PSA tests and
digital rectal exams.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Men at high risk for prostate cancer, including those with
family history of prostate cancer and African-American men, may
want to consider starting screenings at 40.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENS
</P>
<P>
   DURING SCREENING
</P>
<P>
   Digital rectal exam
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The patient bends over, and the physician inserts a gloved
index finger into the patient's rectum. The bent position allows
the doctor to feel for bumps or nodules on the prostate through the
rectal wall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The procedure only takes seconds and is easily tolerated, says
Dr. Fray Marshall, chairman of the urology department at Emory
University School of Medicine (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About one in two detectable prostate bumps prove cancerous.
However, prostate cancer isn't always detectable via DRE.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The exam also can detect enlarged prostates, which are common
in older men, but aren't necessarily cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate-specific antigen test (PSA)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Requires drawing blood.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The test can't specifically diagnose cancer but can indicate
whether something may be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The test looks for antigens, molecules capable of stimulating
an immune response. Prostate-specific antigens are released only by
the prostate gland.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A higher than normal PSA level can reflect anything from an
infection to prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High PSA levels warrant a closer look by a urologist.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO GET SCREENED
</P>
<P>
   Several metro hospitals and clinics are offering free PSA tests
and rectal exams during the next two weeks. Call the American
Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345 or look up the Web site at
www.cancer.org.

HOLLYWOOD'S RECYCLING BIN BRIMS WITH STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS .MDNM/
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody knows that Heather Locklear will flex her conniving
muscle on ``Spin City'' this season, fresh from the dead-and-gone
``Melrose Place.'' (And, before that, the late ``T.J. Hooker'' and
the departed ``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   That Locklear. What a survivor. Or, to be more precise, a
recyclable _ one of those stars who keep turning up time and again
in different seasons on different shows in different roles.
</P>
<P>
   And this season is full of them.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably well aware of the spinoff stars: David Boreanaz
(''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' to ``Angel'') Jennifer Love Hewitt
(''Party of Five'' to ``Time of Your Life''), and Countess Vaughn
(''Moesha'' to ``The Parkers'').
</P>
<P>
   But did you know that ``Snoops'' star Paula Marshall has been
recycled from ``The Wonder Years'' to ``Spin City'' to ``Chicago
Sons'' and last season's ``Cupid''? Or that ``Get Real's'' Debrah
Farentino has bounced from ``Equal Justice'' to ``Earth 2,''
``Hooperman,'' ``McBride and Groom'' and ``EZ Streets?''
</P>
<P>
   Others just hop on other ships as theirs are sinking: Nancy
Travis was ``Almost Perfect,'' so she's back in the CBS comedy
``Work With Me.'' Moira Kelly exited ``To Have &AMP; To Hold'' for
NBC's ``The West Wing''; ``Homicide's'' Richard Belzer bolted with
his conspiracy theories to NBC's ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims
Unit''; Rob Estes latched onto NBC's ``Suddenly Susan'' after
``Melrose Place,'' and Maura Tierney bolted from NBC's
``NewsRadio'' to NBC's ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say Sharon Lawrence found a home on CBS' ``Ladies
Man'' after visiting ``NYPD Blue'' just as Jessie L. Martin found
``Law &AMP; Order'' after too many episodes with that scatterbrained
``Ally McBeal.'' Jason Behr got firm footing on ``Roswell'' after
kicking about on ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   And how about the veterans? Betty White (''Mary Tyler Moore,''
``Golden Girls'') is making trouble in CBS' ``Ladies Man,'' Rue
McClanahan (''Golden Girls'') is making trouble on the WB's ``Safe
Harbor,'' and Buddy Hackett (''The Jackie Gleason Show,''
``Stanley'') is making trouble on Fox's ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Alda (''MASH'') will drop in on ``ER,'' Tyne Daly (''Cagney
&AMP; Lacey,'' ``Christy'') is a regular on ``Judging Amy'' and David
Ogden Stiers (''MASH'') and Swoosie Kurtz (''Sisters'') are,
surprise, a snobby rich couple on CBS' ``Love &AMP; Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Michael Michelle. ``Central Park West'' was
short-lived. ``New York Undercover'' sank two seasons after she got
there; ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' died one season after she
was brought on as a detective.
</P>
<P>
   Just where has she been recycled? ``ER.'' Don't worry. The No. 1
rated series is considered the Titanic of television.

   The release of  &UR; Stanley Kubrick &LR; 's final movie, ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' became an event, says the latest Brill's Content, because
of the machinations of  &UR; Pat Kingsley &LR; , an entertainment publicist
who makes it her business to be professionally conniving.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley's strategy was to pretend that the movie was
extraordinarily sexy, a fabrication that worked only because she
prevented people who were writing about it from seeing it
beforehand. The film's stars were on the cover of Bazaar, Vogue,
Esquire, Good Housekeeping, US, Rolling Stone and Time. Rolling
Stone called it the ``summer's sexiest movie''; Vogue writer  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Powers &LR;  described its ``erotic audacity'' without ever having seen
it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the movie opened, the audience decided how steamy it was. A
month after its premiere, says the magazine, it had taken in $53.5
million; ``The Blair Witch Project'' had earned twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley tried to dissuade reporter  &UR; Katherine Rosman &LR;  from
writing the story _ ``Let it go. Let it die'' _ and then said
mediocre attendance figures were neither her fault nor the actors'.
``That's the movie's fault,'' she said. ``Dead men have no
publicists,'' observes Rosman.

 &HT;    Mets-Braves series has teams 'ready to get it on'By Carroll
Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The National League East comfort zone the Braves have
lived in for the last four years is history. Here come the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   With a dozen games to play and only one game separating them
from second-place New York, the Braves open a three-game series
tonight at Turner Field against their greatest challenger since the
1993 Giants. John Smoltz and Rick Reed are the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of all the talk,'' Braves third baseman Chipper
Jones said. ``Win or lose, I'm ready to get it on and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny how similar the sentiment sounded coming from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get it on,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said after the
Mets' 8-6 win over the Phillies on Sunday. ``(The Braves) probably
watched the end of our game. They know where we are. They know
we're coming.''
</P>
<P>
   No joke. In the most anticipated Braves' regular-season series
in recent memory, Atlanta and the Mets face off in the first of six
games they will play in the next two weeks. The last three are
Sept. 28-30 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest surprise is that several thousand tickets
remain for each of the three games. As of Monday afternoon, 5,000
tickets were left for Tuesday night, 4,500 for Wednesday night and
2,500 were left for Thursday afternoon. But Braves ticket manager
Paul Adams said he expects all three games to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   No more than 4 1/2 games have separated the teams for the last
two months. The Braves have known for a while now their eighth
consecutive division title would have to come at the expense of the
Mets. So the so-called business-like Braves begin a gut-check
series, and it's not even October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our season is on the line, so of course there will be more
excitement,'' Tom Glavine said. ``I don't think that means we'll
play the game any differently. . . . I'd rather have a comfortable
lead, but it's still fun. Two of the most fun years were pennant
races in '91 and '93, but that's because you can look back and say
we won them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have won 13 of their last 18 games against the Mets
over the last two seasons, including taking two of three games
twice this year. Last season, with the Mets wild-card spot on the
line the last three games, the Braves swept them.
</P>
<P>
   But those victories were then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' Smoltz said. ``We proved that, getting
beat by the Pirates year after year and then beating them in the
playoffs. Obviously, that gives you a little more confidence. But
that confidence gets shattered if you don't win right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams realize the importance of the first game or two of
this series, to see who can stake their claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the playoffs,'' Jones said. ``It's all about
momentum and who establishes it first. Usually the one who
establishes it first in the playoffs goes on and wins it.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, both teams are just glad the series is finally
going to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred and fifty games after spring training, we
anticipated this very moment,'' said Mets pitching Al Leiter, who
will start Thursday against Greg Maddux. ``It's exciting. This is
an opportunity few teams get. This is something we should
cherish.''

TWO DEADLY U.S. DISASTERS; YELTSIN'S MISSING FINGERS; THE MOON

<P>
   Q: How many people died in the 1889 Johnstown flood and the 1900
Galveston hurricane?
</P>
<P>
   _ U.C., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: In the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history, 6,000 to
8,000 people were killed when a hurricane struck Galveston on Sept.
8, 1900. The storm, which had winds of 125 mph, submerged the
island and destroyed 3,600 of the 5,200 buildings in the city.
</P>
<P>
   A book released this month, ``Isaac's Storm,'' by Erik Larson,
focuses on the role of National Weather Service meteorologist Isaac
Cline, who survived the storm by floating on the remains of his
house.
</P>
<P>
   There were 2,209 fatalities after the South Fork Dam broke
during a storm on May 31, 1889, pouring the 20-million-ton Lake
Conemaugh into a valley that included Johnstown, Pa., 12 miles
downriver.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnstown Flood National Memorial in St. Michael, Pa.,
includes the remains of the dam and portions of the lake bed. For
more information on the memorial, call (814) 495-4643 or visit the
World Wide Web site www.nps.gov/jofl.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is Boris Yeltsin missing a finger?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.T.K., Dallas
</P>
<P>
   A: The Russian president lost two fingers on his left hand in a
childhood accident involving a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   During the Nazi invasion of Russia, Yeltsin either stole a live
hand grenade from a weapons depot or found it in the woods,
according to press reports. He and a friend were trying to
dismantle the grenade when it exploded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Communist Party presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov
said Yeltsin's missing fingers and Mikhail Gorbachev's birthmark
were satanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's remember the prediction of the apocalypse,'' Zyuganov
said during a campaign speech. ``Two beasts sent by the devil are
coming out of the abyss. The first one has a mark on his head. The
second has a mark on his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Farmers and gardeners are told to plant vegetables such as
potatoes and carrots in the ``dark of the moon,'' and others in the
``light of the moon.'' What is meant by these phrases?
</P>
<P>
   _ H.D., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: The Old Farmer's Almanac defines them according to the dates
of the new moon and full moon.
</P>
<P>
   The dark of the moon occurs from the day of the new moon to the
day of the full moon, and everything else is considered the light
of the moon.

ASHLEY JUDD, TENNESSEE'S ANSWER TO HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Ashley Judd with Tommy Lee Jones in a
scene from ``Double Jeopardy.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Before you go visit Ashley Judd, you'd better think twice.
 &HT;    ``You can't walk into my home without either singing a song or
doing a chore,'' the actress says.
 &HT;    Thank goodness this interview is taking place at Beverly Hills'
Four Seasons Hotel, far from her Tennessee home.
 &HT;    ``If we were at my house, you would be sent right to the sink to
rinse dishes,'' she says. ``Then you could shake out the throw rugs
on the sleeping porch.
 &HT;    ``You know the singer Billy Dean?'' Judd adds. ``Well, he came
over to my house for Christmas. And he's my favorite because he did
a chore and then he sang a song.''
 &HT;    Not the usual Hollywood approach, and indeed it's hard to
believe that the down-home-sounding Judd is a movie star.
Nonetheless, on Sept. 24 the 31-year-old actress will star in
``Double Jeopardy,'' the latest installment in what is rapidly
becoming a creditable career.
 &HT;    Judd's role, as a woman convicted of killing her husband only to
find that she's actually the patsy in his elaborate insurance scam,
was originally intended for Jodie Foster. But the three-time
Oscar-winner had to drop out when she learned that she was
pregnant.
 &HT;    Judd had been interested in the project from the beginning,
however, and was ideally situated when the role suddenly opened up.
 &HT;    ``She had her rep call my office every two weeks to say, `I know
you're meeting with Jodie Foster, but Ashley would still love to do
this role,''' producer Leonard Goldberg says in a separate
interview. ``Ashley really hung in there with it. She has this aura
about her that things are going to work out.''
 &HT;    ``If there is something I want,'' Judd says calmly, ``I will go
after it.''
 &HT;    That aggressiveness might surprise those who knew her when she
was a quiet, bookish girl growing up poor with her extroverted
mother and sister in rural Tennessee. Sometimes forced to live
without electricity, running water or a telephone, Judd recalls,
she and her sister would water down their soup to make dinner
stretch a little further.
 &HT;    ``We didn't have things,'' she says. ``But we had hope, which is
what mattered.''
 &HT;    Her father left the family when Ashley was a baby, leaving Naomi
Judd to raise Wynonna and Ashley on her own. The actress remembers
her mother being a strict disciplinarian.
 &HT;    ``I think she was tough because she was frightened, being a
single parent,'' Judd says. ``You knew when you were in trouble
because the cold, disapproving stare from her was worse than any
other punishment.''
 &HT;    Her sister knew how to finesse their mother, though.
 &HT;    ``Wy could crack her up,'' Judd recalls. ``She would be getting
into trouble, and Wy would put one of those Steve Martin arrows on
her head. Mom would start to laugh.
 &HT;    ``Unfortunately, I didn't have the same wily quality.''
 &HT;    When Judd was a teen-ager, her mother and sister took their
musical act on the road and, improbably, emerged as top-selling
country stars. That left the non-singing sister to be shuttled
between her father and a tour bus, spending a lot of time watching
television by herself.
 &HT;    ``I used to have a crush on David Letterman, until he did the
joke about the Judds,'' she says. ``He would say, `Did you hear
that the Judds have another girl, but she's so ugly they leave her
back home locked in the basement? Every once in a while they throw
her down a canned ham.'''
 &HT;    She winces at the memory. Being a Judd has its drawbacks,
including Naomi Judd's ``Love Can Build a Bridge'' (Fawcett Books,
1994), an autobiography _ later a television miniseries _ which her
daughters found more than a little inaccurate.
 &HT;    ``I'm reading my mom's book going, `This is dubious,''' she
recalls, laughing. ``And then I'm screaming, `Is this true?' But,
you know, mom had a deadline. I couldn't change the information.
 &HT;    ``So you sort of throw your hands up and say, `My reward is in
heaven.'''
 &HT;    But Judd has long since defined herself apart from her musical
relatives. Over the course of a short but star-studded film career
_ including roles in ``Ruby in Paradise'' (1993), ``Heat'' (1995),
``Smoke'' (1995), ``A Time to Kill'' (1996) and ``Kiss the Girls''
(1997) _ she's proven that she's her own woman.
 &HT;    She's also noted for her intelligence _ she graduated Phi Beta
Kappa from the University of Kentucky in Lexington _ an attribute
not always welcome in actresses in male-run Hollywood.
 &HT;    But Judd will have none of that.
 &HT;    ``What? Do I have to downplay my brain for the schmucks?'' she
says. ``Honestly, I think that being perceptive and having
interests is nothing but an asset.
 &HT;    ``I think what shocks people is that I have an urban side,'' she
adds. ``They're stunned that I'm well-rounded in ways they didn't
expect an actress or a Southerner to be. For instance, I walk into
someone's office, and after five minutes they go, `I expected you
to talk about corn bread and quilts.'''
 &HT;    Next up for the actress is a role as a killer in ``Eye of the
Beholder,'' a drama co-starring Ewan McGregor. Judd is outspoken in
her Christian views, but that doesn't stop her from playing evil
people, if she thinks it's dramatically effective.
 &HT;    ``Oh, this is interesting,'' she says, ``because when my sister
got pregnant with her son, she came to me one day and said,
`Ashley, tell me you would never take a role where you kill a
child.'
 &HT;    ``I was very silent,'' she recalls. ``And I finally said, `It
depends on where the script goes. It's drama, and tragedy is a
staple of drama.'''
 &HT;    Judd may not always agree with her sister, but they're clearly
on good terms. In 1993, after her Malibu home burned to the ground,
Judd packed her bags and headed for safer territory in Tennessee,
ending up half a mile away from her mother's driveway and down the
road from her sister's house.
 &HT;    ``My little five-acre fiefdom in the overall Judd kingdom,'' she
calls it. ``I think I appreciate my land more because I earned it.
Then there's the naturalist in me who just appreciates the land _ I
love the quote, `I have found there is nothing in this world that
nature cannot soothe.'''
 &HT;    After a moment, she adds that she had another reason for
relocating.
 &HT;    ``I also think the way I appreciate my house is often rooted in
fear,'' she admits. ``I'm afraid of recognition, which is why I
live in Tennessee.
 &HT;    ``I think I have a fear of fans, a fear of intrusiveness,'' the
actress says. ``That's the real reason this land is so sacred to me
now _ it protects me and buffers me against what we all call
celebrity.''
 &HT;    Judd, who has dated singer Michael Bolton and actor Matthew
McConaughey, among others, has had her share of problems with the
paparazzi. For now, she says, there's no one special in her life.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I think about family,'' she says. ``But something I've
always said, which I think remains true, is `For God to know and me
to find out.'
 &HT;    ``And, hopefully, the reporters a lot longer after that!''

 (Includes a color slide of the Dave Matthews Band, including Dave
Matthews, LeRoi Moore, Stefan Lessard, Carter Beauford and Boyd
Tinsley.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    After nearly 16 months of touring, Dave Matthews sounds like a
man with one thing on his mind _ and it isn't music.
 &HT;    ``I'm looking forward to stopping _ I want to go home,'' the
33-year-old Matthews says. ``I want to see what my house looks
like. I had a puppy _ it's a dog now, since I last got there. I'm
just looking forward to being home and putting my guitar down for a
month or so, stuffing it in a closet and trying to forget how to
play it.''
 &HT;    Matthews isn't complaining, mind you.
 &HT;    ``I'm not bored with my job yet,'' he adds with a chuckle.
 &HT;    But he does feel that, after two years of nearly constant work _
which included recording the Dave Matthews Band's last album,
``Before These Crowded Streets'' (1998), touring and guesting on
the new Santana album, ``Supernatural'' (1999) _ it's time to
recharge a bit before starting work on the group's next album.
 &HT;    ``What a bore I would be if my whole focus was making records,''
says Matthews, who lives in a 19th-century, hydropowered millhouse
near Charlottesville, Va. ``What a bore life would be if everything
was about what our next big thing will be.
 &HT;    ``You have to keep it in perspective.''
 &HT;    Matthews has certainly earned his break, having engineered one
of the decade's most successful rock careers since forming his band
in 1991.
 &HT;    Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, Matthews first came to the
United States in 1969, when his father, a physicist, took a job
with IBM. Matthews returned home to finish high school, then
settled in Charlottesville, where he played music and worked as a
bartender.
 &HT;    He eventually decided to form his own band and recruited some of
his favorite players from the local scene, including drummer Carter
Beauford, bassist Stefan Lessard, reeds player LeRoi Moore,
violinist Boyd Tinsley and occasionally guitarist Tim Reynolds,
with whom Matthews also sometimes tours as an acoustic duo.
 &HT;    Each of the band's five albums has sold platinum or better _
even ``Live at Red Rocks 8.15.95'' (1997), a low-key, unhyped
archival recording that still sold more than a million copies. More
recently, ``Before These Crowded Streets'' debuted on the Billboard
Top 200 album chart at No. 1, and has so far sold more than 2
million copies.
 &HT;    But the DMB's greatest success has come as a live act, one
generally regarded as the most consistent ticket-seller in the
business. During 1998 the band ranked No. 2 in the trade magazine
PollStar's annual survey, grossing $40.1 million in ticket sales
for 85 shows. Its first 61 concerts in 1999 sold nearly 1.5 million
tickets, and were marred only by parking-lot riots that resulted in
roughly 40 arrests Aug. 7-8 outside the Meadows Music Theater in
Hartford, Ct.
 &HT;    Those statistics are only half the story, however. The DMB has
built its success through the old-fashioned route of hard touring
and grassroots marketing _ with a few modern touches, of course.
 &HT;    At first the band paid its dues by playing 200 dates a year,
driving a battered red van to shows at clubs, beachfronts and
fraternity houses throughout the Southeast, winning fans with
heavily improvised performances that blended rock, jazz, soul and
world-music conventions.
 &HT;    Matthews and his cronies also encouraged their steadily growing
audience to record the shows, which, thanks to the tape-trading
underground, helped spread the band's reputation to college
campuses across the country.
 &HT;    Before long the group had an independent album, a burgeoning
telephone-order business and a Website that not only promoted the
band's appearances but also sold T-shirts, caps and other souvenirs
through the Bama Rags division of Dave Matthews, Inc.
 &HT;    As a result, by the time RCA Records signed the group in 1993,
it was getting an established, proven entity.
 &HT;    ``By no means had we anticipated that,'' Matthews says, adding
that he feels it's the group's music-first philosophy that has been
the primary lure for its fans.
 &HT;    ``I feel a connection to the audience,'' he says, ``but I can't
step outside myself and say why an audience likes it. I don't like
to spend much time thinking about what it is, either, for fear of
finding out and diluting it.
 &HT;    ``But I think that comes out of a happiness that they're
enjoying themselves,'' Matthews adds. ``There's a great connection
in the band with each other, and we love to play together. I can
say it's not something that was made in an office in Hollywood or
an office in New York _ it wasn't some plan from the 44th floor of
the BMG building or anything like that.
 &HT;    ``I can just say we enjoy playing.''
 &HT;    More than most concert acts, the Dave Matthews Band is a
constantly evolving institution, with a marked experimental streak
that many bands would be afraid to indulge.
 &HT;    ``Before These Crowded Streets'' was markedly different from its
predecessors, a dense, atmospheric collection that risked
alienating fans who were comfortable with the wiggly, buoyant
grooves of favorites such as ``Crash'' (1996), ``Too Much'' (1996),
``Ants Marching'' (1998) and ``What Would You Say'' (1998).
 &HT;    But as a musician, Matthews says, he craves change. And on
``Crowded Streets,'' which was co-produced by Steve Lillywhite, he
wanted to create more of a studio-generated work, unlike the
earlier albums that largely had been cooked up on the road.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to sound too much like I don't like those
albums,'' he says, ``but they were kind of like ... the collection
of holiday pictures, whereas this one was thinking about it as an
album, as a thing we had to finish, rather than saying `We have
five out of 10 songs done, we're halfway there.'
 &HT;    ``We were sort of continually sanding the whole thing,'' he
says. ``They were constantly changing and constantly developing.
There's a looser feel about the music, I think.''
 &HT;    Matthews _ who co-wrote and, along with drummer Beauford, played
on the song ``Love of My Life'' from the new Santana album _ says
that the band will release a live album later this fall, with its
next studio album due in 2000.
 &HT;    It's too early, he says, to say what might appear on that album.
But he does admit that, after the success of ``Before These Crowded
Streets,'' he feels a new license to experiment and tinker with
what the DMB is.
 &HT;    ``I think our sound is still changing and developing,'' he says.
``I think it's in a good space right now, and I feel pretty good
about it. I think maybe the only thing we don't want to do is
repeat ourselves.''
 &HT;    He doesn't have a sense of the band's future direction, Matthews
adds, but he doesn't mind that.
 &HT;    ``I don't really think that there's a line that we're traveling
along,'' he explains. ``I think it's more like looking for things,
boldly tromping on, you know? It's more of a search, more of a
waiting than it is a direction.
 &HT;    ``We're always writing,'' Matthews says, ``whether that means
it's just fooling around at sound check and our sound man happens
to be recording or it means we've got some new ideas, there's new
things coming all the time.
 &HT;    ``Whether or not any of them grow into tunes is a different
story, but I guess it means we're not bored with what we do yet.''

THE `NOW' GIRL: HEATHER MATARAZZO AND THE NEW FACE OF STARDOM

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Heather Matarazzo in a scene from ``Now
and Again.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Every now and again, Heather Matarazzo wants to slap herself in
the face and scream, ``Oh, my God! I'm working!''
 &HT;    ``I really do,'' the young actress says. ``I'm somewhat
established in the industry and some people know who I am _ that's
a great feeling.
 &HT;    ``Ninety-nine percent of the actors in the United States are not
working, at least as actors,'' she adds, ``and I'm one of the few
who is. I have to keep reminding myself of that, otherwise I could
become very egotistical and not care and forget where I started.''
 &HT;    Few moviegoers can forget where Matarazzo started. The year was
1996, and the film was Todd Solondz's acidic black comedy ``Welcome
to the Dollhouse.'' Matarazzo stunned audiences with her
heartbreaking performance as dorky junior-high-school student Dawn
``Weiner Dog'' Weiner.
 &HT;    So convincing was Matarazzo that most people figured she had
been simply playing herself.
 &HT;    ``Everyone just assumed that I was Dawn and that Dawn was me,''
Matarazzo says with a shrug. ``It wasn't frustrating, though. It
wasn't. Really. I'm thrilled that people even recognized me. I'm
thankful that the movie went as far as it did.
 &HT;    ``People still recognize me,'' she adds, ``which is shocking
because I did that movie five years ago. They'll say, `Oh, you look
so different. I thought you were her, with the glasses.' I'm like,
`No, sorry to disappoint you.'
 &HT;    ``But it was great to get that response, to know that people had
this closeness to the character. And I love that people express
that to me.''
 &HT;    Matarazzo is now a self-assured 17-year-old and, as she says, a
working, even steadily working actress. Her post-``Dollhouse''
credits include such television programs as ``Roseanne,'' ``E.R.''
and ``Law and Order,'' as well as the films ``Devil's Advocate''
(1998) and ``54'' (1998).
 &HT;    At the moment, Matarazzo is sitting in a spartanly appointed
trailer parked on a street in Long Island City, N.Y., just a
stone's throw from the soundstages at Silvercup Studios, where
she's shooting the CBS television series ``Now and Again.''
 &HT;    Debuting on Sept. 24, ``Now and Again'' _ whose pilot was
written, produced and directed by ``Moonlighting'' impresario Glenn
Gordon Caron _ co-stars Matarazzo as Heather, the moody daughter of
Michael (John Goodman) and Lisa Wiseman (Margaret Colin), whose
life turns upside down when her father dies in a tragic subway
mishap.
 &HT;    Unbeknownst to Heather, however, the government implants
Michael's brain in a $3 billion, bioengineered body. Enter the new
and vastly improved Michael Wiseman (Eric Close), who can't contact
his grieving family and must complete assorted dangerous missions
assigned to him by Dr. Theodore Morris (Dennis Haysbert).
 &HT;    Matarazzo simply couldn't resist the project, she says.
 &HT;    ``It was an opportunity to work with Glenn Gordon Caron,'' the
actress says. ``It was a very interesting script, and I thought, if
the pilot could be that interesting, the rest of the scripts could
be even better.
 &HT;    ``Michael is going to be on his missions saving the world and
I'll be at home with mom, with my wit and my sarcasm. Occasionally
I'll be a teen-age brat,'' she says with a smile. ``She's a normal
teen who's suddenly dealing with this anger, frustration and
resentment toward her mother about her father's death. That's a
very real element.
 &HT;    ``We don't Hollywoodize it,'' she adds, ``and, even though we've
got the sci-fi stuff and even some comedy in the show, it's all
still grounded in the reality that everyone in this family is
trying to get on with their life.''
 &HT;    The prospect of a long run for ``Now and Again'' doesn't unnerve
Matarazzo. In fact, she welcomes the idea of maturing on screen, of
making the leap from teen-ager to young woman in the public eye.
 &HT;    ``That'll be pretty exciting,'' Matarazzo says, raising an
eyebrow and shooting a look at her mother, who's sitting quietly a
few feet away. ``That'll be pretty cool. I've never thought about
it that way.
 &HT;    ``I kind of think of `The Brady Bunch' and how they all grew up
on screen,'' she adds. ``I'm happier that I'll be a teen-ager
growing into a young adult, rather than a little child growing into
a teen-ager _ that's more embarrassing.''
 &HT;    Anyone who can't get enough of Matarazzo need not worry. Beyond
her weekly bits on ``Now and Again,'' she's recently completed four
independent features: ``Getting to Know You'' with Mary McCormack
and Chris Noth, ``Strike'' with Kirsten Dunst, ``Company Man'' with
Sigourney Weaver and Alan Cumming, and ``Cherry'' with supermodel
Shalom Harlow.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what's going to happen with those films,''
Matarazzo says. ```Getting to Know You' is on the festival circuit,
and they're trying to find a distributor.
 &HT;    ``I did `Company Man' more than a year ago, and `Strike' may go
straight to video,'' she adds. ```Cherry' is really cute, though. I
play an airhead waitress at a muffin shop, but she's not the kind
of airhead you just want to kick.''
 &HT;    Matarazzo clearly doesn't discriminate between studio films,
independent features and television shows. In fact, she thrives on
being able to jump around.
 &HT;    ``I'm at home wherever I'm acting, and I love a challenge,'' she
says. ``It's great if I can read a script and say, `Man, I can do
this,' and then get scared and think, `Oh, my God! I don't really
know if I can do this.'
 &HT;    ``Then I know I really have the bull by the horns.''
 &HT;    Truth be told, Matarazzo wants to do it all.
 &HT;    ``I want to produce, direct and write as well,'' says Matarazzo,
who lives with her family in Long Island, N.Y. ``I'm going to start
my own production company in the next two or three years.''
 &HT;    But those waiting for the second coming of Woody Allen will have
to wait a while, she adds.
 &HT;    ``I'm not even remotely close to setting it up,'' the
wannabe-mogul says, laughing at herself. ``One day I'll decide,
`Now,' and I'll stay up 24 hours a day and get everything in
motion.
 &HT;    ``I do that with everything, even cleaning my room,'' Matarazzo
admits. ``I won't clean it for months, and then I'll just do it
until it's spic and span.
 &HT;    ``But it's my ambition to produce, direct and screenwrite. I
might procrastinate a great deal, but I'll get it done.''

Raymond.'') 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the longest-standing, most widely accepted Hollywood
cliches is that prime-time-television programming is a crap shoot.
Every year, the networks offer up some three dozen new comedies and
dramas, and every year 80 per cent of them are labeled turkeys long
before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how do some shows beat the odds? In search of
insight into the recipe for success, we talked to the people
responsible for one of television's biggest current hits, the CBS
sitcom ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; 1. FIND A CHAMPION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics loved ``Raymond'' from the outset, but lots of rave
reviews have gone to great shows that disappeared with lightning
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond's'' real hero was Les Moonves, president of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it all to Les,'' says Brad Garrett, who plays Ray's
neurotic older brother, Robert. ``When we started out on Friday
nights, we were getting eaten up by `Who's Cooking the Soup?' on
the Food Network. We really thought it was over. But Les said, `I'm
with you _ trust me, it's going to happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Co-star Doris Roberts, who shines as Marie Barone, Ray's
ever-meddling mother, heartily agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Les' belief in us right from the beginning was so strong and
so supportive that it gave us the strength to keep going and not
worry about where we were in the ratings,'' she says. ``There was
never the fear of cancellation hanging over our heads, so we were
able to just go to work and enjoy it.''
 &UR; 2. GIVE IT TIME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most major hits _ including ``M*A*S*H,'' ``Cheers'' and
``Seinfeld'' _ struggled for a full season or longer to build a
decent following.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond'' is another classic example. Three years ago, it
debuted to dismal ratings on Friday nights, lost among a lot of
fluffy TGIF fare. But the network gave it time to blossom, and by
the end of its second season the show was a top-20 hit. Last year
it broke the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that first season turned out to be a blessing in
disguise,'' star Ray Romano says. ``We were still feeling our way
around and finding out who the characters were _ it was like
practice for us. By the time we got to Mondays, we were in a
groove.'' &QL; 
 &UR; 3. KEEP IT REAL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all her crazy antics, Lucy was real. For all its show-biz
sophistication, so was ``The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' Likewise, head
writer/show runner Phil Rosenthal sees that ``Raymond'' almost
never rings a false note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like best about our show,'' says Patricia Heaton,
who plays Ray's feisty wife, Debra, ``is that it doesn't have a
gimmick. It's not just line-line-joke, line-line-joke. The humor
comes out of genuine, believable relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Rosenthal has an amazing ability to keep it honest,''
Garrett adds. ``He never pushes a joke, never does anything hokey.
He knows better than anyone how to tune into family dynamics.
That's really his thing _ he writes life.''
 &UR; 4. WRITE WHAT YOU KNOW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carl Reiner began each script session for ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show'' by asking the writers what had happened at home the previous
weekend. Rosenthal calls that the greatest lesson he ever had in
running a sitcom: The best comedic moments are borne out of the
creators' own everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ray Barone, Romano once toiled as a futon delivery man. He
and his wife, Anna, really do have twin sons and a daughter. His
real-life brother is a New York cop, his dad says ``Crap!'' just
the way Peter Boyle's Frank does, and Rosenthal's own mother is as
lovingly overbearing as Marie. &QL; 
 &UR; 5. KIDS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Newhart made a point of avoiding what he calls the ``Daddy
Stupid'' syndrome, realizing that sitcoms built around saucy kids
getting their hapless parents out of some weekly pickle have little
staying power.
</P>
<P>
   Like Newhart, Romano knows that adults tune in to watch other
adults in adult situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a family show,'' he says, ``but it's not a `Full
House' kind of family show. It's a show about a family that's built
to appeal to adults by being a little edgy and a little quirky.''
 &UR; 6. PARK THE EGOS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing undoes a sitcom faster than a star who hogs the
spotlight _ just ask veterans of ``Roseanne,'' ``Cybill'' or
``Ellen.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, ``Frasier'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' work because
everybody _ producers, writers, actors, crew _ insists on pulling
together. ``Raymond,'' too, is blessed with tremendous team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in having good hours and better food and a true
sense of friendship and family on the set,'' Rosenthal says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere on our show is so relaxed and generous that we
all appreciate what a tremendous thing we have,'' Heaton agrees.
 &UR; 7. LEARN FROM THE PROS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Transforming stand-up comics into solid sitcom actors isn't
easy, but it helps to surround them with seasoned professionals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson Jerry Seinfeld learned well. Romano's still
learning _ but he's a crackerjack student, as is Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray and I both come from the world of stand-up,'' Garrett
says, ``where, if you don't hear laughs every 30 seconds, you think
you're dying out there. Watching and working with pros like Peter
and Doris has, I think, taught us to trust the silence. They've got
40 years in the business, so every week for us it's like going to
Comedy College.''
 &UR; 8. AVOID STEREOTYPES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom songbook is filled with one-note sambas _ meddlesome
mothers, grumpy dads, stupid siblings, long-suffering wives.
They're all part of the ``Raymond'' mix, but there's a vital
difference: This ensemble has no second fiddles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three seasons, Rosenthal, Romano and the other
writers have stretched real flesh over cardboard bones. A tender
vulnerability balances the brashness of Roberts' Marie. Beneath the
bluster of Boyle's Frank hides a caring grandpa who can't resist
sniffing his grandsons' heads. Garrett has transformed Robert from
a long-limbed loser into a sympathetic spokesman for all the
brothers and sisters who ever spent their lives coming in second.
</P>
<P>
   As for Heaton's Debra, Roberts is impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patricia's made her grow into the most full, deep, funny,
acerbic, edgy, fabulous, well-rounded human being,'' the veteran
actress says. ``And that's not easy to do. Most wives on TV are
just there to be a pretty little thing and feed the kids. But she's
done wonders with it.''
 &UR; 9. HAVE A LIFE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everybody on ``Raymond'' works hard, but they don't let
themselves become defined by their jobs or their celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a lot of personal drama on the show,'' Heaton
says, ``because we all respect the fact that we have other lives.
We come in, do our work, do our best and then everyone goes home to
their real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for a very healthy set.''
 &UR; 10. MAKE IT TIMELESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Topical humor is fine for ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Mad
TV.'' But great sitcom writing transcends trendiness _ it's not
about haircuts or hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   An upcoming ``Raymond'' episode will focus on the Barones'
daughter getting burned in a ``Pokemon'' trading-card ripoff, but
such pop-culture references rarely surface on the show. Instead the
writers focus on slice-of-life situations that can stand the test
of time.
</P>
<P>
   That's why 30 years from now, when the average episode of
``Friends'' or ``Ally McBeal'' will look like little more than
retro chic, everybody will still love ``Raymond.''
</P>

ASHLEY JUDD, TENNESSEE'S ANSWER TO HOLLYWOOD

 (Includes a color slide of Ashley Judd with Tommy Lee Jones in a
scene from ``Double Jeopardy.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Before you go visit Ashley Judd, you'd better think twice.
 &HT;    ``You can't walk into my home without either singing a song or
doing a chore,'' the actress says.
 &HT;    Thank goodness this interview is taking place at Beverly Hills'
Four Seasons Hotel, far from her Tennessee home.
 &HT;    ``If we were at my house, you would be sent right to the sink to
rinse dishes,'' she says. ``Then you could shake out the throw rugs
on the sleeping porch.
 &HT;    ``You know the singer Billy Dean?'' Judd adds. ``Well, he came
over to my house for Christmas. And he's my favorite because he did
a chore and then he sang a song.''
 &HT;    Not the usual Hollywood approach, and indeed it's hard to
believe that the down-home-sounding Judd is a movie star.
Nonetheless, on Sept. 24 the 31-year-old actress will star in
``Double Jeopardy,'' the latest installment in what is rapidly
becoming a creditable career.
 &HT;    Judd's role, as a woman convicted of killing her husband only to
find that she's actually the patsy in his elaborate insurance scam,
was originally intended for Jodie Foster. But the three-time
Oscar-winner had to drop out when she learned that she was
pregnant.
 &HT;    Judd had been interested in the project from the beginning,
however, and was ideally situated when the role suddenly opened up.
 &HT;    ``She had her rep call my office every two weeks to say, `I know
you're meeting with Jodie Foster, but Ashley would still love to do
this role,''' producer Leonard Goldberg says in a separate
interview. ``Ashley really hung in there with it. She has this aura
about her that things are going to work out.''
 &HT;    ``If there is something I want,'' Judd says calmly, ``I will go
after it.''
 &HT;    That aggressiveness might surprise those who knew her when she
was a quiet, bookish girl growing up poor with her extroverted
mother and sister in rural Tennessee. Sometimes forced to live
without electricity, running water or a telephone, Judd recalls,
she and her sister would water down their soup to make dinner
stretch a little further.
 &HT;    ``We didn't have things,'' she says. ``But we had hope, which is
what mattered.''
 &HT;    Her father left the family when Ashley was a baby, leaving Naomi
Judd to raise Wynonna and Ashley on her own. The actress remembers
her mother being a strict disciplinarian.
 &HT;    ``I think she was tough because she was frightened, being a
single parent,'' Judd says. ``You knew when you were in trouble
because the cold, disapproving stare from her was worse than any
other punishment.''
 &HT;    Her sister knew how to finesse their mother, though.
 &HT;    ``Wy could crack her up,'' Judd recalls. ``She would be getting
into trouble, and Wy would put one of those Steve Martin arrows on
her head. Mom would start to laugh.
 &HT;    ``Unfortunately, I didn't have the same wily quality.''
 &HT;    When Judd was a teen-ager, her mother and sister took their
musical act on the road and, improbably, emerged as top-selling
country stars. That left the non-singing sister to be shuttled
between her father and a tour bus, spending a lot of time watching
television by herself.
 &HT;    ``I used to have a crush on David Letterman, until he did the
joke about the Judds,'' she says. ``He would say, `Did you hear
that the Judds have another girl, but she's so ugly they leave her
back home locked in the basement? Every once in a while they throw
her down a canned ham.'''
 &HT;    She winces at the memory. Being a Judd has its drawbacks,
including Naomi Judd's ``Love Can Build a Bridge'' (Fawcett Books,
1994), an autobiography _ later a television miniseries _ which her
daughters found more than a little inaccurate.
 &HT;    ``I'm reading my mom's book going, `This is dubious,''' she
recalls, laughing. ``And then I'm screaming, `Is this true?' But,
you know, mom had a deadline. I couldn't change the information.
 &HT;    ``So you sort of throw your hands up and say, `My reward is in
heaven.'''
 &HT;    But Judd has long since defined herself apart from her musical
relatives. Over the course of a short but star-studded film career
_ including roles in ``Ruby in Paradise'' (1993), ``Heat'' (1995),
``Smoke'' (1995), ``A Time to Kill'' (1996) and ``Kiss the Girls''
(1997) _ she's proven that she's her own woman.
 &HT;    She's also noted for her intelligence _ she graduated Phi Beta
Kappa from the University of Kentucky in Lexington _ an attribute
not always welcome in actresses in male-run Hollywood.
 &HT;    But Judd will have none of that.
 &HT;    ``What? Do I have to downplay my brain for the schmucks?'' she
says. ``Honestly, I think that being perceptive and having
interests is nothing but an asset.
 &HT;    ``I think what shocks people is that I have an urban side,'' she
adds. ``They're stunned that I'm well-rounded in ways they didn't
expect an actress or a Southerner to be. For instance, I walk into
someone's office, and after five minutes they go, `I expected you
to talk about corn bread and quilts.'''
 &HT;    Next up for the actress is a role as a killer in ``Eye of the
Beholder,'' a drama co-starring Ewan McGregor. Judd is outspoken in
her Christian views, but that doesn't stop her from playing evil
people, if she thinks it's dramatically effective.
 &HT;    ``Oh, this is interesting,'' she says, ``because when my sister
got pregnant with her son, she came to me one day and said,
`Ashley, tell me you would never take a role where you kill a
child.'
 &HT;    ``I was very silent,'' she recalls. ``And I finally said, `It
depends on where the script goes. It's drama, and tragedy is a
staple of drama.'''
 &HT;    Judd may not always agree with her sister, but they're clearly
on good terms. In 1993, after her Malibu home burned to the ground,
Judd packed her bags and headed for safer territory in Tennessee,
ending up half a mile away from her mother's driveway and down the
road from her sister's house.
 &HT;    ``My little five-acre fiefdom in the overall Judd kingdom,'' she
calls it. ``I think I appreciate my land more because I earned it.
Then there's the naturalist in me who just appreciates the land _ I
love the quote, `I have found there is nothing in this world that
nature cannot soothe.'''
 &HT;    After a moment, she adds that she had another reason for
relocating.
 &HT;    ``I also think the way I appreciate my house is often rooted in
fear,'' she admits. ``I'm afraid of recognition, which is why I
live in Tennessee.
 &HT;    ``I think I have a fear of fans, a fear of intrusiveness,'' the
actress says. ``That's the real reason this land is so sacred to me
now _ it protects me and buffers me against what we all call
celebrity.''
 &HT;    Judd, who has dated singer Michael Bolton and actor Matthew
McConaughey, among others, has had her share of problems with the
paparazzi. For now, she says, there's no one special in her life.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I think about family,'' she says. ``But something I've
always said, which I think remains true, is `For God to know and me
to find out.'
 &HT;    ``And, hopefully, the reporters a lot longer after that!''

</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of the Dave Matthews Band, including Dave
Matthews, LeRoi Moore, Stefan Lessard, Carter Beauford and Boyd
Tinsley.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    After nearly 16 months of touring, Dave Matthews sounds like a
man with one thing on his mind _ and it isn't music.
 &HT;    ``I'm looking forward to stopping _ I want to go home,'' the
33-year-old Matthews says. ``I want to see what my house looks
like. I had a puppy _ it's a dog now, since I last got there. I'm
just looking forward to being home and putting my guitar down for a
month or so, stuffing it in a closet and trying to forget how to
play it.''
 &HT;    Matthews isn't complaining, mind you.
 &HT;    ``I'm not bored with my job yet,'' he adds with a chuckle.
 &HT;    But he does feel that, after two years of nearly constant work _
which included recording the Dave Matthews Band's last album,
``Before These Crowded Streets'' (1998), touring and guesting on
the new Santana album, ``Supernatural'' (1999) _ it's time to
recharge a bit before starting work on the group's next album.
 &HT;    ``What a bore I would be if my whole focus was making records,''
says Matthews, who lives in a 19th-century, hydropowered millhouse
near Charlottesville, Va. ``What a bore life would be if everything
was about what our next big thing will be.
 &HT;    ``You have to keep it in perspective.''
 &HT;    Matthews has certainly earned his break, having engineered one
of the decade's most successful rock careers since forming his band
in 1991.
 &HT;    Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, Matthews first came to the
United States in 1969, when his father, a physicist, took a job
with IBM. Matthews returned home to finish high school, then
settled in Charlottesville, where he played music and worked as a
bartender.
 &HT;    He eventually decided to form his own band and recruited some of
his favorite players from the local scene, including drummer Carter
Beauford, bassist Stefan Lessard, reeds player LeRoi Moore,
violinist Boyd Tinsley and occasionally guitarist Tim Reynolds,
with whom Matthews also sometimes tours as an acoustic duo.
 &HT;    Each of the band's five albums has sold platinum or better _
even ``Live at Red Rocks 8.15.95'' (1997), a low-key, unhyped
archival recording that still sold more than a million copies. More
recently, ``Before These Crowded Streets'' debuted on the Billboard
Top 200 album chart at No. 1, and has so far sold more than 2
million copies.
 &HT;    But the DMB's greatest success has come as a live act, one
generally regarded as the most consistent ticket-seller in the
business. During 1998 the band ranked No. 2 in the trade magazine
PollStar's annual survey, grossing $40.1 million in ticket sales
for 85 shows. Its first 61 concerts in 1999 sold nearly 1.5 million
tickets, and were marred only by parking-lot riots that resulted in
roughly 40 arrests Aug. 7-8 outside the Meadows Music Theater in
Hartford, Ct.
 &HT;    Those statistics are only half the story, however. The DMB has
built its success through the old-fashioned route of hard touring
and grassroots marketing _ with a few modern touches, of course.
 &HT;    At first the band paid its dues by playing 200 dates a year,
driving a battered red van to shows at clubs, beachfronts and
fraternity houses throughout the Southeast, winning fans with
heavily improvised performances that blended rock, jazz, soul and
world-music conventions.
 &HT;    Matthews and his cronies also encouraged their steadily growing
audience to record the shows, which, thanks to the tape-trading
underground, helped spread the band's reputation to college
campuses across the country.
 &HT;    Before long the group had an independent album, a burgeoning
telephone-order business and a Website that not only promoted the
band's appearances but also sold T-shirts, caps and other souvenirs
through the Bama Rags division of Dave Matthews, Inc.
 &HT;    As a result, by the time RCA Records signed the group in 1993,
it was getting an established, proven entity.
 &HT;    ``By no means had we anticipated that,'' Matthews says, adding
that he feels it's the group's music-first philosophy that has been
the primary lure for its fans.
 &HT;    ``I feel a connection to the audience,'' he says, ``but I can't
step outside myself and say why an audience likes it. I don't like
to spend much time thinking about what it is, either, for fear of
finding out and diluting it.
 &HT;    ``But I think that comes out of a happiness that they're
enjoying themselves,'' Matthews adds. ``There's a great connection
in the band with each other, and we love to play together. I can
say it's not something that was made in an office in Hollywood or
an office in New York _ it wasn't some plan from the 44th floor of
the BMG building or anything like that.
 &HT;    ``I can just say we enjoy playing.''
 &HT;    More than most concert acts, the Dave Matthews Band is a
constantly evolving institution, with a marked experimental streak
that many bands would be afraid to indulge.
 &HT;    ``Before These Crowded Streets'' was markedly different from its
predecessors, a dense, atmospheric collection that risked
alienating fans who were comfortable with the wiggly, buoyant
grooves of favorites such as ``Crash'' (1996), ``Too Much'' (1996),
``Ants Marching'' (1998) and ``What Would You Say'' (1998).
 &HT;    But as a musician, Matthews says, he craves change. And on
``Crowded Streets,'' which was co-produced by Steve Lillywhite, he
wanted to create more of a studio-generated work, unlike the
earlier albums that largely had been cooked up on the road.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to sound too much like I don't like those
albums,'' he says, ``but they were kind of like ... the collection
of holiday pictures, whereas this one was thinking about it as an
album, as a thing we had to finish, rather than saying `We have
five out of 10 songs done, we're halfway there.'
 &HT;    ``We were sort of continually sanding the whole thing,'' he
says. ``They were constantly changing and constantly developing.
There's a looser feel about the music, I think.''
 &HT;    Matthews _ who co-wrote and, along with drummer Beauford, played
on the song ``Love of My Life'' from the new Santana album _ says
that the band will release a live album later this fall, with its
next studio album due in 2000.
 &HT;    It's too early, he says, to say what might appear on that album.
But he does admit that, after the success of ``Before These Crowded
Streets,'' he feels a new license to experiment and tinker with
what the DMB is.
 &HT;    ``I think our sound is still changing and developing,'' he says.
``I think it's in a good space right now, and I feel pretty good
about it. I think maybe the only thing we don't want to do is
repeat ourselves.''
 &HT;    He doesn't have a sense of the band's future direction, Matthews
adds, but he doesn't mind that.
 &HT;    ``I don't really think that there's a line that we're traveling
along,'' he explains. ``I think it's more like looking for things,
boldly tromping on, you know? It's more of a search, more of a
waiting than it is a direction.
 &HT;    ``We're always writing,'' Matthews says, ``whether that means
it's just fooling around at sound check and our sound man happens
to be recording or it means we've got some new ideas, there's new
things coming all the time.
 &HT;    ``Whether or not any of them grow into tunes is a different
story, but I guess it means we're not bored with what we do yet.''

CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service cliehnts.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here are a few men's fashion tips I picked up at
Macy's Passport fashion show last week:
</P>
<P>
   Create an image. Don't be yourself unless you're mostly naked
and your stomach ripples so tightly it looks quilted. The biggest
cheers at Passport didn't go to clothing, but to one particular
guy's stomach, designed and perfectly cut at a gym.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us will need clothes.
</P>
<P>
   When picking an image, mix and match senselessly, as long as you
use a lot of paisley, leather, shiny fabrics, puffy jackets and
items of clothing once associated with men with dirt under their
fingernails or flowers in their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Choose one part of your image from Column A: Carnaby Street,
Gasoline Alley, Easy Street or Mean Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Then choose from Column B: Skateboarder, Two Live Crew,
Audio-Visual Crew, Motocrosser, Mechanic, Oscar Wilde or the Wild
One.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can tell, the idea of contemporary men's fashions is
to avoid being categorized except as cool.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger even had one guy dressed in a midruff-baring
tight T-shirt (all the better to see his quilted tummy), a kilt in
the Hilfiger tartan and knee-high engineer boots.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. But it was a bit extreme, even for a show whose theme
was ``Extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's another thing I learned: If you're a guy who wants to be
noticed in San Francisco, wear a kilt, but not a dress. There is a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The guy entering the show in front of me wore a backless evening
gown displaying the back of a linebacker. And here's one of the
great things about San Francisco: Nobody batted an eye. It must
have ticked him off.
</P>
<P>
   I attend Macy's Passport almost every year, not just because the
show has raised about $10 million for AIDS research and care since
1986. I also go to hang out with interesting people dressed to the
nines, and to learn how to raise my own sartorial standards,
perhaps to the fours.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting harder all the time.
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Devil's Dictionary,'' the great turn-of-the-century San
Francisco Examiner columnist Ambrose Bierce defined fashion as ``A
despot whom the wise ridicule and obey.''
</P>
<P>
   This year I obeyed the despot of fashion, who now rules from
SoHo and MTV instead of Milan and Vogue. I bought cargo pants, a
Shanghai Tang sweatshirt with Mandarin frog-fasteners and a khaki
bucket hat _ and now everybody's ridiculing me.
</P>
<P>
   They do it even though I have the sense not to wear all those
new items at the same time. I mix and match to create new images
ranging from a preppie in cargo pants to a preppie in a sweatshirt
that looks like it came from Jerry Brown's yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   If you're the kind of guy who hasn't worn jeans with rolled up
cuffs since fourth grade, it's hard to please the despot of
fashion. However, friends are always pleased to say, ``What in heck
are you wearing now?''
</P>
<P>
   My style is a lack of style, accessorized by inappropriate
impulse purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Men even have to create images for themselves at black-tie
events these days. You can't just check for soup stains and put on
the penguin suit.
</P>
<P>
   At Passport, men wore paisley tuxes, Lord Fauntleroy scarves,
Nehru jackets, Bat Masterson ties, and collars in every possible
style, including dog.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, men will be saying, ``But I wore this tux to last
year's show,'' and shopping for new ones before every event.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner before Passport, I was sitting in my once-stylish
tuxedo next to a terrific young local designer named Julie Chaikin,
who described the line she was showing as ``urban preppie.''
</P>
<P>
   I said that sounded great, and indeed it turned out to be a
wonderful mix of debutante and Debby Harry. Women's fashions
involve image-splicing, too.
</P>
<P>
   When I said I was an urban preppie, Chaikin asked what I usually
wore. I said my average outfit was work boots, chinos and a leather
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like there was a long silence, then this engaging
woman said, ``As I was telling a journalist earlier, wear what
makes you feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   She was so nice I don't think she was being condescending. But
journalists should never be told to wear what makes them feel
comfortable. The world doesn't need to see all those elbow patches,
unpressed shirts and burrito-stained ties.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen the mechanic look, the hobo look, the glam rock look,
the army poncho look, the bike-messenger look, but there never,
ever will be a journalist look.
</P>
<P>
   Things were easier in the San Francisco of Ambrose Bierce's day,
when men of all professions only wore things that made them
uncomfortable _ dark wool suits distinguished only by the quality
of cut and tailoring, not Tommy and Diesel insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Bierce ended his career by disappearing in Mexico, and that was
easier then, too. How do you pack for disappearance nowadays?
Should I bring the battered-chic cowboy hat from the Sundance
catalog or that skateboarder bucket hat?
</P>
<P>
   You think a serape would make an OK kilt?

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the longest-standing, most widely accepted Hollywood
cliches is that prime-time-television programming is a crap shoot.
Every year, the networks offer up some three dozen new comedies and
dramas, and every year 80 per cent of them are labeled turkeys long
before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how do some shows beat the odds? In search of
insight into the recipe for success, we talked to the people
responsible for one of television's biggest current hits, the CBS
sitcom ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; 1. FIND A CHAMPION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics loved ``Raymond'' from the outset, but lots of rave
reviews have gone to great shows that disappeared with lightning
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond's'' real hero was Les Moonves, president of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it all to Les,'' says Brad Garrett, who plays Ray's
neurotic older brother, Robert. ``When we started out on Friday
nights, we were getting eaten up by `Who's Cooking the Soup?' on
the Food Network. We really thought it was over. But Les said, `I'm
with you _ trust me, it's going to happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Co-star Doris Roberts, who shines as Marie Barone, Ray's
ever-meddling mother, heartily agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Les' belief in us right from the beginning was so strong and
so supportive that it gave us the strength to keep going and not
worry about where we were in the ratings,'' she says. ``There was
never the fear of cancellation hanging over our heads, so we were
able to just go to work and enjoy it.''
 &UR; 2. GIVE IT TIME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most major hits _ including ``M*A*S*H,'' ``Cheers'' and
``Seinfeld'' _ struggled for a full season or longer to build a
decent following.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond'' is another classic example. Three years ago, it
debuted to dismal ratings on Friday nights, lost among a lot of
fluffy TGIF fare. But the network gave it time to blossom, and by
the end of its second season the show was a top-20 hit. Last year
it broke the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that first season turned out to be a blessing in
disguise,'' star Ray Romano says. ``We were still feeling our way
around and finding out who the characters were _ it was like
practice for us. By the time we got to Mondays, we were in a
groove.'' &QL; 
 &UR; 3. KEEP IT REAL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all her crazy antics, Lucy was real. For all its show-biz
sophistication, so was ``The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' Likewise, head
writer/show runner Phil Rosenthal sees that ``Raymond'' almost
never rings a false note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like best about our show,'' says Patricia Heaton,
who plays Ray's feisty wife, Debra, ``is that it doesn't have a
gimmick. It's not just line-line-joke, line-line-joke. The humor
comes out of genuine, believable relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Rosenthal has an amazing ability to keep it honest,''
Garrett adds. ``He never pushes a joke, never does anything hokey.
He knows better than anyone how to tune into family dynamics.
That's really his thing _ he writes life.''
 &UR; 4. WRITE WHAT YOU KNOW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carl Reiner began each script session for ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show'' by asking the writers what had happened at home the previous
weekend. Rosenthal calls that the greatest lesson he ever had in
running a sitcom: The best comedic moments are borne out of the
creators' own everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ray Barone, Romano once toiled as a futon delivery man. He
and his wife, Anna, really do have twin sons and a daughter. His
real-life brother is a New York cop, his dad says ``Crap!'' just
the way Peter Boyle's Frank does, and Rosenthal's own mother is as
lovingly overbearing as Marie. &QL; 
 &UR; 5. KIDS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Newhart made a point of avoiding what he calls the ``Daddy
Stupid'' syndrome, realizing that sitcoms built around saucy kids
getting their hapless parents out of some weekly pickle have little
staying power.
</P>
<P>
   Like Newhart, Romano knows that adults tune in to watch other
adults in adult situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a family show,'' he says, ``but it's not a `Full
House' kind of family show. It's a show about a family that's built
to appeal to adults by being a little edgy and a little quirky.''
 &UR; 6. PARK THE EGOS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing undoes a sitcom faster than a star who hogs the
spotlight _ just ask veterans of ``Roseanne,'' ``Cybill'' or
``Ellen.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, ``Frasier'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' work because
everybody _ producers, writers, actors, crew _ insists on pulling
together. ``Raymond,'' too, is blessed with tremendous team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in having good hours and better food and a true
sense of friendship and family on the set,'' Rosenthal says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere on our show is so relaxed and generous that we
all appreciate what a tremendous thing we have,'' Heaton agrees.
 &UR; 7. LEARN FROM THE PROS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Transforming stand-up comics into solid sitcom actors isn't
easy, but it helps to surround them with seasoned professionals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson Jerry Seinfeld learned well. Romano's still
learning _ but he's a crackerjack student, as is Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray and I both come from the world of stand-up,'' Garrett
says, ``where, if you don't hear laughs every 30 seconds, you think
you're dying out there. Watching and working with pros like Peter
and Doris has, I think, taught us to trust the silence. They've got
40 years in the business, so every week for us it's like going to
Comedy College.''
 &UR; 8. AVOID STEREOTYPES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom songbook is filled with one-note sambas _ meddlesome
mothers, grumpy dads, stupid siblings, long-suffering wives.
They're all part of the ``Raymond'' mix, but there's a vital
difference: This ensemble has no second fiddles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three seasons, Rosenthal, Romano and the other
writers have stretched real flesh over cardboard bones. A tender
vulnerability balances the brashness of Roberts' Marie. Beneath the
bluster of Boyle's Frank hides a caring grandpa who can't resist
sniffing his grandsons' heads. Garrett has transformed Robert from
a long-limbed loser into a sympathetic spokesman for all the
brothers and sisters who ever spent their lives coming in second.
</P>
<P>
   As for Heaton's Debra, Roberts is impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patricia's made her grow into the most full, deep, funny,
acerbic, edgy, fabulous, well-rounded human being,'' the veteran
actress says. ``And that's not easy to do. Most wives on TV are
just there to be a pretty little thing and feed the kids. But she's
done wonders with it.'HAVE A LIFE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everybody on ``Raymond'' works hard, but they don't let
themselves become defined by their jobs or their celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a lot of personal drama on the show,'' Heaton
says, ``because we all respect the fact that we have other lives.
We come in, do our work, do our best and then everyone goes home to
their real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for a very healthy set.''
 &UR; 10. MAKE IT TIMELESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Topical humor is fine for ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Mad
TV.'' But great sitcom writing transcends trendiness _ it's not
about haircuts or hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   An upcoming ``Raymond'' episode will focus on the Barones'
daughter getting burned in a ``Pokemon'' trading-card ripoff, but
such pop-culture references rarely surface on the show. Instead the
writers focus on slice-of-life situations that can stand the test
of time.
</P>
<P>
   That's why 30 years from now, when the average episode of
``Friends'' or ``Ally McBeal'' will look like little more than
retro chic, everybody will still love ``Raymond.''
</P>

 &HT;    WITH HIS COUNTRY IN TURMOIL, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT STUMPS FOR AID
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ At the upscale Andino shopping center in this
capital's affluent northern district, you'd never know there's a
guerrilla war, a disturbing crime wave and a dire economic
recession gripping Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Giggling teenagers rush to the multi-screen cinema, where ``Ojos
Bien Cerrados'' _ ``Eyes Wide Shut'' _ is drawing heavy crowds.
Stylishly-dressed couples stroll the marbled hallways, dawdling at
European boutiques or grabbing a Wendy's hamburger in the sprawling
food court.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombia's troubles are visible just beneath the surface of
even this sheltered enclave. Armed security guards _ some with
German shepherds _ patrol the sidewalks, while hotel desk clerks
warn guests not to leave the exclusive district on foot.
</P>
<P>
   As Colombian President Andres Pastrana meets this week with U.N.
officials and U.S. President Bill Clinton in New York to discuss
strategies for salvaging his country, it's clear that 40 years of
guerrilla war, the endless battle against the drug lords, a crime
epidemic and the economic crisis have left many of this nation's of
38 million people exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana addressed the United Nations Monday, pushing a $3.5
billion plan of international aid _ including $500 million from the
United States _ to fight drugs and the leftist insurgency that have
left his nation reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's middle class is fleeing the country, with hundreds
lining up each week at foreign embassies to apply for visas. Some
60,000 residents have emigrated legally so far this year, with U.S.
officials reporting 50,000 visa applications per month _ twice the
level of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate executives and the wealthy must hire bodyguards and
buy armored cars, as they have become kidnapping targets for both
guerrillas and criminals alike.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla war has uprooted hundreds of thousands of peasants
from the countryside, with many living in makeshift refugee camps.
Others flee to the cities, living in appalling slums and begging
for food.
</P>
<P>
   Residents here don't like to talk about the troubles, but some
admit the situation is extremely bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to find work here, and even if you can you may
not make enough to pay your rent,'' said Orlando Ordonez, 36, a
Bogota taxi driver. ``Many people want to leave. I know five or six
people who have left and more who want to but can't get papers.''
</P>
<P>
   An American who has lived here for four years with his Colombian
wife and young child plans to move to Florida. He likes the
country, but recently was robbed and beaten by six homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened in full view of a police station, and the police
did nothing,'' said the man, who insisted on anonymity out of fear
that kidnappers might target his relatives. ``Unemployment is so
high that people are desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   There is great frustration with the Colombian government.
Pastrana was elected last year after promising negotiations with
the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, but no
substantive peace talks have begun. His approval ratings have
plummeted _ while a belief that the U.S. military will intervene
has grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your government will send in troops,'' said Carlos Alzgate,
45, who was laid off recently from a government agency. ``I believe
you fear too much the conflict will spread to Panama and
Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials adamantly deny the rumors, which have caused a
stir in the Latin American press. Only a few hundred U.S. troops
are currently in Colombia to help train police and soldiers, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, it seems clear that Colombia's future will be
filled with more uncertainty and probably more violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' said Ordonez. ``Our country is very beautiful.
But our situation is very complicated.''

CREATOR OF `thirtysomething' AND `MY SO-CALLED LIFE' EXPLORES(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It could have come from some acerbic art film or romance novel,
or even from some Lionel Richie '80s pop tune about love, loss and
longing: ``How's it possible you might be who I need you to be?''
</P>
<P>
   But those words are uttered through sobs at the tail end of an
episode of ``Once and Again,'' as Lily Manning, harried mother and
divorcee played by the adorable Sela Ward, explains how she needs
the man she's falling for to provide a safe, soft landing.
</P>
<P>
   Scripted by writer/producer Marshall Herskovitz, that one line
is perhaps the sharpest example of the kind of unguarded
emotionalism at the heart of this new drama series. This show,
premiering on ABC Wednesday, prides itself on what TV usually feels
safer handling in sitcom form: the emotional ambivalence of new
love and fractured families.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it's fair game to wonder whether ``Once and
Again,'' house-sitting for ``NYPD Blue'' until the cop drama
returns Nov. 9, stands a chance in a TV universe in which viewers
are more comfortable drawing life lessons from ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' wants to dissect modern life through the eyes
of single parents by focusing on a pair of 40-ish divorcees. On the
surface, they're incredibly good-looking and professionally
successful, but they're also terrified of considering their own
needs, of risking further upheaval in the lives of their children,
of throwing caution to the wind and pursuing a love do-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're afraid,'' Rick, played by Billy Campbell, says to Lily
in Wednesday's opening episode, ``because you want more, not
because you deserve less.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick has been out of his marriage for three years, Lily
separated eight months from her husband of 16 years. They first eye
one another while behind the wheel of their respective SUVs,
sitting in the pick-up/drop-off lanes at their kids' high school. A
chance meeting leads to Rick calling Lily at her home, which
results in one of the many scenes that are subtle yet oh-so
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the kitchen, Lily, phone in hand, is in the
crossfire of conversations among her two daughters and ex-husband,
her knees wobbling, her brow sweaty, her face pale. She literally
hangs up on Rick, only to call him moments later (and in private)
to accept a date.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Campbell have turned in low-key but dead-on
performances modulated by their good looks, acting ability and
chemistry, and helped immensely by an understated tone, a delicate
pace, and writing that is thoughtful, witty and real.
</P>
<P>
   At a restaurant on their first date, Lily whips out a cell phone
connecting her to her kids at home. Smiling but slightly
embarrassed, she lays it on the table. ``I see you,'' Rick says,
bringing out his own, ``and I raise you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the kids. Lily's 9-year-old Zoe (Meredith Deane) hates the
possibility that her father, Jake (Jeffrey Nordling) can be
replaced. Fourteen-year-old Grace (Julia Whelan) is a bright,
sensitive girl with appearance issues: She fears she's overweight
(she isn't) and not pretty (she is). Lily's relationship doesn't
help her delicate psyche. Worse, she's hot for Rick's son,
16-year-old Eli (Shane West). ``Is he going to be, what, my
stepbrother?'' she wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   Rick and ex-wife Karen (Susanna Thompson) talk around Eli's
``problem'' of flunking courses. The problem is a learning
disability. Rick also has a 12-year-old daughter, Jessie, played by
Rachel Wood.
</P>
<P>
   This is enough for Lily, the more fearful of the two, to call
off their budding relationship, which leads to a climax that sets
up next week's episode. It's executed with such bittersweet
honesty, I would have been perfectly happy had the whole thing
simply ended right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' is the work of Herskovitz and partner Ed
Zwick, best known for their collaboration on ``thirtysomething''
and ``My So-Called Life.'' Both were powerfully subtle dramas
unafraid of showing characters as flawed, self-aware human beings,
and both were criticized profusely for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``thirtysomething,'' during its four-year run on ABC, was
branded as nothing more than an exploration of privileged,
narcissistic yuppies; ``My So-Called Life'' was hounded for its
overly dark treatment of the psyche of a teen-age girl.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its high media profile, ``thirtysomething'' never
achieved large-scale ratings success. ``My So-Called Life'' never
made it to a second season.
</P>
<P>
   Watching as ``Once and Again'' unfolds, you may get the sinking
feeling that this is simply too good to make it on network TV.
</P>
<P>
   I remember Herskovitz, after the death of ``Life,'' questioning
the sophistication of contemporary audiences _ wondering whether it
simply wasn't the right time for his series. Perhaps it is time,
particularly now that teen-age angst appears to be in.
</P>
<P>
   But my theory is that network programming has become so limited
and audiences so accustomed to not sitting up and paying attention
that a series asking you do so is doomed. Many viewers would rather
lean back and allow TV to wash over them with predictable
scenarios, to take them away from reality.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma for producers is to be authentic enough to
convincingly portray the perplexities of life, but not too
authentic, as that could undermine the entertainment element and
drive away viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Zwick and Herskovitz have a history of bravely taking on this
problem, and adding a degree of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Once and Again,'' for instance, characters talk directly to
the camera, a technique that's being widely used this season but is
actually old hat for these guys. ``My So-Called Life's'' was
accompanied by a voice-over narration, a wonderful device that made
star Claire Danes a kind of on-the-scene analyst of her own life.
</P>
<P>
   The difference here is that Lily and Rick are shot separately in
black-and- white documentary format, explaining the emotions of the
current or previous scene.
</P>
<P>
   Laced with wry humor and heartfelt emotion, the device is
largely effective. One particularly apt interruption comes while
Rick is eyeing Lily from across the dinner table on their first
date. He's trying to be cool. To be calm. In control.
</P>
<P>
   Flash to Rick in black and white: ``Basically,'' he says,
giggling like a school boy, ``I spent the whole time trying NOT to
kiss her.''

</P>
<P>
   Standing in the kitchen, Lily, phone in hand, is in the
crossfire of conversations among her two daughters and ex-husband,
her knees wobbling, her brow sweaty, her face pale. She literally
hangs up on Rick, only to call him moments later (and in private)
to accept a date.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Campbell have turned in low-key but dead-on
performances modulated by their good looks, acting ability and
chemistry, and helped immensely by an understated tone, a delicate
pace, and writing that is thoughtful, witty and real.
</P>
<P>
   At a restaurant on their first date, Lily whips out a cell phone
connecting her to her kids at home. Smiling but slightly
embarrassed, she lays it on the table. ``I see you,'' Rick says,
bringing out his own, ``and I raise you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the kids. Lily's 9-year-old Zoe (Meredith Deane) hates the
possibility that her father, Jake (Jeffrey Nordling) can be
replaced. Fourteen-year-old Grace (Julia Whelan) is a bright,
sensitive girl with appearance issues: She fears she's overweight
(she isn't) and not pretty (she is). Lily's relationship doesn't
help her delicate psyche. Worse, she's hot for Rick's son,
16-year-old Eli (Shane West). ``Is he going to be, what, my
stepbrother?'' she wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   Rick and ex-wife Karen (Susanna Thompson) talk around Eli's
``problem'' of flunking courses. The problem is a learning
disability. Rick also has a 12-year-old daughter, Jessie, played by
Rachel Wood.
</P>
<P>
   This is enough for Lily, the more fearful of the two, to call
off their budding relationship, which leads to a climax that sets
up next week's episode. It's executed with such bittersweet
honesty, I would have been perfectly happy had the whole thing
simply ended right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' is the work of Herskovitz and partner Ed
Zwick, best known for their collaboration on ``thirtysomething''
and ``My So-Called Life.'' Both were powerfully subtle dramas
unafraid of showing characters as flawed, self-aware human beings,
and both were criticized profusely for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``thirtysomething,'' during its four-year run on ABC, was
branded as nothing more than an exploration of privileged,
narcissistic yuppies; ``My So-Called Life'' was hounded for its
overly dark treatment of the psyche of a teen-age girl.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its high media profile, ``thirtysomething'' never
achieved large-scale ratings success. ``My So-Called Life'' never
made it to a second season.
</P>
<P>
   Watching as ``Once and Again'' unfolds, you may get the sinking
feeling that this is simply too good to make it on network TV.
</P>
<P>
   I remember Herskovitz, after the death of ``Life,'' questioning
the sophistication of contemporary audiences _ wondering whether it
simply wasn't the right time for his series. Perhaps it is time,
particularly now that teen-age angst appears to be in.
</P>
<P>
   But my theory is that network programming has become so limited
and audiences so accustomed to not sitting up and paying attention
that a series asking you do so is doomed. Many viewers would rather
lean back and allow TV to wash over them with predictable
scenarios, to take them away from reality.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma for producers is to be authentic enough to
convincingly portray the perplexities of life, but not too
authentic, as that could undermine the entertainment element and
drive away viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Zwick and Herskovitz have a history of bravely taking on this
problem, and adding a degree of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Once and Again,'' for instance, characters talk directly to
the camera, a technique that's being widely used this season but is
actually old hat for these guys. ``My So-Called Life's'' was
accompanied by a voice-over narration, a wonderful device that made
star Claire Danes a kind of on-the-scene analyst of her own life.
</P>
<P>
   The difference here is that Lily and Rick are shot separately in
black-and- white documentary format, explaining the emotions of the
current or previous scene.
</P>
<P>
   Laced with wry humor and heartfelt emotion, the device is
largely effective. One particularly apt interruption comes while
Rick is eyeing Lily from across the dinner table on their first
date. He's trying to be cool. To be calm. In control.
</P>
<P>
   Flash to Rick in black and white: ``Basically,'' he says,
giggling like a school boy, ``I spent the whole time trying NOT to
kiss her.''

THERE SHOULD NEVER BE CLEMENCY FOR TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The series of apartment house bombings in Russia
terrorize the Russian people and alert Americans to the threats
facing them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is quite stark: How can a democratic society
effectively combat terrorists while retaining the civil and
political rights that define its democracy? Russia and the United
States certainly differ in the quality, range and vitality of their
democratic institutions, but Russia is no longer the controlled
totalitarian society it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Having sustained bombings that have taken nearly 300 lives in a
small span of days, some Russians are waxing nostalgic for the good
old days of Soviet Communism, when a pervasive internal secret
police forestalled terrorists. Then it was doubtful that terrorists
would have even entertained blowing up apartment houses to kill
ordinary people in their sleep, given the forces of the state that
would be arrayed against them, unrestrained by legal niceties.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of Russia today faces the awesome task of
reassuring its people and hunting down the terrorists, believed to
be Islamic fundamentalists from Chechnya in the Caucuses and their
Slav hirelings.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens living outside their homeland are beginning to pay the
price for the bloody depradations believed to have been committed
by their countrymen on behalf of winning independence for the
Islamic territories that are part of Russia. Police are examining
the residence permits of Chechens living in Moscow, using the
questionings as a form of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Such police tactics invoke the notion of collective guilt, which
President Boris Yeltsin has warned against, and which is inimical
to the spirit of a working democracy.
</P>
<P>
   All this should be instructive to Americans, for we have faced
the same threat, now enhanced by the success of the terror
techniques in Russia. That terrorist accomplishment is likely to
inspire others with grievances against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe that America has been comparatively lucky so
far should keep in mind that the bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City killed 168 and injured nearly 700.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the American people were confronted with two
terror acts committed by lone gunmen. In California, a terrorist
wanting to send ``a wake-up call to America to kill Jews'' wounded
three kids and two others at a Jewish community center before going
off to kill a postman because he was not white. In the Midwest,
another racist zealot murdered a black man and Korean man, and
wounded six Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 truck bomb assault on the World Trade Center, 1,000
were injured and five were killed, a small number compared to the
tens of thousands who worked or visited there and who could have
died had the circumstances of the explosion differed only a little.
Members of that conspiracy of Islamic militants were connected to a
foiled plot to blow up the United Nations among other targets and
assassinate an array of political personages.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the bombing of Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan by
the Puerto Rican FALN seeking to establish an independent socialist
regime killed four and injured 53.
</P>
<P>
   That is a sufficient, though far from complete, list of the
terrorist acts against Americans. We are especially mindful of the
Fraunces Tavern bombing a quarter of a century later because
President Clinton chose this, of all times, to give clemency to
convicted FALN members.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the massive difficulty a democratic government faces
overcoming terror, President Clinton's action was totally
wrongheaded. His rationale that the individuals involved were not
directly involved in an act that resulted in death is specious.
They were convicted of participating in the years' long conspiracy,
studded by repeated acts of violence, in which at least six people
died and nearly 200 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to fight terrorists and retain democratic
norms, then the least you must do is punish the conspirators. In an
open society. the best possible dissuader available is the surety
of severe punishment. Tinker with that, and you go a long way
toward making the fight against terror even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Pardons or clemency should never be available to terrorists,
unless they were wrongfully convicted or they help to expose their
cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   The key threat to a democracy that wishes to remain one is
terrorists exploiting the legal protections of a system they are
striving to overthrow. To permit them to misuse these safeguards,
and thereby evade punishment, is to endanger democracy twice over.
</P>
<P>
   The FALN terrorized on behalf of Puerto Rican freedom, while the
people of Puerto Rico overwhelmingly rejected that notion at the
ballot box. Thus the FALN, a handful of zealots, was not merely
trying to bend the United States to its will. Through violence, it
also was trying to force the Puerto Rican people to support the
FALN program.

 &HT;    The doctor is in .....so why are you still waiting? Why you
wait, and how long is too long
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deborah Williams of Austell was already irritated by
the time she went to pay her doctor's receptionist for her annual
physical exam. She had spent more than two hours in the waiting
room. Then she sat in a paper gown in a cold examining room for
another half hour before actually seeing the doctor _ for a
20-minute checkup.
</P>
<P>
   But her irritation turned to rage when the receptionist casually
explained why Williams had waited so long: ``Oh, we forgot about
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 28, never went back. ``I didn't get my time's worth,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting is one of the top consumer complaints against doctors,
with many patients feeling medical offices are places Where Time
Stands Still.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors acknowledge that sometimes things get backed up. But
many say long waits are not their fault. Emergencies happen. And
most medical offices have to overbook _ like hairdressers, airlines
and auto mechanics _ to compensate for the many patients who are
woefully late or don't show up at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have a 20 percent no-show rate,'' said Dr. Bobby
Kaufmann, an Atlanta internist who works 12- hour days and will
personally apologize to a patient who's waited too long.
</P>
<P>
   But health-industry experts say that many problems could be
solved with minor changes in office procedures. In addition,
experts say patients can _ and should _ take steps themselves to
reduce waits, such as calling ahead to see if the doctor's running
late, scheduling appointments early in the day and complaining when
things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is many doctors are still incapable of
thinking of themselves as service providers,'' said Peter Gurney of
Service Intelligence, a Seattle-based firm that evaluates the
quality of customer service. ``Most of them want to explain to you
why things are the way they are, when they should be taking the
time to come up with creative solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Catherine Palmier, regional medical director for Aetna-US
Healthcare's Southeastern region, offered another explanation:
doctors often don't experience the problem first-hand when they
seek treatment. ``They're treated like celebrities'' by their own
doctors, she said. ``They rarely have to sit for long, so they have
no real life experience of what it's like for their own patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that this perennial sore point with patients is
increasingly getting doctors' attention _ because consumers are
more assertive and managed care companies are changing the way
doctors do business. HMOs and other managed care companies
typically bring in consultants, take patient surveys and make
covert field trips to determine patient satisfaction. And most
doctors now rely on managed care contracts for a t least half of
their business, according to the American Medical Association. So
physicians are more willing to learn new ways of business if it
means they can hold on to lucrative contracts with managed care
companies. In addition, some insurers offer bonuses to physicians
with high patient satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the time spent waiting is a key driver for
patient satisfaction,'' said Donna Deckard, director of health care
operations at the Georgia Region of Kaiser Permanente. ``So we have
put a lot of energy into this.''
</P>
<P>
   These trends are forcing changes in some pockets of medicine,
with waits being shorter, or at least, less painful.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, some medical clinics housed in malls equip their
patients with beepers so they can window-shop while they wait. In
Atlanta, a random survey of 20 physicians found about half of the
offices have recently re-arranged their waiting rooms, installed
aquariums and desks with dedicated phone lines, and stocked
children's waiting rooms with videos and new toys. At Atlanta
Plastic Surgery, for example, the waiting room is outfitted with
picture windows with a skyline view of Atlanta, an aviary and a
playhouse for children.
</P>
<P>
   Some offices have also restructured operations
behind-the-scenes. More office managers are now MBAs trained to
handle patient flow. Among strategies experts advise: attach
tickets to patient charts to track time snags, tie receptionist
bonuses to waiting-room management and offer long-waiting patients
vouchers for coffee, prescription discounts and parking.
</P>
<P>
   So how long should a patient have to wait? The answer depends on
whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians see an average of about 25 patients a day, according
to one United Hospital Fund study _ a figure that's been rapidly
climbing in recent years also because of managed care. That allows
about 20 minutes per patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't wait any more than a half hour, '' said Mike
Donio of the People's Medical Society, a consumer advocacy group
based in Allentown, Penn. ``And if you've waited more than an hour,
you should walk out. And you should send them a bill for your
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Donio acknowledges there can be exceptions. Before a patient
storms out of an office, he or she should politely ask _ after 15
minutes _ for an explanation, Donio said. If the doctor was called
to an emergency, the patient should ask to be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   But if delays are the result of a doctor ``running a cattle
chute,'' the patient has every right to be angry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical consultants agree. According to a 1997 survey in Medical
Economics, a trade journal for doctors, patients shouldn't have to
wait longer than 20 minutes. Similar results were found by the
American College of Family Physicians. But these recommendations
don't always match reality. And how much time patients spend
depends more on where they live in the United States and the type
of doctor they're seeing.
</P>
<P>
   One 1998 survey by National Research Corporation of Lincoln,
N.E. found women in Albany, N.Y., typically spend less than one
minute in their OB/GYN's waiting room. That compared with 25
minutes in Dayton, Ohio, and 10 minutes in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And consultants say surveys show patients can generally expect
to wait longer for specialists than general practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A primary care physician tends to have more manageable
diseases, less stuff that's life-threatening,'' said Judy Bee, a
medical management consultant in Long Beach, Calif. ``Sometimes,
(specialists) are going to have to tell patients some pretty awful
news and answer a million questions, so time to time, you're going
to wait longer.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, it's unclear how long the average patient waits.
Kaiser reports that patient surveys show the average waiting time
for doctors in the company's regional network is 12 minutes in a
waiting room and no more than 8 minutes in an examining room.
</P>
<P>
   But variations between offices and clinics can be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Washington, a 40-year-old father of two, said he has no
problem getting his children seen and treated within an hour. But
the East Point resident said when it comes to his own care, it's a
different story. Washington said he is so used to waiting, he
brings a book and a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich to tide him
over.
</P>
<P>
   Also patients _ and insurance companies _ say they are seeing a
new trend of doctors shuffling customers out of the waiting room
quickly just to have them languish in an examining room.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Roberts, 39, said she waited with her husband, Jackie, in
an examining room last month for more than two hours. It was long
enough her husband had time to read all the magazines, get drinks
and ask the nurses (twice) what the hold-up was. In the end, the
physician apologized briefly for the wait and spent 10 minutes with
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was handled very badly,'' said Roberts of College
Park. ``It would have been much better if we had been informed
about what was going on and what choices we had.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   But waiting is often about more than time. What you're doing
while you're waiting may be more important than how long you wait,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Customer service consultants say no one does that better than
Disneyland where visitors may stand in hour-long lines for rides
that last for less than five minutes. The key, they say, is to keep
the customers busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can involve patients in something that distracts them,
the patients are a lot less aware of time and are far more
forgiving than if you just leave them there tapping their foot,''
said Shirley Miles-Watanab, who oversees the quality of customer
service at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If patients are kept busy with something that interests them,
they tend to be much more, well, patient.
</P>
<P>
   And, they also are more satisfied with the visit if a medical
staff is a little proactive. For example, experts recommend staff
tell patients why the doctor is running late and offer to
reschedule. They also say the waiting room should be filled with
up-to-date magazines, television and even nooks with phones and
computer jacks so people can conduct business while they wait.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also recommend that patients who wait a long period of
time, ask the medical office to write off the cost of the visit,
complain to the doctor _ who might not be aware of the problem _ or
to the insurer. Or they can simply walk out and find another
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are getting more savvy about what they expect from a
doctor's office,'' said Marshall Franklin, administrator of Atlanta
Plastic Surgery, who once walked out himself after waiting more
than two hours for a physical exam. ``It used to be that the office
was run by the doctor's wife and scheduling problems were just a
fact of life. But those days are over.''
</P>
<P>
   TO AVOID WAITING
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take the first appointment offered in the morning. That way,
you get to see the doctor before the day has become tangled with
problems.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Call before you leave home or your workplace for a doctor
visit _ like checking in on a traffic report _ to find out if the
doctor is running late. If so, reschedule or leave later.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Try to fill out any paperwork before you arrive, especially if
you're a new patient. Call and have the paperwork sent to your home
ahead of time. You don't want to miss your scheduled appointment
time because you're writing your health history or verifying health
insurance.

 &HT;    `Once' an appealing look at love after 40
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I always had a map for my life,'' Rick Sammler (Billy
Campbell) says near the top of ``Once and Again,'' this season's
most affecting, most I-feel-your-pain new drama, which premieres
tonight at 10 on ABC. ``And now, it's like I walked off it
entirely. It's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Masterfully navigating this off-the-map territory of divorced
40some-thing parents are creators Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz,
who last guided us through the emotional, out-of-bounds landscapes
of suburban baby boomers in ``thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called
Life.'' And while ``Once and Again'' will initially be thought of
as a kind of ``thirtysomething'' sequel, it's really more a
continuation of the too-brief ``My So-Called Life,'' with the focus
shifting slightly from the teens to the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't they keep their private lives private, without
dragging innocent bystanders into it,'' the 14-year-old daughter of
Lily Manning (Sela Ward) says of her mother's maiden voyage into
post-separation dating.
</P>
<P>
   We soon learn that everyone's connected in today's family. The
parents are at the center of things here, but only as landmarks to
find our way through everyone else. Lily and Rick alternate between
the exhausting, super-adulthood of single parenthood, and the
giggly, bumbling second-adolescence of starting love lives all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Lily has been separated for eight months and has yet to date;
Rick has been divorced three years, and started dating an
unsatisfying string of 25-year-olds almost from the moment he moved
into an apartment. Both carry the shell-shocked, hundred-yard stare
of that tribe out there connected by the trauma of failed
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me,'' Lily says to herself, in her SUV, as she waits
to pick up her kids. ``Other people seem safe. I look at their
faces and know that was once my face. I want to go back there.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no going back, of course, which gives this series the
sense of an adventure drama, an internal travelogue that's equal
parts discovery and hardship. These are people _ both the adults
and the kids _ who've been through enough to dispense with the
small talk; this isn't TV as escapism, but as a stark, often
unpretty mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' feels more accessible than Zwick and
Herskovitz's previous creations, which at times were overwhelmingly
dark or self-involved. Much of that has to do with the instant
likeability of Ward and Campbell. Their unloading on us feels less
like whining and more like the honest tribulations of old friends.
You want to pour them another cup of coffee; you don't have
anywhere better to go.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, especially, is virtually radiant with the inside-to-out
glow of a hard-won survivor. She's a beauty who barely notices her
surfaces anymore, which only makes them that much more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Her teenage daughter, Grace, is played by Julia Whelan with a
slightly frumpier intensity than Claire Danes portrayed the
teenaged Angela in ``My So-Called Life.'' Close your eyes, and her
voice is almost indistinguishable from Danes'.
</P>
<P>
   Other tricks that help open up this show, like the characters
talking in black-and-white to a therapist camera, indeed feel like
tricks _ like the overused conventions they are _ but their
familiarity also helps us get through the tough spots.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of those. This is a show about growing up,
whether you're already grown up or not. It asks us to grow up with
it. Tall order, but worth the trip.

<P>
   The genial freelance writer greeting me at the door of his
rustic home in Garrison, N.Y., on a warm August morning is John
Horgan, 46, the unofficial bad boy of science journalism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Horgan, then a senior writer with The Scientific
American, published ``The End of Science: Facing the Limits of
Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age,'' a 281-page essay
in which he argued that scientific inquiry has gone about as far as
it can go and that the questions remaining for it to answer are
unanswerable.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists were outraged, but the book sold nearly 200,000
copies. This month, Horgan will no doubt be making a new set of
enemies with the release of his latest work _ ``The Undiscovered
Mind _ How the Human Mind Defies Replication, Medication and
Explanation'' (Free Press, $25).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of myself as a heretic,'' he says, ``who is
challenging the central dogma that scientific progress is
eternal.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Tell us how you got the idea for this new book.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's really a follow-up to ``The End of Science.'' There were
criticisms of my first book that I thought didn't have much
substance, but one I thought was reasonable was that the science of
the human mind, of all areas of science, had the most potential to
be really revolutionary. So I wanted to see how far we had gotten
with not just neuroscience, but psychology, psychiatry, behavioral
genetics, the new Darwinian social sciences, artificial
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   And what I found is that despite a lot of hype and despite some
amazing instruments _ MRI's, PET scanners _ we seem to be spinning
our wheels. We are not learning the kinds of things we want to
learn. We aren't learning how matter can create a mind. We aren't
even doing something practical like understanding schizophrenia. Or
coming up with better treatments for it. Or even a cure. The
practical issues are what people care about. On that, I've
concluded, despite all the hype about psychopharmacology,
especially, there has been very little progress in understanding
mental illness and treating it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do you think we're not making any progress in
understanding the mind?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think that there's a mystical barrier. It's just the
brain and the mind are fantastically complex.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Sir Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, once
told me that the understanding of outer space is relatively simple
_ molecular biology was what was complex.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yeah, and the brain! So he's agreeing with me that cosmology
and particle physics are all wrapped up?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I don't think so. He's simply saying one is a harder nut to
crack than the other.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, there's no question: particle physics is like a
children's game compared to neuroscience. There are a handful of
particles that behave according to fixed rules _ if you control the
situation enough, you'll always know how those particles are going
to act. With humans, you never know!
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some would say that unpredictability is part of the mystery
of what makes people human.
</P>
<P>
   A. Except I don't think you have to resort to mysticism to talk
about the limits of mind-related science. There's no mystical
reason why we can't do these things. It's just turned out to be
extremely difficult. There's no law of nature that says that just
through sheer effort and will, scientists can solve every problem.
People should at least consider the possibility that, in some
respects, we might not solve this thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you enjoy debunking ideas about scientific progress?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that ``scientific progress'' is idolized by people
who think they are too rational to believe in a Christian God, or
some form of religion ... There's an almost worshipful belief that
this extraordinary period of technological and scientific progress
is just permanent, that it will continue as long as we have the
will. I believe that science itself tells us that there are going
to be limits to this process and that those limits are appearing
right now. People refuse to acknowledge those limits because they
have this faith that it can't end.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Don't you think that the new antidepressant medications _
Prozac, for instance _ have been a big step forward?
</P>
<P>
   A. In my book, I present evidence suggesting that most of the
effect of Prozac, if not all of it, is due to the placebo effect.
What is remarkable is that lots of psychiatrists will admit this is
true.
</P>
<P>
   I have friends who swear that Prozac saved their lives. I try to
be very careful in the way I talk about some of these treatments
because I know that people believe in them strongly, and that the
belief itself can heal people.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Oh, come on, you debunk psychopharmacology throughout the new
book. Aren't you trying to have it both ways?
</P>
<P>
   A. (Laughs.) Well, I am. In the book, I come up with this idea
of hopeful skepticism. ... I think it's important that people know
that the clinical trials show that Prozac is no more effective than
older antidepressants _ or, as a class, more effective than
psychotherapy. Now, all these things are better than doing nothing
... but that can also be said of cognitive behavioral therapy or
your local astrologer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Prozac had a brilliant popularizer.
</P>
<P>
   A. You mean Peter Kramer (author of ``Listening to Prozac'')? It
did. What's interesting about Kramer's book is that he has a lot of
deniability built into it. He certainly doesn't say that Prozac
helps everybody, but the effectiveness of his case studies is very
powerful. It's essentially the same method Freud used to sell
psychoanalysis with stories of Anna O. and the Wolf Man, compelling
literature selling a method of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A writer in the mind sciences you seem to like is Oliver
Sacks. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. He's an anti-reductionist. If you look at the history of
mind-related science, you see lots of abuses of reductionism _
social Darwinism, eugenics, now psychopharmacology. With Dr. Sacks,
the underlying message of all his case studies is that each person
with a given disorder is absolutely unique and has to be understood
on his or her own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your critique of most science reporting?
</P>
<P>
   A. I have enormous respect for all my science-writing
colleagues, but, in general, I'm distressed that science writers
aren't more critical of science. We often don't get as much
sophistication out of science writers as we do out of sports
writers. Or political writers. Scientists are very good at
intimidating science writers. They are always telling us you can't
``really understand'' science unless you are a scientist, which is
absolutely absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you were a staff writer at Scientific American, did you
sometimes feel frustrated?
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, I was encouraged to write critical articles, but
the fit became uncomfortable over time. I guess I became too
critical. There were certainly some people who thought I was
anti-science. There were some people at Scientific American who
were horrified by my last book, by what it said and by the title. I
was challenging the central dogma, this faith in scientific
progress. I think it's fair to say that I left by mutual agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you working on?
</P>
<P>
   A. Both my books have raised the possibility that the mystical
experience can provide insights into the universe as a whole and
our minds that can complement science. I brought it up in a rather
teasing way, but that's what I'm doing my next book on. The problem
with a topic like mysticism is that it is so broad that it very
quickly gets out of hand. I'm talking to Buddhists, yoga
practitioners and also a community of people who use psychedelic
drugs as a way of inducing these experiences. At this point, I'm
all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you going to call the next book ``The End of Reason''?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Because I think of myself as a reasonable, rational
person, and the challenge of this book will be to approach
mysticism, while hanging onto reason and objectivity.

THE LONG ARM OF THE TAX COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The tax code has created more liars than the game
of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, your reward for effort, energy and thrift is
a big tax bill. That's your legacy if you're an American and,
especially, if you're a New Yorker _ that and the knowledge that
the only thing worse than paying taxes is the desperation of owning
nothing worth taxing. And, sure, it takes money to run a
government.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, though, the letter Don McKay received the other
day simply astonished him.
</P>
<P>
   It was from the New York State Deparment of Taxation and
Finance. It said that the department had reviewed a list of items
that Don McKay had declared at U.S. Customs as he'd reentered the
country from a trip abroad. It said that the State of New York knew
that he'd brought back a piece of jewelry for his wife and that the
value of the thing was $2,591.49. The letter informed Don McKay
that he owed the State of New York $207.31 in state use tax on the
purchase and $6.32 in interest for not coughing up the money within
20 days of his return from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And, the letter said, Don McKay had better pay up _ right then
and there. Otherwise, the interest would shoot up to the level
charged on the Brooklyn docks by brawny guys named Lefty.
</P>
<P>
   Don McKay was astounded. It wasn't the $213.63 that troubled
him. He's chairman and CEO of Tougher Industries. That's a
mechanical construction business in suburban Albany that does
roughly $50 million a year and employs about 200 people. The
$213.63 tax payment represented more of an annoyance than a
hardship for him.
</P>
<P>
   What had Don McKay astounded was that he has railed for years
against the high taxes in New York, where he has lived for 31
years. He's right about that, too. New Yorkers rank No. 1 among
residents of the 50 states in combined per capita state and local
taxes, although New York is slightly below the middle of the pack
on state taxes alone. It's mainly the local taxes that kill New
Yorkers _ too many workers in too many tiny, outdated local
governments that suck our economic blood for no real purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But Don McKay has been going in and out of the country for
years, and he has been declaring overseas purchases at Customs for
years. Now he'd learned that, in addition to what you have to pay
the feds when you come back with stuff from abroad, the state also
can come and nail you for what amounts to a sales tax on stuff you
buy in, say, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The letter Don McKay got explained that this tax dates back to
1965. It's imposed in addition to the duty imposed and paid to U.S.
Customs at the time of entry into the United States. The use tax is
payable within (20) twenty days.
</P>
<P>
   Don McKay sent New York state its check for $213.63. He also
sent a letter to the governor, the Assembly speaker and the State
Senate majority leader. He told them this story and said, ``You and
your legislature need to address concerns such as mine, enact a
responsible budget on time and make New York a desirable place to
live and work. You have a long way to go to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Don McKay is 68. He'll retire soon. He has to decide if he wants
to stay in New York, where tax collectors demand money on items on
which you already paid taxes somewhere else. One thing worries him
about moving out, though.
</P>
<P>
   New York might have an exit tax that nobody knows about.
</P>

OLD-FANGLED PROFANITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, Sept. 22)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subject of today's column is profanity, specifically such
words as %&AMP;(AT), !(NU)$&AMP;! and $&AMP;)!!.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, myself included, have noticed a lot of swearing
going on in the movies, on television and especially on the radio.
And it's not just football games or combat situations or lottery
drawings that provoke the bad language. Dirty words are flying out
of the mouths of men, women and children at a furious rate and for
no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing, in a war movie, for a sergeant to order his men
to get their %&AMP;(AT) heads down. It is another thing, in a
lighthearted drama, for a kid to order his mom to pass the !(NU)$&AMP;!
salt.
</P>
<P>
   The result is not only a coarsening of the culture, but also a
devaluation of the swear words themselves. Cuss words, to be
effective, must be used sparingly, otherwise they lose their shock
value. If words like %&AMP;(AT), !(NU)$&AMP;! and $&AMP;)!! trip off peoples
tongues as lightly as words like ``bunny,'' ``cloud'' and
``rainbow,'' then what words are we to use when we whack ourselves
on the thumb with a hammer or three-putt from 5 feet?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, today's swear words and insults have lost their punch,
which is why I'm suggesting we replace our worn-out words with some
fresh and far more imaginative epitaphs found in the plays of the
world's most famous and talented potty-mouth, William Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabethan style of profanity takes a little getting used
to, but with a little practice I think you'll find that it is as
fresh and lively as something can be that is 400 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, as you might expect, is a great help in generating
Shakespearean insults and tailoring them to your specific needs.
(Try http://www.randyworld.com/shakespeare/. There are lots of good
insults and there's even a wandering minstrel tootling in the
background.) For example, if your boss is giving you a hard time,
you might consider calling him or her a ``dankish, fat-kidneyed
horn-beast'' or, perhaps, a ``craven, hasty-witted hugger-mugger.''
</P>
<P>
   The boss, in turn, might respond by calling his or her employee
a ``saucy, rampallian foot-licker'' or (presumably) worse, an
``impertinent, pox-marked bum-bailey.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are plagued by unwanted house guests, as many of us in
Florida frequently are, you may drop this subtle hint from Henry V
the next time they ask to be driven to the beach: ``Thine face is
not worth sunburning.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempers often flare in restaurants, and Shakespeare thoughtfully
provides us with a variety of insults geared to the occasion. If
you are displeased with the service provided by your waiter or
waitress, you may wish to call him or her a ``mammering onion-eyed
ratsbane.''
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you have diligently served a customer
only to be stiffed on the tip, you would be perfectly within your
rights to refer to that customer as an ``artless, beef-witted
scut.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with double-talking politicians? Next time you feel like
sounding off, take a tip from Henry IV, part I and shout: ``You are
a shallow cowardly hind, and you lie!''
</P>
<P>
   Does the sight of an elderly person driving slow in the
left-hand lane drive you crazy? Don't insult your intelligence (or
ours) with a blast of the horn or a single-digit salute. Instead,
do what Hamlet would do. Roll down your window and shout: ``Thou
art open to incontinency!''
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to be the elderly person being insulted, then you
can respond with this line from Troilus and Cressida: ``Thou thing
of no bowels thou!'' though our highways would certainly be a lot
safer if everyone would just shut up and drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you disagree with the tone or content of this column, then
you might want to write me a nasty letter quoting Coriolanus: ``I
find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, be my guest. Just don't be surprised if I write back
and call you a ``weedy, guts-griping codpiece.''

GOING TOO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled Congress just can't leave
President Clinton alone.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan temptation to keep picking at him, as though he
were an ugly boil, is so overwhelming that GOP congressional
leaders have lost all sense of propriety and proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Their failure to impeach him should have beaten some common
sense into their heads, but instead it inflamed their frustration
and inflated their already overblown idea of their own power. Now
they are demanding that the president produce all White House
documents relating to his clemency for some aging, jailed Puerto
Rican militants and grovel before Congress for making the decision.
</P>
<P>
   This is pure politics, but it is stupid politics. And it is
definitely NOT the American way.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has no constitutional leg to stand on here. Article 2
of the Constitution clearly gives the president broad power ``to
grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United
States.'' This is solely the responsibility of the executive
branch. There's no mention of a legislative role at all, whether
oversight or authority to rescind or alter a presidential decision.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton quite properly responded by claiming executive
privilege and refusing to expose his confidential discussions on
the question to prying eyes on Capitol Hill. He said, in effect,
that the Republicans had no power to get into his head on this. It
is none of their business.
</P>
<P>
   Most presidents grant hundreds of pardons or other acts of
clemency during their terms of office, but only a few are
politically controversial. The most recent was President George
Bush's 1992 Christmas Eve pardon of former Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger. He was about to stand trial on perjury charges
stemming from the covert arms-for-hostages swap with Iran and the
secret deal giving aid to the Nicaraguan contras.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had already lost his battle for re-election and could not
be punished again at the polls. So although some outraged
congressional Democrats threatened to hold hearings into the
Weinberger pardon, they never did. It was already old hat.
</P>
<P>
   The most politically unpalatable clemency decision of all time
was President Gerald Ford's 1974 blanket pardon of his disgraced
predecessor Richard Nixon two months after Nixon was forced from
office. Nixon thus escaped civil or criminal prosecution for his
role in the Watergate crimes, even though he had been named in
court as an ``unindicted co-conspirator'' and a contemporary Gallup
Poll showed that 56 percent of those surveyed felt Nixon should be
tried for possible criminal actions.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon contributed to Ford's defeat for re-election two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce political reaction was heightened by the fact that
Ford had indicated he would not pardon Nixon during the 1973 Senate
hearings on his nomination to become vice president. Ford's
credibility immediately plummeted in a swirl of speculation that he
had cut a secret deal with Nixon to get the second spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-controlled Congress smelled an illegal bribe as
well as a hot issue since, with the vice presidency, then-Rep. Ford
got a bigger salary. Ford stonewalled House Judiciary Committee
requests for relevant records of his conversations with Nixon but
defused the criticism by volunteering to testify before his old
colleagues in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was a pussycat, limiting Ford's time under
questioning and letting him testify without taking an oath. He
denied all, easily ducked the mostly soft-ball questions and left
bathed in a friendly glow. Bipartisanship was not entirely dead in
those days, as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, running against Vice President Al Gore
for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination, suggests wickedly
that Clinton should similarly testify on the Puerto Rican clemency
as ``the only way this is going to be put to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense. The politics of this comes nowhere near the high
stakes of the Nixon pardon. It has very short legs.
</P>
<P>
   The political issue is whether making a fuss over this will hurt
Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign. The idea is to make
Clinton appear soft toward terrorists. The jailed Puerto Rican
nationalists were members of FALN, a terrorist group, but as
individuals had not been convicted of any specific act harming
anyone. A large number of Puerto Rican voters live in Manhattan,
but they seem to be divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is
huffing and puffing about sending subpoenas to Attorney General
Janet Reno and other administration officials to determine if any
laws were broken. He charges that proper administrative procedures
may have been sidestepped. What? Hatch is now the defender of
obscure bureaucratic rules?
</P>
<P>
   He is running for the Republican presidential nomination, which
makes this demand look even sillier than it would normally. Does he
want us to take him seriously or not?
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is down there in the dirty weeds with Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., a House committee chairman who has vowed to get Clinton and
pursues the president without success for everything except getting
out of bed in the morning. Burton too is scattering subpoenas
everywhere, convinced that there is something wrong legally with
the clemency, if he could just figure out what.
</P>
<P>
   New York politicians may chew over the issue for a while. It's
their backyard. But Congress looks foolish (again), and President
Clinton will carry the day here (again.)

 &HT;    Community pulls together as homes, lives devastated by flooding
 &HT;    By J. Eric Eckard and David Blount
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ When waters in Rocky Mount began to rise
this weekend, neighbor began helping neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard someone yelling for help, so I got up and saw the
water up to our house,'' said Moses Dickens, who stayed with his
72-year-old mother at Cowlick Creek behind the Weeks-Armstrong
public housing complex . ``I ran around and started banging on
people's doors, telling them to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising waters nearly 2 feet high in their yard, Dickens
and his mother, Carrie Dickens, managed to make it across the
street to a neighbor, whose home was on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a river over here,'' Carrie Dickens said. ``Boats
came and got some people, but I walked out. It was up to my knees,
but I walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Batts, another Overbrook Avenue resident, managed to
escape the rising creek before it came too far inside his home.
Batts, 73, and his 40-year-old son made their way through the
pouring rain and rushing floodwaters to a relative's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asleep, and the lady next door called me and said the
water was at my back door,'' Batts said. ``I got up and got out of
here. I'd never seen the water that close.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, James Taylor and his girlfriend escaped with their
7-month-old baby in tow just as floodwaters reached their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was banging on doors, trying to get people up and get people
out,'' Taylor said. ``We got our little baby and got out. We didn't
grab anything then, but we came back the next morning and got some
food, clothes and baby things.''
</P>
<P>
   The waters continued to rise though, and just about the entire
neighborhood was under water once the rains stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's ruined,'' Taylor said. ``The furniture's ruined;
the TV's blown; our clothes are ruined. We're calling around now,
trying to get some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricity remained off in that area until Monday, and many
people were trying to recover from their losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people in here lost everything,'' said Moses Dickens.
``It's just a pitiful time.''
</P>
<P>
   As the waters continued to recede on Monday, the shock began to
sink in for the residents of the West Haven neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of trees now lie at the curb, toppled first by winds,
then cut by chain saws. Sawdust and pine straw covered the roads. A
tarp was placed across one roof damaged by a fallen pine. Some
lawns were immaculate as property owners carefully removed limbs
and other debris from their grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Power and tree removal crews delicately pulled electric poles
and trees away from one another. Streets were full of fallen
cables, and workers urged residents and bystanders to avoid the
downed lines.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper into the neighborhood, homes suffered more extensive
damage. The Tar River, once a scenic backdrop to the neighborhood,
became an intruder last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judd Pierce, 16, waded into waist-deep water on Lafayette Circle
to retrieve what few possessions he could from his parents' home.
The family silverware was a top priority in the salvage mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty bad,'' Pierce said grimly. ``The floors are warped
out. Everything is still floating in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce and his parents were awakened by neighbors early Thursday
morning and warned of the rising waters. The family retreated to a
friend's home to ride out the worst of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's mother, Nancy, woke the rest of her family and threw on
clothes. Five minutes later, she took another look outside. Water
that had been in the yard minutes earlier already had found its way
into the sun room.
</P>
<P>
   Before the water began to recede, the Tar River was only 6
inches from the ceiling in the Pierces' home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like somebody has died,'' Nancy Pierce said, looking
back at the house. ``It's already started to lean, and I don't know
if we will ever be able to fix it. We might be bringing in a
bulldozer and just have it torn down.''
</P>
<P>
   George Valentine said the floods were unprecedented in West
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here for 51 years,'' he said. ``The highest I had
ever seen it before was right after Hurricane Hazel. Even then, the
water never even got close to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charlie Godwin had to be evacuated by boat at 4 a.m. on
Thursday. ``The water was probably waist-deep,'' he said. ``I've
never seen anything like this. I'm not sure what we'll do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Families huddled at the edge of the receding waters and stared
at homes further down the street. Water lapped at the roof of a
home at the end of the block and some residents traveled the
streets in the only fitting means of transportation _ a bass boat.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Brewer offered what comfort she could to her friends.
Since Thursday, Brewer has washed several loads of laundry for
flood victims to provide clean clothes for those who lost their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said they needed a little money, so I wrote them a
check. Someone else said they needed food, so I cooked them dinner.
I just wish someone else would tell me what I could do for them,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Don and Billie Stallings wandered through their home and
wondered when they would be able to move back in. While the power
was back on, the damage to their home was significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode across that gate in a canoe,'' Don Stallings said,
pointing to a 6-foot gate at the back of his property. ``We got up
at 4 a.m. on Thursday, and the water was on the terrace. At 7 a.m.,
water was coming in the house. By 9 a.m., water was 2 feet high
inside. You read about it and hear about this kind of thing. Until
you actually see it, though, you can't be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Stallings tried to prepare for the flood. On Wednesday
afternoon, she was busy cooking food and making ice. But the floods
caught her by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready for everything except a flood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pru Eatman was counting her blessings on Monday. Eatman's home
was just above the flooded area left by Floyd and became a
launching area for boats trying to rescue victims and survey
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary watching the water come up the street,'' she
said. ``All my friends down there are just devastated. I was so
lucky.''

DETERMINED YOUNG GETS THE JOB DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Steve Young was a dead man walking. And throwing
touchdowns. And tossing out clever quips.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers quarterback looked up and down his body Sunday
evening, assessing the damage from a tumultuous 28-21 win over the
New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing is ... '' he said, glancing from torso to
toes, unable to choose from so many worthy, pain-filled candidates.
``... What is the worst thing?''
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately picked the welts and scratches all over him. He
blamed Candlestick's infield cutout and speculated that the rocky
surface helped Jeff Kent play second base a lot more than it helped
him play quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the Giants was a nice diversionary tactic. Young
would have done anything to obscure the fact that his
soon-to-be-38-year-old body had just been treated like a crash-test
dummy.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to him, you couldn't have guessed what he'd been
through. Actually, to watch him on the Niners' last drive, you
couldn't have guessed, either. It was as if there were two Steve
Youngs, the one who got no protection from his blockers, and the
one who wanted to protect them from the horrible truth and
consequences of their bad day at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 1 was the dead man.
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 2 was walking.
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 1 could barely stay dressed. He wore his shoulder pads
on his sleeve, because that's where the Saints put them.
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 2 had a bandage on his throwing hand after the game
and pretended it was routine.
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 1 was sacked five times and drilled to the ground 16
more. The TV crew started running the knockdown stats, as if this
were a boxing match.
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 2 said he'd had worse days. ``Let's look back,'' he
said with a grin that showed no pity for Young No. 1. Or, for that
matter, for the Young of 1996 and early 1997, the spindled and
mutilated years.
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 1 rushed plays all day, playing like a man in the face
of death. At the Saints' 3, he threw a pass to fullback Tommy
Vardell for a measly 1-yard gain while Terrell Owens stood
tantalizingly open in the end zone. The 49ers stalled at the 2 when
Young missed another open receiver and threw a quick, off-target
pass to Vardell.
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 2 was asked about that series, and didn't get annoyed
or defensive. He didn't point out that how distracting it was that
the Saints kept showing up in the backfield with him as if they
were invited guests. Or that they were always unfashionably early.
He just called neglecting Owens in the end zone ``a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 1 took a helmet- to-helmet blow from blitzing New
Orleans safety Chris Hewitt and stayed prone for several long
seconds afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Young No. 2 stayed in the game, doubling over periodically, but
still driving the 49ers toward the tying touchdown with 2:03 left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After the touchdown, it was hard to tell which Young was
inhabiting his body. Maybe both personalities moved out. After all,
the accommodations had deteriorated dramatically in just a few
hours. The dilapidated quarterback went straight to the bench,
without even celebrating the touchdown. He slumped into a seat, his
head dangling forward. Trainer Lindsy McLean and team doctor James
Klint flanked him, talking, like contractors on a fixer-upper.
</P>
<P>
   Young finally got up and started walking, pacing, stretching his
arms. He pulled off his helmet, something he rarely does until he
is done playing for the day. He wiped off his head, then mopped up
the inside of the helmet. He had it back on when Lance Schulters
scored on a 64-yard interception return, giving the Niners the
lead. Young embraced Klint, leaning his fiberglass-encased head on
the doctor's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Young and Jerry Rice stood side by side on
the sideline, celebrating between themselves, the remains of a
dynasty watching a clock run down.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that he praised Young's perseverance. The rest of the
conversation, he said, was largely unprintable. They were both
carried away. ``You can probably imagine,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't remember exactly what was said. But his memory, he
insisted, was intact. The hit by Hewitt had left him nauseated and
weary, but not concussed. ``Give me a test,'' he teased reporters
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   OK, were Klint and McLean giving him memory tests on the
sideline? ``No,'' he said. He raced over there only because he
needed to rest. ``I knew we might go into overtime,'' Young said,
``and I needed to build my energy back up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was No. 2, the determined denial-specialist talking. A week
ago, the same character emerged from a dreadful outing in
Jacksonville to promise better, to keep the Niners intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last week,'' Young said, ``I said: `Over my dead
body.''' And, even though he won't admit it, that's exactly how the
Niners won.

FORTYSOMETHING WITH SUV SEEKS SAME IN `ONCE AND AGAIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' feels like real life for someone in the big
four-oh range, though it features genetically enhanced actors.
</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward, who professes to being 43, and her co-star Billy
Campbell aren't exactly skirmishing with bulging waistlines,
thinning hair and wattling necks. Realism has its limits on
prime-time TV.
</P>
<P>
   But viewers who thought Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick had
something to say to them with ``thirtysomething'' a decade ago
might experience the same flush of connection with ``Once and
Again.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC romantic drama, produced by Herskovitz and Zwick,
premieres Tuesday in ``NYPD Blue's'' accustomed time slot. ABC's
game plan is a bit hazy, but ``Once and Again'' is supposed to
borrow the time period for seven weeks, then return to help fill
the ``Monday Night Football'' vacancy in January.
</P>
<P>
   But what if ``Once and Again'' clicks? Would ABC yank a budding
hit off the air?
</P>
<P>
   Network executives are paid huge sums to make decisions like
that. Then they're fired.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, ``Once and Again'' is my candidate for the year's best
new drama. It's quietly sexy. It's nuanced. It's well cast. It puts
genuine emotions on the table.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Once and Again'' has something most TV shows give up
without a fight: dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It's also very herskozwicky, meaning that maybe these people can
be too articulate and too self-reflective for the show's own good.
</P>
<P>
   Ward (``Sisters'') is Lily Manning, mother of two girls, 14 and
9. She's emphatically separated and well on her way to divorce.
Campbell (``The Rocketeer'') is Rick Sammler, the divorced father
of a boy and girl, 16 and 12. He's primed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a white suburban show, to be sure. She's a soccer mom; he's
a soccer dad. They meet when Lily's oldest daughter bruises herself
playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   On their first date, their SUVs are parked side by side at the
restaurant. How perfect is that? On their second date, they're
close to being parked side by side themselves. Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   This is the year of yapping to the camera, and ``Once and
Again'' is no exception. Sprinkled through the show are black and
white segments in which Lily and Rick talk about themselves, as if
being interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Am I happier now? I don't know. Ask me in another three
years. I always had a map for my life, where I was supposed to be
headed. And now it's like I've walked off it entirely. It's
weird.''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``I just don't know where I fit in my own life anymore, and
maybe I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   If I keep this up, I could talk myself into disliking ``Once and
Again.'' But the show plays better than it reads.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find yourself cheering for these two decent people to
take those revved-up sexual protons and build something lasting
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Also, to rip off their clothes and have sex like rutting
badgers.

   _ Mike O'Malley has all the star power of sliced bologna, which
is one reason NBC's ``The Mike O'Malley Show,'' which also
premieres Tuesday, is one of the surer flops of the new season.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason deserves consideration: It's not funny.
</P>
<P>
   O`Malley, best known for his ultimate sports fan commercials on
ESPN, plays a 30-year-old bachelor in New Haven, Conn. He sets up
the show by sitting on his rooftop and talking directly to viewers
about life, love and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The show's main comic force is supposed to be Mark Rosenthal as
O'Malley's slacker roommate, Weasel. Ha ... ha.
</P>
<P>
   _ The other new series Tuesday night is ``Mission Hill,'' WB's
animated comedy from two former ``Simpsons'' producers, Bill Oakley
and Josh Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Hill'' bills itself as the first animated show for and
about Gen-Xers. Who, frankly, deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   Andy French (voice of Wallace Langham) is a 24-year-old salesman
at Waterbed World. He'd rather be a cartoonist. He lives in a funky
inner-city loft with roomie Posie Tyler and his best friend Jim
Kuback.
</P>
<P>
   Two additions to the apartment propel Tuesday's pilot. They're
Andy's 17-year-old brother, Kevin, and the French family dog,
Stogie. The dog is alcoholic; the kid spends some time himself at
the porcelain throne.
</P>
<P>
   The animation style seems a throwback to the late '50s and early
'60s _ bright colors, geometric designs, a sort of ``Jetsons''
style to the human figures.
</P>
<P>
   But the animation is rarely used to advantage, to take stories
to the realm of the outlandish and even impossible, where live
action can't go.
</P>
<P>
   And the writing fizzles. I watched Tuesday's episode and tried
to contribute a giggle. No such luck.

SIPPERS DRINK UP ALCOHOL-FREE WINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TED APPEL   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Technology can perform modern miracles. It
can take the fat out of ice cream and potato chips. The caffeine
out of coffee. The calories out of Coca-Cola. And even the alcohol
out of wine.
</P>
<P>
   More and more health-conscious Americans are discovering the
technological marvel of alcohol-free wines, a small but growing
segment of the U.S. wine market.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol-free wines have been around for almost 25 years, but
many of the early brands were virtually undrinkable. Today, with
advances in winemaking techniques, vintners say they have
dramatically improved the quality of nonalcoholic wines.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: Most wine lovers still won't confuse an
alcohol-free wine with the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pretend to be a real wine. It doesn't have the body
and boldness, because the alcohol gives it that. But it has the
other characteristics of wine,'' said Lou Applebaum, brand manager
for Inglenook St. Regis, which introduced the first nonalcoholic
wine in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of alcohol-free wines are growing about 4 percent
annually, said Rob Celsi, brand manager for Sutter Home Fre, the
top-selling brand in the category. But the market is still a tiny
niche, accounting for less than 0.5 percent of the nation's wine
shipments. Last year, the Big Three makers of nonalcoholic wine _
Sutter Home, Ariel and Inglenook St. Regis _ sold a little over
500,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Demand is driven by affluent baby boomers, mostly women, who are
concerned about their health.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these consumers are wine drinkers who are temporarily
abstaining from alcohol for medical or social reasons, such as
pregnancy or being a designated driver. About half are people who
never drink alcohol, Applebaum said. Surveys by the Wine Market
Council estimate that 30 percent of U.S. adults _ or more than 43
million Americans _ do not drink any alcohol. However, some of
these people buy nonalcoholic wines to celebrate special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of alcohol-free wines spike over the holidays. Inglenook
St. Regis, for example, generates almost half of its annual sales
in the six-week period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The market for nonalcoholic wines did not start expanding until
the 1990s, when Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups
focused the nation's attention on alcohol-related problems in
society. Concerns about alcohol abuse created interest in
alternative beverages, prompting the beer industry to develop a new
line of alcohol-free beers. Noticing the trend, Sutter Home
introduced its nonalcoholic wine in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of alcohol abuse may have driven consumers to
nonalcoholic wines in the early 1990s. But the opposite is true
today: Favorable publicity about the health benefits associated
with moderate consumption of wine is helping its clean and sober
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of red wine soared in the United States after reports by
``60 Minutes'' on the ``French Paradox,'' which suggests that wine
is the reason the French have lower death rates from heart disease
than Americans, despite a similar diet of high-fat foods. Some
researchers believe that moderate consumption of alcohol _ whether
wine, beer or liquor _ leads to improved health. Other researchers
claim that antioxidants in wine _ with or without alcohol _ give it
an advantage over other alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have read about the French Paradox and the
heart-healthy aspects of wine,'' said Craig Rosser, marketing
director for Ariel Vineyards. Nonalcoholic wines provide a choice
for those who ``feel they are missing out because they don't drink
wine with alcohol,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, producers of alcohol-free wines still face hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in selling alcohol-free wines is not persuading
consumers to accept the concept, but rather teaching consumers to
find the products on store shelves, said Eileen Fredrikson, a San
Francisco wine industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retailers don't know where to put it. Is it a wine? Does
it belong with juices? Does it belong with natural products? It's a
niche category, yes, but it is not one that has a uniform placement
in shops. So the consumer doesn't know where to look for it. There
is almost never anyone around to tell you where it is. You truly
have to know about the product and ask for it in many cases,''
Fredrikson said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, alcohol-free wines are more expensive than other
alternative beverages, such as sparkling water or apple cider.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And for good reason. It is not easy making alcohol-free wines.
</P>
<P>
   It all starts with wine made the traditional way: Grapes are
crushed to make juice and then fermented into wine, a process that
transforms sugar into alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, vintners cooked the wine until the alcohol
evaporated. ``It made for a nasty product,'' Celsi said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last decade, vintners have used technology to improve
the wines' complexity and mouth-feel.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel and Inglenook St. Regis remove the alcohol from their
wines through a process called ``reverse osmosis.'' Essentially,
the alcohol is filtered out by squeezing wine through a membrane
with tiny pores. Alcohol and water, which have the smallest
molecules, pass through the membrane and leave behind a syrupy wine
concentrate. Water is then added back to the concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Home uses a different technology, created in Australia:
the ``spinning cone column,'' a 13-foot centrifugal chamber. Wine
is poured into the top of the chamber and flows over a series of
cones. In the first step, nitrogen is used to extract the aroma and
flavor components of wine. The process is then repeated at a higher
temperature to remove the alcohol. Finally, the aroma and flavor
components are reintroduced to the wine, and then the liquid is
blended with unfermented grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   All the nonalcoholic wines have less than 0.5 percent alcohol,
by volume. As a result, they have less than half the calories of a
regular glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   How do they taste? A panel of wine experts assembled by The
Press Democrat gave mixed reviews to 16 alcohol-free wines.
</P>
<P>
   The panel awarded the highest marks to the most simple _ and
least expensive _ alcohol-free wines. Inglenook St. Regis White
Zinfandel, Ariel Blanc and Sutter Home Fre Premium White received
the best ratings for their respective brands. Most cost under $5 a
bottle, and all should be served ice-cold, the panelists said. Some
of the higher-priced wines _ which included vintage-dated,
appellation wines aged in oak barrels _ disappointed the panel.
</P>
<P>
   None of the alcohol-free wines, however, tasted like a
full-fledged varietal. Still, vintners say the quality of
alcohol-free wines has improved significantly in the last decade.

`ONCE AND AGAIN': HOW TO FIND NEW LOVE AND TROUBLE AFTER 40 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Once and Again,'' the upscale, divorced parents who fall
for each other with a few swoony glances while dropping their
children off at school seem to have ``insufferable navel-gazer''
written all over them. That may be what you expect from Edward
Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the creators of ``Thirtysomething''
and ``My So-Called Life.'' Once more they are determined to tap
into a generational moment, this time with people in their 40s in
their second go-round of looking for serious love.
</P>
<P>
   But in a rare instance of television reflecting life, here the
presence of children makes the parents less self-absorbed than they
might have been, whether they like it or not. Lily (Sela Ward) and
Rick (Billy Campbell) each have two children and a cranky
ex-spouse, characters who add a range and texture of realism
missing from the creators' previous shows. This ABC series is as
much about divorce and parents struggling with adolescent
children's sexuality as it is about their trying to find a love
life of their own. In a television landscape dominated by young
singles, ``Once and Again'' comes as a mature surprise. Sharply
written, with a bite, it is also one of the new season's most
polished, accomplished series.
</P>
<P>
   The lead actors help the series over the few patches that
threaten to become too cute or precious. Rick, an architect who has
been divorced for three years, has a teen-age son and a younger
daughter. Campbell is the lesser known of the stars. (He was in the
film ``The Rocketeer.'') He has an understated style that is
effective here, especially in the sequences that sound most
annoying: black-and-white segments in which the characters reveal
their thoughts to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   His first monologue sets the tone for the series, one that is
direct and free of self-pity. ``By the time you get divorced,
there's almost some relief in accepting that you've failed,'' he
says. ``You're worthless; you've destroyed your kids' lives. But
there they are, they still need you.'' And Rick is a believably
imperfect father, reluctant to acknowledge that his handsome
football hero son is failing two subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ward is better known (notably from the series ``Sisters'')
and has the tougher job. Lily is recently divorced, with a daughter
in high school and another in grammar school. She also owns a
bookstore with her sister, though that information doesn't creep in
until next week. Stereotypically, when Rick calls for a date, she
has a dish towel slung over her shoulder and can barely hear above
the noise of family squabbling in her kitchen. Sometimes Lily has a
single tear brimming. So far Ms. Ward has just managed to keep the
portrayal from becoming too mannered and the character from
crossing the line into cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is thanks to the series' most realistic and
compelling character, Lily's adolescent daughter, Grace (played
convincingly by Julia Whelan). In denial, Lily refuses to
acknowledge that her daughter is unpopular and has a weight
problem. Grace is distraught at the possibility that her mother
might have sex, especially with the father of a good-looking guy at
her school. When the children and their father return to Lily's
house, they find her energetically tangled with Rick on the couch.
``It's not OK,'' Grace screams, and runs to her room in horror.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue is often at its best and toughest when it involves
the teen-age characters. ``My mother has a date tonight,'' Grace
forlornly tells a girlfriend as they walk through the hall to
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom dates like six times a week,'' the friend says.
``They're all fat and gross.''
</P>
<P>
   Lily is saddled with too many strained speeches, including one
in which she tearfully tells Grace, ``Fear can be your friend.''
But however pompous or gaga about each other Rick and Lily become,
their former spouses add a bitter tone that cuts through a lot of
sweetness. Jake, Lily's ex-husband, says of their older daughter's
problems: ``She's fine when she's with me. Maybe it's you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' will run in its current time slot for seven
weeks, before ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' returns. If the show succeeds, the
plan is for it to disappear after that and return on Mondays in
January after football. That leaves plenty of time for viewers to
become engrossed in the complications of a love affair that ripples
realistically through two families.

   U.N.-ASSEMBLY (United Nations) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan
sounds a warning to a frequently paralyzed Security Council, saying
it must act faster and more effectively to meet the challenge of a
world engulfed in civil wars that quickly descend into the
slaughter of helpless civilian populations. Speaking to the General
Assembly the day before President Clinton is scheduled to address
world leaders here, Annan did not single out the United States or
any other major nation, but his unusually strong criticism of the
council's initial failures to deal with genocide in Rwanda and 1994
and to agree on responding to Serbian atrocities in Kosovo over the
last year pointed obliquely at U.S. policy decisions. By Barbara
Crossette.

   TIMOR-RDP (Dili, East Timor) _ The vanguard of an international
peacekeeping force stakes its claim to this silent and broken town,
watched warily by clusters of refugees, sullen Indonesian troops
and small, angry groups of militiamen. There was no resistance _
but no welcome _ for the peacekeepers, who arrived with all the
firepower and high technology of modern war. There is no peace to
keep: East Timor's tiny capital is a dead city, burned, looted,
evacuated. By Seth Mydans. 1,100 words.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-CAROLINA (Tarboro, N.C.) _ There are 10,000 people in
shelters in North Carolina and two thousand of them are being
housed in a high school gymnasium here where there is no running
water. Most of the people are from tiny village of Princeville,
population 2,000. Princeville was the first town in America
chartered by feed slaves and now is completely underwater. Not even
rooftops can be seen from helicopters overhead and there is no way
in or out by road. Signs of devastation are everywhere in North
Carolina. But even more rain is expected Monday night and this may
worsen flooding on eastern North Carolina rivers. At least 23
people were confirmed dead after 20 inches of rain inundated North
Carolina's coastal plain. By Peter Kilborn.

   NJ-POLICE (Trenton, N.J.) _ After months of delays in her
attempt to address the racial discrimination problems plaguing the
New Jersey State Police, Gov. Christie Whitman nominates New York
FBI supervisor Carson Dunbar to become the next State Police
superintendent and reform the culture of a force with a long
pattern of mistreating minority motorists and black and Latino
troopers. Dunbar, who served briefly as a New Jersey trooper before
joining the FBI 22 years ago, is expected to win easy confirmation
in the state Senate. By David Kocieniewski.
</P>
<P>
   JONES-PLAGIARISM (New York) _ Atlantic Monthly Press has halted
the October publication of a biography of John Paul Jones by the
prolific Scottish author James Mackay, pending resolution of
questions about similarities to the last major Jones biography,
published in 1959 by the eminent American historian Samuel Eliot
Morison. By Ralph Blumenthal. 2,600 words.

 &HT;    Clinton tours flood-ravaged towns in North Carolina
 &HT;    By Viola Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARBORO. N.C. _ Tears flowed down the face of Princeville
resident Patricia Woodard as she listened to remarks by President
Clinton during his visit to Edgecombe County Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard, like more than 4,000 other Edgecombe County residents,
stood near the corner of Main and Church streets as Clinton, Gov.
James B. Hunt and other state and federal officials toured the
flooded aftermath of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all gone,'' Woodard said. ``I don't know what we'll do.
But I'm just happy we were able to get out. I'm glad (Clinton)
came, and I hope he does what he said he's going to do, especially
about getting housing. The shelter is filling up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised Edgecombe County residents the federal
government would stand by them until they got back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been profoundly impressed by the family spirit of the
people of Edgecombe County,'' Clinton said. ``I hope all of you
will keep that attitude. I can only imagine how many of you feel,
spending the night in these shelters with small children. We have
to wait for waters to go down and make sure that the (drinking)
water is not contaminated. Keep up the good work. We're going to
stay with you as long as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton toured the damaged areas of Tarboro, Princeville and
Greenville by air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much bigger than Grand Forks, South Dakota,'' he told
officials in remarks later released to the press. ``I bet when the
cost comes in, it will be as much as the Mississippi Flood. It was
beyond what we imagined. All of the stuff you see floating here and
on the video _ it was beyond the 500-year flood plain. This is
literally more than you would anticipate less than once every 500
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton outlined some of the initiatives going on
to help residents who have been devastated by the flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I flew over the town of Princeville and saw the houses and
businesses still buried under water, I'm just thankful that so many
lives were saved,'' Clinton said. ``I'll do my best to do what
Congresswoman Eva Clayton has asked for so I don't have to have her
camped out on the White House lawn. When she wants something for
you, she comes right to the White House and tells me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by residents and downtown merchants, Clinton said,
``One thing I've learned is that no matter how much television
shows, it does not do justice to what's really happening because it
can't show what's going on inside the people. I know it's hard to
have to take your kids to a shelter. I know it's hard for folks who
have been farmers for 40 years to watch a crop totally destroyed
and wonder if they will be able to buy seed again.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has worked hard to build a good economy
and take care of health care needs, Clinton said. But once in a
while something happens that makes government officials understand
they are not in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it can happen to all of us,'' Clinton said. ``All of
our prayers and thoughts are with you, but we all have a
responsibility as part of the American family to help get you back
on your feet. Too many people have died, and there are still too
many unaccounted for. With all of the loss, we thank God people are
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noticed a minister in the audience wearing a shirt that
said, ``Too blessed to be stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's keep that attitude,'' the president said.

AIRLINES FACE SCRUTINY OVER WHEELCHAIR POLICIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rights of disabled airline travelers under federal laws are
getting renewed attention from the Department of Transportation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August the department served Continental Airlines with a
complaint saying that the airline had treated three wheelchair
passengers illegally, and seeking fines of $250,000. Action against
other airlines is likely soon, according to Nancy E. McFadden,
general counsel in the department. The department has been looking
into the complaint letters it has received, she said, and is
preparing much broader moves against five airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McFadden would not identify the airlines, but the department
has begun breaking down by airline its monthly tabulation of
complaint letters from disabled passengers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The initial tabulation, covering January through June 1999,
showed that United led the list, with 37 letters. Then came US
Airways with 31, American and Delta with 23 each, and Northwest
with 19. The other domestic airlines, and foreign carriers, were in
single digits; Continental had 8. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McFadden said that Transportation Secretary Rodney E.
Slater, who took over the department on Feb. 14, 1997, has made
disability issues a priority. ``It is our strong belief that
complaints from the disabled are civil rights complaints and should
be treated differently from the others,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a separate step at the end of August, the department proposed
a new rule requiring that boarding lifts be provided for mid-sized
planes (those with 31 or more seats) if level-entry boarding or
ramps were not otherwise available. This would mean that wheelchair
users would not need to be carried up steps by airline employees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And under a new rule that recently took effect, airlines that
damage or lose wheelchairs may no longer limit their liability to
$2,500. The rule uncapping such damages became final on Aug. 2, the
department said. The previous limit was not high enough to cover
many electric wheelchairs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case against Continental began when Paul Tobin, Angelo
Bianco and Gerard M. Kelly reported that they were not able to get
their wheelchairs stored in cabins, as the law required, instead of
with the luggage, did not get seats in rows with movable armrests
and were bumped while being placed in seats with fixed armrests,
were stranded aboard long after other passengers had debarked or
were not able to get appropriate answers to their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   They were represented by the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans
Association, an advocacy group that has played a major role in
getting lift-equipped buses onto municipal routes. In 1998, it
filed formal charges for its three clients, saying Continental
violated the Air Carrier Access Act. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after a preliminary investigation, Samuel
Podberesky, assistant general counsel for aviation enforcement at
the department, told the airline that his office found that the
complaints, and others it uncovered, were probably valid and that
it was asking an administrative law judge to hold a hearing and
levy fines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continental, in response, unequivocally denies that it
discriminated against people with disabilities. Noting that the
department had found Continental's training of employees in dealing
with disabled passengers to be adequate, the airline said
``occasional inadvertent mistakes by an individual do not
constitute discrimination on the part of the corporation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July the department's monthly summary of flight delays, the
Air Travel Consumer Report, added its breakout of disabled
passengers' complaint letters by airline. Ms. McFadden said that
this step was taken in response to a suggestion by the National
Council on Disability, an independent government agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months of the year, the department received 192
such letters citing United States and foreign lines. The figures
for the month of July, published Sept. 8, showed 42 disability
complaints for the major domestic airlines, with US Airways getting
9, followed by United with 7, Delta with 6, American and Northwest
with 4 each, and the others with fewer or none. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The totals represent only complaints sent to the Department of
Transportation by consumers, unlike reports on lost baggage and
overbooking, data that the airlines are required to pass on to the
government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Air Travel Consumer Report can be found at
www.dot.gov/airconsumer on the Web. Single copies of a monthly
report can be ordered at (202) 366-2220. Requests can also be sent
to Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, Department of
Transportation, 400 Seventh Street S.W., C-75, Room 4107,
Washington, D.C. 20590. This address can also be used for
complaints.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association, 75-20 Astoria
Boulevard, Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370, (718) 803-3782, has
published a free booklet, ``Accessible Air Travel,'' summarizing
provisions of the 1986 law; a laminated pocket summary is being
prepared. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its notice of proposed rule-making on provision of lifts for
medium-sized planes, the department said it would improve the
comfort, safety and dignity of disabled passengers because airlines
are now permitted to carry wheelchair passenger up steps if no jet
bridge is available.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that if airlines and airports cooperated,
the proposed rule would be inexpensive to enforce, since the lifts
now required for planes with 19 to 30 seats could be used. People
who want to comment on this proposal have until Nov. 26 to do so to
the address above. &QL;

   Paris Bike Tours
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it possible to sign up for a bicycle tour in and around
Paris in October, or is this only an option in the summer? _ Brian
M. Jameson, Columbus, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of the companies that organize guided bicycle tours in
Paris offer them through Oct. 31, so you'll just make it. Here are
a few companies you might try:
</P>
<P>
   From its headquarters at 37 Boulevard Bourdon, near the
Bastille, Paris a Velo, C'est Sympa runs daily guided tours in
English from early March through the end of October and continues
throughout the year on a more limited basis. Most tours last about
three hours and vary in levels of difficulty, from the gentle
nine-mile Heart of Paris tour _ an exploration of the center of the
city from the Jewish quarter and the Louvre to the Ile de la Cite _
to the more intensive 16-mile Paris Contrast, which focuses on the
northern, hillier neighborhoods of the city. Dawn and early evening
tours are also available. Daytime tours cost $27 (calculated at the
rate of 6.2 francs to the dollar); evening tours are $31. Full-day
trips to Versailles or elsewhere in the surrounding countryside are
also options and cost $48. All prices include bike rental. Take
your own picnic for the full-day tour. Information: (33-1)
48.87.60.01.
</P>
<P>
   Maison Rue Libre, in the Forum des Halles, offers a variety of
tours through the end of October, after which it caters to groups
of at least three people by reservation only. The
one-and-a-half-hour Relaxed Visits tour explores the Latin Quarter,
the financial district, the Roman Baths of Cluny and the Place des
Vosges and other sites. Three-hour tours range in theme from
Mysterious Paris and Green Paris to Paris by Night. There's even a
Market Shopping Paris tour on Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Ninety-minute tours cost $17; the three-hour trips are $27, with a
discount for children under 12 and groups of more than 10 people.
Prices include bike rental. All reservations should be made at
least 24 hours before the tour and are available in several
languages, including English. Maison Rue Libre also rents bikes to
individuals throughout the year. On weekends from March 1 to Oct.
31, the company rents bicycles from buses situated throughout
Paris. For information call (33-1) 53.46.43.77. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Decathlon, a chain of sporting goods stores, rents bikes for $10
to $21 a day. Each additional day costs about half of the first
day's price. There are four stores in Paris and in major
metropolitan areas throughout France. The most centrally situated
Decathlon is at 17 Boulevard de la Madeleine in the first
arrondissement (33-1) 55.35.97.55.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller cycling stores in Paris, like Velo Bastille (33-1)
48.87.60.80; Paris Velo, (33-1) 43.37.59.22; and Maison du Velo
(33-1) 42.81.24.72; also rent out bikes for an average of $13 a
day.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking Portuguese in Rio
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can I take Portuguese lessons in Rio? _ Hortense Bilow,
Harrisburg, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your possibilities range from single classes to intensive,
multi-week courses. Here are three examples:
</P>
<P>
   Feedback, a language school with two branches _ one downtown at
74 Rua da Quitanda, the other at 35 Rua Farme de Amoedo in Ipanema
_ offers Portuguese lessons on an individual basis. Each one-hour
lesson costs $19 in the morning and $16 in the afternoon, and
students can start at any time of the year and choose the number of
days or weeks they want to attend. Information: (55-21) 552-0598
(Ipanema), (55-21) 221-1863 (downtown). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Copacabana, the Brazil-United States Institute offers
beginning, intermediate and advanced Portuguese classes. Each level
costs $233 and takes five weeks, with two hours of daily lessons
including conversation, grammar and reading. The classes are held
at 690 Avenida Copacabana. Information: (55-21) 548-8332. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic University, at 225 Rua Marques de Sao Vicente, in
Rio's Gavea district, offers a more extensive, five-level series of
classes of one semester each. Classes are held three times a week
and run from March to June or August to early December. Tuition for
a semester is $360. Information: (55-21) 529-9209.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Eresma Valley Sites
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you tell me something about a historic monastery and some
other sites in the Eresma Valley near Segovia? I am finding very
little about this area in guidebooks. _ Elizabeth Wassman, San
Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. The Eresma River starts in the Sierra de Guadarrama, runs
downhill past La Granja and along the northern edge of Segovia, and
continues a long northwesterly route through pine forests and grain
fields before ending in the Duero River. Situated near the river,
and just outside the old walled section of Segovia but still within
city limits, are four notable sites within a 30-minute walk
starting from the Roman aqueduct along Santa Lucia Street.
</P>
<P>
   The first site is the Casa de la Moneda, the former Royal Mint
that began operations in the 16th century and continued for three
centuries, minting some of the gold and silver brought back from
Spain's New World colonies. The stone mint is closed and can be
seen only from the outside, but a restoration is planned for the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   A bit farther down the road, which has now become a firm dirt
path, is the large El Parral Monastery, founded by King Enrique IV
in 1447, and paid for by the Marques de Villena, a 15th-century
noble who is buried there along with his wife and at least one
child. The monastery's principal stone church _ with richly carved
doors and Renaissance details _ celebrates Mass with Gregorian
chants every Sunday. It is open daily; hours vary.
</P>
<P>
   From there, return to the mint and turn onto a marked trail
along the Eresma River to reach the small San Marcos neighborhood
that contains La Vera Cruz Church, a 13th-century Romanesque
polygonal edifice, which is believed to have been built for the
Knights Templar. Open daily, except Monday; hours vary.
</P>
<P>
   In the same neighborhood, a few minutes away, is the Carmelitas
Descalzos Convent, whose principal church is from the 16th century.
Torquemada, of Inquisition notoriety, once was the prior there and
Pope John Paul II visited it in 1982. The tomb of St. John of the
Cross is at the site. It, too, is open daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Segovia Provincial Tourist Office, at 1 Plaza del Azoguejo,
has details about each site; (34 921) 462-906.

   Egalite at Last On Paris Trains &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may have gone unnoticed by many tourists on their way to
Versailles, Fontainebleau or Disneyland Paris, but until Sept. 1
Paris' suburban trains still had first-class cars, eight years
after the Paris Metro had done away with its own class system. But
no longer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the Transport Ministry and several citizens'
rights groups, the Paris Metro company and the national railway
company, which together manage suburban train service, decided to
eliminate the first-class option this month. The change, which
transportation officials say affects less than 3 percent of
passengers, has increased the capacity of suburban trains by 10
percent. This is because the first-class cars were nearly empty,
with few people actually paying the more than 50 percent markup. &QL;

   Cartier Exhibition Goes to Chicago &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartier 1900-1939,'' an exhibition celebrating the jewelry
company's centennial, makes an appearance at the Field Museum in
Chicago this fall. More than 200 objects are included in the
exhibition, which was organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art
and the British Museum. The examples of Cartier's work draw from
nature, architecture and such far-flung inspirations as maharajahs,
Tutankhamen's tomb, and the ornate trinkets of the czars. Several
pieces are on loan from museums in Paris and Geneva. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the art world embraced modernism, the young Louis Cartier, a
partner in his father's House of Cartier, developed techniques that
brought a new look to ornamentation. A dragonfly of jewels and
platinum, for example, appears to hover weightlessly above its
wearer; a diamond and ruby tiara, in contrast, gets texture and
dimension from a black steel setting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cartier is considered the first jeweler to have shifted the
focus on his craft from luxury to design, but the show is not
without opulence. No precious material goes unrepresented, and
several pieces _ made specifically for heiresses, movie stars and
other modern royals _ are unmistakably extravagant. Design sketches
and original plaster molds are also on view. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show opens Saturday, with two days of related activities,
and continues until Jan. 16 at the Field Museum, 1400 South Lake
Shore Drive, at Roosevelt Road. For details: (312) 922-9410 or

   Where East Meets West in Berlin &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The historic Friedrichstrasse station, formerly the only border
crossing for rail passengers between East and West Berlin, is one
of the most famous Cold War frontiers, a classic rendezvous point
in espionage fact and fiction. Every day, about 110,000 commuters
and shoppers walk past the once terrifying police checkpoint that
adjoined the station, now a memorial _ called Traenenpalast, or
Palace of Tears _ to German families divided by the Wall and a
sometime setting for concerts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After four years of renovation, this 1882 landmark is well on
the way to being restored to its prewar glory. Even though work
will continue for another year and a half, on Sept. 2, the
refurbished Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof, representing an investment of
$106 million, was re-introduced to the Berlin public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of the distinctive, 1920s-style bluish-brown
ceramic-brick facade required 5,000 handmade pieces of black terra
cotta trim. Inside, the last police barriers have long since been
swept aside to make room for a grand hall that houses 50 shops and
snack bars, plus ticketing and information booths. A formal
restaurant will open shortly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of the station complements recent architectural
projects in this rapidly gentrifying shopping district of East
Berlin, including a new Checkpoint-Charlie Business Center that
features an eight-story Philip Johnson office building at 200
Friedrichstrasse and the Galeries Lafayette department store with
its egg-shaped atrium at 23 Friedrichstrasse. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Raisa Maksimovna Gorbachev, who broke Kremlin tradition
by sharing the spotlight with her husband, the former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, and did so with bold self-assurance
and flair, died Monday in Muenster, Germany. She was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, aides to Gorbachev said. She had been
under treatment in University Hospital in Muenster since late July.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Communist Party in
1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the Soviet Union's
calcified politics and economy. But it was Raisa Gorbachev who,
both at home and abroad, soon came to embody the changes to come.
She emerged as a first lady who had her own mind, her own style and
according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after
one of her foreign trips, her own American Express card.
</P>
<P>
   None of this endeared her to the Soviet public, who began to
grumble early in her husband's tenure that she was too pushy, too
flashy and too influential. Her appearances on foreign trips and
her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many Russian
kitchens over whether the proper place for Kremlin wives was _ as
it had always been _ at home, or at least in the background.
</P>
<P>
   But since early September, when Russians first learned that
their former first lady had been hospitalized in Germany with an
advanced and rare case of leukemia, sentiments toward her in Russia
began to shift. Favorable articles began to appear in the press,
and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the
hospital in Muenster, where her husband kept a faithful vigil that
touched many Russian hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be in the Russian character _ to run somebody into the
mud, and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes,''
said Vladimir Polyakov, a Gorbachev spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, Gorbachev's bitter rival in the early
1990s, sent a message of condolence Monday, and in a statement, he
said, that a ``wonderful person, a beautiful woman, a loving wife
and mother is no longer with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, published in 1996, Gorbachev acknowledged
that the resentment over his wife's high profile surfaced in
letters written to the Communist Party's Central Committee. ``Who
does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?'' he quoted one
as saying. ``The simplest answer would have been: `No, she is my
wife.'''
</P>
<P>
   She first became known in the West in 1984 when she accompanied
her husband, then a ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, to
Britain, where they were received by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. Diplomats and reporters, scanning the couple for clues
about the next generation of Soviet leaders, quickly focused up on
her wardrobe _ in particular her gold lame sandals with chain
straps, a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other Kremlin wives.
On a later trip to France, the French press labeled her clothes
``elegant, but not chic.''
</P>
<P>
   On her foreign travels, she also became known for a haughty
conversational style that bordered on the pedantic. During the 1986
summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, she needled her tour guides
with persistent questioning, adding didactic commentary of her own.
Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, she irked
Nancy Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to
socialism, reportedly prompting the American president's wife to
quip, ``Who does that dame think she is?''
</P>
<P>
   As she became more comfortable in her role as the Soviet first
lady, she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued. On a
visit to Washington in 1990, she established more friendly
relations with Barbara Bush, from whom she got a recipe for
blueberry pie.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Siberian city of Rubtsovsk, Raisa Titarenko grew up
as the daughter of a railway engineer. She graduated from school
with a gold medal _ top honors in the Soviet system _ and went on
to the prestigious University of Moscow. She was studying
philosophy there when she met Gorbachev, then a law student.
According to his book, he was smitten, but she was aloof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first meeting had not impressed Raisa at all,'' he wrote.
``She seemed calm and indifferent _ judging by the look in her
eyes.'' Not much later, at an impromptu party staged by Gorbachev's
roommates for Raisa and her friends, ``I wanted to impress her,''
he wrote, but ``I think I made a terrible fool of myself. She was
reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intense courtship, the two penniless students were
married in 1953, the year of Stalin's death. They had one daughter,
Irina, born in 1956, who survives her along with Gorbachev and two
granddaughters, Xenia and Anastasia.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple completed their college work in 1955, the
family returned to Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern
Russia. There Mrs. Gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation,
entitled ``The Emergence of New Characteristics in the Daily Life
of Collective Farm Peasantry,'' based on an unusual amount of field
research, which was accepted by the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When her husband, then first party secretary in Stavropol, was
promoted to Moscow as a Central Committee secretary in charge of
agriculture, she returned to academics, taking a job as lecturer in
philosophy at Moscow University, a position which she gave up when
he became general secretary of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   As the wife of the Soviet leader, she was enlisted as a board
member of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, headed by Dmitri S.
Likhachevcq, one of Russia's most distinguished academicians, which
was created to promote the arts and to restore the country's
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In this role, she became one of her husband's conduits to the
Russian intelligentsia, which was then rallying to his call for
more ``glasnost,'' or openness. As Soviet censorship eased, the
Soviet people rushed to rediscover books and parts of their own
history that had been buried under a rigid Communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gorbachev's most traumatic moments came during the August
1991 coup, when the Gorbachevs were held hostage at a seaside villa
in the Crimea while a group of Communist hard-liners tried to seize
control in Moscow. The coup failed, and Gorbachev and his family
returned to Moscow, visibly shaken. ``Raisa Maksimovna took it very
hard,'' said Gorbachev at a news conference after their return to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Raisa Gorbachev published a book of reminiscences,
entitled in English, ``I Hope,'' which she decided to write after a
visit with Mrs. Bush in 1990 to Wellesley College where, she said,
``the girls showered me with questions.'' Reviewers found the book
self-serving in parts but also informative about the couple's
intellectual journey as, together, they came to realize the flaws
in the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   In her last years, Mrs. Gorbachev started a club that drew
together a dozen well-known and high-powered Russian women for
conferences, charitable projects and informal debates. She
described the group as an attempt to promote a civil society in
Russia. Against her wishes, the club became known as the Raisa
Maksimovna Club.
</P>
<P>
   Lyudmila Telen, a deputy editor at the newspaper Moscow News and
a member of the club, said her impressions of Mrs. Gorbachev
changed as she got to know her better. ``She set herself very high
goals _ she felt she had to improve herself,'' said Ms. Telen.
``Going from wife of a provincial first secretary to first lady was
a big jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to represent the country in a new way. She
understood that what Mikhail Sergeyevich was doing was a
revolution, but she had many complexes, too _ a natural reserve and
a Soviet way of behavior that she tried to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Telen said Mrs. Gorbachev was well aware of the resentment
against her felt by many Russians. But she herself was never
bitter. ``She realized that people had been used to different
women, different traditions, different leaders,'' said Ms. Telen.
``She understood it. It hurt her of course, but I never heard her
be mean or bitter about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a couple, the Gorbachevs shared interests in philosophy and
literature, theater and politics. Gorbachev on several occasions
acknowledged that he often turned to his wife for advice. In his
book, he recalled how the two would have their most serious
discussions in the garden of their government-provided apartment,
beyond the earshot of KGB eavesdropping devices.
</P>
<P>
   Their close relationship was the envy of their friends. At a
dinner in Paris in the fall of 1985, her host said she confided:
``I am very lucky with Mikhail. We are really friends, or if you
prefer, we have great complicity.''
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, when
Yeltsin took over Gorbachev's office in the Kremlin, he became a
political pariah in Russia, widely blamed for ushering in reforms
that led to a decade of political and economic instability.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous run for the presidency in 1996, he maintained
a low profile at home, while Mrs. Gorbachev, who accompanied him on
the international lecture circuit, became practically invisible
until her recent illness.
</P>
<P>
   With a diagnosis of acute leukemia, Mrs. Gorbachev was rushed to
the hospital in Muenster, Germany on July 25. News of her
hospitalization became public only in early August.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian news reports, Gorbachev remained at her
side day and night. ``Dear God,'' the former Soviet president,
visibly exhausted, told a Russian television reporter on Aug. 9,
``for her to undergo such a drama these two days before my very
eyes.''

 &HT;    MILITARY GETS BILL FOR PRESIDENTIAL TRAVEL
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's tour of Africa last year
brought along more than 1,300 American military and civilian
officials, 13 helicopters and enough gear to require 98 air cargo
missions, all at a cost of more than $42.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Military cooks from the White House ``mess'' also went along to
prepare some meals for first family, says a study by the U.S.
General Accounting Office scheduled to be released later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The report, an advance copy of which was obtained by Cox
Newspapers, unlocks some of the long-held secrets surrounding the
costs of presidential travel. The GAO, the investigative arm of
Congress, examined Clinton's six-nation visit to Africa as well as
his trips last year to China and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Africa tour, billed largely as a goodwill mission,
required 10 separate advance delegations to arrange the itinerary.
More than 200 White House aides either accompanied Clinton or
traveled on an advance trip, and more than 900 military personnel
were deployed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 10-day trip to China in the summer of 1998 cost at least
$18.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ A four-day trip to Chile to attend a regional summit in April
1998 was estimated at $10.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The expense totals do not include security costs, which are
classified. However, drawn from federal agencies and U.S.
embassies, the study is probably the most authoritative estimate of
how much it costs when a president goes abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The report is unusual because presidential travel budgets have
long been closely held by administrations of both parties. Expenses
are divided among perhaps a dozen federal agencies and often kept
secret.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the GAO did not compare the cost of Clinton's
trips to previous presidential travel.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Craig Thomas of
Wyoming asked the accounting office for the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have President Clinton asking the military to do more with
less and cutting the defense budget to the bone,'' said Jerry
Fritz, an aide to Craig. ``And we find that he's spending defense
money to travel the world with little or nothing to show for it.''
Of the $72.1 million total for the three trips, 84 percent was
charged to the Defense Department. Most of the expenses came in
airlifting people and gear.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman David Leavey said that the president takes
overseas trips ``that he deems to be in the national interest'' and
added, ``I reject any notion that somehow we're taking erroneous
trips.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For the Africa trip, the military flew 98 air cargo missions for
equipment such as the president's bulletproof limousine,
sophisticated communications gear and motorcade vehicles. The cost
was more than $29 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tanker aircraft flew 110 aerial refueling missions to transport
13 Army and Marine helicopters to sites in Africa, at a cost of $1
million. And flying passengers aboard Air Force One and other
military aircraft cost $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department assumed the second largest share of the
cost for all of the trips. It paid for lodging, car rentals and
phone services for its own personnel and White House staffers as
well as members of Congress. Sixteen lawmakers accompanied Clinton
to Africa, while six went to China and five to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Private citizens invited by Clinton as guests are required to
pay their own way and were not listed in the report. The traveling
press corps, which flies on a private charter, is also billed for
presidential trips.

CALABRIA BY THE SEA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Paul Hofmann, who lives in Rome, is the author of ``Umbria: Italy's
Timeless Heart'' (Holt).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the parapet of the little piazza at Tropea in Calabria, the
limestone cliff drops perpendicularly 150 feet, and you see the sea
gulls wheeling below you. Every pebble and rock outcrop on the deep
bottom of the aquamarine sea is visible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such crystal-clear waters are an exception today off the
European shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Yet Calabria, the rocky
southwestern subpeninsula of the Italian peninsula, boasts many
bays and coves that are still limpid.
</P>
<P>
   Many are now surrounded by condominium developments, shuttered
most of the year, as well as by beach hotels and a plethora of
recently built pizzerias. And more are building from the Gulf of
Policastro to the Straits of Messina. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tropea, one of Calabria's jewels, is framed by such modern
developments and by campsites. But the ancient town, high up on its
panoramic promontory, has retained a measure of authenticity, and
the sea is still a palette of blues, from nearly green to azure to
indigo.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the annual ecological surveys of Italy's 5,000 miles of
seashore have up to now given the coastal waters here and in most
of Calabria a clean bill of health. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That airy lookout, with its bronze cannon and its clusters of
elderly men on the stone benches who discuss the catches brought in
by the fishing boats and the national soccer championship, commands
one of the greatest views of the Tyrrhenian coastline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fine sand on the beach at the foot of the towering cliff is
white, in season dotted with gaudy umbrellas. A craggy rock just
off Tropea, today linked to the mainland by a narrow strip of land,
is crowned by an old Benedictine sanctuary, St.-Mary-of-the-Isle. A
few miles to the south the green Cape Vaticano recalls the epoch
five centuries ago when the papal state had its own fleet of
galleys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the horizon looms the cone of Stromboli, one of Europe's few
active volcanoes, a 3,040-foot-high younger cousin of Mount Etna in
Sicily and Vesuvius near Naples. On clear days one can see the
cloud of smoke that often hangs over the crater of the small
circular island. Sunsets in Tropea have the color of amethyst. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The town, which today has a permanent population of 7,000, was
successively Greek, Roman and Arabic, and through the ages had to
endure the multifarious invaders who passed through Calabria or
occupied it. The Normans, who drove out the Saracens in the 11th
century, built Tropea's remarkable cathedral with the sand-colored
stone of the district. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you hear English spoken in the narrow streets or at the cafe
tables in the squares, the chances are they aren't tourists but
Americans visiting relatives; enormous numbers left the region for
America early in the century.
</P>
<P>
   The Calabrians, unlike the lively Neapolitans, are often
reserved; the visitor who approaches them civilly will be met with
grave courtesy. A sojourn in Tropea is particularly pleasant
because it's not just a seaside resort but also a genuine old
Calabrian town with an intense local life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many thousands of Italians from the north pour into Tropea and
other Calabrian beach towns in August, the nation's hallowed
vacation period, when Milan, Turin and the other big cities become
deserted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During four visits to Calabria in spring 1998 and winter 1999, I
avoided the summer crowds, enjoyed many sunny days, obtained
favorable hotel rates and ate deliciously fresh seafood. I also saw
owners of second homes on the coast who come over the weekends from
Naples and Rome, and some early guests from northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, when the sea must have still been quite
chilly (I didn't care to find out), Virgilio Ciccarelli, manager of
the Virgilio Hotel in Tropea, where I stayed, told me: ``A Finnish
travel group just left; they have been bathing in the sea every
day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The international travel industry appears about to discover
Calabria, which until now _ together with the neighboring region of
Basilicata _ used to be the part of Italy least known to foreign
tourists (and to millions of Italians too). Once the rush of August
vacationers is over, the golden autumn along the Calabrian coasts
is particularly gratifying, as I know from previous years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sea, there is the sub-tropical vegetation _
tall palms, pines, cypresses, cactuses, fig and lemon trees and
vines everywhere. A ruined castle scowls from almost every other
hill, some of them like the one in Cirella, adapted as a setting
for concerts, plays and other summer events.
</P>
<P>
   The rocky coastline is studded with ancient watchtowers that,
until the early 19th century, would alert the villagers and
townspeople when they sighted pirates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Cirella, 125 miles north of Tropea, I looked up old friends
who have retired to Calabria from Virginia (they are of Northern
Italian stock) to live in a pleasant whitewashed house with a
flower garden and a terrace looking out on a tiny, privately owned
offshore island. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My headquarters in Cirella was a new hotel, the Ducale, in a
restored seaside villa that the dukes of the Gonzaga clan built for
themselves in the 18th century. The noble complex vaunts a walled
garden with palms, giant cactuses, shrubbery and flower beds, and a
private beach. My large room, looking out on the garden, was
soberly but comfortably furnished and had a modern bathroom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The old, still-inhabited village of Cirella, a short distance
from the shoreside resort, climbs a slope below the ruins of a
hilltop town that Hannibal razed 2,200 years ago, and that in later
centuries was rebuilt and destroyed again, the last time by a
French fleet in 1806. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a little to the south, is the beach resort of Diamente,
with a tree-lined boardwalk. A jewelry trader from West 47th Street
in Manhattan, who was spending a few weeks in Calabria, walked with
me around the crooked streets, showing me the frescoes that
contemporary local and foreign artists have painted on facades of
the old buildings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another resort, eight miles to the north, Scalea, with ancient
houses marching up a hill and a modern seaside neighborhood, has
good hotels on either side of a rock with a restored medieval
fortress on top; underneath are caves in which stone-age tools were
found. The fortress and its fenced approaches are now privately
owned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During one of my recent trips to Calabria, I also revisited the
inland city of Cosenza, 54 miles southeast. Its Old Town, a warren
of lanes around the Gothic cathedral, huddles below a hill with a
massive, square castle and an octagonal 13th-century tower.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Cosenza, with broad, regular streets, extends from the
confluence of the Busento and Crati Rivers almost all the way to
the village of Rende, the seat of the University of Calabria. Built
in 1973, this state school is one of the very few Italian
institutions of higher learning with dorms on campus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere below the waters of the Busento the king of the
Visigoths, Alaric, is supposed to be buried, along with a fabulous
treasure. The barbarian conqueror died in A.D. 412 in or near
Cosenza, and his warriors are said to have forced their prisoners
to divert the river and dig a royal tomb, into which they lowered
Alaric's body together with spoils from their sack of Rome two
years earlier. They then restored the original course of the
Busento and massacred the prisoners, so that the site of the grave
would remain secret. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During World War II the chief of the Nazi SS, Heinrich Himmler,
dispatched a team of engineers and archeologists to Cosenza, hoping
they would locate the secret tomb of the Germanic king and recover
the Roman gold. They failed, as have other treasure hunters before
and since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cosenza is the obvious starting point for exploring the sullenly
mountainous Sila massif. During my latest visit, in January, when
the icy wind known as the buran swept down the continent from
Siberia and hit southern Italy, snow and ice on the roads made a
foray into the forested heights inadvisable. During an earlier
Calabrian tour, the Sila reminded me of the Alps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mountain area is an enormous, rugged block of granite,
rising to an altitude of 6,332 feet in the Botte Donato heights,
which are usually snowcapped until June. There are still patches of
dense woods _ pines, spruces, oaks, chestnuts and beeches _ from
which in antiquity the Greek city-states of Sicily and even the
Athenians cut timber for their ships. Vast pastures cover the
plateaus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 100 specimens of the light-gray Apennine wolf, a protected
species, are known to be still living in the Sila, especially in
its national park. A pair of wolves were sighted on the outskirts
of Consenza in the coldest days of January, but I saw nothing more
than a few timid stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Natural and artificial lakes in the thinly populated mountains
supply the water for power plants. It's a great environment for
hiking, camping and, in the cold winters, skiing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During my latest stay in Cosenza I reread chapters from Norman
Douglas' ``Old Calabria,'' published in 1915. This intrepid and
quirky Scottish traveler who, among other feats, traversed the Sila
on foot, tells of villages without male adults _ they had all
emigrated to America _ and of grinding poverty, brigandage,
widespread malaria and even pockets of cholera. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Calabria has come a long way. It is as healthy now
as the rest of Italy. Many Calabrians who emigrated to Germany as
``guest workers'' in the 1950s have returned and bought property or
started businesses. The government has stepped up its fight against
organized crime; some bandits still hold out in the Aspromonte, the
rough, forest-clad mountain ranges in the toe of the Italian boot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In comparison to affluent northern Italy, Calabria is less
developed, especially the interior. Unemployment is high. But the
region seems ready for an economic takeoff. The Rome government and
the European Union have promised investment aid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the projected manufacturing plants, hotels and vacation
villages, the big challenge is to keep the waters of Tropea and the
other Calabrian bays and nooks as clean as they are today, and its
landscape relatively uncluttered.
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, am reasonably confident that at least some of this
beautiful coast will remain pristine; having been hooked on
Calabria, I plan to return.

WITHOUT THE FUSS AND FLASH, GANNON JUST GET THE JOB DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Tim Brown's last memory this good is six years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, this is the biggest road win I can remember since
we beat Buffalo in '93,'' the oldest living Raider without a ring
said Sunday, basking cheerily in the glow of, well, the biggest
road win the Raiders have had since they beat Buffalo in 1993 to
kick-start their last playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, Oakland's 22-17 win over Minnesota gave
the Raiders their first tangible proof that (a) they are not
destined to be Destiny's dust mites, (b) making plays doesn't
always have to mean making highlight film plays, and (c) that this
Rich Gannon fellow may be the perfect fit at the one position that
has pinched their feet since Jim Plunkett roamed the earth.
</P>
<P>
   There were enough big plays from Raiders great and small to
explain the upset, and Monday's film session will be the first
catered affair since the team moved back to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   But Gannon's play stood out because, well, it didn't stand out.
</P>
<P>
   It was brutally efficient, with enough clever improvisation to
make it seem that much better. He didn't throw the perfect 70-yard
spiral, but he did move the richly maligned Oakland offense as much
as he needed to, even if it wasn't as much as he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left a lot of yards on the field,'' Gannon said, jumping
the line to take what little available blame there was. ``We left
the defense hanging a few times, and we have to get better. I'll
shoulder a lot of responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when confronted by the evidence of seven dropped balls that
could have turned 22-17 into 34-17, he stood shield in hand for his
guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, it's not the drops, it's the accuracy of the
throws,'' he said with jaw fully squared. ``Maybe if I put the ball
in there better . . . I have to make those throws better than I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   If this seems like a small thing to you, snap out of it. The
Raiders have known enough lousy times over the years that they have
developed complicated techniques for deflecting blame. To have a
quarterback who takes the hit for his mates after guiding them to
such a win speaks volumes about Rich Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, that whatever you think he doesn't have, he has much
more than you think.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon's numbers were good but not eye-popping; 21-of-33 for 248
yards and one score. But Gannon isn't a numbers guy, and never has
been. What he gave the Raiders was playmaking, with a lower-case
``p,'' the kind that doesn't have a soundtrack but has a point to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he ran for the winning score on a 5-yard
quarterback draw late in the third quarter. Look past the underhand
flip he delivered to tight end Rickey Dudley that turned a
potential drive killer into a 35-yard gain that set up his score.
Forget the 31-yard pea he threw to James Jett to get the Raiders
out of the shadow of their own end zone moments after Minnesota cut
the Oakland lead to five.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, don't forget them. They were huge plays, plays that
separated the Raiders from another gut-wrenching loss, plays that
make coach Jon Gruden describe Gannon as ``brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget the things he didn't do, things that Raider
quarterbacks have conjured up for years to ruin Sundays by the
crate-load and make Al Davis pull Al LoCasale's hair out in clumps.
</P>
<P>
   He threw no interceptions. He was sacked once, and seemed to
have a third eye out for pressuring Vikings, throwing the ball a
split second before getting popped. He escaped getting drilled a
good eight times, and the one time he fumbled, he recovered it
himself. He even made calling a timeout he didn't have seem
downright inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders had a third-and-5 at the Minnesota 42 with 12
minutes and change left in the fourth quarter when Gannon came to
line and discovered old-time Raider chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the wrong formation out there, and to be honest, I
forgot we were out of timeouts,'' he said. ``But at the time, I
figured if we take the 5-yard penalty, it's not a big issue to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. The Raiders had to punt, but the defense, which had
prevented the Vikings from establishing their pace and tone on the
game stopped them each of the last three times they got the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Which, after all, is what a defense regarded as highly as
Oakland's is supposed to do, no matter how much Gannon wants to
fall on his own javelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of it,'' he said. ``We have a great defense
that played well, even in the first half when I wasn't playing well
at all. I wanted to settle myself down because I didn't play well
at all in the first half. If I play well in the first half, it's
probably a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   But it already was a different game, different than the 28-24
loss at Green Bay last week, different than the standard close-
your-eyes-and-take-six-aspirin Raider game of the modern East Bay
era. It was the Raiders standing up until game's end, and winning
when nobody thought they could, in a place where few visiting teams
do.
</P>
<P>
   What it is, in words of tackle Lincoln Kennedy, is ``overdue.''

 &HT;    Braves and Mets square off to decide which philosophy works
bestBy Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They both have power stashed at the corners, and they
both have stacked the defense up the middle. Both have production
at catcher too, or did, until Javy Lopez dismantled his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Both call out a flame-thrower for the ninth inning. Lately, the
Braves even have rediscovered the art of the stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and New York Mets arrive at their 10 days of destiny
having followed the same kind of roster-building architecture that
has served general managers for decades now, if for only one huge
exception:
</P>
<P>
   The Mets view starting pitching as a vehicle to the seventh
inning; the Braves see starting pitching as a reason for living.
The two clubs not only will settle the NL East in these upcoming
six games, they also will further the late-century debate that
relievers have superseded starters in this era of biceps baseball.
</P>
<P>
   At Turner Field, the Mets find a club that is cinching its belt
around its rotation, wondering about Tom Glavine's 4.35 ERA and
John Smoltz's knuckleball almost as much as it wonders about Brian
Jordan. September, where philosophies clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get starters. I have all my life,'' Braves GM John
Schuerholz said. ``I'm just not saying that because you asked me
today. I've been doing it for 19 years _ trying to get starters and
guys that can catch the ball around them.''
</P>
<P>
   For two teams that stand just one game apart above the league,
the Braves and Mets arrive tonight via different routes. Since he
took the Mets' GM job in 1995, Steve Phillips gradually became
enamored of the Cleveland Indians, which had placed an effective
bullpen above stocking the rotation with proven stars. Even with
the midseason acquisition of Oakland starter Kenny Rogers (5-0),
Valentine's mandate for his starters remains the same: work six
innings while we get a lead and then get out of the way for the
bullpen to take it from there.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have thrown only three complete games this season,
second-fewest in the majors along with _ no surprise _ Cleveland.
The bullpen has worked 456 innings, an average of more than three
innings a game. New York relievers will earn some $11.2 million
this season, significantly higher than the $6.47 million Atlanta
relievers will earn. And that figure stood at just $3.5 million
until a bump from newcomer Terry Mulholland, also the fifth
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bullpen is a lot more important over 162 games,''
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   With Smoltz's elbow, Glavine's inconsistency and the departure
of Denny Neagle, Atlanta's starters' numbers are
uncharacteristically down. Their nine complete games ranks just
fifth in the league. Since Schuerholz's arrival in 1991, the Braves
had ranked first or second in complete games every year until now.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz has stood up to the criticism that the emphasis on
the starters _ $25.78 million or 35 percent of the Opening Day
payroll _ has mortgaged the bullpen. The fact that Atlanta
relievers enter the series with a slightly lower ERA (3.70) than
the Mets' (3.73) hardly ends the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the emergence of relief pitching in today's
baseball is evident, and it's very important,'' Schuerholz said.
``But given the choice if I would have starters or relievers, I'd
rather have starters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Indians are not alone in the revised thinking.
Contenders Cincinnati, San Francisco, Texas and Boston, working
around impaired rotations, all have been heavily reliant on their
bullpens all season. But the Mets have set a standard. They went
nearly two-thirds of the year before anyone went nine innings.
After Masato Yoshii and Rogers threw complete games on Aug. 15 and
18, the Mets have had just one more.

RAISA GORBACHEV, WIFE OF LAST SOVIET LEADER, AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Raisa Gorbachev, the wife of former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, died in a German hospital Monday after an
eight-month battle with leukemia. She was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gorbachev's husband and her daughter, Irina Virganskaya,
were by her side when she passed away at 3 a.m. local time at the
Muenster University Clinic in Germany, where she had been
undergoing treatment for leukemia since July 25.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gorbachev died in her sleep, doctors at the hospital
announced. She was scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant
from her sister as soon as she recovered from complications caused
by chemotherapy and infection. Her condition deteriorated Sunday,
and she was transferred to the hospital's intensive care unit where
she remained unconscious until her death.
</P>
<P>
   The first spouse of a Soviet leader to be called ``first lady''
here, the outspoken, smart, and stylish Mrs. Gorbachev broke the
mold for Kremlin wives _ as Gorbachev opened up Soviet society and
tore down the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Gorbachevs moved into the Kremlin in 1985, the wives
of Soviet leaders hid in the shadows, rarely showing themselves in
public and never taking an active role in politics. But Mrs.
Gorbachev not only carved out a public role for herself in this
conservative society that still looks at female public figures with
suspicion, she blazed a new trail for women to enter public life.
Decked out in designer clothes, she traveled with Gorbachev,
advised him on policy, and was not afraid to speak her mind in
public.
</P>
<P>
   But while her bold style won praise in the West, it was
controversial at home, where Mrs. Gorbachev was scorned by many
Russians, who were put off by her flamboyance. Since her illness,
however, many here have inundated the Gorbachevs with veneration
and praise. In part, this may be that Russians, weary from a decade
of dashed hopes and unfulfilled expectations, long for the
boundless optimism of the Gorbachev years. Every major television
network here led the evening news Monday with somber reports on
Mrs. Gorbachev's death and footage of her and Mr. Gorbachev's
careers.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mr. Gorbachev kept a lonely vigil by his wife's
side throughout her illness and, although deeply shaken, always
found time to brief reporters on her progress and to thank all
those who expressed their support and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   It has also only now become widely known here that Mrs.
Gorbachev donated much of her wealth to charity and over the past
several years raised more than $8 million for children's leukemia
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Northeastern University in Boston bestowed an honorary
degree on Mrs. Gorbachev. The Gorbachev Foundation also opened a US
office at Northeastern, where the former Soviet president delivered
a commencement address in 1998. Raisa Gorbachev and Barbara Bush
delivered commencement addresses at Wellesley College in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gorbachev was born Raisa Maximova Titorenko on Jan. 5, 1932
in the Altai region of southern Siberia. The eldest daughter of a
railway construction worker and a housewife, she met Gorbachev, now
68, when both were students at the elite Moscow State University _
where she studied sociology and he studied law _ in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The two married in September 1953 and moved to Gorbachev's home
region of Stavropol in southern Russia after he graduated in 1955.
There she taught Marxist-Leninist philosophy at Stavropol State
University. She later took a teaching position at Moscow State
University when Gorbachev, a rising political star, moved his
family to the capital 1978. She gave up her academic career when
Gorbachev became Soviet leader in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, the former Soviet president wrote that his
mother did not approve of his outspoken wife. But Gorbachev never
let anybody doubt his deep love for the woman he called ``my
Raisa.''
</P>
<P>
   Grilled by reporters during her husband's unsuccessful 1996
presidential campaign about her tendency to accompany her husband
anywhere, Mrs. Gorbachev didn't miss a beat. ``You all wrote about
how I was always by his side when he was in power,'' she said then.
``But why don't you write that I never left his side after all of
you forgot about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from all over the world _ including Pope John Paul II,
President Clinton, and former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher _ sent messages of condolence. Russian President Boris N.
Yeltsin, a bitter rival of Gorbachev's who forced him out of the
Kremlin in 1991, sent his as well. Yeltsin has also provided a
presidential aircraft to bring Mrs. Gorbachev's remains, and her
family, back to Moscow Tuesday. She is scheduled to be buried in
Moscow on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband and daughter Irina, Mrs. Gorbachev
leaves behind two granddaughters, Kseniya, 19 and Anastasia, 12.

 &HT;    Bockrath to resign at Alabama
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the first move in what could become a major shakeup
at Alabama, athletics director Bob Bockrath will resign this week.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Bockrath, who had been AD since June 1996,
does not bode well for the future of football coach Mike DuBose,
who has come under increasing fire since Saturday's stunning 29-28
loss to Louisiana Tech in Birmingham. DuBose was Bockrath's first
major hire, and his departure can only weaken DuBose's support,
which has been tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's rumor and speculation at this particular time, and I
wouldn't care to speculate on that,'' DuBose said Monday when asked
about the situation at his regular weekly news conference. ``I
understand the question, but until I know more that what I know,
I'd just as soon not speculate on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is expected to name Finus Gaston, the school's senior
associate athletics director, to the job on an interim basis. Names
mentioned as possible candidates for the job include Mal Moore, a
former assistant coach now the associate athletics director for
football relations; former Crimson Tide All-American Lee Roy
Jordan, a businessman in Dallas; Florida State athletics director
Dave Hart, an Alabama graduate who played basketball for the
Crimson Tide; and former football coach Gene Stallings, whom DuBose
replaced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bockrath, who could not be reached for comment, has been in
negotiations with university president Andrew Sorensen over his
severance package. The Birmingham Post-Herald reported Monday that
those negotiations had been completed over the weekend. Bockrath
had a five-year contract that paid him between $250,000 and
$300,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Bockrath, who came to Alabama from Texas Tech, was never very
popular with the Crimson Tide alumni or employees of the athletics
department, who disliked his impersonal management style. His
tenure was filled with controversy from start to finish:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1998 Bockrath's former school, Texas Tech, was hit with
NCAA sanctions for rules violations and ``a lack of institutional
control'' during his time in Lubbock. Those problems did not sit
well with some Alabama alumni, as the school has just gone through
its own NCAA investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a lawsuit that later was dismissed, an Alabama alumnus
charged that Bockrath had exchanged a premium skybox at
Bryant-Denny Stadium for a deep discount on a lot in a subdivision
in Tuscaloosa, Ala., where Bockrath owns a $750,000 home. Bockrath
recently put that home up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most recently, several members of the Alabama's Board of
Trustrees were critical of Bockrath's decision to keep DuBose as
coach after DuBose admitted to lying about an extra-marital affair.
Bockrath did not consult the trustees on the issue. If he had,
DuBose might have been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Bockrath's resignation also follows a decision by the trustees
to form a committee to oversee all personnel decisions in the
athletics department of the three schools in the university system.
That decision, in effect, rendered Bockrath powerless over major
hirings and firings.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in Tuscloosa continues that Sorensen will be out as
the Alabama president before the end of the year. Sorensen
reportedlyis pursuing the opening for chancellor at Vanderbilt.

NO RESISTANCE, NO WELCOME FOR PEACEKEEPERS IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TIMOR-MILITARY) 
(nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ The vanguard of an international peacekeeping
force staked its claim to this silent and broken town Monday,
watched warily by clusters of refugees, sullen Indonesian troops
and small, angry groups of irregular militias.
</P>
<P>
   There was no resistance but no welcome for the peacekeepers, who
arrived with all the firepower and high technology of modern war.
There was no peace to keep; East Timor's tiny capital is a dead
city _ burned, looted and evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Through the hot, still day, as dogs barked in the empty streets
and the leaves of banana trees rustled quietly, 2,000 Australian
and British soldiers spread out through the city with their heavy
packs and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Then as the sun went down, three large fires were set in
villages near the airport, their black smoke and bright orange
flames filling the sky, a sort of initiation for the invited but
unwelcome guests.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of a departing troop-transport plane mingled with the
popping sound of burning buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they are testing us,'' said an Australian trooper,
adjusting his night vision goggles as he stood beside an armored
vehicle, watching the flames. ``They want to make us do something
we don't want to do, but as long as we stick to our game plan we'll
be all right and we'll move them out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires have been burning in Dili since the terror here began on
Sept. 4, the day the United Nations announced that the East
Timorese people had voted nearly 4-to-1 for independence from
Indonesia, which invaded and occupied the former Portuguese colony
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, thousands of people have been reported killed and
hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes by civilian
militias armed, supported and sometimes manned by the Indonesian
military. Indonesia's top military commander disputed that estimate
of deaths Monday, saying the military had recorded fewer than 100
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was soldiers, men in green berets,'' a villager said of the
men who started one of the fires Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the commander of the multinational
force _ which is to include some 8,000 troops from a dozen
countries _ praised the cooperation of the Indonesian military
Monday and said the initial deployment of troops had proceeded
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   He said that once the capital had been secured his troops would
begin moving through the territory _ where 800,000 people had lived
before the recent terror _ to neutralize any opposition and provide
support for a huge aid operation.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Mark Evans, who commands the Australian troops who
make up the bulk of the forces here, said the first day had gone
``very smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the support we have had from the TNI
today,'' he said, using the initials for the Indonesian armed
forces. ``That augurs well.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Indonesian transport trucks, with armed
Indonesian escorts, helped ferry the foreign soldiers through town.
But only the foreigners returned the waves of onlookers; the
Indonesians stared back grimly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good reception by the TNI and had a guarded _ I would
call it guarded _ welcome by the local people,'' said Maj. Chip
Henriss-Anderssen, who arrived on the second aircraft Monday
morning in the first wave of Australian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw men I would call militia,'' he said. ``They were
carrying homemade weapons and they were wearing a mixture of
camouflage and civilian uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kennedy, who coordinates humanitarian efforts here for the
United Nations and has been in Dili for the past two weeks, said:
``I think the militias are taking flight or keeping a very low
profile. When we see them we stay in our cars and keep going. We
have armed TNI escorts. It's a yin and yang thing. They don't press
the TNI. Many of them are TNI.''
</P>
<P>
   As they drove through the town Monday, the newly arrived
soldiers passed block after block of burned, vandalized and
roofless buildings, their windows smashed, their contents looted.
The home of the Roman Catholic bishop, Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo,
is a burned shell. So is the city's main hotel, the Mahkota. The
city's tiny shopping district disappeared in flames.
</P>
<P>
   As in the rest of Dili, the vandalism at the small airport _
where giant transport planes landed, unloaded and took off again
all day Monday without cutting their engines _ seemed to have been
an act of violent passion.
</P>
<P>
   In the departure lounge, people had picked up and flung here and
there the rows of molded plastic chairs, as if in a convulsion of
anger. The floor was smeared with feces.
</P>
<P>
   In the offices, the trash was ankle-deep. Computers and
telephones had been looted but someone had gone to the trouble to
dump a can of blue paint over an old typewriter. A framed poster of
smiling flight attendants had been ripped from the wall and
smashed.
</P>
<P>
   Convoys of yellow civilian trucks rolled out of the city, filled
with refugees and their belongings, evacuating as the peacekeepers
arrived. These were native Indonesians or people who opposed
independence, one resident said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are afraid of new fighting,'' said the resident, Misuar
Santos, as he watched them drive past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier, a man with long hair, several strings of necklaces and
a black Che Guevara T-shirt said he expected the militias would
withdraw for a while, wait their moment, then resume their
trouble-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are waiting,'' he said. ``Maybe they still prepare
a bad plan. The militia will not stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, Julio das Dores Soares, 25, said he was a fighter for
independence _ an enemy of the militias _ who had left the city
after the referendum to go to Dare, a stronghold for the guerrillas
just south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is back, he said, with seven of his friends, to assess
the situation. ``Now there is still panic in Dare,'' he said, where
relief officials say as many as 30,000 people have taken refuge.
``They want to come back to Dili but they are still afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The people in Dare are not yet starving, Soares said, but they
are hungry. ``Many people need food,'' he said. ``Many children are
sick and some have already died.''
</P>
<P>
   Soares stopped abruptly. One hundred yards away two Indonesian
soldiers began slowly walking in his direction.

 &HT;    Love gets go-ahead for Ryder Cup actionBy Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Davis Love III has no way of knowing whether
The Country Club will be a spot to remember pleasantly _ in
contrast to the bitterness of Oak Hill and Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   All that Love knew Monday, after arriving at the site of the
33rd Ryder Cup, was that his physical condition should not be a
factor. After a doctor-ordered, two-week break from golf, hunting
and fishing, Love said he no longer feels pain from a nerve in his
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Love worked on the practice range with teacher Jack Lumpkin of
Sea Island and later played nine holes. Love denied that two
matches a day might be too much of a load on Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the talk before,'' Love said, ``that I didn't want to
wear myself out for Sunday. Now, I feel like I could go the whole
way. I'm as rested as anyone on the team. My hip feels great. My
back feels great. I'm excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Bob Estes, the United States' first alternate,
is no longer on stand-by status. Not that Love ever seriously
considered missing the Ryder Cup, an event he respects so deeply.
Obviously, he longs to erase the gloominess of the 0-4 record he
took back from Spain two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed reading in the press how I wasn't going to play,
or how could I play after not playing for two or three weeks,'' he
said. ``Well, that's normal for me. I take time off a lot. . . . If
the only thing I could do the rest of the year was play the Ryder
Cup, I'd play that and take the rest of the year off.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest episode of back and shoulder pain was different in
that Love felt numbness in his left hand after hitting a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing Brian Jordan of the Braves has,'' Love
said. ``When he throws it, his hand goes numb. When I hit a ball,
my hand just kind of went numb. . . . I was just unsure of what I
was doing, because every time I hit it, it was like, `God, am I
tearing my shoulder and my arm up?' . . . I just aggravated the
nerve, and I had to let it calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Love started hitting balls Friday, shortly after Hurricane Floyd
veered away from the Georgia coast and after he got permission from
orthopedic specialist Tom Boers of Columbus to ease back slowly. By
Sunday, Love, 35, was striking 3-woods and drivers with full
strength. And none too soon, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting away from golf was one thing,'' he said, ``but I
really couldn't do anything else, and that was a little boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Love's ``recovery'' was an uplifting development for the U.S.
squad, which held informal practice rounds Monday. Captain Ben
Crenshaw had begun the day with a wait-and-see approach about Love.
A few hours later, Love seemed available for as many matches as
necessary, probably with Justin Leonard as his partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Davis is one of the best players in the United
States,'' Jim Furyk said. ``Hopefully, he's very healthy, and he's
going to play very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin and I want to play a lot together,'' Love said, ``and
if we're both playing good, I hope they play us a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Love has the longest consecutive Ryder Cup streak on the U.S.
squad, with this his fourth appearance in a row. He has a 5-8
record _ 2-1 in singles.

 &HT;    Third Millenium CEO announcement made, capital soughtBy Mark
Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It took two job offers and 15 years for Gerald
Eickhoff to land Michael Reene.
</P>
<P>
   Eickhoff, co-founder of Third Millenium Communications, an $8
million a year company that develops tools for corporate Web sites,
named Reene his new chief executive. Reene starts Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Eickhoff, 52, said he will work continue to work full-time, but
now he will focus on helping Third Millennium nail down a new
injection of investment capital. Eickhoff said he hopes to attract
about $16 million. He will also be talking to investment bankers
about a possible public offering of stock sometime in the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The pair first met in 1984. Reene was a consultant with Arthur
Andersen and Eickhoff ran his own consulting company, BEI Holdings.
Eickhoff was so impressed with Reene that he asked him to come work
for him. Reene turned him down. He wanted to test his mettle with a
big corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In May, after 17 years with Andersen and five years with IBM,
Reene was near the top when he stepped down. He ran the division
that served IBM's global telecommunications customers, selling
computer equipment and consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   But Reene, 43, also kept an eye on the smaller companies. He was
a founder of Consumer Financial Network, which was sold to iXL
Holdings in 1996. He sits on the board of Enrev, a battery
technology firm. And in 1996, when Eickhoff started his next
company, Third Millennium Communications, Reene was one of the
people who invested start-up money. In July, Reene took a seat on
Third Millennium's board and increased his stake. He now holds a 20
percent share of the Decatur, Ga.-based Web site developer.
</P>
<P>
   Third Millennium develops tools used on corporate Web sites,
including MVP.com, a new Web company being developed, in part, by
former football star John Elway. The firm also has a product,
expoexchange.com, a Web site that helps automate many of the
functions for trade shows, from booking plane tickets, to choosing
floor space to setting up itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   Reene will become president of the Technology Association of
Georgia on Jan. 1. He also sits on the board of the Georgia Center
for Advanced Telecommunications Technology, GCATT. He heads the
recruitment committee of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce's
Industries of the Mind program, an effort to attract attention to
the local high-tech community. Eickhoff has struck entrepreneurial
lightning once, with BEI Holdings. He also is a philanthropist
chairman of Honduras Outreach, which helps 25,000 Hondurans receive
a range of help, including health and planting advice.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Fleming, a partner with Alliance Technology Ventures,
has worked with Reene through the Industries of the Mind, GCATT and
Video Networks, a company Fleming's firm has invested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have huge regard for him,'' Fleming said. ``I respect his
technology savvy and his business savvy and his understanding of
how to get things done.''
</P>
<P>

BLOOD DONATIONS TRIPLE AFTER CHURCH SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Nearly 4,600 units of blood were donated by
North Texans in the four days after the shootings at Wedgwood
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   It was two to three times the amount of blood normally donated,
said Jenny Nelson, a spokeswoman for Carter BloodCare, the primary
blood bank for 22 North Texas counties.
</P>
<P>
   The peak was Thursday when 1,900 units were drawn. The figure
fell to 1,364 on Friday, 821 on Saturday and 502 on Sunday.
Normally collections average about 500 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the shooting happened last week we pulled in some units
from some of our outlying hospitals. Since we pulled from their
supplies last week, this week we'll be pulling from the blood
center inventory to get the hospital inventories built back up,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said that as of Monday, stocks of O-positive, B-positive
and AB-positive were at preferred levels. The supplies of
O-negative, A-positive and A-negative were at the minimum
acceptable level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep working hard to educate the community that we
need blood donors every day, not just following a crisis like
Wedgwood or the Oklahoma City bombing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the demand for blood has increased 8 percent to 10
percent this year, much of it due to aggressive cancer therapy and
surgeries that require more blood. She said donations are down
about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that 60 percent of the general population can
give blood. In North Texas about 4.2 percent of eligible people
give. The national average is 4.9 percent.

KRISTI BECKEL REMEMBERED AT FILLED SANCTUARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALTOM CITY, Texas _ Bob and Debbie Beckel stood in the first
row, facing a portrait of their young daughter, as hundreds of
worshipers stood behind them, praying, singing and hugging their
own children especially tight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beautiful tribute conducted on Monday because of an
ugly event: the murder of 14-year-old Kristi Kathleen Beckel, one
of seven people shot and killed last week in a rampage at Wedgwood
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Kristi's funeral was at Bethesda Community Church in the Fort
Worth suburb of Haltom City, next door to Bethesda Christian
School, where she was a ninth-grader. Her mother is a teacher of
second-graders at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Al Meredith, pastor at Wedgwood Baptist, thanked the crowd of
mourners who nearly filled the 1,200-seat sanctuary at Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an easy thing to come to,'' Meredith said. ``None
of us ever expect to bury our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said the doors at Wedgwood Baptist will remain open and
unguarded _ at least by police _ despite the horror last week that
stole Kristi's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen where some churches are hiring armed guards to
patrol the churches,'' the pastor said, adding: ``I respect their
concerns. But there are not enough armed guards in the world to
keep us from conflict and tribulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Debbie Beckel sat silently in the front pew, almost
close enough to touch their daughter's casket, with their other
daughter, Kim Marrillo, as Meredith preached that no one,
especially the young, is completely safe from someone like Larry
Gene Ashbrook, the killer at Wedgwood Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the protection of my children were up to me, I'd be a
basket case, I'd be in a mental ward,'' the preacher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be with them all the time, everywhere. I have to
release them to God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said Kristi was killed by a ``deranged gunman who was
in the power of the prince of darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has watched this community, this family of faith, in
amazement this week. ... The prince of darkness began in Wedgwood,
at my church,'' he said. ``Seven precious lives were snuffed out,
then the gunman turned the gun on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pray for his family, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Vaughn, principal at Bethesda Christian School, said
Kristi was an inspiration to her classmates and to her teammates on
the school's vollyeball team, where she was described as an
``awesome server.''
</P>
<P>
   Every night, after school and after volleyball, Kristi would
stick her head into her parents' bedroom and wish them well, Vaughn
told the congregation. Then, she said, Kristi would ``leave their
room, go into her bedroom, and shout through the walls, `Good
night, I love you!' ''

CLINTON OFFERS CONDOLENCES TO FORT WORTH IN CALL TO MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KRISTIN N. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ President Clinton called to offer residents
condolences on Monday in the wake of Wednesday's church shooting
and volunteered his staff's help to develop a community response,
Mayor Kenneth Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed his frustration that these types of things are
happening in the country,'' Barr said of the 8:45 a.m. call. ``We
talked a little bit about the nature of them and a little bit about
what the country needs to do to figure out what to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors have said that Larry Gene Ashbrook, a 47-year-old from
Forest Hill, was a social outcast who sent them irrational letters
before he killed seven people and himself Wednesday evening at
Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he told Clinton that he may convene a group of
religious leaders and mental health professionals to discuss what
help can be extended to people exhibiting deranged behavior in
hopes of preventing similar tragedies. Clinton offered to send a
staff member to help if Barr request.MDSD/.MDNM/s it, the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, White House operators first tried to reach Barr
at City Hall, but patched Clinton through at Barr's family printing
business, The Barr Co., the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he spoke with Clinton for 10 or 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good conversation,'' Barr said. ``He said it was a
great puzzlement, there's some frustrated people in our society _
largely white males _ who seem to fall into this trap, this
conduct. He speculated a little about why.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the shooting tragedy, Clinton has publicly
advocated criminal background checks on would-be buyers at gun
shows similar to checks required for sales in gun shops.
</P>
<P>
   But on the telephone yesterday, Barr said, the two didn't
discuss additional restrictions on handguns or the general
availability of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him about the fact that Fort Worth is a safe city,
that our crime stats are down and that we had not had a homicide in
that council district in 1999'' until Wednesday, the mayor said.
``I said all of this adds to our bewilderment and inability to
understand what happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he also told the president about Safe City USA, a
program designed to reduce the number of gun-related crimes by
prosecuting criminals wielding weapons through the federal court
system which traditionally provides longer prison sentences. City
officials plan to launch the Safe City program Sept. 29. It was
planned before the church shootings, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciated his call,'' the mayor said. ``All of us
know how busy he is. It says a lot to me that he was concerned, and
he wanted us to know that.''

   MOSCOW _ Raisa Maximovna Gorbachev, who broke Kremlin tradition
by sharing the spotlight with her husband, the former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, and did so with bold self-assurance
and flair, died Monday in Muenster, Germany. She was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, aides to Gorbachev said. She had been
under treatment in University Hospital in Muenster since late July.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Communist Party in
1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the Soviet Union's
calcified politics and economy. But it was Raisa Gorbachev who,
both at home and abroad, soon came to embody the changes to come.
She emerged as a first lady who had her own mind, her own style and
according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after
one of her foreign trips, her own American Express card.
</P>
<P>
   None of this endeared her to the Soviet public, who began to
grumble early in her husband's tenure that she was too pushy, too
flashy and too influential. Her appearances on foreign trips and
her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many Russian
kitchens over whether the proper place for Kremlin wives was _ as
it had always been _ at home, or at least in the background.
</P>
<P>
   But since early September, when Russians first learned that
their former first lady had been hospitalized in Germany with an
advanced and rare case of leukemia, sentiments toward her in Russia
began to shift. Favorable articles began to appear in the press,
and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the
hospital in Muenster, where her husband kept a faithful vigil that
touched many Russian hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be in the Russian character _ to run somebody into the
mud, and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes,''
said Vladimir Polyakov, a Gorbachev spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, Gorbachev's bitter rival in the early
1990s, sent a message of condolence Monday, and in a statement, he
said, that a ``wonderful person, a beautiful woman, a loving wife
and mother is no longer with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, published in 1996, Gorbachev acknowledged
that the resentment over his wife's high profile surfaced in
letters written to the Communist Party's Central Committee. ``Who
does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?'' he quoted one
as saying. ``The simplest answer would have been: `No, she is my
wife.'''
</P>
<P>
   She first became known in the West in 1984 when she accompanied
her husband, then a ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, to
Britain, where they were received by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. Diplomats and reporters, scanning the couple for clues
about the next generation of Soviet leaders, quickly focused up on
her wardrobe _ in particular her gold lame sandals with chain
straps, a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other Kremlin wives.
On a later trip to France, the French press labeled her clothes
``elegant, but not chic.''
</P>
<P>
   On her foreign travels, she also became known for a haughty
conversational style that bordered on the pedantic. During the 1986
summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, she needled her tour guides
with persistent questioning, adding didactic commentary of her own.
Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, she irked
Nancy Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to
socialism, reportedly prompting the American president's wife to
quip, ``Who does that dame think she is?''
</P>
<P>
   As she became more comfortable in her role as the Soviet first
lady, she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued. On a
visit to Washington in 1990, she established more friendly
relations with Barbara Bush, from whom she got a recipe for
blueberry pie.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Siberian city of Rubtsovsk, Raisa Titarenko grew up
as the daughter of a railway engineer. She graduated from school
with a gold medal _ top honors in the Soviet system _ and went on
to the prestigious University of Moscow. She was studying
philosophy there when she met Gorbachev, then a law student.
According to his book, he was smitten, but she was aloof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first meeting had not impressed Raisa at all,'' he wrote.
``She seemed calm and indifferent _ judging by the look in her
eyes.'' Not much later, at an impromptu party staged by Gorbachev's
roommates for Raisa and her friends, ``I wanted to impress her,''
he wrote, but ``I think I made a terrible fool of myself. She was
reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intense courtship, the two penniless students were
married in 1953, the year of Stalin's death. They had one daughter,
Irina, born in 1956, who survives her along with Gorbachev and two
granddaughters, Xenia and Anastasia.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple completed their college work in 1955, the
family returned to Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern
Russia. There Mrs. Gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation,
entitled ``The Emergence of New Characteristics in the Daily Life
of Collective Farm Peasantry,'' based on an unusual amount of field
research, which was accepted by the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When her husband, then first party secretary in Stavropol, was
promoted to Moscow as a Central Committee secretary in charge of
agriculture, she returned to academics, taking a job as lecturer in
philosophy at Moscow University, a position which she gave up when
he became general secretary of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   As the wife of the Soviet leader, she was enlisted as a board
member of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, headed by Dmitri S.
Likhachevcq, one of Russia's most distinguished academicians, which
was created to promote the arts and to restore the country's
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In this role, she became one of her husband's conduits to the
Russian intelligentsia, which was then rallying to his call for
more ``glasnost,'' or openness. As Soviet censorship eased, the
Soviet people rushed to rediscover books and parts of their own
history that had been buried under a rigid Communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gorbachev's most traumatic moments came during the August
1991 coup, when the Gorbachevs were held hostage at a seaside villa
in the Crimea while a group of Communist hard-liners tried to seize
control in Moscow. The coup failed, and Gorbachev and his family
returned to Moscow, visibly shaken. ``Raisa Maximovna took it very
hard,'' said Gorbachev at a news conference after their return to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Raisa Gorbachev published a book of reminiscences,
entitled in English, ``I Hope,'' which she decided to write after a
visit with Mrs. Bush in 1990 to Wellesley College where, she said,
``the girls showered me with questions.'' Reviewers found the book
self-serving in parts but also informative about the couple's
intellectual journey as, together, they came to realize the flaws
in the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   In her last years, Mrs. Gorbachev started a club that drew
together a dozen well-known and high-powered Russian women for
conferences, charitable projects and informal debates. She
described the group as an attempt to promote a civil society in
Russia. Against her wishes, the club became known as the Raisa
Maximovna Club.
</P>
<P>
   Lyudmila Telen, a deputy editor at the newspaper Moscow News and
a member of the club, said her impressions of Mrs. Gorbachev
changed as she got to know her better. ``She set herself very high
goals _ she felt she had to improve herself,'' said Ms. Telen.
``Going from wife of a provincial first secretary to first lady was
a big jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to represent the country in a new way. She
understood that what Mikhail Sergeyevich was doing was a
revolution, but she had many complexes, too _ a natural reserve and
a Soviet way of behavior that she tried to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Telen said Mrs. Gorbachev was well aware of the resentment
against her felt by many Russians. But she herself was never
bitter. ``She realized that people had been used to different
women, different traditions, different leaders,'' said Ms. Telen.
``She understood it. It hurt her of course, but I never heard her
be mean or bitter about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a couple, the Gorbachevs shared interests in philosophy and
literature, theater and politics. Gorbachev on several occasions
acknowledged that he often turned to his wife for advice. In his
book, he recalled how the two would have their most serious
discussions in the garden of their government-provided apartment,
beyond the earshot of KGB eavesdropping devices.
</P>
<P>
   Their close relationship was the envy of their friends. At a
dinner in Paris in the fall of 1985, her host said she confided:
``I am very lucky with Mikhail. We are really friends, or if you
prefer, we have great complicity.''
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, when
Yeltsin took over Gorbachev's office in the Kremlin, he became a
political pariah in Russia, widely blamed for ushering in reforms
that led to a decade of political and economic instability.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous run for the presidency in 1996, he maintained
a low profile at home, while Mrs. Gorbachev, who accompanied him on
the international lecture circuit, became practically invisible
until her recent illness.
</P>
<P>
   With a diagnosis of acute leukemia, Mrs. Gorbachev was rushed to
the hospital in Muenster, Germany on July 25. News of her
hospitalization became public only in early August.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian news reports, Gorbachev remained at her
side day and night. ``Dear God,'' the former Soviet president,
visibly exhausted, told a Russian television reporter on Aug. 9,
``for her to undergo such a drama these two days before my very
eyes.''

INDONESIAN GENERAL DISPUTES REPORTS OF WIDESPREAD DEATHS IN EAST
TIMOR
</HEADLINE>
   (With TIMOR-RDP) 
(nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia's top military commander,
disputing reports of thousands of deaths in East Timor, said Monday
that fewer than 100 people had been killed in the bloodshed in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of victims that we have recorded since the
announcement of the result of the referendum is roughly in the
90s,'' said the commander, Gen. Wiranto. Widespread violence by
military-backed militias broke out last month after the people of
East Timor voted overwhelmingly to be independent of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the number we have recorded so far, but it is not the
tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands as reported by the
foreign media,'' he told the Indonesian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto's estimate is much less than those of pro-independence
groups, which put the death toll at anywhere from 900 to 7,000. And
it drew a skeptical response from the United Nations, which
sheltered hundreds of refugees in the capital, Dili, before leaving
its compound to a rampaging mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much hope he's right,'' said David Wimhurst, a
spokesman for the U.N. Mission in East Timor. ``However,
indications are that the situation is far more serious than he
suggests.''
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said the United Nations was particularly concerned
about refugees who had fled or were forcibly moved from East Timor
to neighboring West Timor. He said the United Nations would not
estimate the number of deaths without an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   With the first troops of an international military force landing
in Dili on Monday, such an investigation may soon be possible.
Wiranto's remarks seemed to anticipate that the Indonesian army
would soon come under harsh scrutiny for its role in the violence
over the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have accused the military of helping anti-independence
militia groups kill people and loot and burn their homes.
</P>
<P>
   An uneasy calm hung over Jakarta on Monday, as Indonesia's
military and political leaders confronted the painful precedent of
foreign troops entering Indonesian territory for the first time
since independence. Sporadic small demonstrations broke out near
the parliament and in the business district.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 protesters gathered at the National Human Rights
Commission in Jakarta to demand a vote on independence for the
eastern province of Irian Jaya, which Indonesia took over from the
Netherlands in 1969. Political leaders here fear East Timor's
decision to break away from Indonesia will unleash separatist
passions throughout this archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   For Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, the decision to allow
soldiers into East Timor has thrown him on his heels during a
presidential campaign that already seemed to be turning against
him. An electoral assembly is to choose the next president this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Habibie will go to parliament to give an account of
why he acquiesced to demands for troops _ particularly a force led
by Indonesia's now unpopular neighbor, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Umar Juoro, an adviser to Habibie, said the president would
explain that the government had tried to restore order in East
Timor by imposing martial law. When that failed, Indonesia had
little choice but to accept outside help. Juoro said that Habibie
would note that Australia was the logical choice to lead a force
because of its resources and proximity to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Habibie's critics are using the fact that he allowed foreign
troops into Indonesia as a weapon against him,'' Juoro said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Habibie is not likely to subside. Monday, the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, met with the
president to urge him to allow more emergency relief for the
estimated 200,000 refugees in West Timor. Earlier, Ms. Ogata
visited a refugee camp in Atambua, near the East Timorese border,
which is said to be under the grip of anti-independence gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ogata said Habibie had promised to allow more air drops of
food and other supplies. But she said it was too early to discuss
arrangements to move the displaced East Timorese back to their
shattered homes.

PATRIOTS WIN HAUNTED BY ERROR-PRONE WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Sunday's 31-28 comeback victory over the
Colts was a thriller, but Patriots coach Pete Carroll and his
players realize that if they continue to commit penalties at the
rate they did in that game, their chances of winning will be slim.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots set a team record with 15 penalties, including an
unsportsmanlike conduct call on Carroll, and they cost 135 yards.
In last week's 30-28 win over the Jets, they committed seven
penalties for 43 yards. Last season the Patriots committed 108
penalties, fourth-most in their history. The most penalized Patriot
team of all-time was the 1985 team, which committed 114 but went
11-5 and reached the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm most concerned about penalties _ we have to get that
cleaned up,'' said Carroll. ``And they aren't of the same type. We
didn't have a lot of motion penalties or holding penalties at the
line, we had aggressive-oriented penalties, we had a late hit, a
face mask, roughing the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   And his own unsportsmanlike conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part we can handle,'' said Carroll. ``We can fix that up
in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   So concerned is Carroll that he's getting league officials to
come in during practice this week and call penalties during 7-on-7s
and 11-on-11s, ``just to do different things this week to create a
different emphasis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in these situations before. It's over-aggression at
times. They're hitting out there. I like the way we're chasing the
football. I like our aggressiveness, but the whole idea is we don't
want to make it easy on the opponent by giving them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are a young team, but most of Sunday's penalties
were on guys who should know better. The breakdown:
</P>
<P>
   First quarter:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ed Ellis (three-year veteran), 5 yards for false start on
third and 7.
</P>
<P>
   2. Tony Carter (sixth year), 14 yards for unnecessary roughness
on second and 1. The Patriots wound up punting.
</P>
<P>
   3. Tebucky Jones (second year), 5 yards for an incidental face
mask on a punt.
</P>
<P>
   4. Lawyer Milloy (fourth year), 4 yards and automatic first down
for pass interference. The next play was a 42-yard touchdown pass
to Marvin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   5. Larry Whigham (sixth year), 5 yards for illegal touch. This
nullified a 63-yard punt by Lee Johnson that had pinned the Colts
at the 3. Fortunately for Whigham and the Patriots, Johnson
followed with a 57-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   6. Ty Law (fifth year), 22 yards for pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   Second quarter:
</P>
<P>
   7. Law, 5 yards for illegal contact on second and 9 at the Colt
22.
</P>
<P>
   8. Carroll (26th year), 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct
when he kicks the flag thrown on Law and has heated words with the
official.
</P>
<P>
   9. Troy Brown (seventh year), 5 yards for encroachment on an
extra point.
</P>
<P>
   Third quarter:
</P>
<P>
   10. Tony Carter, 15 yards for unnecessary roughness on a punt.
</P>
<P>
   11. Ellis, 5 yards for illegal formation.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter:
</P>
<P>
   12. Harold Shaw (third year), 10 yards for holding on punt
return.
</P>
<P>
   13. Team, 5 yards for 12 men on the field.
</P>
<P>
   14. Team, 5 yards for delay of game, a penalty taken
deliberately to run the clock down as they were preparing for the
winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   15. Henry Thomas (13th year), 15 yards for roughing the passer
with 25 seconds left and the Colts desperately trying to get the
ball downfield into field goal range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a problem that almost wrecked this game for us,'' said
Carroll. ``We come out of these two games with wins with a lot of
improvement to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show improvement if we're to see good we are. To
execute so poorly _ and the execution had to do with the penalties
_ we weren't clean throwing the football. There are a number of
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Sunday's penalties will be reviewed by the league; in
some cases the league has said a penalty was unjust. One of Law's
interference calls was borderline, though he appeared to bump
Harrison as Harrison was going for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Carter's hit, the reason they threw it is not because is
was so late or overly aggressive,'' said Carroll. ``It's because he
hit his helmet on the other guy's helmet. Helmet-to-helmet contact
is very strict. Tony didn't realize what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On the roughing-the-passer on Thomas at the end of the game,
Carroll said he never saw the roughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see that penalty,'' said the coach. ``Thomas hit him
higher and it was a vicious hit. It was so vicious that I think the
official thought it must have been a penalty. We'll turn it in and
see what they say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Whigham's illegal touch, Carroll said, ``That's a bad
mistake. He got jacked up about downing the ball at the 3-yard line
after he had gone out of bounds. He made a bad choice there.''

<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ As flood waters receded in this devastated
city Monday, stories of survival amid a 500-year deluge emerged.
</P>
<P>
   In the upscale West Haven neighborhood, which until Monday had
been nearly isolated by floodwaters as well as downed trees and
phone lines, receding water revealed its devastation.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighborhood of former Lt. Gov. Jim Gardner, scores of
trees now lie at the curb, toppled first by winds, now by chain
saws. Sawdust and pine straw cover the streets. A tarp lies across
one roof damaged by a fallen pine. Some lawns were returning to
immaculate condition as homeowners carefully removed tree limbs and
other debris.
</P>
<P>
   Crews carefully separated tangled electrical poles and trees.
Streets were full of fallen cables, and workers urged residents and
bystanders to avoid the downed lines.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper into the neighborhood, homes suffered more extensive
damage. The Tar River, once a scenic backdrop, became an intruder
starting last Wednesday thanks to Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Judd Pierce, 16, waded into waist-deep water on Lafayette Circle
to retrieve what few possessions he could from his parents' home.
The family silverware was a top priority in the salvage mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty bad,'' Pierce said grimly. ``The floors are warped
out. Everything is still floating in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce and his parents had been awakened by neighbors early
Thursday morning and warned of the rising waters. The family
retreated to a friend's home to ride out the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's mother, Nancy, woke the rest of her family and threw on
clothes. Five minutes later, she took another look outside. Water
that had been in the yard minutes earlier already had found its way
into the sun room.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the flood, the Tar River was 6 inches from the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like somebody has died,'' Mrs. Pierce said, looking
back at the house. ``It's already started to lean, and I don't know
if we will ever be able to fix it. We might be bringing in a
bulldozer and just have it torn down.''
</P>
<P>
   George Valentine said the floods were unprecedented in West
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here for 51 years,'' he said. ``The highest I had
ever seen it before was right after Hurricane Hazel. Even then, the
water never even got close to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charlie Godwin had to be evacuated by boat at 4 a.m. on
Thursday. ``The water was probably waist-deep,'' he said. ``I've
never seen anything like this. I'm not sure what we'll do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Families huddled at the edge of the receding waters and stared
at homes farther down the street. Water lapped at the roof of a
home at the end of the block, and some residents traveled the
streets in the only available means of transportation _ a bass
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Brewer offered what comfort she could to her friends.
Since Thursday, Brewer has washed several loads of laundry for
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said they needed a little money, so I wrote them a
check. Someone else said they needed food, so I cooked them dinner.
I just wish someone else would tell me what I could do for them,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional add.)
</P>
<P>
   Don and Billie Stallings wandered through their home and
wondered when they would be able to move back in. While the power
was back on, the damage to their home was significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode across that gate in a canoe,'' Don Stallings said,
pointing to a 6-foot gate at the back of his property. ``We got up
at 4 a.m. on Thursday, and the water was on the terrace. At 7 a.m.,
water was coming in the house. By 9 a.m., water was 2 feet high
inside. You read about it and hear about this kind of thing. Until
you actually see it, though, you can't be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stallings tried to prepare for the flood. On Wednesday
afternoon, she was busy cooking food and making ice. But the floods
caught her by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready for everything except a flood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pru Eatman was counting her blessings on Monday. Eatman's home
was just above the flooded area left by Floyd and became a
launching area for boats trying to rescue victims and survey
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary watching the water come up the street,'' she
said. ``All my friends down there are just devastated. I was so
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional add.)
</P>
<P>
   Across town, in the area around the Weeks-Armstrong public
housing complex, similar tales were told Monday about waters rising
in the pre-dawn hours Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard someone yelling for help, so I got up and saw the
water up to our house,'' said Moses Dickens, who stayed with his
72-year-old mother at Cowlick Creek. ``I ran around and started
banging on people's doors, telling them to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising waters nearly 2 feet high in their yard, Dickens
and his mother, Carrie Dickens, managed to make it across the
street to a neighbor, whose home was on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a river over here,'' Mrs. Dickens said. ``Boats
came and got some people, but I walked out. It was up to my knees,
but I walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Batts, another Overbrook Avenue resident, managed to
escape the rising creek before it came too far inside his home.
Batts, 73, and his 40-year-old son made their way through the
pouring rain and rushing floodwaters to a relative's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asleep, and the lady next door called me and said the
water was at my back door,'' Batts said. ``I got up and got out of
here. I'd never seen the water that close.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, James Taylor and his girlfriend escaped with their
7-month-old baby just as floodwaters reached their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was banging on doors, trying to get people up and get people
out,'' Taylor said. ``We got our little baby and got out. We didn't
grab anything then, but we came back the next morning and got some
food, clothes and baby things.''
</P>
<P>
   The waters continued to rise, and just about the entire
neighborhood was under water once the rains stopped Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's ruined,'' Taylor said. ``The furniture's ruined;
the TV's blown; our clothes are ruined. We're calling around now,
trying to get some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricity remained off in that area until Monday, and many
people were trying to recover from their losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people in here lost everything,'' said Moses Dickens.
``It's just a pitiful time.''

DOLE GOES BACK TO HER TEACHING ROOTS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Melrose (Mass.) High is no Boston Latin, but when
Elizabeth Dole needed a venue for a speech on education, she
overruled advice that she pick the prestigious exam academy and
insisted on middle-class Melrose's public high school instead.
</P>
<P>
   For a presidential hopeful who says her top priority is to raise
academic standards, promote local initiative, and restore
discipline and values in the nation's struggling public schools,
Melrose, with its no-nonsense principal and new dress code, rules
of conduct, and Saturday classes seems the perfect place to
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Dole's visit to Melrose Wednesday is
something of a sentimental journey. In 1959, Dole _ then Miss
Hanford of Harvard's graduate school of education _ taught
11th-grade history in Melrose and got her own lesson in the
strength of America's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful experience for me,'' Dole said in an
interview, as she recalled her time as a student teacher as a
highlight of the seven years she spent living and studying in
Cambridge. ``I have a real personal connection to Melrose. I've
been there, taught there, and feel like it is part of my life and
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's education speech is one of two policy addresses _ the
other will be on foreign affairs _ she will deliver between now and
mid-October, when, aides say, she will officially declare her
candidacy for president. A former head of the American Red Cross
and a two-time Cabinet secretary, Dole campaigned in the
early-primary state of New Hampshire over the weekend and will
squeeze the visit to Melrose between fundraisers in North Carolina
and New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher, Dole said, her goal was to make history ``come
alive off the page'' for her students. She said her most vivid
memories from 40 years ago are of finding a Buddhist monk in
Harvard Square and a policeman who took part in the 1919 Boston
police strike and bringing them into class to share their
experiences. The students loved it, she said, which filled her with
``the joy of teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   With education ranked as the top issue today in most
public-opinion polls, it's no surprise that Dole is dusting off her
teacher credentials and making the most of her very brief but, she
says, very satisfying stint at Melrose High School. She's also
using the stop in Melrose to remind voters that while she has never
held elective office, her public-service career and real-life
experiences qualify her to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Dole, a 1958 graduate of Duke University, sought
a master's degree in education primarily as a ``vocational
insurance policy'' in case she couldn't get a job in Washington or
find a way to use the Harvard law degree she earned several years
later. In her book ``Unlimited Partners,'' Dole admits she
disappointed a professor who called her ``a born teacher'' because
personally, ``the lure of government outstripped the satisfaction
of the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Daniel R. Burke, the principal of Melrose High School,
said he wasn't aware of the candidate's connection to or strong
feelings for Melrose until two of her aides visited his office last
week and pitched the idea of making the school the site for Dole's
education speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Hi, we're from Elizabeth Dole's presidential
campaign,' and I said, `Yeah, and I'm a tightrope walker,' '' said
the principal, mocking his 300-pound girth.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who came from Scituate (Mass.) High School in July, said
he is glad to showcase Melrose because it is going through a
transformation from what he called ``Happy High'' to being a
serious school with stricter academic standards, tighter
discipline, and more structure. The school has 990 students; the
majority are white and more than 80 percent of them go on to
two-year or four-year colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of her GOP rivals, who are stressing school choice
and promoting federal vouchers so parents can pay for private and
religious schools, Dole's focus is on rebuilding public schools
like Melrose.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her husband, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who
made bashing teachers' unions a centerpiece of his failed GOP
presidential campaign in 1996, Elizabeth Dole says she won't ``turn
teachers into rhetorical punching bags.'' Dole defends teachers as
``the true heroes of our society,'' though she says many could use
more training and be more accountable to students and their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the GOP front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush,
who earlier this month laid out an education policy that would
transfer federal funds to parents from public schools that don't
make the grade, Dole is not expected to make any sweeping or
specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will emphasize four things that she is passionate about in
education: more flexibility, discipline, local control, and
values,'' a Dole adviser said. ``She will underscore that parents
must be empowered to do and demand more in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole does not adhere to the 1996 Republican Party platform that
calls for abolishing the US Department of Education. Instead, she
says she wants local school districts to have more discretion over
how federal money gets spent and more responsibility for earning it
through improved performance.
</P>
<P>
   Melrose Mayor Patrick Guerriero says education is the most
serious issue in the suburbs, and Dole's message is exactly what
local officials want to hear. A volunteer in Bob Dole's 1988
campaign for president, Guerriero says he invited Mrs. Dole to
Melrose in this, its centennial year.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who has no children, acknowledges she may be in for
surprises as she returns to high school. ``The worst things I faced
as a teacher were students talking in class, running in the halls,
and throwing spitballs,'' Dole said. ``Today it's a very different
picture, no question about it.''

ISSUE OF WEB COPYRIGHT HOTLY DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picture this: A scientist spends years compiling
the world's largest book of poison antidotes. Then, shortly after
it's published, he turns on his computer to find a competing
researcher has photocopied the book, posted it to a Web page and
splashed it across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Legal? Yes, under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Preventable?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question perplexing Congress right now. The issue
extends far beyond the scientific community, affecting millions of
stockbrokers, librarians, real estate agents and publishers _
anyone who makes a living collecting information. Today, such
compilations, otherwise known as databases, go largely unprotected
by copyright laws that safeguard the interests of the authors and
publishers of creative works.
</P>
<P>
   Until lately, this had not seemed unfair: Databases, after all,
are generally gatherings of information created by someone else.
But the rise of the Internet has prompted heated debate over
whether those laws should change.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are tremendous within the $25 billion information
service industry: database owners fear they will lose huge profits
if outsiders can freely copy their information, while on-line
companies, such as Yahoo!, fear they could be run into the ground
if they can't easily trade in others' works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of restricting the availability of information in
the Information Age is a cause for concern to anyone interested in
the future of the Internet,'' said John Scheibel, a lobbyist for
Yahoo!, a portal site that allows Internet users to search the Web
_ and thrives off easily connecting users to databases around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have the most powerful computers, the most
sophisticated search engines and fully operative broadband systems,
but none of it will mean much without the information to flow over
those lines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, the debate is between people who collect raw
data and people who distribute it _ a dividing line that has grown
far deeper with the expansion of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents, for example, gather information about which
apartments are available. Their concern is that an on-line
publisher could see their listings in the window of an agency, copy
them down, and put them up on a Web site _ all perfectly legal
under current federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Lexis keeps vast collections of court decisions. They might be
faced with a competing on-line publisher who decides to use Lexis
data to launch a website of all court decisions from Massachusetts
_ also perfectly legal under copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anyone spend $2 million to create a database if it's
not going to be protected?'' said David Mirchin, of SilverPlatter
Information, a database publisher in Norton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The issue resonates in Massachusetts, where academic
institutions and technology firms have lined up against database
publishing companies on opposite sides of the debate. It has also
split members of the Massachusetts delegation, four of whom sit on
the two House committees sparring over what role the federal
government should play.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey, the Democrat who is the ranking
Democrat on the House telecommunications subcommitee, has sided
largely with the 70 groups that are pushing for easy access to
databases _ among them corporations such as AT&AMP;T and universities
such as Brandeis. What they want is legislation that would not
restrict people from copying databases unless they plan to use the
information in a directly competitive way.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern: restricting access could stifle the economy.
On-line stockbrokers, for example, worry that if Congress goes for
more restrictive copyright language, the New York Stock Exchange
would claim its stock quotes are part of a protected database. That
would allowing the NYSE to charge exorbitant licensing fees for
each stock price, dampening the enthusiasm of companies such as
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. or Bloomberg Financial Markets _ and,
opponents argue, giving the stock exchange a virtual monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers worry they would be forced to pay for
information that is currently free or inexpensive _ such a listing
of chemicals or a database of the elements. And Internet service
providers want to keep access to databases as free as possible, as
part of their strategy to encourage people to do business on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as part of e-commerce, as part of a network
economy,'' Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   But detractors say that the less restrictive version of the
copyright bill has too many loopholes, and could sap the incentive
of those whose work is collecting raw data into extensive
databases.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Delahunt is among those who sees database piracy as
a serious law-and-order matter. Congress' mission is to keep
companies from becoming ``victims of unscrupulous freeloaders who
can exploit their work with a click of a mouse,'' according to a
letter he co-wrote this month.
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by virtually everyone on the House Judiciary
Committee. Along with Delahunt, fellow Democratic Massachusetts
Representatives Barney Frank and Martin T. Meehan also support the
stricter bill, which more closely resembles true copyright law.
People who copy information out of a database for commercial use
would have to clear it with the owner first _ just as people are
required to do now with newspaper articles or Broadway plays.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting whole sections out of, say, a consumer directory of
doctors' addresses to open a medical referral service would be
against the law. So would copying information to compete directly
with any owner of a database.
</P>
<P>
   The bill even raises the possibility of criminal sanctions
against database pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the push for stricter copyright regulations are some
major corporate and other interests: Reed Elsevier, owner of Lexis
Nexis and of Cahners Publishing of Newton, Mass; the American
Medical Association; and the National Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   All freely concede that their goal is to preserve their private
interests _ the profitability of the databases they collect. And
they see the potential threat as grave: Some advocates paint a
database doomsday scenario, in which whole databases are secretly
spirited away to the Internet, with no accountability for their
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite example is Poisindex a database produced by
Micromedex, which does, in fact, list poison remedies for use in
emergency rooms. To date, the data has not been copied and posted
on the Internet. But if it were, ``there is nothing in the law that
would allow Poisindex to tell them to stop,'' according to Dan
Duncan, a lobbyist for the Software &AMP; Information Industry
Association. A parent browsing the Internet for poison remedies
would have no legal recourse if the pirated version of the index,
published without updates, revisions or accurate instructions, gave
outdated medical advice , he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, advocates of strict regulations say there have been
tangible consequences to the lack of database piracy laws.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Warren Publishing, a Washington-based company
that printed a three-volume book of US cable systems. Another
company copied the book and reissued it on diskette. Warren
Publishing took their competitors to court and lost at the appeals
level; they have since become among the most outspoken advocates of
tougher rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally ripped off. It seemed to us an extremely
unfair decision. We invested hundreds of thousands of dollars each
year into producing this product, and the court basically
sanctioned'' its piracy, said Lynn Levine, assistant publisher for
research.
</P>
<P>
   Although Warren Publishing also reached a settlement with the
defendants, the case underscored database owners' worst fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake here is that producers of factual
compilations of information enjoy no general law protecting them
from piracy in the United States,'' Duncan said. ``If this
legislation does not go through, there will be much less quality
database information for users.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank agreed: ``I'm strong believer in the First Amendment, but
the First Amendment doesn't mean you have the right to publish
other people's work. I think there is a value to society of people
compiling databases. But if you get zero protection, why would you
do it? Data compilation is not fun. It's not something people do
for the sheer creative joy of it.''

EDUCATION EXPERT TESTIFIES EXIT TEST UNFAIR TO MINORITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional ending) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Texas' mandatory high school exit test has had a
``pervasive'' impact on minority students, labeling them as
failures and driving many to drop out, an education expert from
Boston testified in a federal trial Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that we're talking about tens of thousands of
black and Hispanic students being designated failures,'' said
Walter M. Haney of the Center for the Study of Testing, Evaluation
and Educational Policy at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Haney's testimony came during the opening day of a trial in a
civil rights challenge to the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills
high school exit exam, a test public high school students in the
state must pass to get a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view the adverse impact (of the test) on blacks and
Hispanics in the state of Texas ... is extensive in time and
pervasive in nature,'' Haney said.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs are asking U.S. District Judge Edward Prado to stop
the state from using the TAAS exit test as a reason to deny
diplomas to students who have met all other graduation
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the lawsuit filed by the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund is expected to last three to five
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being watched closely by educators and education
policy-makers across the nation because about 20 other states have
mandatory standardized tests similar to the TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   Haney, however, testified that ``TAAS is the single
highest-stakes test of which I know'' because it not only
determines who gets a diploma but because it is also used to rate
schools and evaluate teachers.
</P>
<P>
   TAAS results at all grade levels are an integral part of the
state's school rating system. Texas began using TAAS results as one
measure of classroom teachers' effectiveness about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffery Amsel, one of two assistant attorneys general defending
the Texas Education Agency, spent a good part of the day trying to
block testimony and evidence about the use of the skills test in
rating schools and teachers. Such information, he said, goes beyond
the scope of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prado agreed to block that testimony, but allowed Haney _ over
the state's objections _ to testify about the effect the TAAS exit
test has on ninth-grade retention and school drop-out rates.
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF also was permitted _ again over the state's objections _
to introduce testimony about the historic evidence of racism in
Texas schools. In an earlier ruling in the case, Prado dismissed
MALDEF claims that state education officials had intentionally
discriminated against minorities with TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the state's defense of segregated schools in the 1950s
and its opposition to bilingual education in the 1960s and 1970s,
MALDEF lead attorney Al Kauffman told the judge, ``They (state
education officials) have always said these things are good for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the state says the same thing about TAAS. ``We
filed this case on behalf of ... the disappeared and the
forgotten'' _ students who gave up trying to get a diploma after
they failed the TAAS exit exam and those who simply gave up because
they were held back in the ninth grade by teachers who thought they
would fail.
</P>
<P>
   In her opening statement, Assistant Attorney General Deborah
Verbil told the judge that the only issues are whether the TAAS
test violates students' rights to due process and whether the
impact of the test on minorities exceeds generally acceptable
standards for differences in groups based on ethnicity or gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test is valid educationally and statistically,'' she said.
Texas students are given several opportunities to pass the exit
exam, and those who fail it the first time are given intensive
remedial help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of education is not to get a diploma if the
diploma doesn't mean anything,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Texas implemented the TAAS exit test in 1990 as a way to find
out if students had learned the essential academic lessons and
skills that the state has determined all high school graduates
should have.
</P>
<P>
   Haney, however, spent a good part of the afternoon testifying
why he believes the TAAS is an invalid test. He said that one of
the reasons it is an invalid measurement is that the passing score
of 70 was arbitrarily set by the State Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the method the board use in setting the passing
score ignore all professional standards on setting ``cut scores''
for tests, the board knew full well that minority students would be
adversely affected, Haney said.
</P>
<P>
   Records of state board minutes reflect that the passing score of
70 was set solely because it was the score that former Education
Commissioner W.N. Kirby recommended at the time. The passing score,
Haney added, ``was set right in the middle where, if the intent had
been to discriminate, it would have the most impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The state contends that the TAAS test scores reflect that the
difference between performance of minority students and whites on
the exit test fall within generally accepted levels of disparity.
Under that standard, minority groups' passing rate should be at
least 80 percent of the passing rate of white students.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF contends that the failure rate of Hispanics and
African-Americans is twice that of white students. The civil rights
group also claims that although minority groups have closed part of
the gap in TAAS scores in recent years, the numbers reflect only
the ``survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other students give up and drop out of school _
many of them before they even take the TAAS exit test the first
time it is offered.
</P>

MASS RALLIES SEEK TO BRING ABOUT THE OUSTER OF MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.s News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The leader of a group of opposition
parties that will try to bring down President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia in a series of rallies and demonstrations beginning on
Tuesday says the outcome is really up to the Serbian people now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is poker with all the cards on the table,'' Zoran
Djindjic said in an interview on Monday. ``We don't have any
choice. We have to try to remove Milosevic by the end of the year,
and do it with people on the streets. We believe that the people
are stronger than Milosevic. But it depends on the people of Serbia
now, and I don't know what their reaction will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic's Democratic Party and the smaller opposition parties
in the Alliance for Change have made plans for simultaneous rallies
beginning on Tuesday evening in 32 Serbian cities and towns. They
have also tried to organize daytime events. Party workers will hand
out material from kiosks and canvass with petitions. Daily mock
trials of government officials will be presented on ``charges'' of
having failed the population or being corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a summer of intermittent rallies and disputes within
the broader opposition. The largest of the parties, the Serbian
Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic, will not take part in the new
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Alliance politicians said it was time, as Djindjic
(pronounced jin-JITCH) said last month, at the biggest opposition
rally to date, ``to go to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally on Tuesday in Belgrade, the capital, will be in the
Square of the Republic, which will look full with 10,000 to 15,000
people, not in front of the Parliament, where the rally last month
drew an estimated 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rally posters show Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic,
with big red X's over their faces and with the slogan, ``The people
choose.'' That is an echo of a 1945 slogan the said, ``We want no
king, we want Tito _ the people choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, appearing to use the time-honored tactic of lowering
expectations, said he expected that the rallies would start slowly
and peak at some point. Depending on the turnout, by the beginning
of next month the Alliance plans to concentrate on activities like
traffic blockades, some form of a general strike and naming an
alternative shadow government, to be led by a former Central Bank
governor, Dragoslav Avramovic.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition-run local governments of the main cities may then
make declarations of no confidence in the government and refuse to
obey it, Djindjic suggested. Or the opposition could on its own
hold informal elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by the end of October, Milosevic will respond in some
way,'' Djindjic said, ``with violence or counterdemonstrations or
new elections or his resignation,'' although Djindjic said he had
no great hopes for an easy or quick resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, the other main opposition leader, has been pushing
for early elections, and he is widely expected to wait to see how
the rallies fare before committing himself. If the turnouts are
large, he will have little choice but to join in some fashion. If
they are small, he is most likely to declare himself the leader of
the opposition and urge the others to unite behind him.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Draskovic said that he would join protests if the
opposition could agree on conditions for free, fair and early
elections and if Milosevic refused to schedule them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear that Milosevic feels the need to have early
elections, in view of their risks to him, and he is also waiting to
see what turnouts the Alliance produces.
</P>
<P>
   So is the United States, which is backing Djindjic's efforts _
with more moral support than tangible help. A senior administration
official said in a telephone interview: ``We'll see if these
demonstrations go well, if they have a progression, plateau or even
decline. Then they can decide what comes next. They have four or
five weeks to mobilize people and see where that takes them.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a decline, he said, ``then the administration may
have to change its tune'' about whether this form of protest can be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic and Alliance officials are encouraged by opinion polls
that indicate that two-thirds of Serbs are unhappy with the
government, half believe that the political system is growing
worse, and nearly 40 percent have no confidence in Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the polls, released last week by the Center for Studying
Alternatives, a research institute, from interviews with a random
sample of 1,600 representative Serbs, indicate deep and abiding
insecurity and fear of chaos and civil war. The government is
exploiting such fears through its propaganda, accusing the Alliance
of acting as NATO's cat's paw, of being in the pay of the United
States and trying to finish what the bombing started.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the respondents said they feared a
lowering of their already poor living standards. Nearly as many
said they feared new inflation and being unable to find work.
Eighty percent said they feared civil war, and 70 percent mentioned
hunger. When asked whether they favored change even at the price of
violence, many respondents demanded that the word violence be
scratched out, pollsters said. Still, about a third said they
wanted change at any price.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the demonstrations is to turn those concerns into
collective action, to mobilize further Serbs who fear for their
future and to give them confidence, Djindjic said. If the rallies
build and the Alliance can achieve as many as two million
signatures on petitions, he added, he expects the government to
begin to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said 30 people associated with the government and its
business interests had approached his party about making
contributions as a sort of bet on the future. They also want help
in having their names removed from a European Union ban on visas
and travel for 300 notables from the present administration.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Djindjic, Cedomir Jovanovic, said Monday,
``Milosevic's power will disappear the day he no longer controls
the levers of power, when the police understand that there's no one
behind their backs but a little group of thieves, and in front of
them are the people.''
</P>
<P>
   But some party officials are also concerned that they are
attempting too much and opening too many fronts, that they have to
deal with the conflict with Draskovic, as well as internal
conflicts about strategy in the party and the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The party's 5,000 active participants are already working 12
hours a day, officials said, and the canvassing that Djindjic plans
will take even more out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is party-building work _ obtaining signatures and
telephone numbers _ of the kind that the opposition has rarely
done, and it should help in elections should they come about.
</P>
<P>
   As for himself, Djindjic stepped back from an earlier pledge to
quit as party leader if Milosevic was still in power on Jan. 1,
2000. But if this new effort to unseat Milosevic fails, Djindjic
said, he will step down as a ``lightning rod'' for criticism.

HAVING THWARTED GORE'S RABBIT STRATEGY, BRADLEY PLAYS THE HARE 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Riding a wave of favorable attention and strong
fund raising, Bill Bradley is adopting a campaign strategy that
mirrors his own meticulous manner: He is preparing for a grinding,
patient battle that could last into the summer, well beyond the
March primaries that many Democrats once thought would deliver the
nomination to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley game plan reflects the organizational strength of
Gore, who has built wide support among Democratic officials across
the nation and whose campaign seems capable of staying afloat even
if Bradley does extremely well in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   So while Bradley's advisers say he must win several early
primaries, New Hampshire, California and most importantly in New
York, to build momentum, he must also be prepared to hunker down
and demonstrate that he can outlast Gore as the primary season
drags into April, May and June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are letting people know that we have the resources to see
this thing through for the long haul,'' said Gina Glantz, Bradley's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Under this strategy, Bradley and his advisers are doing
everything they can to delay the crowning of Gore as the Democratic
Party's consensus candidate. They have been aggressively wooing
undeclared elected officials and labor leaders. And they have been
urging a host of grass-roots organizations that represent core
Democratic voters _ including blacks, environmentalists,
abortion-rights advocates, gays and lesbians _ to stay neutral, if
not endorse Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   By their reasoning, if Bradley performs well early, he will buy
time to convey his message, establish beachheads in states where
Gore already has established organizations and make Gore appear
unelectable. Forcing the battle into the final June primaries would
also mean that New Jersey, which Bradley represented in the Senate
for 18 years, could tip the balance in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What one sees nationally, slowly, is movement toward Bill
Bradley,'' Douglas Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman, asserted.
``That's because as voters learn who Bill is and how he will
respond to the nation's problems, there is movement toward him.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, political analysts say, the Bradley strategy has worked
relatively well. He has stalled efforts by Gore to win the
AFL-CIO's endorsement, convinced several abortion rights groups to
stay neutral, received the endorsement of a small environmental
group, Friends of the Earth, and won plaudits from gay and lesbian
groups by advocating broader civil rights protections for
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's eliminated Gore's quick-kill strategy,'' said Bill
Carrick, a Democratic consultant in California. ``It's beginning to
look like a war of attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gore assert that once Bradley begins laying out the
specifics of his agenda, he is certain to upset some segments of
the Democratic base. They also argue that once centrist and
independent voters in New Hampshire voters see that Bradley has
taken more liberal positions than Gore on several issues, they will
reject him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley faces a host of other obstacles, including having to
keep pace with the vice president's fund raising _ which, so far,
he has been able to do _ while also catching up to Gore's extensive
campaign organization, which has a presence in most states. Gore,
who represented Tennessee in the Senate before being elected vice
president, seems particularly strong in the South as well as in
California, where he has won endorsements from almost every
Democratic state official.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley must also find a way to compensate for Gore's advantage
in so-called superdelegates _ members of Congress, party officials
and others who will automatically be sent to the Democratic
convention and who account for about 20 percent of all delegates.
Though neither candidate can say exactly how many superdelegates
they have, Gore clearly has a majority.
</P>
<P>
   That means Bradley will either have to win a larger percentage
of the primary vote in major states _ and thus a larger share of
the regular delegates _ or convince Gore's superdelegates to switch
allegiances, which traditionally has been a difficult thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Bradley _ a Hall of Fame basketball player _
must win a few large states in the early going to prove that he is
more than a celebrity insurgent. Central to his calculations are
New York and California, which both hold primaries on March 7 and
together provide nearly a third of the 2,168.5 delegates needed to
win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a momentum point of view, our desire is to win New York
and California,'' said Gale Kaufman, senior advisor to the Bradley
campaign in California who has strong ties to the state's labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Though California has more delegates, New York is viewed by many
Democrats as a more crucial symbolic battleground for Bradley,
since he played with the New York Knicks for 10 years and is
probably better known there than in any other state except New
Jersey and Missouri, where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a must win for him,'' said former Mayor Ed Koch,
who is supporting Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Bradley has put together his most extensive
organization in the country, outside Iowa and New Hampshire.
Running the campaign is Michael DelGuidice, an investment banker
who was chief-of-staff to former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, and
Frank Sanzillo, a lobbyist and former aide in the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has also recruited several well-known Democratic
organizers, including William Cunningham, a former chief of staff
to Sen.Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., John LoCicero, a former top
aide to Koch, James L. LaRocca, a former transportation
commissioner under Cuomo, and New York City Councilwoman Ronnie
Eldridge.
</P>
<P>
   Recent signs in New York have been encouraging for Bradley. Last
week, he won the endorsement of more than 20 Democratic officials
in Brooklyn, which has the most Democratic voters in the state. He
is also expected to pick up the endorsement of Moynihan in the
coming weeks. And last week, three separate polls _ by Zogby
International, Quinnipiac College and the Marist Institute for
Public Opinion _ all showed the race in New York to be a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of their growing concern about the state, Gore's
campaign has begun downgrading expectations for their candidate.
``We have always known that New York would be a tough fight,'' said
Kiki Moore, communications director for the Gore campaign. ``This
is Bill Bradley's back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign is clearly not prepared to give up on New
York. In recent days, Gore has personally called politicians that
seemed to be tilting toward Bradley, including Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
a Manhattan Democrat, and Dominic Baranello, chairman of the
Suffolk County Democratic Committee. Gore was scheduled to meet
privately with Baranello this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be talking about baseball,'' Baranello said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of how important he considers California,
Bradley has spent more days there this year, 31, than anywhere else
except Iowa. He is planning on delivering his first major policy
speech of the fall, on health care, in Los Angeles next week. He
has raised more money from California than anywhere. And his
campaign plans to open an office with full-time staff in the next
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Though the vice president has sewn up the support of much of the
Democratic Party establishment, Bradley's supporters note that Al
Checchi also had endorsements from many California state officials
before he lost last year's gubernatorial primary to Gray Davis, who
went on to win in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because some politician endorses you don't mean his
friends will vote for you,'' said state Assemblyman Richard Floyd
of Carson, Calif., one of the only Democrats in the Legislature to
endorse Bradley. ``But you do get all his enemies.''

ISSUE OF WEB COPYRIGHT HOTLY DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picture this: A scientist spends years compiling
the world's largest book of poison antidotes. Then, shortly after
it's published, he turns on his computer to find a competing
researcher has photocopied the book, posted it to a Web page and
splashed it across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Legal? Yes, under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Preventable?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question perplexing Congress right now. The issue
extends far beyond the scientific community, affecting millions of
stockbrokers, librarians, real estate agents and publishers _
anyone who makes a living collecting information. Today, such
compilations, otherwise known as databases, go largely unprotected
by copyright laws that safeguard the interests of the authors and
publishers of creative works.
</P>
<P>
   Until lately, this had not seemed unfair: Databases, after all,
are generally gatherings of information created by someone else.
But the rise of the Internet has prompted heated debate over
whether those laws should change.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are tremendous within the $25 billion information
service industry: database owners fear they will lose huge profits
if outsiders can freely copy their information, while on-line
companies, such as Yahoo!, fear they could be run into the ground
if they can't easily trade in others' works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of restricting the availability of information in
the Information Age is a cause for concern to anyone interested in
the future of the Internet,'' said John Scheibel, a lobbyist for
Yahoo!, a portal site that allows Internet users to search the Web
_ and thrives off easily connecting users to databases around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have the most powerful computers, the most
sophisticated search engines and fully operative broadband systems,
but none of it will mean much without the information to flow over
those lines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, the debate is between people who collect raw
data and people who distribute it _ a dividing line that has grown
far deeper with the expansion of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents, for example, gather information about which
apartments are available. Their concern is that an on-line
publisher could see their listings in the window of an agency, copy
them down, and put them up on a Web site _ all perfectly legal
under current federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Lexis keeps vast collections of court decisions. They might be
faced with a competing on-line publisher who decides to use Lexis
data to launch a website of all court decisions from Massachusetts
_ also perfectly legal under copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anyone spend $2 million to create a database if it's
not going to be protected?'' said David Mirchin, of SilverPlatter
Information, a database publisher in Norton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The issue resonates in Massachusetts, where academic
institutions and technology firms have lined up against database
publishing companies on opposite sides of the debate. It has also
split members of the Massachusetts delegation, four of whom sit on
the two House committees sparring over what role the federal
government should play.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey, the Democrat who is the ranking
Democrat on the House telecommunications subcommitee, has sided
largely with the 70 groups that are pushing for easy access to
databases _ among them corporations such as AT&AMP;T and universities
such as Brandeis. What they want is legislation that would not
restrict people from copying databases unless they plan to use the
information in a directly competitive way.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern: restricting access could stifle the economy.
On-line stockbrokers, for example, worry that if Congress goes for
more restrictive copyright language, the New York Stock Exchange
would claim its stock quotes are part of a protected database. That
would allowing the NYSE to charge exorbitant licensing fees for
each stock price, dampening the enthusiasm of companies such as
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. or Bloomberg Financial Markets _ and,
opponents argue, giving the stock exchange a virtual monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers worry they would be forced to pay for
information that is currently free or inexpensive _ such a listing
of chemicals or a database of the elements. And Internet service
providers want to keep access to databases as free as possible, as
part of their strategy to encourage people to do business on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as part of e-commerce, as part of a network
economy,'' Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   But detractors say that the less restrictive version of the
copyright bill has too many loopholes, and could sap the incentive
of those whose work is collecting raw data into extensive
databases.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Delahunt is among those who sees database piracy as
a serious law-and-order matter. Congress' mission is to keep
companies from becoming ``victims of unscrupulous freeloaders who
can exploit their work with a click of a mouse,'' according to a
letter he co-wrote this month.
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by virtually everyone on the House Judiciary
Committee. Along with Delahunt, fellow Democratic Massachusetts
Representatives Barney Frank and Martin T. Meehan also support the
stricter bill, which more closely resembles true copyright law.
People who copy information out of a database for commercial use
would have to clear it with the owner first _ just as people are
required to do now with newspaper articles or Broadway plays.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting whole sections out of, say, a consumer directory of
doctors' addresses to open a medical referral service would be
against the law. So would copying information to compete directly
with any owner of a database.
</P>
<P>
   The bill even raises the possibility of criminal sanctions
against database pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the push for stricter copyright regulations are some
major corporate and other interests: Reed Elsevier, owner of Lexis
Nexis and of Cahners Publishing of Newton, Mass; the American
Medical Association; and the National Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   All freely concede that their goal is to preserve their private
interests _ the profitability of the databases they collect. And
they see the potential threat as grave: Some advocates paint a
database doomsday scenario, in which whole databases are secretly
spirited away to the Internet, with no accountability for their
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite example is Poisindex a database produced by
Micromedex, which does, in fact, list poison remedies for use in
emergency rooms. To date, the data has not been copied and posted
on the Internet. But if it were, ``there is nothing in the law that
would allow Poisindex to tell them to stop,'' according to Dan
Duncan, a lobbyist for the Software &AMP; Information Industry
Association. A parent browsing the Internet for poison remedies
would have no legal recourse if the pirated version of the index,
published without updates, revisions or accurate instructions, gave
outdated medical advice , he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, advocates of strict regulations say there have been
tangible consequences to the lack of database piracy laws.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Warren Publishing, a Washington-based company
that printed a three-volume book of US cable systems. Another
company copied the book and reissued it on diskette. Warren
Publishing took their competitors to court and lost at the appeals
level; they have since become among the most outspoken advocates of
tougher rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally ripped off. It seemed to us an extremely
unfair decision. We invested hundreds of thousands of dollars each
year into producing this product, and the court basically
sanctioned'' its piracy, said Lynn Levine, assistant publisher for
research.
</P>
<P>
   Although Warren Publishing also reached a settlement with the
defendants, the case underscored database owners' worst fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake here is that producers of factual
compilations of information enjoy no general law protecting them
from piracy in the United States,'' Duncan said. ``If this
legislation does not go through, there will be much less quality
database information for users.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank agreed: ``I'm strong believer in the First Amendment, but
the First Amendment doesn't mean you have the right to publish
other people's work. I think there is a value to society of people
compiling databases. But if you get zero protection, why would you
do it? Data compilation is not fun. It's not something people do
for the sheer creative joy of it.''

A NIGHT FOR SLACKERS: TUNE IN AND ZONE OUT TO TWO NEW SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slackers of the world, unite. Oops. Guess that would violate
some sort of slacker code.
</P>
<P>
   Just sit back, turn on the TV and zone out. You can do that,
right? Good. Tuesday night is your night, with two prime-time
series devoted to slackerdom premiering on the networks. One is a
live-action NBC comedy featuring Mike O'Malley, that guy from the
ESPN commercials, as a 30-year-old slacker living the frat-boy life
in New Haven, Conn. The other is an animated comedy on The WB about
a 24-year-old cartoonist wannabe sharing a loft in make-believe
Cosmopolis.
</P>
<P>
   If you have time for just one, well, what kind of slacker are
you? Still, that being the case, ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' is the
choice here because it actually has moments that are amusing.
``Mission Hill,'' on the other hand, is virtually amusement-free,
as if The WB had hired an anthropologist to see how long we can go
without laughing. Neither, however, is turning over any new ground
in the field of comedy. And if either survives the season, it'll be
a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' has Mike O'Malley playing Mike
O'Malley, to make it easy for us slackers to remember. He lives
with a guy named Weasel (Mark Rosenthal) in a bachelor pad where
Lysol could make a killing. Now that he's 30, though, he's starting
to shed the bonds of desuetude, mindful that getting a life is
helpful in getting a wife, or at least a meaningful relationship.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley is a funny guy, but his show is like so many other
comedies that are just OK. He talks to the camera a lot, one of
this season's popular conventions, but it's not really necessary,
just a contrivance to make it stand out from the other very average
comedies out there.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive thing about ``Mission Hill'' is that it's
animated. Creators Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, who spent
several years writing and producing ``The Simpsons,'' say their new
series will be a sort of ``Simpsons'' for the older set.
</P>
<P>
   So let hosannas rain down on Oakley and Weinstein for finally
delivering an animated satire of today's youth culture in which the
characters can call each other ``douchebag.'' If memory serves,
Andy Sipowicz has used the term on ``NYPD Blue,'' but it's high
time an animated comedy be granted the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to harp on this, but there's nothing else about ``Mission
Hill'' that's memorable. In fact, in a self-referential moment
that's more damning than intended, the main character pokes fun at
the current glut of animated prime-time comedies, suggesting that
everybody and his brother will soon have one on the air.
</P>
<P>
   That would include Andy French and his brother, Kevin. Andy, a
24-year-old slacker extraordinaire aspiring to be a cartoonist,
lives in a loft in the Mission Hill district of Cosmopolis with two
loftmates. His life seems perfectly slack until 17-year-old Kevin
moves in, orphaned by his parents' move to Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Under Andy's wing, Kevin learns about drinking and sex and all
the other freedoms associated with absent parents, and Andy
grudgingly learns about responsibility and all that adult stuff.
Trouble is, where Oakley and Weinstein may have been the perfect
team to satirize the suburban family in ``The Simpsons,'' they seem
oddly out of touch in satirizing the MTV generation in ``Mission
Hill,'' where the living is easy but the jokes aren't funny.
</P>
<P>
   The Mike O'Malley Show. Half-hour comedy series about a
30-year-old slacker trying to become a better man. Starring Mike
O'Malley, Will Arnett, Missy Yager, Mark Rosenthal, Kate Walsh and
Kerry O'Malley. Premieres Tuesday night on NBC. Parental guideline
rating: TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Mission Hill. Half-hour animated comedy series about a
24-year-old slacker and his teenage brother living in the big city.
Season premiere Tuesday night on The WB; reappears in its regular
time period, Fridays, on Oct. 8. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

CONSERVATIVES HIT MCCAIN STANCE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ A group of conservative Washington lobbyists
touched down in New Hampshire Monday to denounce presidential
candidate John McCain's quest for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington group, which included Grover Norquist of
Americans for Tax Reform, Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president
of the National Rifle Association, David Keene, chairman of the
American Conservative Union, and Carol Tobias, political director
of the National Right to Life Committee, staged a news conference
at the Legislative Office Building to air their views.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist called the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill
a ``threat to the first amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(McCain's) persistent sponsorship of legislation that would
stifle political speech in the name of reform is wrong, dangerous,
and, I believe unconstitutional,'' said Keene.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington group was met by protesters from groups
advocating campaign finance reform, holding signs that said ``New
Hampshire voters won't be silenced by big money'' and ``No more fat
cats.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, an Arizona senator, puts campaign finance reform high on
his political agenda. He has called the current system ``an
elaborate influence-peddling scheme'' and slammed those, even in
his own party, who defend it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not in New Hampshire Monday, but at a later press
conference his state supporters defended the senator's crusade to
rid politics of the often covert influence of big money.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Spaulding, a New Hampshire executive counselor and state
chairman of McCain's campaign, denounced the Washington lobbyists
for coming to New Hampshire to ``discredit campaign finance reform,
and to protect their six and seven-digit salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not here to attack John McCain for opposing the
common-sense pro-family positions that these organizations stand
for. John McCain has been their ally day in and day out for
common-sense conservative reforms and pro-family values they
profess to support,'' Spaulding said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sponsored in the Senate the McCain-Feingold bill, which
has been scaled down since its original introduction.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive bill, the Shays-Meehan bill, has passed the
House of Representatives and will be considered next month by the
Senate, where Republicans have filibustered campaign finance reform
efforts in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The groups appearing oppose both measures, but focused their
wrath on McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills seek to ban unlimited ``soft money'' contributions to
political parties. ``Soft money'' is the term for unlimited,
unregulated contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The bills do not change the regulations on individual citizens'
donations to candidates' campaigns, which are already limited.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill was introduced in the Senate earlier
this year, but no longer includes limits on issue advertising
within 60 days of an election -- one provision McCain's critics
attacked, saying it could be put back into a bill in conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the `McCain Lite' version of the bill,
introduced this week, is simply a vehicle for amendments that
contain the speech-suppressive provisions...'' Tobias said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that if the ban on soft money is passed,
we're next.''
</P>
<P>
   These critics of the measure charge that it curtails freedom of
speech by preventing groups like the National Rifle Association and
National Right to Life from running ``issues'' advertisements
during the final stages of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents -- such as Rep. Martin T. Meehan of Massachusetts who
sponsored the Shays-Meehan bill -- say that is simply not true.
They say the bill does not ban such advertising, it just forces
groups running such ads to disclose who paid for them. Currently,
they are not required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre said the NRA would fight such a law in court if it were
to pass.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters said Monday's criticism will only help their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I'd like to mention that, contrary to some rumors, we
did not pay the plane fare for our predecessors up here this
afternoon,'' Spaulding joked. ``But we are prepared to pay their
bus fare anytime they want to come back...their performance today
was probably one of the best arguments we could have for campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   While the average New Hampshire voter may not be well-versed in
the intricacies of the campaign finance reform debate, the issue
could play well here. Polls indicate that a majority of New
Hampshire voters want to reform the way elections are funded.

 &HT;    River threatens power, water; more rain could hamper efforts
further
 &HT;    By Dawn Bryant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The merciless Tar River, which just won't
scale back its soggy and destructive path, continued Monday to
threaten Greenville's power and water service.
</P>
<P>
   With the water rising, Greenville Utilities officials were
unsure whether their round-the-clock, creative battle with the
unforgiving river _ which has shattered the 24.5-foot 100-year
floodmark by more than six feet _ would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m. Monday, fragile riggings at the submerged electric
substation and the water treatment plant were still holding up,
keeping electricity and water service to the city.
</P>
<P>
   But the slightest leak of a sandbag wall at the water treatment
plant, or an unstoppable piece of floating debris at the electric
substation could knock out those services.
</P>
<P>
   Roads to the plant and the substation are more like rivers. The
only way in and out is by boat or helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get anywhere,'' said Malcolm Green, GUC's general
manager/CEO. ``We are having to fly things everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As the river continued to edge toward a crest Monday, water
reportedly was just a few inches from the only line bringing
electricity into the city.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers constructed that setup above the submerged substation
Saturday after floodwaters had knocked out power for nearly 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   If the river gets within nine inches of high-power lines there,
officials will have to shut off the power serving all of Greenville
and three-fourths of Pitt County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an adequate amount of breathing room for today,''
Green said Monday. ``I can't speak to tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the water treatment plant, crews have filled
thousands of sandbags to protect generators, transformers and
electrical panels, just as they did last week to protect the
electric substation.
</P>
<P>
   If water reaches that equipment, officials must take the plant
off line. The city would have to rely on its stored water supply,
which could last about four to five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's touch and go,'' said Ron Elks, GUC's water resources
director. ``Right now we are still doing fine. But if the water
continues to rise or hold at high levels for several more days, we
could find ourselves without enough raw water to treat.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of one to three inches of rain over the next
several days has everyone on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what everybody is worrying about now,'' said Sharon
Daughtridge, an operator at the water treatment plant. ``If we get
any more water _ I just don't know. I don't know what else we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   GUC crews have worked non-stop since Hurricane Floyd dumped 13
inches of rain on the area Wednesday and Thursday. Those downpours
fell on an already saturated ground from Hurricane Dennis' repeat
visits and other recent rains.
</P>
<P>
   That water has found places to go. It has submerged houses, the
Pitt-Greenville Airport and GUC's Operations Center, destroying
several trucks, the building's contents and employees' personal
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything over there is just ruined,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding forced GUC to relocate its emergency operations
center to its downtown office. The lobby has become a refreshment
station, with weary workers picking at tables of everything from
Pop Tarts and bread to chips and crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are clinging to cellular telephones and hand-held
radios, the main means of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prepare for disasters. That's a part of the business. This
is extreme,'' said Howard Corey, GUC's water resources engineering
coordinator. ``I've seen people do things, rise up and figure out
solutions where you don't think there are solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   After relying for several days on helicopters to cart workers,
generators, sandbags and food to the water plant, officials added
several boats to their arsenal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Greensboro Fire Department and Forsyth Rescue Squad turned a
submerged bridge near the airport into a boat dock.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in wet-suits, crews made the eight-minute trip to the
plant more than a dozen times, once stopping to rescue two people
and some pets from a flooded house.
</P>
<P>
   After working three days with 1 1/2 hours sleep, one GUC
employee said the reason for the non-stop effort overrides his lack
of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really think about it when you do it. It's the
company you work for. You just do what has to be done,'' he said,
sitting on the railing of the submerged bridge after being ferried
from the water treatment plant. ``We are going to beat it. We are
not going to let the floodwaters beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, George Fuller, a GUC crew leader, strapped on a
life jacket.

   ``I know some guys out there are tired. I've had plenty of rest.
I'm here to help serve,'' he said, returning for the second time in
three days to help fill sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   Like soldiers ready to enter battle, GUC workers armed with
waders and a change of clothes climbed into boats, anxious to see
what their workplace looks like. They've already heard warnings
about snakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see all kinds of Herculean efforts,'' Elks said.
</P>
<P>
   The water plant, sitting in the middle of what is now a lake,
resembled a war zone.
</P>
<P>
   A stalled front-end loader sat lopsided beside the
administration building; crews stood beside a wall of sandbags
monitoring the hum of the sump pumps, and workers waded through
waist-high river water. Nearby, soaked clothing was draped along a
railing. Overhead, President Clinton's convoy of choppers circled
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Daughtridge, a water plant operator, eyed the generator that
keeps the plant running, the one crews are trying to shield with
sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to keep that generator dry. If we don't, we can't
provide water,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To get from that generator to the operations building, which is
just feet away, workers have to stand in the scoop of an oversized
front-end loader and be carted to the other side of the building to
enter.
</P>
<P>
   The building's first floor is ankle-deep in water, Sandbags
protect electrical equipment. Pumps push the water through an open
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is critical. Every little thing becomes a potential
dream killer,'' said Wayne Meads, a GUC water resources engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos, GUC orchestrated a way to restore power to
Greenville on Saturday night and handle other minor emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The water) is hitting things nobody ever thought of,'' Green
said. ``It's pushed us, but we have been able to maintain service.
It's pushed us way up into our contingencies.''
</P>
<P>
   With a backpack of food and another holding dry clothes,
Daughtridge jumped off the front-end loader to start her 24-hour
shift. ``Home sweet home,'' she said.

<P>
   Although four of his recent biographies have been attacked as
plagiarisms and one of them was recalled and pulped, still James
Mackay, a prolific Scottish author of more than 100 books, was on
the American publishing list for fall.
</P>
<P>
   His new work, ``I Have Not Yet Begun to Fight: A Life of John
Paul Jones,'' the first full-length biography of the Scottish-born
American naval hero in 40 years, was due for release next month by
Atlantic Monthly Press of Grove/Atlantic Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the same sorts of accusations that have recently dogged
Mackay have now caused his publisher, after questions from The New
York Times, to abruptly halt the book for a check on similarities
to the last major Jones biography, published in 1959 by the eminent
American historian Samuel Eliot Morison, who died at 88 in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am holding back distribution and getting an independent
evaluation,'' said Morgan Entrekin, president and publisher of
Grove/Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home in Glasgow, Mackay (pronounced Muhk-EYE), 63,
who has written 160 books by his own count, denied copying the
Morison book, ``John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I read it like I read everything else that had ever
been written on the subject, but this is my own work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how so many passages in the two biographies could be so
remarkably similar, he said, ``There are only a certain number of
words in the English language.''
</P>
<P>
   The action, putting in limbo 7,500 freshly printed copies of the
$28 book, comes just a year after another publishing house recalled
and destroyed thousands of copies of one of Mackay's books over
issues of copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Just how a prominent publisher could have proceeded with Mackay
after four of his other books had been questioned has led to
disbelief among those who know of his history.
</P>
<P>
   Entrekin acknowledged that until last week he had never talked
to the author he was publishing or inquired into his checkered
past. Entrekin added that Mackay's Scottish publisher, Mainstream
Publishing Co., which had released the Jones book in 1998, had
``mentioned'' the earlier plagiarism allegations ``but they never
told me the entire story.'' However, Bill Campbell, one of
Mainstream's two managing directors, said that ``Atlantic Monthly
knew about the allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The similarities in the Jones books were first identified by W.
Jeffrey Bolster, who was assigned by The New York Times Book Review
to review the new work from bound galley proofs. A subsequent
comparison of the Morison and the Mackay texts by The Times found
dozens of instances of closely matching passages. Morison wrote of
Jones:
</P>
<P>
   ``During his career, he visited some of the most beautiful parts
of the world _ Cape Breton, the Windward Islands, Jamaica, Galicia,
Brittany, the Hebrides, the Baltic and the Black Sea; yet not once
in his voluminous correspondence does he indicate any appreciation
of them; and in only one letter, about the great gale of October
1780, does he mention the majesty of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackay wrote: ``In the course of his career he visited some of
the most beautiful parts of the world _ the Caribbean islands, Nova
Scotia, Galicia, the Baltic and the Black Sea as well as the
eastern seaboard of America and the coasts of Britain _ yet nowhere
in his vast correspondence does he betray any appreciation of them.
In only one letter, written in October 1780 in the aftermath of a
great storm, does he allude to the majesty of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackay called any similarities ``quite unintentional'' and
added, ``If I've done that, I assure you that it's certainly not
something that I would do deliberately.'' He does cite Morison in
several places in the book.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mackay also rejected charges, leveled by
another author and by scholars and reported in a series of articles
starting last year in Scotland's leading newspaper, The Scotsman,
that he had plagiarized material for four of his other books since
1995. He wrote biographies of Alexander Graham Bell, Mary Queen of
Scots, Andrew Carnegie and the 13th-century Scottish patriot Sir
William Wallace, portrayed in ``Braveheart,'' an unrelated film
starring Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   His biography of Bell, published in the United States by John
Wiley &AMP; Sons in 1997, was withdrawn by Wiley last year and copies
were destroyed at Mackay's expense, about $40,000. The action came
after a retired Boston University professor emeritus, Robert Bruce,
documented that the book had been copied wholesale from his 1973
Bell biography, ``Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of
Solitude,'' published by Little, Brown.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After talking to Mackay in Glasgow and to his Edinburgh
publisher, Entrekin said that copies of ``I Have Not Yet Begun to
Fight,'' which came off the presses just last week, would not be
shipped until further evaluation by a history specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Entrekin said that he had known about the Morison book, which
was also published by Atlantic Monthly Press, then an imprint of
Little, Brown, and had had an editor in his office look through it,
but that no systematic comparison had been made and no alarms
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay is one of Scotland's busiest authors, writing many books
on stamps and coins. He is a leading biographer of Robert Burns and
in 1994 received a coveted Scottish literary prize, the Saltire
Award.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bolster, the reviewer who had been assigned by The Times Book
Review, is an associate professor of history at the University of
New Hampshire in Durham. He said he was startled to find Morison's
words, with insignificant changes, echoing in the Mackay book.
</P>
<P>
   In one passage, Morison gave this description of Jones: ``His
characteristic features were a sharp, wedge-shaped nose, high
cheekbones and a strong, cleft chin. His expression showed pride,
eagerness and intellectual alertness.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackay wrote: ``His outstanding features were a sharp,
wedge-shaped nose, high cheekbones and a strong, cleft chin. His
expression showed pride, eagerness, sagacity and intellectual
alertness.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackay called questions about the authenticity of his book
``quite outrageous'' and said that with perhaps 40 books written
about Jones, ``there are plenty of other books where the same
observations are made.''
</P>
<P>
   Every historical writer ``treads in the footsteps of people who
go before them,'' he said. ``We make progress on the shoulders of
giants. That is my answer to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackay acknowledged that his career had been damaged. ``It shows
what happens once these journalists get their hooks into you,'' he
said. Was he continuing to write books? ``Yes I am indeed,'' he
said.

FLEET TO FREEZE, ROLL BACK ATM CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fleet Financial Group said Monday that it would
temporarily freeze its automatic teller surcharge in Massachusetts
at 75 cents, its current level, and roll back BankBoston's fee once
the two banks formally merge.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which expects to receive final approval for its
acquisition of BankBoston Corp as early as next month, said it
would reduce BankBoston's ATM surcharge to 75 cents from its
current $1.
</P>
<P>
   The rates are in force until 2001 and apply only to ATMs in
Massachusetts. In Connecticut, Rhode Island, and other states where
Fleet and BankBoston are active, both companies charge non-clients
$1 to use their ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Surcharges are fees that banks charge customers from other banks
for using their ATMs. Fleet and BankBoston, which collectively own
more than half of Massachusetts' 3,500 ATMs, do not charge their
own customers fees to access their machines but penalize them for
using other banks' outlets. BankBoston is the state's largest ATM
operator, with over 1,330 machines.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, New England's leading bank, said it agreed to limit ATM
fees after the State Treasurer's office protested that the
acquisition of BankBoston would result in excessively high charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the issues that the treasurer raised were
constructive and reasonable and we responded accordingly,'' said
Fleet spokesman James Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze and rollback will save customers approximately $4.5
million through the end of next year, according to the State
Treasurer's office. Customers of other banks who use Fleet's and
BankBoston's machines already pay fees below the national average
of $1.32.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which will become the nation's eighth largest bank after
acquiring BankBoston, is free to boost fees come 2001, and may
choose to follow a national trend and increase surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with that in mind, Fleet shunned Treasurer Shannon P.
O'Brien's request that its freeze and rollback stand for at least
the first two years following the merger. Fleet also declined
O'Brien's suggestion that the new bank designate 125 ATMs as
surcharge-free for two years. The bank said such a move would
create market imbalances for its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ATM surcharges are a contentious matter among banks, which say
they cannot afford to provide free services to non-clients, and
consumer advocates, who say the charges eat away at depositors'
pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign Bancorp, which is acquiring over 360 ATMs from Fleet
and BankBoston as it moves into the region, has said it does not
plan to charge fees exceeding those of its local competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has been among the most aggressive states in
seeking, so far unsuccessfully, to ban ATM surcharges. Only
Connecticut and Iowa have banned the levies.

HOTLINES A LUKEWARM RESPONSE TO COMPANY TROUBLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Ken Lloyd _ a specialist in organizational behavior _ is a
columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News. His column moves Mondays
in the ``f'' financial news file. Send your questions to P.O. Box
260057, Encino, Calif. 91426 or by electronic mail to
LloydOnJobaol.com. Names will be withheld upon request.) 
By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: At a recent management meeting, it was
suggested that we put in a hotline for the employees to call with
anonymous complaints, accusations and tips. Are companies doing
this type of thing, and what is your view? R.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Employee hotlines are in fact becoming a hot item, as a
growing number of companies are installing them to serve the very
purposes that you mentioned. If the employees feel reluctant to
openly express their concerns, or in the more likely case that they
fear some retaliation for doing so, hotlines have been proposed as
the solution.
</P>
<P>
   The problem that is not being adequately addressed in these
situations is the reason why the employees need to have a hotline
in the first place. There are real questions as to why the
employees are upset about so many issues, why they feel that they
cannot address management directly, and why they fear retaliation
for expressing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A hotline actually provides little more than symptomatic relief.
The employees are upset about something, and here is a way for them
to express their concerns about it. While this hotline may be a
welcome addition to the company, it is more important for
management to look at whatever may be causing the employees to
sense that they need a hotline at all.
</P>
<P>
   When there is a good deal of open communication, mutual respect
and trust, and honest and equitable treatment, interest in a
hotline typically cools off.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have been approached by a company that sells
pre-employment tests. Their brochures look pretty good, but I have
heard that there is an issue regarding test validity that can cause
troubles for a company. When I mentioned validation to the company
representative, he told me not to worry since the tests are all
validated. Is that possible? S.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: The company representative did provide you with a valid
response on the issue of validation, but there are a few additional
items that need to be reviewed. In the area of psychological
testing, there are several types of validation, and you need to be
certain that the test has criterion-related validity. In a word,
does the test predict successful performance on the job, and,
importantly, does it do so without discriminating against women and
minorities?
</P>
<P>
   If the testing company has conducted validation studies in a
workplace similar to yours, in which the work behaviors are similar
to yours, in a labor market similar to yours, and the testing
company has specifically examined its findings to be sure that they
are nondiscriminatory, then you may be able to rely on the testing
company's assertions about validity. Be sure to obtain and review
copies of such studies.
</P>
<P>
   However, unless these criteria are met, you will need to have
the tests validated for your company. Failure to do so can cause a
broad range of problems, not only in terms of equal employment
opportunity issues, but also in terms of the likelihood of
rejecting suitable candidates and hiring inappropriate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Before you select any test company, make sure that company can
pass your tests first.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager and I are miles apart on political issues, and we
have had some heated discussions over the past few months. We have
fundamentally different opinions, and I am concerned that this is
going to interfere with his assessment of me. If he opens a
subject, I cannot sit in silence. What do you suggest? M.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: The most politically astute move for you is to focus on your
job performance, so that no matter how your manager assesses your
political opinions, he will have no choice but to positively assess
your work.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is important for both of you to recognize
that you are not going to change each other's political views,
beliefs or ideologies. Your political views are reflections of your
deeper values, and they do not change easily or quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question is why the two of you are spending work time
arguing over political issues in the first place. Although you may
disagree on matters of politics, you both probably agree that the
workplace is not the best forum for airing political rhetoric. This
does not mean that politics should be a forbidden subject, but
rather that the two of you should try to spend more time in the
work arena, and less time in the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Having different political views is part of diversity at work,
and such diversity can be a real asset. If political subjects come
up, rather than trying to convert each other, it makes more sense
to try to listen to each other, learn from each other, and respect
each other's views.

CMGI TO ACQUIRE ADFORCE IN $500M STOCK DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to improve the effectiveness of its on-line advertising,
CMGI Inc. said it plans to acquire a California Internet-promotions
company for about $500 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, the Andover, Mass. venture investment firm that
specializes in Internet companies, said it will buy AdForce Inc. of
Cupertino, Calif. and help it catch up to competitors by creating
synergies between AdForce and two other CMGI units.
</P>
<P>
   AdForce and the two CMGI units, AdSmart and Engage Technologies
Inc., are all involved in distributing commerical content over the
World Wide Web to users who, based on their demographic profile or
past selections, are judged to be more likely to respond.
</P>
<P>
   AdSmart, a wholly-owned division of CMGI, already applies this
theory to the distribution of ads from other companies. Engage, in
which CMGI owns a majority, creates software used for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   AdForce's role is to function as a broker, assembling blocks of
material from 300 companies including America Online Inc. and the
World Wrestling Federation. It then distributes the material over
sites such as sports pages run by CBS.com.
</P>
<P>
   AdForce had already provided some material to Adsmart's network
under a previous partnership. Following the planned acquisition,
which still requires approvals from AdForce shareholders and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, AdForce will operate as an
independent unit within CMGI.
</P>
<P>
   AdForce's 160 employees will remain at offices in Cupertino and
Costa Mesa, Calif., and in New York. AdForce chief executive Chuck
Berger will continue to run the company.
</P>
<P>
   Engage has about 350 employees and Adsmart has about 150, none
of whom will likely be affected by the acquisition, said CMGI
marketing manager Bill White.
</P>
<P>
   First Albany electronic-commerce analyst Ullas Naik said the
deal should effectively expand CMGI's advertising network by giving
it access to a greater range of material with which to draw in
users. Eventually that should allow it to increase the rates it
charges ad producers to distribute such content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more targetable the ads, the more valuable their
real-estate becomes,'' Naik said of CMGI's advertising operations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ends months of uncertainty for AdForce, whose shares
have declined to less than a third of their high of $62.73 since
May on concerns the company was losing ground to competitors such
as DoubleClick Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   However, Doubleclick gains much of its revenue through
ad-placement agreements with the AltaVista search engine, the
majority of which CMGI purchased in June for about $2.3 billion,
mostly in stock.
</P>
<P>
   While those agreements will remain in place, CMGI's White said
certain subdivisions of AltaVista might soon begin drawing ads from
the AdForce network instead.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months ended June 30, AdForce reported a loss of
$5.2 million on revenue of $4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, CMGI will exchange 0.262 of
its shares for each of the 19.9 million oustanding shares in
AdForce. Based on Monday's closing prices the deal values each
AdForce share at $21.86, a 12 percent premium over AdForce's
closing price on Friday. Including outstanding warrants and other
obligations, AdForce has about 23.5 million shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in AdForce rose 3/4 to close at $20 1/4 in Nasdaq trading
Monday. Shares in CMGI rose 3 7/16 to close at $83 7/16 on the same
exchange.

PEACEKEEPING FORCE BRINGS QUICK ORDER IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ In less than 12 hours Monday, the first
elements of a multinational peacekeeping force took control of East
Timor's ravaged capital and began to disarm murderous
pro-Indonesian militias, achieving in one day what Indonesian
troops were unable or unwilling to do for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen military flights and several ships carried
the first 1,190 heavily armed peacekeepers into Dili from northern
Australia before sunset, equipped with a UN mandate to restore
order and facilitate humanitarian relief in the devastated
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The troops, unlike UN peacekeepers in Bosnia several years ago,
have the right to use force to stop a rampage of one-sided
violence. Pro-Jakarta militias, apparently aided by Indonesian
security forces, unleashed a vicious backlash after 79 percent of
East Timorese voted to separate from Indonesia on Aug. 30. The
revenge campaign has claimed thousands of lives, destroyed
uncountable assets, and displaced 800,000 people _ nearly all of
East Timor's population, according to UN and Red Cross estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Two ships anchored off Dili were to dock early Tuesday, kicking
off a second day of deployment, with a total of 2,500 troops
expected to be in place by Tuesday night. The force is expected to
grow to 8,000 personnel from about 20 countries, and will remain in
East Timor until a longer-term UN force takes over to monitor the
territory's transition to independence.
</P>
<P>
   Dili was smoldering from fresh fires and destruction, but
otherwise quiet as the first Hercules C-130 cargo plane touched
down at dawn. It disgorged soldiers in jungle camouflage and flak
jackets who charged off to secure the airstrip, some squatting low
with their guns raised overhead. Squinting in the harsh sunlight,
commandos in full combat gear kicked their way through trash and
stepped over human waste littering the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The city was a ruined ghost town, devoid of cars or people on
the streets, and the smell of rot tainted the air.
</P>
<P>
   Feared civilian militiamen who had rampaged through Dili,
looting, burning, and shooting for the last two weeks, glowered
silently as the Australian-led troops secured the airport and
docks, unloading soldiers and supplies throughout the day. Radical
militia leaders had in recent days threatened to kill and ``eat the
hearts'' of foreign peacekeepers. But the force met no resistance
on its first day, and got help from the Indonesian military in the
form of vitally needed trucks. Peacekeepers also managed to disarm
at least two militiamen carrying homemade guns.
</P>
<P>
   Other men wearing red-and-white headbands in the colors of
Indonesia's flag crowded anxiously onto boats leaving the port;
many were joined by their families. Hundreds of other displaced
people who were sleeping at the port under tarpaulins seemed happy
to see the troops arriving, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town is a heap...but there is no animosity,'' said Bryson
Keenan, one of the first Australian officers to arrive Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two fires raged in different sections of Dili, sending sparks
high in the air. It was unclear who set the fires, but organizers
of the UN-mandated force fear that embittered Jakarta supporters
and elements of the Indonesian military might try to sabotage the
peacekeeping operation or test its mettle.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment marks the first time foreign troops have set foot
on Indonesian-controlled territory since independence more than 50
years ago. It also marks a key transition for the disputed
territory of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony at the
southeastern end of the Indonesian island chain that Jakarta
invaded in 1975 and has occupied ever since.
</P>
<P>
   When pro-Jakarta gunmen wreaked havoc followed the Sept. 4
announcement of a landslide vote for independence, Indonesia at
first insisted that its military could control the situation. But
the government last week acknowledged that at least some ``rogue''
soldiers were participating in the revenge campaign, and buckled to
pressure to accept international peacekeepers, as long as
Indonesian soldiers served alongside foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, commander of the
multinational force, said the first troops ``met absolutely no
resistance...By and large, it has been a cordial reception.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, Indonesian military chief in East
Timor, said over the weekend he was withdrawing most of his troops
and would hand over command of East Timor _ and of six remaining
Indonesian batallions _ after the multinational force had fully
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   An advance team of US Marines entered East Timor with the first
wave of the multinational force, on a one-day mission to survey the
territory. The US has committed 200 support troops for
intelligence, communications, and transport.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight in Darwin Monday, a C-5 Galaxy transport
plane unloaded 18 US Navy personnel and satellite communications
equipment. It could be days or even weeks before US troops are
posted in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The first job of the UN mission dubbed ``Operation Stabilize''
is to secure Dili, and then to fan out to the hills where people
fled to escape violence and are now believed to be in danger of
starvation. A key challenge will be transporting humanitarian aid,
since there are few vehicles and very little gasoline left after
two weeks of looting and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's rugged terrain also presents challenges; the
Ramelau mountain range has peaks rising above 9,000 feet, and in
the interior, unreliable passes snake along ridgelines. During the
rainy season, streams often cut off roads.
</P>
<P>
   In Darwin, UN humanitarian aid coordinator Abdulmejid Hussein
said he was ``cautiously optimistic that the situation will be
stabilized quickly'' and that aid can be delivered largely by land
and by sea.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said relief work would begin in earnest ``as soon as the
security situation permits. We are very, very much ready. We could
have gone in even...a few days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   World Food Program spokeswoman Abby Spring said a $5.6 million
emergency program to feed 150,000 over the next two months could be
extended if necessary. ``These are people who didn't have a lot of
food to begin with,'' she said, raising the danger of quick
starvation from chronic malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, Indonesia's military chief Gen. Wiranto told
parliament not to believe reports of war crimes or estimates that
thousands of people died in the recent violence, saying his
official death toll was under 100.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Armed Forces chief of territorial affairs Lt. Gen.
Bambang Yudhoyono told reporters: ``I am worried about opinion
being formed in the international community that what happened in
East Timor is a great human tragedy, ethnic cleansing or a
large-scale crime, when in reality it was not.''

 &HT;    While water recedes, Floyd's flood victims hope Harvey stays
away
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARBORO, N.C. _ Flood water from Hurricane Floyd remains
everywhere. A fetid cocktail of sewage and drowned hogs, turkeys
and chickens began receding Monday, leaving a brown stain on the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   More rain from Tropical Storm Harvey this week could make things
even worse.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Thelma Bridgers has been out of her home since
Thursday. She is one of more than 6,500 people still in North
Carolina shelters. Another 1,500 remain stranded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might find anything floating in your house _ snakes, rats,
dogs _ anything that has died in the water,'' Bridgers said Monday,
sitting in the shade of Tarboro High School. ``I left with what I
had on. I did not know the water was going to keep coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton toured the engulfed area Monday, offering
comfort and federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a stage in downtown Tarboro, a few yards from the
receding flood waters, Clinton urged people in the 66 counties
declared national disaster areas to seek assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies are offering emergency Food Stamps,
low-interest loans, temporary housing and cash assistance. The U.S.
Labor Department authorized $12 million in emergency funds to
create temporary jobs to clean up North Carolina's worst natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who need it ought to take it,'' Clinton told several
hundred people during his tour of flood-ravaged areas east of
Raleigh. ``There is nothing to be ashamed of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Overflowing lagoons of animal waste and runoff from sewage
plants have deluged water treatment systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Jones County, the smell of rotting hogs filled the air. A
clean-up crew towed a pair of industrial-size incinerators to
dispose of the animal debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling us 100,000 hogs and a half million chickens,''
said Ronnie Jordan, a contractor hired to get rid of carcasses in
Jones County. He fears there may be many more.
</P>
<P>
   Contaminated water could be fatal for young children and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a huge number of different risks out there right
now,'' said Johanna Reese from the North Carolina Division of
Environmental Health. ``The most immediate one we have is lack of
safe drinking water.''
</P>
<P>
   Flood waters have shut down the eastern third of North Carolina,
and the damage may exceed the $6 billion total from Fran in 1996,
the state's costliest natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 campers have been hauled to Tarboro Park which will
become a center for evacuees, said Richard Moore, the state's
public safety director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of North Carolina will probably be the biggest
landlord in Edgecombe County within the next few days,'' Moore
said, adding that more than 1,000 campers and mobile homes for
displaced people may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   There are similar problems in Virginia, where Floyd washed fuel
oil, pesticides and untreated water into the streets of Franklin.
No smoking is permitted within 100 feet of roped-off roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the water catch on fire?'' one woman whose husband stayed
at their flooded home asked Mayor Jim Councill, whose business was
among those flooded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I can't answer you,'' the mayor said. ``But it's
contaminated.''
</P>
<P>
   More rain is headed to Virginia, and that could keep downtown
underwater for days to come. Nearly 150 homes are under as much as
15 feet of contaminated water. Just outside town, the International
Paper Mill _ the area's largest employer _ remains closed.
</P>
<P>
   And Floyd spread his tarnish up the East Coast. As of Monday
evening, 62 deaths had been blamed on the storm and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   On the Raritan River town of Bound Brook, N.J., a layer of red
mud clogged streets. The National Guard stopped people from
returning home so inspectors could examine buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Damage in New Jersey could top $100 million, said Gov. Christie
Whitman. Evacuees pleaded for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in these clothes since Thursday,'' said Charnett
Hillireo. ``I have a 4-year-old here. He's going nuts. He didn't
fall asleep till 4 a.m. He just keeps crying, `Mommy, I want to go
home.' Who's going to help us?''
</P>
<P>
   Back in North Carolina, Gov. Jim Hunt pleaded for private
donations to bolster government aid coordinated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, tell the nation that we have tens and tens of
thousands of people without homes,'' said Hunt, adding that 1,500
people remain stranded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have suffered a terrible disaster in eastern North
Carolina,'' Hunt told Clinton, ``and you have seen it with your own
eyes. It is certainly the worst disaster we've ever had in North
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 300 roads remained closed in North Carolina, hampering
emergency crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge you to keep your spirits up and know we're going to be
with you every step of the way,'' Clinton told about 500 people in
Tarboro, an 11,000-resident historic town flanked by tobacco and
cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Nightwolves'' air squadron from NAS Atlanta has helped
control North Carolina air space for the military helicopters in
rescue and relief missions. A combination of reserve and full-time
pilots from the Marietta, Ga., base could be in North Carolina for
up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, helicopters from the National Guard, Air Force, Navy,
Marines, Army and Coast Guard shuttled food. In several towns,
grocery shelves are bare, the water undrinkable. Clinton said
federal, state and local rescue crews saved ``almost 1,000 lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The president urged people who remain in shelters to stay there
until flooding has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be safe'' before you return, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember there is a God of history; there is a God of
creation,'' said U.S. Rep. Eva Clayton (D-N.C.). ``A God of comfort
brings the best out in people.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3,000 people crowded Tarboro High School, one of 18
area shelters opened after Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on
eastern North Carolina . The region was still drying out from
Hurricane Dennis two weeks earlier. That storm dumped nearly 10
inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a new double-wide, and I never got to spend a night in
it,'' said Barbara Carr, 39, at Tarboro High with her six children.
'' We got out with the clothes on our backs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is none of these damage claims are insured,'' said
Ed Roberson, 50, a Tarboro insurance agent who listened to
Clinton's speech. ''People do not have flood insurance because they
do not live in a flood plain.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson's business on Main Street was flooded. ``The water has
never come up this high before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials accompanying Clinton offered hope, made easier, they
said, by people helping one another.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said rescuers in boats heard people inside a house nearly
covered by water. They cut open the roof and found 11 people in the
attic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank all the heroes who have saved lives,'' Hunt
said.
</P>

IRAQ UNWILLING TO ACCEPT RETURN OF U.N. WEAPONS INSPECTORS  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Iraq dealt a fresh blow on Monday to the
prospect of any swift return of U.N. weapons inspectors to its
soil. In a statement and in remarks by a senior official, the
government of Saddam Hussein indicated it was unwilling to go along
with even the most generous of several proposals aimed at
establishing a new inspection system.
</P>
<P>
   The tough stance complicated efforts of the U.N. Security
Council's five permanent members to agree on a plan to entice Iraq
to allow renewed inspections of its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Monday night more than 10 months after the last
weapons inspectors left Iraq, Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister, warned that any plan that might emerge from the ongoing
discussions might at best subject Iraq to ``bad compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is a serious easing of sanctions or a complete
lifting of sanctions, and this has not been done,'' Aziz told
foreign reporters. He said he believed that not even proposals
being floated by France and Russia, Iraq's closest friends on the
Security Council, could satisfy that Iraqi demand.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has not yet played a part in the discussions, which began
last week in London and are expected to continue in New York this
week around the opening session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the message from the Iraqi government on Monday
suggested that Iraq may see itself in a position of strength as
American concerns about Baghdad's weapons programs are being
overshadowed by weariness elsewhere over nine years of economic
sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued after a meeting of the Revolutionary Command
Council, which is chaired by Saddam, warned that any proposal that
did not grant Iraq its demands would ``definitely be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   At least according to published reports, the plans offered by
France and Russia would go a long way toward satisfying Iraqi
concerns. In return for Baghdad's agreement to new inspections,
those reports have said, France and Russia have proposed that most
or all sanctions against Iraq be lifted immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Those sanctions, which include a strict economic embargo, were
imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and have been kept
in place ever since, despite protests from the Baghdad government
that they should have been lifted long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But, without offering a clear explanation, Aziz said on Monday
night that he feared that even the French and Russian proposals
might prove to be nothing more than ``sugar-coated.''
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed as ``hostile to Iraq'' a plan backed by Britain,
with apparent support of the United States. That plan would offer
Iraq limited relief from sanctions as a reward agreeing to allow
entry to weapons inspections teams. Any easing would come only over
time, after a test period intended to gauge Iraq's cooperation.

 &HT;    Forecasters: Rain won't cause more area flooding
 &HT;    By T. Scott Batchelor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The 1-3 inches of rain expected to fall in
eastern North Carolina over the next several days will not cause
the Tar and Neuse rivers to rise further, forecasters said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for the rain to make them flood any more
than they already are,'' said Gene Chiellini, a meteorologist with
the National Weather Service station in Newport. ``It's going to be
an annoyance as far as draining,'' causing the swollen waterways to
``go do down slower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help them, but it doesn't make it any worse,''
Chiellini said.
</P>
<P>
   The expected rainfall is a ``drop in the bucket'' compared to
the 5-10 inches dumped by Hurricane Floyd in a short period of
time, said weather service meteorologist Laura Furgione.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The current) flow is from the excessive amount we got from
Floyd, which is in the double-digit amount,'' said Furgione.
</P>
<P>
   Furgione said the flooding in Greenville is fueled by water from
upstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need that flow behind it to continue at that level,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Lecce, a geography professor at East Carolina University
who studies rivers, said the massive amount of flooding is
partially attributable to the size of the watershed that collects
and directs water into the Tar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tar River has a really large drainage basin,'' he said.
Lecce said the area that feeds the river is about 2,620 square
miles.
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Floyd came through, the ground was already
saturated from Hurricane Dennis and other precipitation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water runs off of the surface into small streams (that
serve the Tar River),'' Lecce said. ``All that water is working its
way through that drainage network.''
</P>
<P>
   The slowly rising flood waters, and expected slow cresting and
drop, are the result of that process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while for the water to get down the small streams
into the Tar River,'' Lecce said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters and the computer models they use have had a
difficult time narrowing down when the Tar will reach its peak, and
how high that water level will be, because they have had little
experience in dealing with flooding of this magnitude, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is on the extensive side,'' Lecce said. ``It's just
difficult to predict because the (computer) modelers just don't
have the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiellini said the predicted rain was already materializing as
showers in neighboring Lenoir County early Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The precipitation is the result of a cold front moving east
across the United States colliding with tropical outflow from
Tropical Storm Harvey, which is now churning in the Gulf of Mexico
off of Florida's east coast.
</P>
<P>
   That mixture of systems ``is going to be kicking off some rain
and some isolated thunderstorm activity,'' Chiellini said.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical storm's track carries it eastward across Florida
and out into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday or Thursday, Chiellini said, eastern North Carolina
``will be under the influence of high pressure again and (get) a
breather from any weather system.''

 ABC's `ONCE &AMP; AGAIN' BEST OFFER OF THE NEW TV SEASON   
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Please watch ``Once &AMP; Again'' more often than once and again.
Please, please, please, please, please.
</P>
<P>
   If enough of us watch, ABC won't cancel ``Once &AMP; Again'' the way
it deep-sixed ``My So-Called Life'' and ``Relativity'' and
``Nothing Sacred'' and ``Maximum Bob'' and ``Murder One.''
</P>
<P>
   In this season's menu of new offerings, ``Once &AMP; Again'' is the
berries &AMP; cream: fresh and rich, sweet and pungent. With writing to
rival the best movies and camera work to match, it gives commercial
TV something to shout about. The performances of Sela Ward and
Billy Campbell are so full of truth that acting coaches will be
using the series in how-to seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Campbell play parents in their 40s, both divorced, both
with a couple of kids, both with a fear of what's lurking out
there, romance-wise, now that their marriages have failed.
</P>
<P>
   In the chatty style that drew millions of American baby boomers
to ``thirtysomething'' a decade ago, creators Edward Zwick and
Marshall Herskovitz are now exploring what's happening to many of
them as they hit their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's character, Lily Manning, helps her sister run a bookstore
while doing the single-mom juggling act. Campbell plays Rick
Sammler, an architect who's a bit more aloof as a parent but
learning fast as he begins to see more of himself than he'd like in
his 16-year-old son, Eli (Shane West).
</P>
<P>
   The emotional tugging in ``Once &AMP; Again'' will test the stoutest
lines, the surest knots. Lily's older daughter, Grace (Julia
Whelan) is having self-esteem problems. Younger daughter Zoe
(Meredith Deane) isn't ready for a second dad. Putting her kids
first comes naturally to Lily, but does she do so at the peril of
her own well-being?
</P>
<P>
   Zwick and Herskovitz take the self-analysis that was the
hallmark of ``thirtysomething'' and extend it even further in
``Once &AMP; Again.'' By placing Lily and Rick in occasional
black-and-white segments separate from the main story, they set the
audience up as a sort of collective psychoanalyst. As Lily and Rick
pour out their hopes, their fears, their dreams, we get sucked into
their lives even more.
</P>
<P>
   It's a device sometimes used to mask bad scripts, but Zwick and
Herskovitz cleverly use it to advance the story.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry. Lily and Rick aren't wacko. They're pretty
normal, in fact, with the usual insecurities of anyone who has
experienced a foundering relationship. As Rick says in one of his
``sessions'': ``If somebody knew that I didn't want them for them,
but basically because I was scared to death of being alone, I can't
imagine why they'd want me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once &AMP; Again'' is like that throughout: refreshingly real,
reflecting the thoughts of people who are uncompromisingly ordinary
in an age when TV characters aren't considered interesting unless
they're quirky.
</P>
<P>
   Once &AMP; Again. One-hour drama series about a budding romance
between two fortysomething single parents. Starring Sela Ward,
Billy Campbell, Julia Whelan, Shane West, Meredith Deane and Evan
Rachel Wood. Premieres Tuesday night on ABC. Parental guideline
rating: TV-14.

CASKET SAYS IT ALL FOR CHURCH SHOOTING VICTIM CASSANDRA GRIFFIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By REBECA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The casket said it all.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, at the age of 14, Cassandra Griffin was laid to rest
in a bold blue casket with clouds painted on its lid.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting for a young woman so many describe as an angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today some of you picked up the newspaper and you read the
obituary column, Cassie Griffin had died,'' said the Rev. Al
Meredith, pastor of Wedgwood Baptist Church, where the funeral took
place. ``Don't you believe it. This is not Cassie,'' he said,
pointing to her casket. ``Her soul and her spirit are with the
Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, a freshman at North Crowley High School, was one of
seven people shot to death on Wednesday at the church by a gunman
who then killed himself. They had gathered to pray, sing and
worship. But yesterday, in that fateful place, gunshots were
replaced by thunderous singing, screams were replaced by joyous
shouts to the Lord, and the gaping void left by the shooting was
filled with love and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds gathered in the arc-shaped sanctuary, which seemed to
enclose the grieving family with loving arms. In the front row,
Cassie's parents David and Tralissa Griffin sat and held one
another. Cassie's brother, 11-year-old Chris, held a rainbow
colored Beanie Baby bear _ Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the casket was a brilliant sea of color _ pink
roses, yellow carnations, white lilies and orange and purple birds
of paradise. On either side of the casket floated lime-green
balloons in the shape of a frog, which represents a motto of the
church's youth: Fully Rely On God.
</P>
<P>
   People began filling the sanctuary an hour before the 2 p.m.
service. They lined up by the dozens to sign the casket with black
indelible markers. As they wrote, they hugged, cried and murmured
quiet words of comfort to one another.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, youth pastor Jay Fannin showed a homemade
video of young people praying at their school flag poles Wednesday
morning, part of a national See You at the Pole rally. The shooting
happened before the video could be shown at the church's evening
service.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the service, an emotional Meredith took the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you have been to the funeral of a martyr before?''
he asked those in the crowd. ``This is my fifth one in three
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Skinner, 14, and Robert DeBord, 17, were honorary
pallbearers and sat in the front row. Both were injured in the
shooting. Also attending were Mary Beth Talley and Jaynanne Brown,
who also were wounded, and Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr.
</P>
<P>
   As the service drew to a close, a clarinetist played ``Amazing
Grace'' while ushers opened Griffin's casket to allow people one
last glimpse of the young life that had touched so many.
</P>
<P>
   Some cried loudly and clutched Griffin's relatives in a tight
hug. One man dressed in a military uniform presented David Griffin
with an American flag, folded in a triangle, and saluted him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a Christian soldier, killed in the line of duty,''
said the Rev. Don Robertson of Plainview, who baptized Cassie
Griffin. ``Jesus died for her. She died for Him.''

SECOND MAN CONVICTED IN DRAGGING DEATH
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ After a week of testimony that detailed a crime
of almost unimaginable brutality, a Texas jury Monday found a
racist ex-convict guilty of capital murder in the beating and
dragging death of a 49-year-old black man last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors must now decide whether the defendant, Lawrence Russell
Brewer, 32, one of three white men charged in the June 7, 1998,
killing of James Byrd Jr., should be sentenced to death or life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments and testimony in the punishment phase of the trial
began Monday afternoon and were to continue Tuesday. If the jury
does not recommend a death sentence, Brewer will be eligible for
parole in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer did not react to the verdict, but members of Byrd's
family in the courtroom smiled, wept and gently patted the shoulder
of the family patriarch, James Byrd Sr., whose eyes brimmed with
tears as the jury's decision was read.
</P>
<P>
   The case had drawn national attention both because of the racial
aspect of the murder _ Brewer admitted on the witness stand that he
had led a prison-based white supremacist group _ and the grisly
nature of the killing. Byrd was beaten, sprayed in the face with
black paint, then chained by the ankles to a pickup truck and
dragged for three miles along an isolated rural logging road near
the East Texas town of Jasper, according to testimony by Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   In final arguments Monday, lawyers for the prosecution and the
defense noted how people around the nation had seen the case as an
example of the ugliness of racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't our case,'' Guy James Gray, the Jasper County
district attorney, told the jury. ``This case belongs to everyone
in the state of Texas and maybe the whole nation. You are the law.
You are the state. You are the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers had urged jurors not to be swayed by the public
outrage that gruesome details of the murder had provoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of pressure for a conviction in
this case,'' said Layne Walker, a lawyer for Brewer. But, Walker
told the jurors, ``take whatever public pressure you feel and
whatever sentiments you feel and leave them outside the door.''
</P>
<P>
   John William King, 24, the first man tried in the case, was
convicted in Jasper in February and sentenced to death. The third
man charged, Shawn Allen Berry, 24, will be tried later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, witnesses from the Jasper County Sheriff's Department
told jurors of finding an armless, headless body and backtracking
along the dragging route to recover a human head, dentures, beer
bottles, cigarette butts and Byrd's wallet. DNA evidence presented
connected the beer bottles and cigarette butts to the men charged
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, testifying in his own defense, Brewer said the attack
on Byrd started when King and Byrd began fighting. Berry then slit
Byrd's throat, Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Alternately combative and contrite on the witness stand, Brewer
tried to portray himself as a reluctant bystander to the murder
even as he admitted kicking Byrd in the side hard enough to injure
his own toe and spraying black paint into Byrd's face.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer wept openly as he denied that he had meant any harm to
Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean to cause his death. I had no intention of doing
_ killing nobody,'' he sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer blamed Berry entirely for the crime, saying he had
slashed Byrd's throat with a pocket knife, single-handedly tied him
to the pickup truck with a logging chain and then dragged the body
before dumping it in the cemetery of a black church.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Gray told the jury: ``It took all three of these men
to subdue James Byrd. He's alive, he's conscious, and he's fighting
for his life. It probably took all three of them to get him down,
wrap the chain around him and get the chain tied up to the truck.
It took all three.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, prosecutors also produced a letter written from
Brewer's jail cell to a fellow member of a racist prison gang in
which he had boasted, ``Well, I did it. And I am no longer a
virgin.'' Defense lawyers argued that the letter referred to an
unrelated sexual experience.
</P>
<P>
   In another letter that prosecutors contended demonstrated prior
intent, this one written in 1993 to his wife at the time, Brewer
wrote of feeling ``as though I've been drug 120 miles chained by
feet to the bumper of Corvette doing 90 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   Though admitting it was an odd coincidence, Brewer said under
cross-examination that the phrase had been ``just a figure of
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe that King led the other two men to commit
the murder, based in part on ideological teachings acquired while
he and Brewer were in the pro-Aryan Confederate Knights of America
prison gang. Brewer's body is covered with tattoos of white
supremacist slogans and satanist beliefs, according to trial
testimony and photographs entered as evidence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brewer ran away from his home in Sulphur Springs, Texas, as a
teen-ager and has been in and out of prisons over the last 16 years
for burglary and drug convictions and parole violations.
</P>
<P>
   District Court Judge Monte Lawlis had moved Brewer's trial from
Jasper, 150 miles east, to this city of about 60,000 at the request
of prosecutors anxious to outflank potential defense claims of
local pre-trial bias in the area where the killing occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 white and two Hispanic jurors took four hours to reach a
verdict.

 &HT;    Atlanta bid for Games is defended
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. Olympic Committee officials on Monday defended
attorney Griffin Bell's contention that the International Olympic
Committee had created a culture of corruption that exploited bid
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Griffin Bell) report does nothing to alter what we are
clear about,'' said Mike Moran, a USOC spokesman. ``This is much
wider than any American city.''
</P>
<P>
   The USOC forwarded a copy of Bell's report on the Atlanta
lobbying effort to the IOC late last week. In a cover letter, an
USOC attorney said the Colorado Springs, Colo., organization did
not plan any further investigation into the Atlanta bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned all the lessons to be learned in this,'' said
Scott Blackmon, deputy executive director and lead counsel of the
USOC. ``Based on what we've seen in the report, it looks like more
of the same culture. There's nothing different between what
happened in Atlanta and Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC demanded last week the USOC explain why details of
Atlanta's gifts, travel payments and scholarship offers were not
included in an earlier report the USOC provided in an IOC inquiry
into improprieties in candidate cities.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he believed the IOC had been seeking information
about its own members making improper requests of bid cities in its
February inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking for information about IOC members
approaching candidate cities. Atlanta informed us there was no
additional information, which we relayed to the IOC,'' Moran
offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe we have a problem with what they told us in
February,'' he said. ``It seems to be more weighted the other way''
with the bidders making improper offers.
</P>
<P>
   The report turned over to Congressional lawmakers last week
revealed that Atlanta bidders offered or considered lavish favors,
gifts and perks for IOC members and their families, including
college scholarships, free healthcare and job offers. The report
amended a previous accounting given to a U.S. House Commerce
committee investigation opened in the wake of the Salt Lake City
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Moran appears to corroborate the IOC's contention last week that
Atlanta bidders ``pushed'' the favors and gifts onto the IOC
members ``under the pretext of friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Moran said the USOC would not be drawn into a
finger-pointing spat. ``To affix blame here is not very helpful,''
he said. ``The question of whether cities are forcing something on
IOC members or whether IOC members are soliciting gifts is not the
point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our very own thorough look into this ... made it clear there
is a culture of this involving all bid cities and the IOC itself.
It has ebbed and flowed in various cities.''
</P>
<P>
   An ethics commission, headed by former Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, investigated the Salt Lake City and determined the
IOC was an inbred, unethical group that fostered a ``culture of
improper gift giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled in connection
with the Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmon said the USOC couldn't afford another investigation.
``We have limited resources . We'd like to use those resources to
identify and train athletes.,'' he said. ``We spend an awful lot of
money in connection with Salt Lake. And we've already taken
corrective action.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian IOC member Mario Pescante, who led Rome's losing
campaign for the 2004 Games, accused the Americans of ducking
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't the Americans take the responsibility for the people
who organized this strategy of bribery and corruption? Who started
this? They did,'' Pescante told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are always against our movement. They don't have the
humility to criticize their own behavior.''

ANNAN URGES U.N. TO ACT QUICKER TO PREVENT HUMANITARIAN DISASTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan sounded a warning
Monday to a frequently paralyzed Security Council, urging it to act
faster and more effectively to meet the challenge of a world
engulfed in civil wars that quickly descend into the slaughter of
helpless civilian populations.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to world leaders at the opening day of debate in
the General Assembly, Annan also said that countries which have
resisted international intervention will no longer be able to hide
behind protestations of national sovereignty when they flagrantly
violate the rights of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the charter precludes a recognition that there are
rights beyond borders,'' he said, on the day an Australian-led
force landed in East Timor to help complete its separation from
Indonesia. A Western diplomat called the speech ``courageous and
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan did not single out the United States, the Security
Council's most powerful member, or any other major nation, but his
unusually strong criticism of the Security Council's initial
failures to deal with genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and to agree on
responding to Serbian atrocities in Kosovo over the last year
pointed obliquely at American policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who would normally speak on the first day of
the general debate in the assembly, postponed his appearance until
Tuesday out of respect for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Annan spoke Monday as officials of the council's five permanent
members, who have veto power _ Britain, China, France, Russia and
the United States _ were preparing to meet again to try to end
another Security Council deadlock, this one over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, since the American bombing of Baghdad in
December, there have been no arms inspections in Iraq, which must
be certified as disarmed before 9-year-old sanctions can be lifted.
The council is sharply divided on how to devise a new monitoring
system, while Iraq has used the time to harden its position against
any kind of renewed inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, the United States blocked council action while tens
of thousands of Tutsi and their moderate Hutu neighbors were
massacred. Annan, who was then in charge of U.N. peacekeeping, has
borne a lot of criticism for what was essentially a political
decision made in Washington, where memories of American soldiers
killed in Somalia in 1993 were still fresh. The secretary-general
has called for an investigation in response to charges that the
United Nations knew about the imminent genocide but did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the Clinton administration, fearing a veto of
military action from Russia or China, circumvented the United
Nations and went directly to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the genocide in Rwanda will define for our generation
the consequences of inaction in the face of mass murder,'' Annan
said, ``the more recent conflict in Kosovo has prompted important
questions about the consequences of action in the absence of
complete unity on the part of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who hailed the NATO bombing of Kosovo as a new era of
quicker action outside the United Nations, Annan asked two
questions that reflect the concerns of many nations uneasy with the
prospect of unbridled American power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there not a danger of such interventions undermining the
imperfect, yet resilient, security system created after the second
World War, and of setting dangerous precedents for future
interventions without a clear criterion to decide who might invoke
these precedents and in what circumstances?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary-general had no consolations for the countries,
particularly in the Third World, that argue that the United Nations
has no right to overstep national borders. That case was presented
Monday by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria who said in his
speech that ``interference can only occur with the consent of the
state concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Algeria, where violence by Islamic militants and government
forces has left thousands dead in recent years, has refused to
allow international human rights monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not deny the right of northern hemisphere public opinion
to denounce the breaches of human rights where they occur,'' said
Bouteflika, who is also chairman of the Organization of African
Unity and spoke on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, we do not deny that the United Nations has the
right and the duty to help suffering humanity. But we remain
extremely sensitive to any undermining of our sovereignty, not only
because sovereignty is our last defense against the rules of an
unequal world but because we are not taking part in the
decision-making process of the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also been ambivalent about the trend
toward intervention by international organizations into a country's
affairs. Although the Clinton administration proposed a series of
international war crimes tribunals, it has stopped short of backing
a permanent international criminal court because of Pentagon
objections. It has also failed to ratify a number of international
treaties including a convention banning land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the council, with its five most powerful
members unchanged since the end of World War II, rankles many
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Security Council acted with relative speed in the
case of East Timor last week, as the secretary-general pointed out
Monday, the council did wait for an Indonesian invitation. The
council had not been prepared to take preventive action, although
there were numerous reports reaching the United Nations and
government capitals about threats from the quasi-official militias
opposed to independence for the territory, threats that turned to
carnage after the East Timorese overwhelmingly rejected continued
association with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless several leaders mentioned that the action on East
Timor by the council set an example of strong international support
for people who have made an important choice in a free vote and
paid a terrible price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever saw the images of the Timorese on voting day,'' said
President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal, the former colonial power in
East Timor, ``clutching their registration cards, waiting in
orderly lines for the long-awaited moment to express freely their
will, must have reacted with strong emotion, and surely perceived
in those faces and gestures, the universal appeal of democracy,
freedom and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a century after the founding of the United Nations as a
club of countries whose national interests often overrode those of
their own populations or people in trouble in other nations, Annan
said unambiguously that countries can no longer cite sovereign
rights when it is clear to the world that they are committing
abuses against their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This developing international norm in favor of intervention to
protect civilians from wholesale slaughter will no doubt continue
to pose profound challenges to the international community,'' he
said. He told the audience of world leaders that the U.N. charter
should not be misread.
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to this turbulent era of crises and interventions,
there are those who have suggested that the charter itself _ with
its roots in the aftermath of global interstate war _ is ill-suited
to guide us in a world of ethnic wars and intrastate violence,''
Annan said. ``I believe they are wrong.''

 &HT;    Debate over F-22 Raptor turns to funding
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debate over building the F-22 Raptor fighter
plane is shifting from whether it should be funded to a new fight
over how much money and how many planes will be built.
</P>
<P>
   That's a victory for the Georgia delegation, which has worked
hard to restore $1.8 billion in F-22 funding to the $266 billion
defense appropriations bill. That money would pay for the first
group of six fighters to be built at Lockheed Martin's Marietta,
Ga. plant.
</P>
<P>
   A special conference of House and Senate lawmakers will meet as
early as Wednesday to hash out a final figure. Congressional
supporters say that they are confident that the program will be
funded, but it is unclear how many planes will be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Their confidence comes from comments Appropriations Chairman
C.W. ``Bill'' Young, a Florida Republican, made to the St.
Petersburg Times over the weekend. Young told the paper that
Republican leaders from both the House and Senate had decided to
buy an unspecified number of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Young's statement, coupled with the lift on budget caps, was
seen as a sign that the House was ready to work with the Senate to
fund the program. But some congressional staffers caution that no
deal is certain until the budget conference is finished.
</P>
<P>
   In Marietta, Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems issued a
statement saying it is ``encouraged by media reports concerning the
F-22 funding issue. At this time, however, we are not aware of any
specific details concerning how Congress may choose to resolve this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Cales, an Air Force spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said the
service ``doesn't have anything new on the issue. We're still
working with the congressional leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, both Lockheed Martin and the Air Force have
suggested that even a cut in the number of planes in the first
production lot would be counterproductive because it would disrupt
the supply chain and boost unit costs.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise move last summer, House budget leaders cut $1.8
billion from the $3.1 billion requested for the program in the next
fiscal year. The Senate approved the full amount, setting the stage
for a showdown between the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   By nixing the funding, the House put the $62 billion program
into limbo. Under current plans, Lockheed would build 339 aircraft
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Cancellation of the F-22 program would be a severe blow to
Lockheed Martin and especially to the Marietta plant. Some analysts
believe the company would be forced to consolidate its aircraft
business, now split among Georgia, Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this indicates pretty clearly that the lights will
stay on the program,'' said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) whose district
includes the plant. ``This is important for Georgia and our
national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) agreed, but added he's frustrated that
the House put the F-22 program in jeopardy to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't like is the gamesmanship,'' Cleland said. ``The
entire program got ambushed by the House. They took the entire $1.8
billion and shifted it off to their own favorite programs, leaving
the F-22 high and dry. I think there are some people playing games
with national security. ``
</P>
<P>
   The attack was led by Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), chairman of
the appropriations subcommittee. Lewis contends the Air Force
should re-examine its need for the F-22 when compared with upgrades
to pay and existing weapons systems. Ironically, the House version
of the defense budget includes money for extra C-130J cargo planes,
also built in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sprecht, press secretary to Lewis, said if his boss had the
opportunity to address the Senate appropriations committee members,
``he could make them understand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a longtime appropriator, he's always willing to work
with Senate appropriators to pass the appropriations bills by the
end of the fiscal year,'' Sprecht said.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the fiscal year fast approaching on Sept. 30,
congressional aides said, Lewis decided to work with the Senate
appropriators and not contest the program.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor influencing Lewis was his formidable opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Cleland and Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.)
gathered signatures from three-fifths of the Senate in support of
the program. Two of those signatures came from Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Minority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation's commitment to this program began some two decades
ago,'' Coverdell said. ``I simply cannot fathom why someone would
throw that investment away at this juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the House, Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and Majority
Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) have given their support for the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chairman (Lewis) has had a lot of leadership
pressure put on him,'' said Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), a member of
the appropriations committee. ``There has been a barrage of support
on both sides of the aisle for the F-22. It has been an incessant
campaign.''

FEDERAL COMMISSION PREDICTS INCREASING THREAT OF TERRORISM  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States faces increasing threats from
terrorism in the next 25 years and is likely to be compelled to
intervene in other conflicts like Kosovo and East Timor even as its
military shrinks, a federal advisory commission warned in a report
released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report makes grim predictions about crises and threats at
home and abroad. The commission, headed by former Sens. Gary Hart
and Warren B. Rudman, warns in the 143-page report that the country
``will be vulnerable to an increasing range of threats against
American forces and citizens overseas, as well as at home,'' from
terrorists or rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   ``While conventional conflicts will still be possible, the most
serious threat to our security may consist of unannounced attacks
on American cities'' by terrorist groups using germ warfare, said a
summary of the report. ``Another may be well-planned cyber-attack
on the air traffic control system on the East Coast of the United
States as some 200 commercial aircraft are trying to land safely in
a morning's rain and fog.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission predicted that the American military will
increasingly be called upon to conduct humanitarian missions and
what the Pentagon calls ``operations other than war'' in trouble
spots around the world. But its status and influence will fuel
resentment toward the United States, making it a target for attacks
at home and abroad. In one of its grimmest predictions, the report
added, ``Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in
large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the United States is not prepared to defend
itself against terrorist threats at home. That, its report
concluded, will lead to more pressure on the military to expand its
scope into domestic law enforcement as the lines between foreign
and domestic threats is blurred.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's effort is the latest in a series of reviews
undertaken inside and outside the government over the last few
years to try to assess threats to the United States in the
post-Cold War era. Many of its findings echo those made by the
Pentagon's own Quadrennial Defense Review in 1997 and a
Congressional group, the National Defense Panel, which issued a
report a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the commission is expected to influence the debate over
funding for the Pentagon and its programs for dealing with new
threats, including a stronger focus on chemical and biological
weapons and a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week previewing the report, Rudman
said he hoped the commission's work would ultimately lead to a
rethinking of the organization of the nation's national security
agencies _ the way similar reviews after the end of World War II
led to the creation of the Air Force, the Central Intelligence
Agency and the National Security Council. ``We believe that with
the world changing as it has, the essential force structure of the
United States defense establishment, although it has changed in
many ways, structurally has remained very much like it was intended
to be'' after World War II, Rudman said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission stopped short of offering prescriptions, saying
it would offer those in its subsequent reports.
</P>
<P>
   In surveying the possibilities for the future, the commission
said that, while Russia and China are likely to be competitors to
the United States in global influence _ with China's economy likely
to surpass the United States' by 2020 _ it is also possible that
Russia and China could disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   In looking ahead, the commission was not entirely gloomy. The
spread of democracy, advances in medicine and technology and new
economic opportunities raise the prospect of increased stability
and security around the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the same trends have less benign consequences. The
increasing integration of the world's economy will mean that
economic crises that were once local might spread, while scientific
advances could hasten the spread of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, as well as missiles to fire them.
</P>
<P>
   The reliance on computers and other technologies will also
create new vulnerabilities to attack from those unable to take on
the American military directly, the commission said. The United
States, like other advanced countries, could also face serious
security threats from economic crises that touch off social unrest
or conflicts. The report noted that the Asian economic crisis in
1997 and 1998 was soon followed by the political upheaval in
Indonesia and the fall of President Suharto's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most advanced states,'' the report said, ``major threats
to national security will broaden beyond the purely military.''

SECOND MAN TRIED IN DRAGING DEATH FOUND GUILTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ White supremacist Lawrence Russell Brewer, who
described himself in prison notes as a ``soaring eagle'' and ``hero
of the day,'' was brought down to earth on Monday when a jury found
him guilty of capital murder in the dragging death of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, 32, who has served time for house burglary, showed no
emotion when the jury of five women and seven men, including one
Hispanic, announced its verdict after four hours' deliberation in
the second trial to arise from the torture slaying of James Byrd
Jr. in Jasper, Texas, last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' the victim's father, James Byrd Sr., said
after the punishment phase of the trial began. Brewer could be
sentenced to death, or life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution on Tuesday will call one more witness, a
psychiatrist, to testify about whether Brewer represents a future
threat to society. Defense lawyers declined to say how many
witnesses they plan to call, but the jury is expected to begin
deliberating Brewer's punishment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second weight has been lifted from our shoulders,'' Byrd's
sister Mary Verrett told reporters. She said testimony showed
Brewer ``enjoyed what he did to my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tortured, then he was killed and they got much
satisfaction out of that,'' Verrett said. ``And we the Byrd family
are satisfied right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said he was
relieved at the verdict. The South Central Texas jury took 90
minutes longer to convict Brewer than a Jasper jury took find John
William King guilty in Jasper. King was sentenced to death. The
third man charged, Shawn Berry, 24, is expected to be tried in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 22 years, it doesn't get any easier,'' Gray said. ``It
scares you. Everyone was nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial was shifted from Jasper in East Texas, where the
killing occurred, 135 miles west to Bryan because of pretrial
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Texas, particularly East Texas, is embarrassed by that
history (of racial violence) from 60 to 70 years ago,'' Gray said.
``When Jasper turned the case against Bill King, some people would
say they were just trying to protect themselves. When you move it
half way across the state of Texas and another jury returns a
guilty verdict, it kind of broadens the scope, speaks for the whole
state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the DNA evidence placing Brewer at the scene where
Byrd was beaten and chained behind a pickup was the strongest
evidence. The case, he said, got a major boost when Brewer
testified, acknowledging he was at the scene and confirming he
smoked and drank there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The just punishment for this case in this set of circumstances
is death,'' Gray said. ``Will he be a danger in the future? I don't
see any answer to that but, yes, he will be a danger.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Brewer _ an exalted cyclops of a prison Ku
Klux Klan gang and self-described Aryan warrior _ intermittently
sobbed last week as he told the jury that he had no intention to
kill Byrd. He blamed Berry for slashing Byrd's throat, then
dragging him for three miles behind the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Gray said Brewer took the stand to
craft a scenario that put him at the scene _ which DNA evidence had
proven _ but made himself out to be a non-participant in Byrd's
kidnapping and slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He admitted enough to comply with the facts ... and just
staying short of the death penalty,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three men in the truck, three men who smoked and
three men who had blood on their shoes,'' said Gray, who listed the
three different accounts Brewer gave of his actions to authorities
before the trial, in prison notes, and in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a racist white supremacist like Bill King,'' the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Brewer blamed Byrd's kidnapping and murder on
Berry, who was the first suspect to give an account to
investigators. He said Brewer cut Byrd's throat before chaining him
behind the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   But in his closing statement, Gray said the dragging marks
started more than 60 feet from where Byrd was beaten, and there
wasn't enough blood at the scene or on Berry's clothes to
corroborate Brewer's account that Byrd's throat was cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied when he told you he wasn't a racist and he lied when
he told you Shawn Berry cut James Byrd Jr.'s throat,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said that Byrd was alive and conscious before he
was chained to the bumper of Berry's pickup, and that, judging from
the black man's size, it took three men to subdue him long enough
to fasten the chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of pressure for a conviction,''
Layne Walker, one of Brewer's defense attorneys, said in his
closing arguments. ``I know it. You know it. They know it,'' he
said, referring to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job of making you hate Russell Brewer.''

<P>
   As many as 4 million users of free electronic mail systems may
have been vulnerable to a gaping security hole that would let
anybody on the Internet read their mail. The incident is the latest
example of the risks involved in using free e-mail systems for
private communications.
</P>
<P>
   The problem affected free e-mail service on a number of major
Web sites including the E(asterisk)Trade on-line investment service
and Network Solutions Inc., the biggest provider of Internet
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that anyone maliciously tampered with mail
at these sites. In addition, the e-mail system at E(asterisk)Trade
is entirely separate from that site's financial trading computers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the insecure mail system is run by Critical Path Inc.
of San Francisco, which sells e-mail service to other firms.
Companies like E(asterisk)Trade and Network Solutions offer
Critical Path e-mail as a free service to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions began offering free e-mail accounts last week,
and it was apparently some of these users who discovered the
problem. They found that by typing a certain address into a Web
browser and entering the name of a free e-mail user, they would be
registered as a ``new user'' of the system, but with full access to
the original user's mailbox. They could read the user's mail, or
send out phony messages that would appear to come from the actual
owner of the mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the problem was posted on the Internet's Hacker News
Network, and on a Web page run by 2600, a hacker magazine. The 2600
page described how to duplicate the bug. Soon the mailbox for
Network Solutions' own Web master was flooded with insulting
messages, mocking the lack of security at a site run by the company
that manages the ``.com'' Internet addresses used by most of the
world's major Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Network Solutions wasn't to blame. Marcy Swenson, vice
president of engineering for Critical Path, conceded that the bug
resided on her firm's system and that it probably affected other
sites using Critical Path e-mail. Overall, Swenson said, about 4
million Internet users have free e-mail accounts running on the
Critical Path system.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson said Critical Path had shut down its system for allowing
the registration of new users, and expected to have the bug tracked
down and fixed by Tuesday. ``I can think of no other instance of
something like this,'' said Swenson. ``We're constantly working to
improve our security.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weld Pond, a security consultant with L0pht Heavy Industries
Inc., a Boston computer security firm, said systems such as
Critical Path's are rarely secure. ``This is not news to anyone in
the security industry,'' said Pond. ``These free, Web-based e-mail
systems are just riddled with security problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Microsoft Corp.'s Hotmail, which with 40 million
users is the world's largest free e-mail system, was beset by a
similar flaw that let anybody sneak into mailboxes belonging to
others.

APPLE SAYS IT WILL NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the first setback for Apple Computer Inc.
since the return of the company's co-founder Steven Jobs two years
ago, the company said Monday that shipments, revenues and earnings
for the current quarter will fall short of expectations as a result
of smaller-than-expected deliveries of microprocessor chips from
Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Apple made the announcement after the market had closed. But the
warning sent Apple's share price down almost 10 points in
after-hours trading Monday evening. After rising 2 1/8 to 79 1/16,
within pennies of the all-time high, during regular NASDAQ trading,
it dropped quickly to 69 7/8 after the warning was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Since announcing its new PowerMac G4 line of desktop computers
on Aug. 31, Apple has received more than 150,000 orders. These
machines are based on the G4 version of the Power PC microprocessor
co-developed by Apple, Motorola and IBM Corp. Although both
Motorola and IBM manufactured previous generations of the Power PC
chip, Motorola is the sole source for the G4.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may be paying the price for the fact that IBM lost
interest in serving Apple a year ago,'' said Michael Slater, an
editor with the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter.
``Apple is stuck with one processor supplier, although they're not
worse off than anyone with a Pentium III system,'' he said,
referring to Intel Corp.'s most powerful chip. ``The thing that is
different is the one-to-one connection: There is one supplier and
one customer'' for the G4, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stock will get hit because they now have a picture for the
quarter that is less than perfect, but I think it will blow over
fairly rapidly,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P.
Morgan. ``Supply problems are fairly high-class problems. Demand
problems are more fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple said it would earn between $75 million and $85 million,
which is equivalent to 42 cents to 48 cents per share, in the
quarter ending Sept. 30. Analysts had expected 76 cents, according
to First Call. Apple will report its results on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, said in a telephone
interview Monday that the response to the new PowerMac models had
been extremely strong but that Apple was going to receive only
about 40 percent to 45 percent of the microprocessors it had
expected during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, after we'd announced the products, Motorola
informed us they're having problems ramping up the G4 production,''
Jobs said. ``If this had occurred earlier in the quarter, we would
have had time to recover from it. We've been told by Motorola we
will have the processors we need to catch up early next quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Wilke, Motorola's corporate vice president and general
manager of personal computer systems, said that there had been no
problems with G4 production but that Apple's demand had grown
faster than expected. ``Demand is high and naturally, the customer
would like more chips than we can supply,'' he said. ``The only
time you don't have these sorts of challenges is when you launch a
product nobody wants to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple introduced three models of the G4, distinguished by
processors of different speeds and other features. The 400 mhz
model, priced at $1,599, was available immediately, with a 450mhz,
$2,499 machine to follow this month, and a 500 mhz, $3,499 version
in October. As is often the case with new microprocessors, the
faster versions are not being produced in anticipated quantities.
The 450 mhz PowerMac is only now beginning to ship, and the 500 mhz
version will not ship until November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The December quarter will be affected because the design and
publishing crowd wants the 500,'' said Charles Wolf, an analyst
with Warburg Dillon Read. ``We ordered a 450, and the anticipated
delivery was a month out. That threw it into the next quarter in
any event.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf said he thought Apple's setback would prove temporary,
noting that the company has 160,000 advance orders for the new
iBook portable, which is not affected by the G4 issue, and is also
expected to introduce a more powerful version of the popular iMac
as early as next month. ``It's a hiccup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said the company might not always have a single source in
Motorola for the Power PC chip, but he declined to comment on
whether there were ongoing negotiations with IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the rest of the PC market is buying pretty much solely
from Intel, it's not that big an issue,'' Jobs said. ``At least
we're a much bigger fish in this particular pond.''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary shortage of Motorola chips has to be viewed in
light of the strong demand for Apple's new products and its ongoing
recovery, Jobs said. ``Given where Apple's come from in the past 24
months, having a quarter where we're going to miss and still being
able to report $75 to $85 million in earnings is progress,'' he
said.

SECURITY AT LOS ALAMOS HAS IMPROVED, REVIEW FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department said Monday that a new review
had found that security at Los Alamos National Laboratory had
improved in recent months, but that security procedures at the
nation's two other weapons laboratories still lagged.
</P>
<P>
   Officials credited reforms implemented at Los Alamos in the wake
of accusations that China stole nuclear secrets from the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department review gave Los Alamos a ``satisfactory''
rating, up from a ``marginal'' rating just one year ago. The
government's two other nuclear weapons laboratories, Lawrence
Livermore and Sandia, were given marginal ratings in the new
review.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the higher marks at Los
Alamos proved that stricter security standards he had imposed on
the laboratories this year were ``beginning to work.'' He said that
``people are getting the message that we're serious about
protecting our nation's secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   An Energy Department official involved in the security review
said that the higher rating reflected a ``change in attitude''
about security at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The government's weapons laboratories came under fire for lax
security procedures earlier this year in the wake of accusations
that China had stolen secret design information related to
America's most advanced nuclear warhead, the W-88. A Los Alamos
scientist, the subject of a 3-year FBI investigation into the
theft, was dismissed for security violations in March, but has not
been arrested or charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics now contend that the FBI and the Energy Department
prematurely focused their espionage investigation on Los Alamos and
the scientist, Wen Ho Lee. But the government's counterintelligence
experts had concerns about security and counterintelligence
procedures at the laboratories long before the latest case.
</P>
<P>
   Entrenched bureaucratic interests at the laboratories, the
Energy Department and elsewhere in the government have prevented
serious changes in the past, a presidential review board found in a
study this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage case, however, has given laboratory security
prominence, and legislation intended to restructure the
government's nuclear weapons programs is now moving quickly through
Congress. The House passed legislation last week to create a new,
semiautonomous agency within the Energy Department to run the
laboratories and weapons programs, and the Senate is expected to
vote on the measure this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson has said he will most likely recommend to
President Clinton that he veto the proposal, arguing that it would
blur the lines of authority and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security at Los Alamos has been a particularly sore
topic, since officials say that Lee transferred huge computer files
containing nuclear secrets from the laboratory's classified
computer system into an unsecure system. Lee has said that he
transferred the codes as a routine part of his job, but the Justice
Department is now considering prosecuting Lee for mishandling
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   The new review, by 25 security experts from the Energy
Department's Office of Independent Oversight, found that
cybersecurity at Los Alamos had improved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that experts were unable to break into the
laboratory's classified computer network used for nuclear weapon
design.
</P>
<P>
   The review team's hackers, working remotely over the Internet,
also failed to break into the unclassified system at Los Alamos,
but did succeed in penetrating the unclassified networks at
Lawrence Livermore and Sandia. That enabled them to tap into
``sensitive'' information, like personnel files, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Alamos, the review team was able to penetrate the
unclassified system only while they were actually at the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   After the investigators uncovered evidence of Lee's unauthorized
transfers of computer codes in the spring, Richardson ordered a
shutdown of the classified computer systems at the weapons
laboratories and mandatory security training for employees. Now,
procedures are being put in place to prevent classified data at Los
Alamos from being moved into the unsecure system from the
classified system.

 &HT;    Families awaiting word on relatives
 &HT;    By Travis Fain
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Questions from family and friends continued
to flow into city and county emergency operators Monday as rescues
continued throughout flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the queries came from out of state as family members
unable to make contact with evacuees searched for information that,
in many cases, was difficult to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are in shelters that we just can't put
our hands on,'' Pitt County Schools spokesman Barry Gaskins said.
</P>
<P>
   County officials were working Monday to compile an exhaustive
list of the almost 2,000 people in official shelters around the
county, Gaskins said. But many people are in ``ad hoc'' shelters
not being operated by the county, making it hard to track down
relatives who have generated a stack of missing persons reports,
sheriff's department Chief of Community Patrols Rick Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just can't make contact (with family members) ...
sometimes we know that they're at a shelter, sometimes we don't,''
Fisher said. ``A lot of these folks are in churches and homes
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed death count in the county remained at two Monday,
the two Hispanic men found dead after flood waters swept them away
near Grimesland on Friday, Fisher said. Their names have not been
released pending notification of the families.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville police have scaled back their search for a man swept
off an N.C. 33 bridge on Wednesday night. That investigation is
continuing, but dive teams have stopped searching the area,
according to Capt. K.M. Smeltzer of the Greenville Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue calls for the county had slowed Monday, but were still
heavy enough that rescue personnel, sheriff's deputies, National
Guardsmen and volunteers continued to throw available resources
into efforts, especially north of the Tar River. That area has been
cut off from Greenville except by air, Gaskins said. Rescuers
continued to use an unknown but large number of boats, Jet Skis,
hovercraft and helicopters in the search, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are locating people reported missing as fast as they
can, but evacuation of flooded areas remained the focus of
emergency operations Monday, Gaskins said.
</P>
<P>
   People can try to locate family members in shelters by calling
Red Cross hotlines at (252) 355-0532, (252) 355-0280, (252)
355-0344, (252) 355-1055, (252) 355-0794 or (252) 355-1620.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Greenville, rescue requests had stopped coming
into the emergency center Monday afternoon, but officials continued
to monitor water levels and draft plans to renew rescue operations
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers and public employees alike have worked a lot of long
hours since Hurricane Floyd hit Thursday morning, Gaskins said.
More help is coming as national Red Cross and Federal Emergency
Management Agency support were expected to kick in by today.
</P>
<P>
   Already, volunteers from rescue departments across the state
have come to Pitt County and other points in eastern North Carolina
to help.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, a string of about six rescue vehicles sat along
Fifth Street in front of city hall, mobilizing for an operation.
Crews stood preparing equipment and waiting for orders from state
emergency management, not knowing where they'd be that night, or
where they would go tomorrow. That type of uncertainty is typical
of rescue operations that mobilize so many people, rescuers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just wait and see on each one,'' said Larry Pierson, a
volunteer fireman from the Asheville area. ``And adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   The crews spend their days, and most of their nights, in boats,
keeping to drainage ditches to avoid unseen mailboxes or anything
else that might be underwater, Pierson said. They sleep a few hours
each morning wherever they can. For Mike Soule, a 22-year-old
Asheville-area rescuer, that once meant on an airport runway
outside of Kinston.
</P>
<P>
   Their own homes are safe and dry, but Pierson said they couldn't
watch Floyd's disaster on television and not help.
</P>
<P>
   ``And our time will come,'' he said. ``It's a state-wide scratch
your back.''
</P>
<P>
   Flooded homes, ruined photographs and other irreplaceables are
the worst Pierson and his colleagues have seen during their
operations, he said
</P>
<P>
   But the material losses from Hurricane Floyd pale in comparison
to the pain of parents separated from their children.
</P>
<P>
   Larrie Ward's husband took their children back into Belvoir as
waters continued to rise on Friday, she said. That's the last she
heard of them because the phones are out. When she tried to go
looking for them, authorities had closed area roads, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm blaming myself, because I never should have let them go
back,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ward has asked at shelters, called police and talked
to neighbors, looking anywhere she can for word of Brandon, 14, or
Samantha, 8. No one knows where they are and no one can tell her
how high the water is at her husband's home, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trusting in the Lord,'' Ward said. ``And thinking that
they're fine. I'm trying not to think of the worst, but it keeps
popping into my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's mobile home is under water and when, _ if _ the rest of
her family is found, they'll have nowhere to go, she said. But
that's less of a concern right now, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just devastated,'' Ward said. ``It's just like I'm in a
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Child knows the same helpless feeling. Her 18-year-old son,
Aaron, has been missing since Thursday at 2 p.m.. A Greenville
detective has been assigned to the case, Smeltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The last Tina Child heard, Aaron was at his brother Adam's
apartment, taking a nap. When Adam came home, his brother was gone
and his wallet and keys were left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be doing something real stupid right now, just hasn't
called,'' Child said. ``But that's not like him.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Aaron's East Carolina University roommates told Child he
thinks the freshman called on Friday, but that offered little
comfort and even less information, she said. She posted Aaron's
picture around campus and in student apartment complexes. Police
asked television stations to run pictures of missing people, but
they wouldn't, saying they've logged too many requests for that to
be feasible, Smeltzer said.

COMMENTARY: IS THIS AMERICA? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You are awakened by Immigration and Naturalization
Service agents knocking at your door. They tell you they are taking
you into detention _ prison _ to be held for deportation. You say:
``But I am an American citizen. I can't be deported.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years you keep making that claim of
citizenship. You want it to be decided by a federal judge, but they
make you go through an extended administrative process. You have no
right to a government-provided lawyer if you cannot afford your
own. And all this time you remain in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A fanciful scenario? Not at all. That is exactly what INS
lawyers say should happen to someone who is taken in for
deportation and claims to be a U.S. citizen. They take that
position in a case now going on in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Hawa Said, 21, was born in Yemen. Her parents were divorced, and
her mother left. When she was 1 year old, her father emigrated with
her to the United States _ to Anchorage, where he owns a
watch-repair shop. In 1996 he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.
Under U.S. law, because she was under 18 she automatically became a
citizen, too.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Ms. Said was convicted in the Alaska courts of a
cocaine offense. She was given a three-year sentence, all but 30
days suspended. This past May she reported to jail to serve the
time. Instead of being released at the end, she was taken into
custody by the INS as an ``aggravated felon.'' The 1996 immigration
law requires detention and deportation of such convicted aliens.
But Ms. Said said she was a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   An Anchorage lawyer, Margaret D. Stock, took on the case. She
sought the classic remedy for someone wrongly imprisoned: a writ of
habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge H. Russel Holland found last month that
Ms. Said had ``made out a prima facie case'' that she was indeed a
citizen. But then, at the urging of the INS, he changed his mind
and said she would have to make that claim in an administrative
deportation proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Said has now appeared before an immigration judge. If he
decides against her, she can go to the Board of Immigration
Appeals. The next move is to the U.S. Court of Appeals. But if it
found facts in dispute, which it likely would, it would have to
send the case down to a U.S. district court for fact-finding. Then
it would go back up to the Court of Appeals. While all that goes on
_ three years is a minimum, probably understated _ Ms. Said would
remain in prison.
</P>
<P>
   That tormenting process flies in the face of a notable Supreme
Court decision, the 1922 case of Ng Fung Ho vs. White. A person of
Chinese origin, held for deportation, claimed to be a U.S. citizen.
The government said the question should be decided
administratively. The court held that it must be a decision for the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Louis D. Brandeis, writing for a unanimous court, said
the Constitution entitled the claimant to a judicial decision, on
habeas corpus, of his citizenship. To deport someone who may be a
citizen, he said, may deprive him ``of all that makes life worth
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Congress, in the 1996 immigration law, sweep aside that
constitutional decision? Did it really mean to do so?
</P>
<P>
   The case raises troubling issues of government power. But there
are also human issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Said is seven months pregnant. After taking her into
custody, the INS sent her to a facility in San Diego, 2,427 miles
away from her home and family; it brought her back only when
ordered to by Judge Holland. She is held in a state prison with
Alaskan criminals. She knows no one in Yemen and speaks no Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Hawa Said is an extreme example, but not the only
one, of what must be an INS mind-set. I always ask myself why
immigration agents _ and INS lawyers _ feel they must grind their
targets down so inflexibly, so mercilessly. The new Immigration
Act, harsh as it is, does not require that level of inhumanity.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner of immigration, Doris Meissner, is a humane
person. So is her boss, Attorney General Janet Reno. But somehow
they seem unwilling, or unable, to infuse the immigration service
with the quality of mercy, not to mention respect for the
Constitution.

WASHINGTON LOBBYING FIRM, PR GIANT SEEN NEAR MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cassidy &AMP; Associates, the lobbying firm that has
raked in millions in federal funds for Boston University and served
as a revolving door for influential political figures, is on the
verge of merging with a New York public relations giant to form one
of the largest unions on Capitol Hill, sources familiar with the
negotiation said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would combine the Cassidy Cos., an umbrella
organization that includes three separate service branches, with
Shandwick International, a public relations firm with offices in 54
countries. Two sources familiar with the talks said Cassidy would
sell for $70 to $80 million, and the merger could take effect as
soon as Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both companies would confirm only that negotiations
are under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to them. We're in negotiations. But there's no
final agreement,'' said Paul Costello, the Shandwick managing
director for national media.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy spokesman Dale Leibach said ``discussions are ongoing''
about the merger. ``But we don't have an agreement at this point,
and there is no guarantee that there will be an agreement,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources on both sides of the deal, however, said it could happen
in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said the impact of the arrangement should not
be underestimated. Like many recent mergers, a Cassidy-Shandwick
alliance could give both companies an instant boost in resources _
and would allow the conglomerate to provide ``one-stop shopping''
to clients who seek political and public relations advice all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of coordinated service makes a great deal of sense
for clients,'' said Nancy Sterling, vice president of public
relations for ML Strategies, which provides a similar service as
the consulting affiliate of the Boston law firm Mintz, Levin.
``They will be a significant lobbying and PR force, certainly
well-known on Capitol Hill. And they're going to have the backing
of Shandwick and the Interpublic Group.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interpublic Group is the international advertising and PR
holding company that owns Shandwick. Locally, Interpublic owns
advertising agencies Hill Holliday Connor Cosmopulos in Boston and
Mullen in Wenham, and the public relations firm Weber Public
Relations Worldwide in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Cassidy, a former congressional staffer who founded his
company in 1975 and turned it into a political powerhouse with
advisers from both parties, will remain CEO and chairman of the
Cassidy service units he now owns, a source said. The Cassidy
divisions would be folded into the Washington office of Shandwick
Public Affairs, but remain a distinct entity within the larger
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the Cassidy firms _ the public relations firm Powell
Tate _ might be fully merged with Shandwick, a source from each
company said, because it performs the same service as the New York
company.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy would receive about 20 percent of the profit from the
merger _ roughly the equivalent to his current stake in the holding
company that controls the Cassidy Cos., a source said. That company
is expected to earn approximately $45 million in revenue this year.
It currently has a staff of about 200, among them Jody Powell, who
once worked for Democratic President Jimmy Carter, Sheila Tate, who
worked for Republican President Ronald Reagan, and Barbara Sutton
and Jim Rowan, who worked for former Speaker of the House Tip
O'Neill, a Massachusetts Democrat. Powell is expected to be put in
charge of the Washington public relations part of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The client list is equally impressive. Besides Boston
University, Boston College, and Tufts University, Cassidy and
Associates has lobbied for Boeing, Delta Airlines, General
Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Ocean Spray Cranberries within the
past two years.

CONSERVATIVES HIT MCCAIN STANCE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ A group of conservative Washington lobbyists
touched down in New Hampshire Monday to denounce presidential
candidate John McCain's quest for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington group, which included Grover Norquist of
Americans for Tax Reform, Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president
of the National Rifle Association, David Keene, chairman of the
American Conservative Union, and Carol Tobias, political director
of the National Right to Life Committee, staged a news conference
at the Legislative Office Building to air their views.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist called the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill
a ``threat to the first amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(McCain's) persistent sponsorship of legislation that would
stifle political speech in the name of reform is wrong, dangerous,
and, I believe unconstitutional,'' said Keene.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington group was met by protesters from groups
advocating campaign finance reform, holding signs that said ``New
Hampshire voters won't be silenced by big money'' and ``No more fat
cats.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, an Arizona senator, puts campaign finance reform high on
his political agenda. He has called the current system ``an
elaborate influence-peddling scheme'' and slammed those, even in
his own party, who defend it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not in New Hampshire Monday, but at a later press
conference his state supporters defended the senator's crusade to
rid politics of the often covert influence of big money.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Spaulding, a New Hampshire executive counselor and state
chairman of McCain's campaign, denounced the Washington lobbyists
for coming to New Hampshire to ``discredit campaign finance reform,
and to protect their six and seven-digit salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not here to attack John McCain for opposing the
common-sense pro-family positions that these organizations stand
for. John McCain has been their ally day in and day out for
common-sense conservative reforms and pro-family values they
profess to support,'' Spaulding said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sponsored in the Senate the McCain-Feingold bill, which
has been scaled down since its original introduction.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive bill, the Shays-Meehan bill, has passed the
House of Representatives and will be considered next month by the
Senate, where Republicans have filibustered campaign finance reform
efforts in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The groups appearing oppose both measures, but focused their
wrath on McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills seek to ban unlimited ``soft money'' contributions to
political parties. ``Soft money'' is the term for unlimited,
unregulated contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The bills do not change the regulations on individual citizens'
donations to candidates' campaigns, which are already limited.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill was introduced in the Senate earlier
this year, but no longer includes limits on issue advertising
within 60 days of an election -- one provision McCain's critics
attacked, saying it could be put back into a bill in conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the `McCain Lite' version of the bill,
introduced this week, is simply a vehicle for amendments that
contain the speech-suppressive provisions...'' Tobias said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that if the ban on soft money is passed,
we're next.''
</P>
<P>
   These critics of the measure charge that it curtails freedom of
speech by preventing groups like the National Rifle Association and
National Right to Life from running ``issues'' advertisements
during the final stages of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents -- such as Rep. Martin T. Meehan of Massachusetts who
sponsored the Shays-Meehan bill -- say that is simply not true.
They say the bill does not ban such advertising, it just forces
groups running such ads to disclose who paid for them. Currently,
they are not required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre said the NRA would fight such a law in court if it were
to pass.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters said Monday's criticism will only help their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I'd like to mention that, contrary to some rumors, we
did not pay the plane fare for our predecessors up here this
afternoon,'' Spaulding joked. ``But we are prepared to pay their
bus fare anytime they want to come back...their performance today
was probably one of the best arguments we could have for campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   While the average New Hampshire voter may not be well-versed in
the intricacies of the campaign finance reform debate, the issue
could play well here. Polls indicate that a majority of New
Hampshire voters want to reform the way elections are funded.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Raisa Maximovna Gorbachev, who broke Kremlin tradition
by sharing the spotlight with her husband, the former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, and did so with bold self-assurance
and flair, died Monday in Muenster, Germany. She was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, aides to Gorbachev said. She had been
under treatment in University Hospital in Muenster since late July.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Communist Party in
1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the Soviet Union's
calcified politics and economy. But it was Raisa Gorbachev who,
both at home and abroad, soon came to embody the changes to come.
She emerged as a first lady who had her own mind, her own style and
according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after
one of her foreign trips, her own American Express card.
</P>
<P>
   None of this endeared her to the Soviet public, who began to
grumble early in her husband's tenure that she was too pushy, too
flashy and too influential. Her appearances on foreign trips and
her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many Russian
kitchens over whether the proper place for Kremlin wives was _ as
it had always been _ at home, or at least in the background.
</P>
<P>
   But since early September, when Russians first learned that
their former first lady had been hospitalized in Germany with an
advanced and rare case of leukemia, sentiments toward her in Russia
began to shift. Favorable articles began to appear in the press,
and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the
hospital in Muenster, where her husband kept a faithful vigil that
touched many Russian hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be in the Russian character _ to run somebody into the
mud, and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes,''
said Vladimir Polyakov, a Gorbachev spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, Gorbachev's bitter rival in the early
1990s, sent a message of condolence Monday, and in a statement, he
said, that a ``wonderful person, a beautiful woman, a loving wife
and mother is no longer with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, published in 1996, Gorbachev acknowledged
that the resentment over his wife's high profile surfaced in
letters written to the Communist Party's Central Committee. ``Who
does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?'' he quoted one
as saying. ``The simplest answer would have been: `No, she is my
wife.'''
</P>
<P>
   She first became known in the West in 1984 when she accompanied
her husband, then a ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, to
Britain, where they were received by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. Diplomats and reporters, scanning the couple for clues
about the next generation of Soviet leaders, quickly focused up on
her wardrobe _ in particular her gold lame sandals with chain
straps, a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other Kremlin wives.
On a later trip to France, the French press labeled her clothes
``elegant, but not chic.''
</P>
<P>
   On her foreign travels, she also became known for a haughty
conversational style that bordered on the pedantic. During the 1986
summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, she needled her tour guides
with persistent questioning, adding didactic commentary of her own.
Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, she irked
Nancy Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to
socialism, reportedly prompting the American president's wife to
quip, ``Who does that dame think she is?''
</P>
<P>
   As she became more comfortable in her role as the Soviet first
lady, she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued. On a
visit to Washington in 1990, she established more friendly
relations with Barbara Bush, from whom she got a recipe for
blueberry pie.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Siberian city of Rubtsovsk, Raisa Titarenko grew up
as the daughter of a railway engineer. She graduated from school
with a gold medal _ top honors in the Soviet system _ and went on
to the prestigious University of Moscow. She was studying
philosophy there when she met Gorbachev, then a law student.
According to his book, he was smitten, but she was aloof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first meeting had not impressed Raisa at all,'' he wrote.
``She seemed calm and indifferent _ judging by the look in her
eyes.'' Not much later, at an impromptu party staged by Gorbachev's
roommates for Raisa and her friends, ``I wanted to impress her,''
he wrote, but ``I think I made a terrible fool of myself. She was
reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intense courtship, the two penniless students were
married in 1953, the year of Stalin's death. They had one daughter,
Irina, born in 1956, who survives her along with Gorbachev and two
granddaughters, Xenia and Anastasia.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple completed their college work in 1955, the
family returned to Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern
Russia. There Mrs. Gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation,
entitled ``The Emergence of New Characteristics in the Daily Life
of Collective Farm Peasantry,'' based on an unusual amount of field
research, which was accepted by the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When her husband, then first party secretary in Stavropol, was
promoted to Moscow as a Central Committee secretary in charge of
agriculture, she returned to academics, taking a job as lecturer in
philosophy at Moscow University, a position which she gave up when
he became general secretary of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   As the wife of the Soviet leader, she was enlisted as a board
member of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, headed by Dmitri S.
Likhachevcq, one of Russia's most distinguished academicians, which
was created to promote the arts and to restore the country's
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In this role, she became one of her husband's conduits to the
Russian intelligentsia, which was then rallying to his call for
more ``glasnost,'' or openness. As Soviet censorship eased, the
Soviet people rushed to rediscover books and parts of their own
history that had been buried under a rigid Communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gorbachev's most traumatic moments came during the August
1991 coup, when the Gorbachevs were held hostage at a seaside villa
in the Crimea while a group of Communist hard-liners tried to seize
control in Moscow. The coup failed, and Gorbachev and his family
returned to Moscow, visibly shaken. ``Raisa Maximovna took it very
hard,'' said Gorbachev at a news conference after their return to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Raisa Gorbachev published a book of reminiscences,
entitled in English, ``I Hope,'' which she decided to write after a
visit with Mrs. Bush in 1990 to Wellesley College where, she said,
``the girls showered me with questions.'' Reviewers found the book
self-serving in parts but also informative about the couple's
intellectual journey as, together, they came to realize the flaws
in the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   In her last years, Mrs. Gorbachev started a club that drew
together a dozen well-known and high-powered Russian women for
conferences, charitable projects and informal debates. She
described the group as an attempt to promote a civil society in
Russia. Against her wishes, the club became known as the Raisa
Maximovna Club.
</P>
<P>
   Lyudmila Telen, a deputy editor at the newspaper Moscow News and
a member of the club, said her impressions of Mrs. Gorbachev
changed as she got to know her better. ``She set herself very high
goals _ she felt she had to improve herself,'' said Ms. Telen.
``Going from wife of a provincial first secretary to first lady was
a big jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to represent the country in a new way. She
understood that what Mikhail Sergeyevich was doing was a
revolution, but she had many complexes, too _ a natural reserve and
a Soviet way of behavior that she tried to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Telen said Mrs. Gorbachev was well aware of the resentment
against her felt by many Russians. But she herself was never
bitter. ``She realized that people had been used to different
women, different traditions, different leaders,'' said Ms. Telen.
``She understood it. It hurt her of course, but I never heard her
be mean or bitter about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a couple, the Gorbachevs shared interests in philosophy and
literature, theater and politics. Gorbachev on several occasions
acknowledged that he often turned to his wife for advice. In his
book, he recalled how the two would have their most serious
discussions in the garden of their government-provided apartment,
beyond the earshot of KGB eavesdropping devices.
</P>
<P>
   Their close relationship was the envy of their friends. At a
dinner in Paris in the fall of 1985, her host said she confided:
``I am very lucky with Mikhail. We are really friends, or if you
prefer, we have great complicity.''
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, when
Yeltsin took over Gorbachev's office in the Kremlin, he became a
political pariah in Russia, widely blamed for ushering in reforms
that led to a decade of political and economic instability.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous run for the presidency in 1996, he maintained
a low profile at home, while Mrs. Gorbachev, who accompanied him on
the international lecture circuit, became practically invisible
until her recent illness.
</P>
<P>
   With a diagnosis of acute leukemia, Mrs. Gorbachev was rushed to
the hospital in Muenster, Germany on July 25. News of her
hospitalization became public only in early August.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian news reports, Gorbachev remained at her
side day and night. ``Dear God,'' the former Soviet president,
visibly exhausted, told a Russian television reporter on Aug. 9,
``for her to undergo such a drama these two days before my very
eyes.''

STUDENTS AT SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET FROM SHOOTING TRY TO GET BACK
TO NORMAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MARTHA DELLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Most of the students displaced from Bruce
Shulkey Elementary School last week were anxious to get back to
their school on Monday, arriving early with protective parents,
grandparents or neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But the youngest children, sheltered from details of the
Wedgwood Baptist Church shooting across the street, feared that the
``bad man'' who killed seven people would return to harm them.
</P>
<P>
   Soothing those fears kept kindergarten teacher Barbara Peters
busy on Monday, the first day back for 640 students who stayed home
or went to other schools Thursday and Friday after Shulkey became a
police command post.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought the bad man was still alive and hiding at the
church because they saw his picture on TV,'' she said. ``Some
thought bombs were still here. Some even thought the dead people
were buried at the church memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters fielded her students' questions herself, although she
consulted with seven counselors and psychologists sent in to help
with more extreme fears.
</P>
<P>
   Older students were less fearful, said Principal Janet Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Like Peters, many teachers corrected misinformation, and assured
the students that an early morning sweep by bomb-sniffing dogs
showed their school free of bombs, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 30 students saw counselors, including about 20
Bosnian students who were counseled as a group because school staff
feared that their prior experiences might make the shooting more
traumatic for them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shulkey students are among several hundred counseled by school
district counselors and psychologists since the shooting, most at
schools where students were most affected by the shooting, said
Leslie James, director of special services.
</P>
<P>
   But most Shulkey students were glad to be back with their
friends. Classes followed the normal routine, just as their parents
hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Norvelle said her daughter, Annie, was confused about why
Shulkey was closed but was glad to be returning to her own
second-grade classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went to work with me on Thursday,'' Norvelle said. ``Then
she found out her friends were going to Westcreek and I let her go
there. It was a big adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think children need consistency. She needs to be back at
her own school.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-grade teacher Michelle Windsor said none of her students
seemed upset, including one girl who was in the church during the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of my students at the candlelight vigils. I think
that helped them,'' Windsor said. ``Their parents did a good job
explaining it to them, but most of them wanted to see their
friends. That's the best medicine now.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Sobczak, whose family knew one of the shooting victims,
agreed. She said her daughter Kathleen, a second grader, was a
little nervous but that her son Brendon missed his fourth-grade
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were out of school two days, they saw everybody else
going about their normal lives,'' she said. ``I think it's good to
get them back into their routine and give them back the security
they had before.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Stephanie Gaworski organized an impromptu
picnic at LeBlanc Park last Friday for her second- and fourth-grade
children and other Shulkey students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids needed to know that their friends were OK and the
school was OK,'' she said. ``My kids were not apprehensive about
coming back. They feel safe and loved here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the feeling Walker and her staff were trying to impart
when they stood on corners outside the school early on Monday,
greeting parents, helping children out of cars and ushering them to
crossing guards and into the school.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for parents such as Jeannie Johnson, whose
8-year-old daughter, Destiny, was inside the church and knew Sydney
Browning, the slain children's choir director.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's scared to go anywhere outside,'' Johnson said. ``They
had a counselor at church but she didn't open up. She keeps saying,
`Mommy, don't leave me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But even those children did fine once they got inside their
school, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were very few tears,'' Walker said. ``They were mostly
fidgety. The kids wanted to come back. Once they got inside, things
were pretty normal. We hope it will be even more so tomorrow.''

 &HT;    State of emergency in place, Florida waits for Harvey's deluge
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Forget soccer practice today and keep
those yellow rain slickers handy. Never mind the umbrellas, it'll
be too windy.
</P>
<P>
   A week after Category 4 Hurricane Floyd threatened, much weaker
Tropical Storm Harvey is expected to bluster across central Florida
from the Gulf of Mexico, sloshing the county with 2 to 4 inches of
rain by tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The county was included in a tropical storm watch that included
all of Florida's east coast from south Miami-Dade County to Daytona
Beach, including Lake Okeechobee. Palm Beach County was included
because Harvey's tropical storm-force winds extend 150 miles on the
southeast side, putting the county on the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Lucie County, schools will be closed, but county and city
offices will be open.
</P>
<P>
   On the west coast, a hurricane watch is in effect from the
Suwannee River south to Bonita Beach and a tropical storm warning
from the Suwanee to east Cape Sable. Forecasters didn't expect
Harvey's winds to meet the 74 mph threshold for hurricane status,
but they declared the watch anyway as a precaution. They warned of
up to 10 inches of rain in the storm's path and low-lying areas
were voluntarily evacuated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said Harvey could produce storm surge flooding of 3
to 6 feet above normal, up to 8 feet above normal at the heads of
bays on the west coast. They also advised that rains from the storm
could ease dry conditions in much of Florida as it sloshes across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency in most of the state
except the Panhandle, thereby putting National Guard troops on
standby.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise ship with 1,701 passengers and crew labored in 12-foot
swells 100 miles southwest of Tampa. A tug boat was sent to pull
the liner Tropicale southwest, then swing around behind the storm
and follow it into port in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters warned that Harvey could spin off tornadoes as it
moves inland. Monday night, a possible tornado was blamed for
blowing a roof off a house near Naples.
</P>
<P>
   But forecasters expect Harvey to be more wet than windy in South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be sufficient to cause some street flooding, that's
something we're all familiar with in South Florida,'' said National
Weather Service meteorologist Bob Pifer. The county also is under a
flood warning. The weather service is predicting southwest winds of
at least 20-25 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   A rather disorganized Harvey, which formed Sunday in the gulf,
is expected to wash ashore near Tampa Bay at midday with 60 mph
winds and quickly move northeast across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers have been opening floodgates throughout the east
coast to prepare for any rain dropped by Harvey. Many canals were
already low because the district had drained them last week to
prepare for Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The district also is releasing water south from the sugar
farming region into the northern Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching and waiting,'' South Florida Water management
District spokeswoman Ann Overton said. The district's helicopters
are on standby to survey any damage.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Water Management District will take residents'
questions and complaints from 6 a.m. ``into the evening'' today at
(800) 544-2323, Overton said.
</P>
<P>
   The district can help residents figure out which of the region's
many drainage districts, local governments and homeowners'
associations control nearby floodgates, culverts and pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Florida Power &AMP; Light mobilized 700 workers from
Miami-Dade and Broward counties and dispatched them to the west
coast to join 500 others for help restore power as soon as Harvey's
winds subside to safer levels. FP&AMP;L urged customers who want to
report service problems to call (800) 468-8243.
</P>
<P>
   Once Harvey passes, a cold front will push south ``but it's
probably not going to make it to the southern part of the state,''
Pifer said. At best, it will bring drier air Thursday and Friday.
</P>

COMMENTARY: BUCHANAN'S LONGEST DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan's presidential candidacy is looking swell. Within
the last few days he's made friends with Lenora Fulani and gotten
into an argument about whether it was a good idea to go to war
against Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's new book on foreign policy got a devastating critique
from that well-known scholar of world history, Donald Trump. As we
all know, Buchanan is pretty close to announcing that he wants to
be the Reform Party's presidential nominee, and Trump is enjoying
the speculation that he might try for the nomination, too. The
realtor is not much of a political deep thinker, but he does
definitely know that he favored American participation in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Trump was apparently informed that Buchanan's book argues that
Hitler was not a threat to any vital American interests after 1940.
So the developer whipped off an indignant fax, in which he
misspelled ``Adolf.'' But no matter. Pat Buchanan, the master of
the red-meat quote, was left complaining on TV that his position
had been misinterpreted. Even in retreat, he didn't sound really
enthusiastic about our role in whipping the Nazis. (``Hitler
declared war on the United States. We had no alternative but to
fight him.'').
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buchanan appeared to be heading toward an astonishing
detente with Lenora Fulani, a leader in the New York Reform
(Independence) Party who was once an ally of Louis Farrakhan. More
recently, she was Harlem coordinator for Abe Hirschfeld, the
eccentric parking garage developer who was then the Republican
candidate for Manhattan Borough president. Hirschfeld is about to
go on trial for allegedly hiring a hit man to knock off his
business partner. All this goes to show Ms. Fulani's talent for
both ideological consistency and picking a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has been courting Ms. Fulani because she controls a
number of votes in the Reform Party. And Ms. Fulani, who once
withdrew her support from Al Sharpton because she felt he was
getting too mainstream, is sounding very enthusiastic about
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go from Al Sharpton to Pat Buchanan would make a dead
person suspicious,'' said Sharpton Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What in the world brought them together? Like Buchanan, Ms.
Fulani has been accused of anti-Semitism, although that doesn't
seem a really great basis for finding common ground. Ms. Fulani's
political roots are with the New Alliance Party, a now-defunct
organization that was founded by Fred Newman, a psychotherapist and
playwright. In 1985, according to the Anti-Defamation League,
Newman told a party convention that Jews were becoming ``the storm
troopers of decadent capitalism against people of color the world
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, Ms. Fulani and many of their old followers have now
migrated to the Reform Party, where they are valued for their
genius at getting people's names on the ballot. (This genius has
never translated into an actual victory in the polls. In my own
neighborhood in 1992, their candidate for Congress lost in a
landslide to a man who had died a week earlier.) Ms. Fulani says
they're building a non-ideological third party that is simply
focused on process issues, like term limits and campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thinking presumes that American voters are so
intent on cleaning up the system that they don't care whether the
finished product looks like Pat Buchanan's idea of utopia or Lenora
Fulani's. The Reform Party is full of folks like this, inhabitants
of the political fringes who make Jesse Ventura look like Woodrow
Wilson, united only by their frustration over their inability to
make themselves heard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fulani and Buchanan are angry on a higher plane _ not
because they can't get a hearing, but because they can't get
elected. Buchanan got plenty of attention when he ran for the
Republican presidential nomination, but his main achievement,
besides losing, was to scare moderate voters away from the party
altogether. Now the polls suggest that the vast majority of
Republican primary voters are planning to ignore him entirely. This
is driving Buchanan nuts, and sending him ricocheting into the arms
of the Reform Party and folks like Ms. Fulani. To tell the truth,
it does seem like the perfect place for him.

CHEVRON AND PHILLIPS SAID TO BE IN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS with LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chevron Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co. have discussed forming
a joint venture in the petrochemical business, people close to both
companies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The people also said that a merger of the two companies was not
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Times of London reported over the weekend that
Chevron was in talks to buy Phillips in a deal that would be worth
about $16.5 billion, or $65 a share. Shares of Phillips rose
$2.8125, to $56.5625, Monday on the New York Stock Exchange amid
speculation that the company would be bought.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said they had no comment on the report of merger
talks. But analysts and other experts said Monday that those oil
companies, like Chevron and Phillips, that did not find partners
despite a recent wave of mergers in the industry, were under less
pressure to snare a mate since the recent recovery in crude oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil has more than doubled since the end of
last year, with the benchmark West Texas Intermediate approaching
$25 a barrel in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of mergers last year was spurred in part by a sharp
decline in crude oil prices. Among the mergers, British Petroleum
Co. acquired Amoco Corp. and that combined company subsequently
agreed to buy Atlantic Richfield Co. Exxon Corp. also agreed to buy
Mobil Corp. in a deal that would create the world's largest oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Totalfina SA agreed to buy Elf Aquitaine SA for
$48 billion. And Chevron was also in talks earlier this year to
acquire Texaco Inc., but Texaco rejected the overture.
</P>
<P>
   ``With crude at $25 there is less impetus to merge,'' said Harry
Quarls, a senior vice president who oversees the energy group for
Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, the consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity also has been dampened by uncertainty over the
conditions that the Federal Trade Commission could impose before it
would approve the proposed merger of Exxon and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Quarls said that companies still felt pressure to
strengthen some of their businesses since the mergers had left
competitors better able to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he added, the petrochemical operations of both Chevron
and Phillips were under greater pressure since British Petroleum
and Amoco had begun to combine their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron's revenue last year from its chemical business totaled
$3 billion while Phillips' totaled $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petrochemicals are also in a downturn,'' Quarls added.
``There's pressure on Chevron and Phillips on the chemical side.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, the seventh-largest U.S. oil company, is also seeking
to sell its natural gas processing division before the end of the
year. But while some experts have suggested that Chevron would be a
likely buyer, people close to the companies said Chevron had not
shown significant interest.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, the fourth-largest oil company in the United States,
spun off its natural-gas processing operation in the fall of 1996
to Dynegy Inc. in return for a 25 percent equity stake. Chevron is
thus unlikely to seek to enter the business again.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Phillips' oil production is at the Ekofisk oilfield off
the coast of Norway. Phillips and its partners have had to spend
heavily, more than $2.5 billion since 1995, to upgrade the oil
platforms and undersea pipelines at the field as the seabed has
sunk with the oil's removal. Phillips is the operator of the field
and has a 37 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there may be an incentive for Chevron to take a
more serious overall look at Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   John Hervey, an oil analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
said that Phillips was a large natural-gas producer in the United
States and that with strong demand and the downturn in drilling,
which was replacing reserves at a slower rate, natural gas prices
had been rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevron has a good view on natural gas,'' and has been seeking
to build up that part of its business, he added. He said the two
companies were a good fit if they agreed to combine operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would gain critical mass in the petrochemical division,''
he added. ``These companies should be talking. They go together
very well.''

ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY INVESTIGATION LOOKING AT PEOPLE CLOSE
TO YELTSIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal investigation of money laundering at
the Bank of New York is examining transactions with the bank by
people close to President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, according to
Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has found transactions involving Pavel Borodin, the
powerful head of Yeltsin's property management team, and Leonid
Dyachenko, the husband of Yeltsin's younger daughter, Tatyana, an
influential political adviser to her father, senior Clinton
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One government official described the information that the FBI
had as ``credible'' but he declined to discuss it further because
the investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Yakushkin, the spokesman for Yeltsin, has previously
asserted that neither Yeltsin nor any members of the immediate
Yeltsin family has a foreign bank account. However, he said Monday
that that statement applied to Yeltsin and his two daughters. It
does not apply, he said, to their husbands: Dyachenko or Valery
Okulov, a senior executive at Aeroflot, the Russian national
airline, who is married to Yelena Okulova, the elder Yeltsin
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Swiss prosecutor who has been investigating
corruption involving Russian officials said that money from
Borodin's accounts in Switzerland had been transferred to accounts
at American banks that are under federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to name the banks or the accounts. The entities that
have figured most prominently in the investigation in the United
States are the Bank of New York and a company called Benex, which
was related to several accounts at the bank in which billions of
dollars were funneled from Russia to other foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Yeltsin's son-in-law, federal authorities would
not say whether he had an account at the Bank of New York or
whether he had channeled money through the Benex accounts there.
However, officials said the amounts of money moving through the
Bank of New York by both men were ``substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials declined to discuss the nature of the evidence or
provide any details of the transactions. The Bank of New York
declined to comment on any specific accounts. American
investigators also say they have not determined the sources of the
funds moving through the bank nor their ultimate destination _
factors that have complicated the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has been the leading American bank in Moscow that
specialized in international services for Russian banks and
businesses. It was widely used to handle payments between Russian
companies and foreign suppliers and by individuals who wanted to
put money outside of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Many transactions could be legitimate and legal, but the bank
has been cooperating in a federal money laundering investigation
for a year. Neither the bank nor any individual has been formally
accused of any wrongdoing by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is safe to infer that it was parking and transfers,'' a
Clinton administration official said, referring to funds handled
for Borodin and Dyachenko by the bank. ``The investigation is
whether it was laundering.'' the official added, referring to a
series of banking transactions intended to hide the origin and
ultimate destination of money.
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin, the spokesman for Yeltsin, was asked on Saturday to
help arrange comment from Dyachenko. But Monday he said that
Dyachenko was traveling abroad on business and could not be
reached. Yakushkin said no other aides or family friends could
speak on Dyachenko's behalf. He also said he could not provide
telephone or fax numbers or a business address for Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and has dismissed
the allegations against him as politically motivated. In response
to whether he had an account at the Bank of New York, his spokesman
said, ``Mr. Borodin learned about the existence of the Bank of New
York from newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said that after the
bank transactions by Borodin and Dyachenko were discovered last
week, the Justice Department immediately alerted the National
Security Council that administration officials should no longer
say, as they have since the investigation surfaced, that there is
no evidence of official Russian involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This changes the whole tenor of things,'' an official said
about the evidence that Borodin and Dyachenko used the Bank of New
York. Until now, he said, there had been only suspicions, and
rumors, that Russian officials were involved. ``Now U.S.
investigators are saying it,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the matter as ``very sensitive'' and known to only a
few people in the Clinton administration, the officials spoke only
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty investigators will have in examining the banking
transactions are reflected in a message the American Embassy in
Moscow sent Washington earlier this month. The memo, which is
labeled ``sensitive'' and not for foreign distribution, outlines
the ``schemes'' used by Russians to get money out of the country.
The embassy notes that these have been used by people who merely
want money for travel or to help a relative abroad, by businesses
trying to avoid taxes by hiding their financial movements with
shell companies, and by criminal organizations laundering their

   The Russian government sent a delegation to meet with U.S. law
enforcement officials last week to discuss the Bank of New York
investigation. ``Fortunately, media reports of Russian money
laundering have not been confirmed,'' Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said Monday after a meeting with Yeltsin.

</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities have been investigating Mrs. Dyachenko, and
Borodin, on charges of money laundering and corruption. One
allegation is that Borodin and Mrs. Dyachenko received bribes from
Mabatex Project Engineering, a Swiss company based in Lugano that
performed extensive construction work on Yeltsin's residence and
other Kremlin properties.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts were awarded by Borodin's agency, which by his
estimate manages more than $600 million worth of property, palaces,
dachas, automobiles, aircraft, yachts, hospitals and spas. One of
the accusations against Borodin is that he his company provided
credit cards to Yeltsin and his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, in a phone conversation, President Clinton
asked Yeltsin about the credit cards and Yeltsin denied those
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dyachenko has not been as visible in Russian political circles
as his wife, Tatyana. They met while working at the Salyut Design
Bureau, which is part of the Russian space industry.
</P>
<P>
   His full first name is Leonid, but in the Yeltsin family he is
called Lyoshsa, which is also a diminutive for Alexsei.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Tatyana was appointed an official adviser to her
father, a Moscow newspaper asked her in an interview what her
husband did. She appeared uncertain before answering that it was
``something connected with wood processing,'' the newspaper,
Obshchaya Gazeta, reported.
</P>
<P>
   Dyachenko later joined a company, Interural, that exported
metals from the Urals. It was a joint venture with a Swiss partner.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the personnel section of Interural, Irina
Nikolayevna, confirmed in a telephone interview that Leonid
Yuriyevich Dyachenko worked for the company several years ago,
though everybody addressed him as Alexsei. She said she did not
know his current whereabouts.

   Chevron and Phillips Petroleum have discussed forming a joint

WHITMAN NAMES FBI SUPERVISOR TO TAKE OVER N.J. STATE POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman announced Monday that her
nominee to head the state police is Carson Dunbar, an FBI
supervisor in New York, who promised to strengthen the force's
recruitment and disciplinary procedures and change its culture so
that racial bias is no longer tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first steps, Dunbar said, would be to make the
Internal Affairs Bureau more accountable to the public and to
review incentive programs for drug seizures that may have
encouraged racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   In surprisingly introspective comments for a news conference,
Dunbar, who was a N.J. state trooper in the early '70s, said Monday
that he had accepted the nomination to be superintendent of the New
Jersey State Police because of his mixed racial background. One of
his parents was black, and one was white, he said, adding that he
wanted a chance to build on the civil rights advances he has
witnessed during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   He even revealed that several years ago, he was subjected to
racial profiling himself at a traffic stop by a New Jersey state
trooper.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Dunbar said he thought that the news media had
overstated the extent of the problem and assured officers that ``I
do not come with a chip on my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Dunbar's status as a former state trooper and his
extensive experience as a federal law enforcement administrator,
however, some civil rights leaders questioned Monday whether he had
the leadership skills and vision to lead a deeply divided agency
through a politically charged overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness to him, we'll have to wait and see whether he's a
strong superintendent,'' said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson,
director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey. ``But if
he's not a strong leader, we're going to end up in the same
situation two years from now that we're in now. Nothing this
administration has proposed will outlive the end of the governor's
term, and that is quickly drawing to a close.'' Whitman, who cannot
run for a third term, leaves office in January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate is expected to hold public hearings on Dunbar's
nomination next week, and legislators from both parties say that he
is likely to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   For Whitman, Dunbar's formal nomination ends seven months of
embarrassing fits and starts in an effort to address an issue that
has become the most persistent crisis of her five-and-a-half-year
tenure in office.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the governor fired the previous superintendent,
Col. Carl A. Williams, for making racially insensitive statements
in a newspaper interview. After years of insisting that the state
police did not engage in racial profiling, the governor made
history this spring when she became the first state official to
acknowledge that troopers discriminated against minority drivers
and harassed female and minority officers.
</P>
<P>
   But her attempt to replace Williams and enact change has been
fraught with miscalculations and political squabbles. The
governor's first choice for the top police job, a commander with
the Illinois State Police, withdrew from consideration after
encountering fierce resistance from state legislators who wanted
Whitman to choose someone from within the state police ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar's nomination was also stalled for months, as the governor
pressed Attorney General Janet Reno to approve an administrative
arrangement that would allow him to receive his full federal
pension.
</P>
<P>
   In naming Dunbar, the governor said she hoped his familiarity
with the protocol of the state police would allow him to enact
thorough reforms while being fair to the officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to be an advocate for the outstanding men and
women of the state police and someone who will ensure the
confidence in the public in the job that those men and women are
asked to do every day,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar seemed relieved that his wait for the nomination had
ended at last, and asked the news media and the public to be
patient as they measured his attempts to change the force.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in measured tones, Dunbar that his first priority would
be to bolster the department's internal affairs unit. That bureau
is now so autonomous that its commanders refuse to release any
information about discipline, even to citizens who file complaints
against officers.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar also said there were several other systemic changes he
would tackle, including recruitment and promotional policies, but
he cautioned that results might not come quickly. His job might
also be complicated if the U.S. Justice Departments Civil Rights
Division, which is now investigating the force, decides to appoint
an outside monitor.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complexity of the task ahead of him, Dunbar, said he
looked forward to returning to the force where he worked as a
trooper from 1973 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   As one of only a handful of minority troopers, Dunbar said he
had witnessed bias, but no real hostility, during his four years on
the force.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said, he was not surprised to read reports that
many black and female troopers have been victims of discrimination
and harassment from their white colleagues and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar rose quickly through the FBI, to his current position as
chief of administration in the bureau's New York office, but
co-workers and supervisors have given mixed reviews of his
performance. Lewis D. Schiliro, current head of the FBI's New York
office, said Dunbar was dedicated, experience and unfailingly
professional.
</P>
<P>
   But other FBI officials have criticized Dunbar's ill-fated
decision to end surveillance of a group of terrorists in 1992, six
months before they bombed the World Trade Center. One of those
critics, Oliver B. Revell, who was a deputy director of the FBI in
Washington during the early 1990s, said he had always viewed Dunbar
as a better administrator than an executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the governor, I would want him to work for me
because he's honest and hard-working,'' said Revell, who is now
retired. ``But leadership isn't his strong suit, so I wouldn't want
to hire him for the superintendent's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar calmly rebutted questions about his leadership and his
role in the World Trade center case during Monday's news
conference, saying that he was an independent thinker who wasn't
afraid to make a tough decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to come back and say, `Why didn't you do this?
Why did you do that?''' Dunbar said. ``It's a little bit more
difficult when you're making the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Dunbar's supporters argue that he will not have to
overhaul the force himself because the governor has already
appointed three members of the state attorney general's office, who
already have drawn up a detailed plan to improve the force.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But one brief exchange during the news conference suggested that
the racial politics of revamping the state police could make for
some tense moments. When the governor was asked whether Dunbar's
race was a factor in his nomination _ and she quickly responded
that he was chosen solely because of his professional
qualifications _ Dunbar jumped in before reporters could ask
another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question that you just asked is just what I talked about
before,'' he said. ``There is no place that I can go, no matter
what I accomplish, without somebody asking that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why couldn't I just be the best possible candidate?'' Dunbar
said. ``Every time something happens and a minority happens to be
the person, then why is it that that question has to be raised?''

CHURCH FILLS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SAY GOODBYE TO JOEY
ENNIS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Enough young people to fill a small high
school attended Joseph ``Joey'' Ennis' funeral on Monday, and each
one's eyes were filled with sorrow and questions.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 mourners _ mostly teen-agers _ flowed into First
Baptist Church of suburban White Settlement to say goodbye to the
14-year-old Brewer High School freshman. They didn't know what to
do with their hands, their eyes, their hair.
</P>
<P>
   They fidgeted in the presence of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say that somehow gives the answer to all the
questions?'' the Rev. Jim Gatliff, First Baptist pastor, asked the
standing-room-only crowd. ``Why did this happen? I can say simply:
I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ennis was one of seven victims killed Wednesday night when Larry
Gene Ashbrook walked into Wedgwood Baptist Church, where Ennis was
visiting, and sprayed bullets into the crowd of 150 youths.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Ennis' friends sat on the floors, stood in the
doorways, filled the sanctuary and several other rooms at First
Baptist. Many resorted to standing outside on the church steps.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis was too young to die, they whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Just four months ago, on May 25, 1999, Ennis wrote his mission
statement in life for a class assignment:
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission in life is to be kind and trustworthy with humor,
always keeping promises, especially as a friend, a son and a pet
owner. Don't let people get down in the dumps,'' Gatliff quoted
Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis had arrived early at First Baptist last Wednesday
afternoon. He wanted to play pool with his friends before going to
the youth rally at Wedgwood Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Hi, pastor,' '' Gatliff told the crowd. ``Little did
I know it would be the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Ennis, Donna Ennis' only child, loved playing basketball,
playing with his pet cats and spending ``family nights'' playing
board games at home.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin, 14-year-old Chris Belsher, had persuaded Ennis to
start going to the First Baptist youth group a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my cousin, my friend, and he felt like a brother,''
Belsher said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Belsher thanked the crowd for coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people of different race, religion and color,'' Belsher
said as his voice trailed into tears. ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ennis' casket was closed, a basketball signed by friends
was at his feet. A Chicago Bulls jersey signed by friends was over
his chest. And pictures signed by friends sat at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be missed!'' read one boy's T-shirt.

BATTLE WAGED IN THE SENATE OVER ROYALTIES BY OIL FIRMS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Oil companies drilling on federal land have been
accused of habitually underpaying royalties they owe the
government. Challenged in court, they have settled lawsuits,
agreeing to pay $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department wants to rectify the situation by making
the companies pay royalties based on the market price of the oil,
instead of on a lower price set by the oil companies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A simple issue? Not in the U.S. Senate. Instead, it has become a
textbook example of how Washington works. The battle over royalties
shows how a senator can use legislation to right a wrong, in the
view of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who is blocking the
Interior regulations. Or it shows how Congress does favors for
special interests, in the view of Mrs. Hutchison's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could come to a vote this week, and it appears as if
the Senate might side with the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hutchison, who has received $1.2 million in contributions
from oil companies in the last five years, has been winning the
battle to block the pricing regulations since the Interior
Department imposed them in 1995. The department estimates that oil
companies are saving about $5 million a month, money that would
otherwise be flowing to education, environmental programs and other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hutchison calls the regulations a breach of contract and an
unfair tax increase. She says she represents ``the overwhelming
majority of the Senate who want to do the right thing, who want
fair taxation of our oil and gas industry.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years, she has placed amendments and riders into annual
spending bills to keep the Interior Department regulations from
taking effect. To do otherwise, she argues, would be ``to let
unelected bureaucrats make decisions that will affect our
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hutchison's chief antagonist has been Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., who has condemned the underpaying of royalties as a
scheme intended to ``rob this Treasury of millions and millions of
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have a double standard just because an oil
company is powerful, just because an oil company can give millions
of dollars in contributions,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has never actually voted on Mrs. Hutchison's measure.
It has been inserted into must-pass spending bills that provide a
perfect vehicle for controversial measures that might attract
public notice if they were openly debated.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the Senate decided it would stop attaching
such riders to appropriations bills. Now the Hutchison amendment
has turned into a running battle on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department first proposed the regulations in
December 1995, nearly 10 years after the state of California first
began to suspect that energy companies were underpaying the
royalties they owed on oil pumped from federal and state land. The
royalty is 12.5 percent for onshore drilling and 16.67 percent for
offshore production.
</P>
<P>
   For the industry's giants, the royalties are a small fraction of
earnings. For the Exxon Corp., they represent about one-eighth of 1
percent of company revenues. According to Interior Department
figures, the new regulations would cost Exxon $8 million, an
additional one-hundredth of one percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The money goes to the Treasury, which sends it to environmental
and historic-preservation projects, and to 24 states, many of which
use the money on education.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of basing their royalties on the actual market price
of oil, the energy companies have been using a price they set that
has run as much as $4 a barrel less than the market price.
</P>
<P>
   According to the sworn testimony of a retired Atlantic Richfield
executive in a California lawsuit in July, the policy of his
company and others was to pay royalties based on a price ``at least
four or five dollars below what we accepted as the fair market
value.'' The retired executive, Harry Anderson, said his company's
senior executives had decided ``they would take the money, accrue
for the day of judgment, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony was first reported by Platt's Oilgram News, a
trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   This practice allowed 18 oil companies, including Shell, Exxon,
Chevron, Texaco and Mobil Oil, to avoid paying royalties of about
$66 million a year, according to Interior Department figures
published in the Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
   Sued by state governments, and now under investigation by the
Justice Department, most of the major oil companies have signed
settlements totaling about $5 billion with seven states.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hutchison says forcing the companies to pay royalties
based of the true market price of oil amounts to an unfair tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are breaking a contract and saying: `We are going to
raise your taxes,''' she argued on the Senate floor this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allow that to happen, who will be next?'' the senator
asked. ``Who is the next person who is going to have a contract and
have the price increased in the middle of the contract? Contract
rights are part of the basis of the rule of law in this country,
and we seem to blithely going over it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hutchison amendment comes to a vote _ and it might this
week _ it appears likely to pass, with support from almost all the
Senate's 55 Republicans and a few oil-state Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate lets the regulations take effect, says Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, who supports the amendment, the message will
be clear: ``We will be saying, `Go ahead. Raise royalties and
taxes. We, the U.S. Senate, yield our power.'''

   TARBORO, N.C. _ Of the 10,000 North Carolinians driven into
shelters by Hurricane Floyd, more than 2,000 have occupied a
teeming building here that until recently was Tarboro High School.
It is surrounded by lakes of stagnant brown water, but there is not
a drop for toilets, showers or washing clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the refugees come from the inundated town of
Princeville, a couple of miles east of Tarboro, where President
Clinton spoke Monday at the edge of the flooded downtown.
Princeville, the first village in the United States founded by
freed slaves, is a normally placid community of 2,000. It may also
have been the deadliest place to have lived in the storm that hit
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the shelter, people speak of relatives and friends who remain
missing, and of rumors of bodies afloat in the unappoachable waters
around Princeville.

Butts, had determined by late Monday were killed by the storm,
seven were in Edgecombe County, in or near Princeville, including
six who drowned in an overcrowded boat that was fleeing the Tar
River as it ravaged the village. No other county has had as many
deaths from the storm, Butts said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, beyond the lost lives, is the total if perhaps temporary
loss of the whole town of Princeville.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie L. Randolph, 25, lives high and dry in an apartment in
Tarboro with her four children. But most of her family was in
Princeville.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom lost her trailer,'' Ms. Randolph said. ``My sister lost
her house. My whole family lost everything. We lost our church.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Randolph knows about the people in the capsized boat. ``My
baby sitter's two nieces died,'' she said. ``They were 2 and 5.
They drowned. The water was coming so fast they fell off the rescue
boat.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a harrowing time for others in Princeville, many of whom
learned of the assault of the river past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son-in-law come knocking at the door,'' said Dolores
Sherrod, who escaped with her husband and two grandchildren and was
searching through mounds of donated clothes at the shelter. ``We
had to get out fast.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Princeville evacuees who were interviewed said they
had had time to collect anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in a mobile home there,'' Jimmie Hilliard, 47, a
custodian at the Tarboro courthouse who has a wife and five
children. ``It's under water. Totally gone. We lost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin White, 22, told of Turner Prince, Princeville's founder,
who built some of the houses that still stand there on Main Street.
Or that stood until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Freedom Hill in Princeville,'' White said. ``That's
where they escaped to. We were building a new boy's and girl's club
with a gym. All gone.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what might be left of Princeville. The police and
the Tar have blocked roads leading there, precluding any access or
even a view of the place. But from a small boat, Princeville was
Lake Princeville.
</P>
<P>
   Above the surface of the Tar, only rooftops, a church steeple
and the top floors of a few larger buildings were visible.
</P>
<P>
   A dog was stranded on a gas-station roof, another dog on the
roof of a house, a cat on a chimney.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Princeville, however, are hardly alone in the
totality of their loss. All across Edgecombe and neighboring
counties, the Tar has climbed so high _ 24 feet above flood stage _
that it has swallowed so much of some neighborhoods that nothing
can be seen of them without a boat.
</P>
<P>
   From the Bahamas to New England, 62 deaths connected to the
storm have been reported. But North Carolina was hit the hardest.
The eastern third of the state is flooded and state officials said
the storm may be North Carolina's costliest natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   While there were some encouraging reports Monday, of a receding
river or a restored power line, the news was mostly grim. Two to
three more inches of rain were expected as early as Monday night
from a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   First Sgt. Jeff Winstead of the state highway patrol said that
the Tar and Neuse Rivers were expected to remain at flood stage for
five more days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our major concern,'' Winstead said, ``is an increase in the
number of fatalities as the water recedes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lives have been disrupted in countless other ways. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency reported that 47,000 customers in North
Carolina remained without electricity, 56,000 without water and
33,500 without telephones. Most schools in the counties east of
Interstate 95 were closed indefinitely. So were more than 200
roads, including long stretches of Interstates 95 and 40.
</P>
<P>
   Disease was also a concern, with livestock carcasses rotting,
and sewage overflow, fuel, farm chemicals and manure fouling the
water.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard delivered drinking water to several counties
and two industrial-size incinerators were brought into Jones County
to burn the hundreds of thousands of dead animals.
</P>
<P>
   In Tarboro, Clinton tried to be encouraging, announcing loans
for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge you to keep your spirits up and know we're going to be
with you every step of the way,'' he told 500 people ``When things
like this happen to some of us, we know they could happen to all of
us. We know we have a responsibility as members of the American
family to help you get back on your feet again.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rocky Mount, which straddles Edgecombe and Nash Counties, Ben
Elliott stands at one end of Taylor Street. At the other, now
submerged end, his wife Marion and three grandchildren lived in a
$80,000 brick ranch house.
</P>
<P>
   ``That water just gushed down there,'' he said. ``Them that
didn't get out had to be rescued. The only thing that I got out was
the pair of pants I was wearing, a shirt and my shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   He has called FEMA for help and been assured that he would most
likely be given a low interest loan and other assistance for new
housing. He has to make an inventory of what he lost, however.
</P>
<P>
   To share in the exercise, Elliott suggested that his
granddaughter, Shannon, 8, who was standing with him in the mud at
the safe end of Taylor, to make her own inventory of lost property.
This is Shannon's list, as she compiled it on a yellow legal pad:
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbie skates, Barbie helmet and kneepads and elbo pads.
</P>
<P>
   NC State Barbie, Balerina Barbie, Florda Barbie and sweethart
Barbie and ther was a Barbie who had star sticking things that go
in her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Freestile bike.
</P>
<P>
   A dog.
</P>
<P>
   50 pairs of socks and underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Lots and lots of church dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of shirts and pants.
</P>
<P>
   A Barbie diary.''

KOSOVO LIBERATION ARMY YIELDS, AGREEING TO CIVILIAN ROLE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The Kosovo Liberation Army agreed on
Monday to disband and to be replaced by a civilian force, ending
two days of intense negotiations after NATO's supreme commander
flew in to help seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, intervening to break the
logjam, gave the guerrilla army a replacement force that is
nominally defensive, and only lightly armed. He flew in after the
NATO commander in Kosovo, Lt. Gen. Sir Mike Jackson, failed to
reach an agreement with the Albanian leaders during negotiations on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the guerrilla army will cease to exist and a new
civil emergency service will be formed in its place. The accord is
of vital importance to plans of NATO and the United Nations to
establish security and contain violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Clark spent the day in talks with the Kosovo Liberation Army's
chief-of-staff, Gen. Agim Ceku, and its political leader, Hashim
Thaci. All the army's field commanders were also gathered at the
NATO headquarters, perched on a hill overlooking the Kosovo
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The deal involved all the players in Kosovo. Thaci signed the
agreement to transform the Kosovo Liberation Army; Bernard
Kouchner, the all-powerful U.N. special representative in Kosovo,
granted legal status to the new corps, and appointed Ceku as its
provisional commander. Jackson, who will oversee the daily
operations of the new corps, signed a document laying out its
operational principles.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before, at 6 a.m., after a whole night of
negotiations, Jackson emerged from his headquarters looking tired
and somewhat frustrated. He laid the blame for the deadlock in
negotiations fully on Thaci and his commanders, and he warned of
the consequences of failing to reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Thaci and his commanders to accept the weapons
agreement ``is in danger of unsettling the future of the vast
majority'' of Kosovo Liberation Army members, he said. Ordinary
members were supposed to hand in their remaining weapons and cease
wearing uniforms and insignia by Sunday night, but Jackson extended
that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one reported incident in eastern Kosovo, where a
dozen soldiers in uniform were found outside their base after the
Sunday deadline and were escorted back, the Kosovo Liberation Army
appeared to have begun complying with the new rules, Maj. Roland
Lavoie, a spokesman for the allied force said.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, three issues were still under discussion: the
name of the future force, the selection of its members, and the
number of weapons allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army sees the new force as the core of a
future defense force or army, and wanted that recognized in the
name. NATO and U.N. negotiators have repeatedly stressed the
civilian aspect of the force, and wanted it to be called the Kosovo
Corps. The name ultimately chosen was the Kosovo Protection Force.
</P>
<P>
   Far more contentious was the issue of weapons. The new force is
to be allowed 200 sidearms, to be carried only by bodyguards and
guards of ``vital and key institutions,'' according to a press
release from the allied headquarters. According to Lavoie, the
Kosovo Liberation Army ``put on the table a number that would be
closer to 400.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark appeared to have persuaded the Kosovo Liberation Army to
back down on the weapons issue. It is not clear, however, if they
were granted the right to own personal weapons, which could
increase the total number of weapons carried by members of the new
corps.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, and in particular the United Nations, wary of the reaction
of Russia in the Security Council, insisted on strictly limiting
the number of weapons for the new force. The Kosovo Liberation Army
leadership is intent on retaining as many weapons as possible, as
it is intent on forming an army in the future to defend Kosovo and
ultimately achieve independence.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons issue seems to have blown up at the last minute when
regional commanders realized that the weapons allowed in their
regions would be under allied control, and inside allied bases and
not in their own bases.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a serious play for power within the organization
over the last weeks, and the formation of the Kosovo Protection
Corps will illustrate who will be influential in the future. Ceku
is to head the new force, Thaci announced on Monday, adding that
the decision was approved by the general headquarters and the
defense ministers of the interim government of Kosovo. It is not
clear, however, if Ceku, a Kosovo Albanian and a former general of
the Croatian army, will choose to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci took time out from the negotiations on Monday to announce
the formation of a new political party. He did not announce the
name of the party, still under discussion, but clearly launched it
as the political successor of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and the
rightful owner of its legacy as the forerunner in the struggle for
freedom and independence.
</P>
<P>
   The party, which, according to one diplomat, is tentatively
named the Progressive Party for the Renaissance of Kosovo, will
stand for a multiethnic society and respect for human rights, Thaci
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci has had to delay the formation of his party while he has
tried to keep key commanders on his side. As they contemplate their
future and their role in the Kosovo Protection Corps, the
commanders have grown more insistent in their demands. For Thaci,
the agreement on the new force, and in particular the weapons
issue, became a critical test.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat likened the game to musical chairs where, to stay
in the game, it is essential to grab a chair. Commanders were
maneuvering for positions of power, reduced to just six regions of
command in the new force. ``Tomorrow at midnight the music stops
and there are only six chairs,'' he said.

COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT SAYS U.S. WON'T BE DRAWN INTO STRIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Andres Pastrana of Colombia insisted
Monday that despite his government's request for a huge new
infusion of aid from abroad, the United States would not be drawn
more deeply into Colombia's 40-year fight against leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times of intervention are over,'' Pastrana said in an
address to the United Nations on the opening day of the General
Assembly. ``These are times of cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Pastrana sought to reassure Americans about the
Clinton administration's deepening commitment to Colombia, saying
military aid and training would be channeled mainly to special
units like army battalions being created to fight guerrillas who
support the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana indicated that his government had decided not to ask
the United States for sophisticated attack or transport
helicopters. Instead, he said, Colombia will seek American
authorization to buy such aircraft with its own funds.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia will seek U.S. aid to strengthen its radar capabilities
and refurbish or replace many of its air force jets as part of a
stepped-up effort to intercept planes involved in the drug trade
flying into and out of the country, Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, for the first time, Colombia has joined Peru in
trying to shoot such planes out of the sky in order to deter the
traffickers. American officials confirmed that the new policy took
effect last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Pastrana administration is seeking at least $3.5 billion in
international aid over the next three years to carry out a
wide-ranging strategy to deal with leftist and rightist insurgents,
a surging drug trade and a faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials hope that the brunt of that aid will come
from the United States, and they are using Pastrana's visit to New
York and Washington this week as a busy diplomatic sales tour that
will include meetings with President Clinton, congressional leaders
and others.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Colombian officials did not deny that their target
for American help is well above the $1.5 billion that Clinton
administration officials cited last week as the high end of what
they have considered providing to Colombia over the next three
years. The United States is giving Colombia $287 million in the
fiscal year that ends this month, according to State Department
figures.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Pastrana seemed to have no quarrel with the
notion, widespread in Washington, that his year-old government is
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a difficult year,'' he said wearily as he sat back
in an armchair in the midtown hotel suite where he is staying. In
the next room, a pile of Colombian newspapers announced darkly that
leftist guerrillas had decided once again to suspend their
participation in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana pointedly challenged the American perception that
the most serious new turn in Colombia's troubles is the growing
alliance between drug producers in the south and the leftist
guerrillas there who tax the producers' crops or protect their
laboratories and fields.
</P>
<P>
   While the guerrillas may be growing stronger and the traffickers
are recovering from serious blows in the mid-1990s, Pastrana said,
their violence is not as serious as it was a few years ago when
rival drug cartels were still fighting ruthlessly against each
other and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security issue was much more serious in Colombia at the
end of the '80s and the beginning of the '90s,'' he said. ``What is
happening now is that the security problem is becoming mixed up
with the economic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the government's debt burden at a critical level, commodity
prices falling and unemployment on the rise, Pastrana said, the
country simply cannot afford to fight its battles alone,
particularly those against powerful cocaine and heroin traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is ready to put up some cash, and we are putting it
up, but we need international aid,'' Pastrana said. ``This is a
partnership in which all of us must contribute _ the Americans, the
Colombians, the Europeans, the Asians.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the Pastrana administration hopes to get
at least $775 million in loans from international financial
institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund and that the total could rise to as much as $1.5 billion. But
despite talk of ``international cooperation,'' the officials said,
Colombia will turn to the United States for almost all of the
remainder.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While his aides said that about 55 percent of Colombia's
proposed aid would be spent to fight drug trafficking, the leftist
guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary groups, Pastrana also
sounded frustrated with the lack of emphasis in Washington on
social development, substituting other crops for drugs and trade
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we are looking at not just the police part
of this. We are looking at the economic part,'' he said. ``This is
what we have to make people aware of in the United States and
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Discussing details of his military aid request for the first
time, Pastrana said he would not ask the United States to provide
the Colombian army with advanced UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters to use
as troop transports, as American officials expected. Instead, he
said he would seek American authorization to purchase as many as 15
aircraft and arm at least some of them for use against the
guerrillas. Such arms generally include small machine guns and
rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   The shift _ which officials said would also involve using
smaller UH-1N helicopters to transport a new American-trained
antidrug army battalion _ would probably mean less American
scrutiny on the Colombian military's use of the helicopters as
gunships against the guerrillas. The Colombians had previously
considered buying Apache and Cobra attack helicopters, officials
said, but had been discouraged in part by the difficulty they were
likely to have in getting American authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana also indicated that he would seek to expand a program
under which the United States is soon to refurbish 10 of the
Colombian air force's fleet of 14 A-37 fighter jets, installing
radar in five of them. In a telephone interview from Bogota, the
air force commander, Gen. Hector Fabio Velazco, confirmed that
Colombian jets have shot down four drug planes since late last
year, while hitting 11 others and forcing down 10.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Colombian defense minister, Luis Fernando Ramirez, said that
as part of the plan, Colombia hopes to create as many as four of
the new counternarcotics battalions over the next three years in
addition to the first such unit, which is expected to begin
operations at the end of the year. He also said the Colombian
military hopes to double its contingent of 2,500 navy and army
troops now fighting drug traffickers and their guerrilla allies
along the country's rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they were generally
pleased with Pastrana's plan, which Colombian officials presented
to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last Thursday. But
administration officials are continuing to debate how they should
seek funding for the plan to keep congressional Republicans from
cutting other foreign aid programs.

DOCTOR HAD PRESCRIBED ANTI-DEPRESSANT FOR CHURCH SHOOTER
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Name Marjorie Poche carries an accent on the e)

By KATHY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ |A doctor had prescribed the anti-depressant
drug Prozac for Larry Gene Ashbrook, but investigators are unsure
whether he was taking it when he killed seven people and then
himself in a Fort Worth church last week, police said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's Lt. Mark Krey, who is heading the investigation
into the largest mass shooting in the city's history, said police
have found a Prozac vial in Ashbrook's name and want to ask doctors
why it was prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Krey said Ashbrook, 47, may have slipped past the brink of
sanity after his father died in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of paranoia within his life had advanced to an
extreme stage,'' he said. ``We're investigating the possibility
that with the death of his father, Mr. Ashbrook stopped taking
medication. We believe when he lost his father, who was his anchor
to reality and his caretaker to ensure he took his medication, he
lost any connection to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, police said a homemade pipe bomb exploded in
Wedgwood Baptist Church with enough velocity to send a piece of
shrapnel hurtling 80 feet before slicing through a wall and landing
in the hallway outside the sanctuary, Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than blasting out into a sanctuary where more than
150 worshippers were taking part in a youth service, shrapnel shot
toward the ceiling and then rained down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very blessed in the manner in which it detonated ... or
it would have caused serious bodily injury,'' Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said they found nine vials of prescription drugs
for Jack Ashbrook in the family home in suburban Forest Hill as
well as a diary in which the father documented his pill use, said
spokeswoman Marjorie Poche. It is unclear where the Prozac was
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing changed in the last couple of weeks of the diary.
It's only speculation, but (Larry Ashbrook) may have started taking
his father's medication,'' she said. ``Either that or he started
recording when his father took the pills. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The final three of his seven victims were laid to rest on
Monday, but Ashbrook's body remained unclaimed at the Tarrant
County Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Ashbrook, his brother, said the family is finalizing
funeral arrangements, but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there probably has been more said than there needs to
be, and a lot of it's untrue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't make any difference,'' he said. ``I think the
damage has already been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators classified information on Monday from nearly 70
depositions taken the night of the shooting, reinterviewed the
wounded and tried to trace Ashbrook's final, fatal steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigators are going though a number of depositions to
determine the exact sequence of events,'' said homicide Sgt. Dave
Loftis. ``We want to know, first of all, specifically what happened
and how everything went down that day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the search for the most asked questions _ what set Ashbrook
off and why did he choose Wedgwood _ may never pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any motive right now,'' Loftis said. ``I don't
know if we'll ever have an answer to those questions. If we can, we
certainly will get them. It's like any of those senseless acts of
violence, there aren't any answers. And can any motive explain it
and make sense of it?''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Ashbrook details a vast, unspecified conspiracy
against him by law enforcement. His brother described him to Wise
County sheriff's deputies as a paranoid schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   Krey said Ashbrook apparently was such a loner that few people
have been found to help explain his activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we won't find anybody because there is nobody to
find. And that is consistent with the mental illness he appeared to
be afflicted with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church, Ashbrook fired all six rounds from a
.380-caliber semiautomatic gun, then fired up to 50 more shots from
a Ruger 9mm semi-automatic pistol, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Six of his seven victims died from gunshot wounds to the head,
autopsy reports show. The seventh was fatally shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook shot himself with the 9mm, police said. He apparently
was alive in a back pew when paramedics rushed into the sanctuary,
but was pronounced dead a short time later, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook's victims were Christi Beckel, 14; Shawn Brown, 23;
Susan Kimberly Jones, 23; Cassandra F. Griffin, 14; Joseph ``Joey''
D. Ennis, 14; Sydney R. Browning, 36; and Justin M. Ray, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and a woman separately videotaped Ashbrook's rampage, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Forest Hill said Ashbrook also may have made a
futile effort to contaminate the city of Forest Hill's water
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put concrete in the commodes and, working for the city, I
wanted to make sure he didn't do something else,'' said Forest Hill
Public Works Director Michael Duehring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure he did not contaminate our water system.
I can't go any further than that and tell you what he did, but he
didn't do any damage.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials inspected plumbing in Ashbrook's home Thursday
after the concerns were voiced. They did not, Poche said, consider
it a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agent said it looked like he was just trying to mess up
the inside of the house,'' said agent Marjorie Poche. ``The agent
who was out there said he had ripped off the shower head and neck
and put one of those paper cones and a quart of motor oil to back
down into the pipes. He said it was stuck in there still.''

   MEXICO: EXTRADITION BY SWISS
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Switzerland have agreed to extradite to Mexico
the former chief executive of the holding company that owns
Aeromexico and Mexicana Airlines, Gerardo de Prevoisin. De
Prevoisin fled into exile in 1994 as the airlines he bought from
the government in 1988 careered toward bankruptcy, and he was later
charged with defrauding the companies of $57.8 million. He has said
he donated part of the money to President Ernesto Zedillo's 1994
election campaign.

   COLOMBIA: BISHOP FREED

<P>
   A left-wing guerrilla group that kidnapped a Roman Catholic
bishop more than a month ago has released the cleric, but is
demanding that the Vatican transfer him and another bishop in the
region to other dioceses. ``I will not go,'' was the response of
the kidnapped bishop, Msgr. Jose de Jesus Quintero, said by the
People's Liberation Army to favor right-wing paramilitary groups
that have recently become active in the area.

   Russia is placing two to three lines of troops along Dagestan's
border with Chechnya to halt new infiltration by Chechen rebels and
capture any rebels still in Dagestan, the first deputy chief of
Russia's general staff said. The deputy, Valery Manilov, ruled out
no military options but said commanders had learned from ``bitter

ordinary Chechen citizens.

   The Belfast High Court said it would hear an appeal for a
judicial review of the finding by Mo Mowlam, Britain's Northern
Ireland secretary, that IRA involvement in a murder and a
gun-running case did not mean that the group had broken its
official cease-fire. The decision permitted the IRA's political
wing, Sinn Fein, to remain a party to peace talks. The appeal was
brought by a Protestant whose parents were killed in an IRA bombing
in 1993.

   BRITAIN: POLICY ON DIVORCES

   The Church of England issued a hard-line restatement of its ban

Prince of Wales, and his long-term partner, Camilla Parker-Bowles,
both of whom are divorced.

   Labeling laws have gone into effect in Britain requiring all

   After three and a half years and 650,000 pages of court

which does not recognize the group as a religion. Defense lawyers

after court documents relating to the case were reported missing.

BUCHANAN'S VIEWS ON HITLER CREATE A REFORM PARTY STIR
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Minn.)  (nk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The shadow competition for the presidential
nomination of the Reform Party has become embroiled in Pat
Buchanan's views, expressed in his new book, that Hitler presented
no threat to the United States after Nazi Germany's initial
victories of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's thesis that Hitler offered ``no physical threat to
the United States'' as of late 1940 has been underlined for
criticism by Donald Trump, the real estate developer who, like
Buchanan, is considering seeking the Reform Party nomination next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The budding controversy was taken by one Reform Party official
as an early caution that Buchanan's history of such disputes should
offer the party some pause. ``A party takes on a lot of attitudes
and reflections of its standard bearer,'' said Dean M. Barkley, an
adviser to Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform leader who has
reservations about Buchanan's threat to quit the Republican Party
and campaign for the Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Buchanan becomes the candidate, obviously if there's
negative baggage, that will affect the entire ticket,'' said
Barkley, noting Ventura's preference for a more ``centrist''
aspirant for the party line, Trump included.
</P>
<P>
   But Pat Choate, the party's 1996 vice-presidential nominee, who
is a strong Buchanan supporter, said Buchanan's stock was rising
positively within the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critics are taking things in his book out of context and I
think he's explaining it well,'' said Choate, emphasizing that Ross
Perot, the party founder, was strictly neutral about any
competition for the nomination. ``Pat's doing very well. If he runs
for the nomination, he'll get the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire'' (Regnery Publishing),
Buchanan analyzes the history of American foreign policy and
questions whether Hitler sought war with the West or was driven to
it. ``Hitler made no overt move to threaten U.S vital interests,''
after his initial victories across Europe in 1939 and 1940,
Buchanan writes.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate chapter criticizing the power of numerous American
ethnic groups over foreign policy, Buchanan writes, ``After World
War II, Jewish influence over foreign policy became almost an
obsession with American leaders.'' Buchanan complained on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation'' on Sunday that critics were lifting that
observation from a complex criticism directed at numerous groups.
``One paragraph discussing the power of the Israeli lobby is not
only legitimate, it is necessary,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which is a centerpiece of Buchanan's presidential run,
emphasizes the views of some historians that Hitler was primarily
interested in building a German empire to the east, not westward
toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Trump contends that Buchanan is denigrating the memory of
Americans who died fighting in an unavoidable war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat says Hitler had no malicious intent toward the United
States,'' Trump said in an interview. ``Well, Hitler killed 6
million Jews and millions of others. Don't you think it was only a
question of time before he got to us? He tackled Europe first and
we were next. Pat's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had read the book, Trump said, ``I've seen the
phrases we're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, complaining that he had been misrepresented, replied
that ``Mr. Trump's views reflect an almost paralyzing ignorance of
the history of World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Americans had no choice but to fight once Hitler
declared war on the United States, Buchanan said, while writing
that it was ``preposterous'' to suggest Germany had any real power
to threaten the United States after Hitler's air force was defeated
in the Battle of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The German invasion threat was history,'' he writes,
contending that the British and French declarations of war after
the German invasion of Poland served mainly to distract Hitler from
his strategy of attacking Russia and ``thus saved the Soviet Union
for Communism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Britain and France not given the war guarantees to
Poland,'' Buchanan writes, ``there might have been no Dunkirk, no
blitz, no Vichy, no destruction of the Jewish populations'' of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the excerpts being singled out, the overall thesis of
Buchanan's book is a warning against an ``unsustainable'' foreign
policy committing American forces in ``scores of nations in regions
where we have never fought before.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party officials said Buchanan, who promises a final
decision on whether he will switch parties next month, has
privately begun reaching out to key Reform officials, though not
yet to Ventura. Barkley, the adviser to Ventura, estimated that
Buchanan could stir enough excitement among some Reform Party
members to put together a serious organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's challenging to those of us who are not so excited to
provide a viable alternative,'' he said. ``If we can't, we've got
nothing to complain about because we always knew our party was
subject to an outside group coming in.''

HAVING THWARTED GORE'S RABBIT STRATEGY, BRADLEY PLAYS THE HARE 
</HEADLINE>

Democrats ...) (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Riding a wave of favorable attention and strong
fund raising, Bill Bradley is adopting a campaign strategy that
mirrors his own meticulous manner: He is preparing for a grinding,
patient battle that could last into the summer, well beyond the
March primaries that many Democrats once thought would deliver the
nomination to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley game plan reflects the organizational strength of
Gore, who has built wide support among Democratic officials across
the nation and whose campaign seems capable of staying afloat even
if Bradley does extremely well in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   So while Bradley's advisers say he must win several early
primaries, New Hampshire, California and most important New York,
to build momentum, he must also be prepared to hunker down and
demonstrate that he can outlast Gore as the primary season drags
into April, May and June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are letting people know that we have the resources to see
this thing through for the long haul,'' said Gina Glantz, Bradley's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Under this strategy, Bradley and his advisers are doing
everything they can to delay the crowning of Gore as the Democratic
Party's consensus candidate. They have been aggressively wooing
undeclared elected officials and labor leaders. And they have been
urging a host of grass-roots organizations that represent core
Democratic voters _ including blacks, environmentalists,
abortion-rights advocates, gays and lesbians _ to stay neutral, if
not endorse Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   By their reasoning, if Bradley performs well early, he will buy
time to convey his message, establish beachheads in states where
Gore already has established organizations and make Gore appear
unelectable. Forcing the battle into the final June primaries would
also mean that New Jersey, which Bradley represented in the Senate
for 18 years, could tip the balance in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What one sees nationally, slowly, is movement toward Bill
Bradley,'' Douglas Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman, asserted.
``That's because as voters learn who Bill is and how he will
respond to the nation's problems, there is movement toward him.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, political analysts say, the Bradley strategy has worked
relatively well. He has stalled efforts by Gore to win the
AFL-CIO's endorsement, persuaded several abortion rights groups to
stay neutral, received the endorsement of a small environmental
group, Friends of the Earth, and won plaudits from gay and lesbian
groups by advocating broader civil rights protections for
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's eliminated Gore's quick-kill strategy,'' said Bill
Carrick, a Democratic consultant in California. ``It's beginning to
look like a war of attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gore assert that once Bradley begins laying out the
specifics of his agenda, he is certain to upset some segments of
the Democratic base. They also argue that once centrist and
independent voters in New Hampshire voters see that Bradley has
taken more liberal positions than Gore on several issues, they will
reject him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley faces a host of other obstacles, including having to
keep pace with the vice president's fund raising _ which, so far,
he has been able to do _ while also catching up to Gore's campaign
organization, which has a presence in most states. Gore, who
represented Tennessee in the Senate before being elected vice
president, seems particularly strong in the South as well as in
California, where he has won endorsements from almost every
Democratic state official.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley must also find a way to compensate for Gore's advantage
in so-called superdelegates _ members of Congress, party officials
and others who will automatically be sent to the Democratic
convention and who account for about 20 percent of all delegates.
Though neither candidate can say exactly how many superdelegates
they have, Gore clearly has a majority.
</P>
<P>
   That means Bradley will either have to win a larger percentage
of the primary vote in major states _ and thus a larger share of
the regular delegates _ or persuade Gore's superdelegates to switch
allegiances, which traditionally has been a difficult thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Bradley _ a Hall of Fame basketball player _
must win a few large states in the early going to prove that he is
more than a celebrity insurgent. Central to his calculations are
New York and California, which both hold primaries on March 7 and
together provide nearly a third of the 2,168.5 delegates needed to
win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a momentum point of view, our desire is to win New York
and California,'' said Gale Kaufman, senior adviser to the Bradley
campaign in California who has strong ties to the state's labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Though California has more delegates, New York is viewed by many
Democrats as a more crucial symbolic battleground for Bradley,
since he played with the New York Knicks for 10 years and is
probably better known there than in any other state except New
Jersey and Missouri, where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a must win for him,'' said former Mayor Ed Koch,
who is supporting Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Bradley has put together his most extensive
organization in the country, outside Iowa and New Hampshire.
Running the campaign is Michael DelGuidice, an investment banker
who was chief-of-staff to former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, and
Frank Sanzillo, a lobbyist and former aide in the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has also recruited several Democratic organizers,
including William Cunningham, a former chief of staff to Sen.Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., John LoCicero, a former top aide to Koch,
James L. LaRocca, a former transportation commissioner under Cuomo,
and New York City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge.
</P>
<P>
   Recent signs in New York have been encouraging for Bradley. Last
week, he won the endorsement of more than 20 Democratic officials
in Brooklyn, which has the most Democratic voters in the state. He
is also expected to pick up the endorsement of Moynihan in the
coming weeks. And last week, three separate polls _ by Zogby
International, Quinnipiac College and the Marist Institute for
Public Opinion _ all showed the race in New York to be a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of their growing concern about the state, Gore's
campaign has begun lowering expectations for their candidate. ``We
have always known that New York would be a tough fight,'' said Kiki
Moore, communications director for the Gore campaign. ``This is
Bill Bradley's back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign is clearly not prepared to give up on New
York. In recent days, Gore has personally called politicians that
seemed to be tilting toward Bradley, including Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
a Manhattan Democrat, and Dominic Baranello, chairman of the
Suffolk County Democratic Committee. Gore was scheduled to meet
privately with Baranello this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be talking about baseball,'' Baranello said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of how important he considers California,
Bradley has spent more days there this year, 31, than anywhere else
except Iowa. He is planning on delivering his first major policy
speech of the fall, on health care, in Los Angeles next week. He
has raised more money from California than anywhere. And his
campaign plans to open a state office with full-time staff in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Though the vice president has sewn up the support of much of the
Democratic Party establishment, Bradley's supporters note that Al
Checchi also had endorsements from many California state officials
before he lost last year's gubernatorial primary to Gray Davis, who
went on to win in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because some politician endorses you don't mean his
friends will vote for you,'' said state Assemblyman Richard Floyd
of Carson, Calif., one of the few Democrats in the Legislature to
endorse Bradley. ``But you do get all his enemies.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WALTON'S SCHOOL FOR THE BIG MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Ninety minutes of low-post tutelage
concluded, Bill Walton limped off in one direction and Gheorghe
Muresan walked stiffly in another. Fundamentals aside, the best
advice the most diversely talented center in pro basketball history
might have given the tallest man to ever play the game was what to
do to remain in one large, functional piece.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson one: don't take bold, unnecessary risks, and the minute
you feel sharp pain, by all means, sit down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very slow learner myself,'' Walton said Monday, the
start of three days of big-man workouts, Camp Cure-a-Klutz, at the
Nets' training facility. ``I played on a broken foot. Then you look
back 10 years later and say, `Maybe I shouldn't have done that.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the sore subject of play today, pay tomorrow, Walton opined
that Patrick Ewing should not have hobbled through the Knicks' wild
run on an aching Achilles' tendon. If you didn't hear him say that
on the network telecasts last spring, well, he was thinking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to pay a huge price for that,'' Walton said,
suggesting Ewing faces the likelihood of pain until he quits.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about the Knicks, but Walton's assessment _ based on
his own unhealthy, unhappy experiences between championships in
Portland and Boston _ wasn't very good news for the metropolitan
area fan already heartsick about Vinny Testaverde's foot in
particular and the New York football season in general. Judging by
Sunday's results, the tender local sports psyche may, by November,
be raw, in need of a quick basketball fix. But the recent medical
word on Ewing and his backup, Chris Dudley (knee), as well as the
report that Jayson Williams won't play for the Nets until at least
January does not bode well for that.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what contingency plans the Knicks are making, as
Scott Layden, the latest in Madison Square Garden executives
schooled at the Pentagon, has reportedly issued a moratorium on
injury updates. The Nets, bless them, just continue to parade more
oversized bodies into their Champion Center. And in what amounts to
a minor managerial miracle, the players are actually coming to work
this week when they aren't legally bound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magic pill for the development of skills,'' Walton
said, after reviewing footwork and other basic concepts with Keith
Van Horn, Jim McIlvaine, Jamie Feick and Muresan, the most
intriguing class case.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-7-inch Romanian import had three fairly productive
seasons in Washington, but in the summer of 1997, after Muresan
stood up tall as straight man for Billy Crystal while filming ``My
Giant,'' his aching foot was fitted for a cast and didn't get
better, and he didn't play for two years. According to John Nash,
the Nets' general manager, the misdiagnosed problem was a vertebra
in his back that was compressing a nerve, causing pain down below.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you feeling?'' Muresan was asked Monday, after
finishing a game of two-on-two _ he and someone named Peter Cornell
against Feick and Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tired,'' Muresan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know much about Walton's career, his injuries?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear something.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Muresan is no threat to displace Walton at NBC, or
tower over him in the Hall of Fame. He did average 14.5 points, 9.6
rebounds and almost 3 blocks a game in 76 games in 1995-96. If
Muresan could somehow replicate those numbers, the Nets would thank
the playoff gods. The Knicks, in fact, would take that production
from Ewing, their giant, in a New York minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``George can be a force,'' Walton said. ``He's not a player who
can jump, who can run. He's got offensive skills. He's intelligent.
He thinks the game. His problem is getting his body to react to his
mental commands.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Walton tried to tell Muresan's body, by way of his
brain: Positioning is everything for a man his size. Watching from
the sideline, Dr. Jack Ramsay, Walton's championship Portland coach
in 1976-77, said no big man has commanded space in the paint,
without having to wrestle for it, better than Walton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran to his spot, turned, and his hands were up, calling for
the ball,'' Ramsay said. ``Across the board, no big man has ever
had Bill's variety of skills, when he was healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Always, the issue of health. Over one four-year stretch, Walton
played 14 games. He kept at it, though, until 1985, Boston, and
Larry Bird. He soon after left the sport a champion, limping tall
and proud, a great history lesson to be learned on perseverance and
patience through pain.

WILL GM AND FORD FOLLOW IN FOOTSTEPS OF DAIMLERCHRYSLER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ DaimlerChrysler AG's tentative contract with the
United Automobile Workers contains company concessions that may
create problems when the union demands similar concessions next
from General Motors and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler agreed in the contract to hire more employees if
the work force at any factory complex falls by more than 5 percent
during the four-year contract for any reason except a downturn in
automobile sales.
</P>
<P>
   While DaimlerChrysler has a relatively young work force and has
been hiring more workers to keep up with demand for its sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks, Ford Motor Co. and particularly
General Motors Corp. have large, older work forces that they have
been trying to reduce through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler also agreed to a so-called side letter that
contained a surprisingly categorical ban on any move to get rid of
unionized businesses. Over the years, the UAW has sometimes allowed
auto makers to have different side letters provided that they
accepted identical labor contracts. But the DaimlerChrysler side
letter represents a precedent for an effort by some in the union to
stop Ford's planned spin-off of its auto parts division, which has
$18 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the contract emerged in a compendium of contract
provisions prepared by the union as labor negotiations accelerated
in Canada and the United States Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Basil Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union,
said Monday that the risk of a strike against Ford there on Tuesday
night was receding, but that a 35 percent chance of a walkout
remained. And Stephen P. Yokich, the UAW's president, said that
intensive talks with GM in the United States would start on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the current labor contract, DaimlerChrysler and GM had
proposed to guarantee the jobs of current UAW workers with at least
10 years of seniority. In exchange, both auto makers wanted relief
from a provision in the previous contract, which expired on Sept.
14. The controversial provision required DaimlerChrysler, GM and
Ford to hire more workers if employment in any region of the United
States fell by 5 percent or more from 1996 levels because work was
moved to other factories.
</P>
<P>
   But the UAW rejected that proposal. The compendium of contract
provisions released Monday showed that the union and
DaimlerChrysler did not agree on job guarantees for senior workers.
Instead, they retained the rule requiring new hiring and broadened
it to require that workers be hired if employment were to fall
sharply for any reason, and not just because work was transferred
to other factories. The rule also appears to require new hiring if
employment falls steeply at a single factory complex instead of in
a region.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract language is complicated, however, and has a few
small pieces of good news for the auto makers. For example, the
required drop in employment before new hiring occurs will relax
somewhat over the four years of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   A 10 percent drop in a factory complex's work force will be
required to trigger new hiring by the end of the contract in 2003.
The provision nonetheless could pose problems for GM and Ford. GM
had been hoping that up to 6 percent of its work force will retire
each year for the next several years and would not have to be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been reducing employment at its older car factories in
Ohio while hiring workers at sport utility vehicle factories in
Kentucky, and has run afoul of the ``5-percent'' rule in Ohio.
Partly as a result, Ford has paid Ohio workers up to $45,000 apiece
to move to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 1996 agreement also turned out to have important
loopholes that still allowed GM in particular to continue shrinking
its work force, although not quite as quickly as executives had
hoped. Whether the current contract has such loopholes will not be
known for months, but Diane Swonk, the chief economist at the Bank
One Corp., predicted that the auto makers would be able to continue
downsizing somewhat under the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and GM declined to comment Monday on the DaimlerChrysler
contract.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler officials also refused to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the side letter, the union's summary said: ``The new
letter states that DaimlerChrysler will not close, nor partially or
wholly sell, spin-off, split-off, consolidate, or otherwise dispose
of in any form, any plant, asset or business unit of any type,
constituting a bargaining unit under the agreement,'' the summary
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the union has always demanded that each auto maker accept
virtually identical labor contracts, covering issues like wages and
benefits, side letters are tailored to each auto maker's
circumstances. DaimlerChrysler's side letter could nonetheless
create problems for Ford, which is making plans to spin off or sell
its auto parts division, Visteon Automotive Systems. The UAW has
left negotiations with Ford for last this year, and could ask Ford
for a similar side letter.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford has long enjoyed the best labor relations in the auto
industry, the union is divided on how to handle Visteon, union
officials said. While many want to prevent a spin-off of Visteon,
others note that GM spun off its auto-parts unit in May without
reaching an understanding with the union first. Because in-house
auto-parts divisions tend not to be competitive, stopping Ford from
following GM's example would result in the union's penalizing Ford
for having tried to negotiate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW compendium of the contract also said that there had been
no changes in DaimlerChrysler's prescription drug plan. Complaining
of steeply rising costs, the auto makers had sought higher
co-payments for prescriptions, particularly for popular medicines
like Viagra, an impotence treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, UAW compendiums of labor agreements have tended
to be accurate because misrepresentations could result in
subsequent challenges to ratification votes.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, Hargrove, the Canadian union leader, said at a news
conference Monday afternoon that he saw only a 35 percent chance of
a strike when his union's current, three-year contract with Ford
expires at 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday. Ford's initial offer on Friday
had infuriated Canadian union officials, who dismissed it as
inadequate, but Ford revised its offer on Sunday and negotiations
since then have gone fairly well, Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus and energy is to try to do this without a shutdown
of production,'' he said, while cautioning, ``I'm reluctant to say
we can avoid a dispute here.''
</P>
<P>
   James Hartford, a Ford spokesman, said ``there are still a heck
of a lot of things that remain on the table.''

NO RESISTANCE, NO WELCOME FOR PEACEKEEPERS IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT number of troops to 1,000, sted 2,000,
and deleting British.) (With TIMOR-MILITARY)

<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ The vanguard of an international peacekeeping
force staked its claim to this silent and broken town Monday,
watched warily by clusters of refugees, sullen Indonesian troops
and small, angry groups of irregular militias.
</P>
<P>
   There was no resistance but no welcome for the peacekeepers, who
arrived with all the firepower and high technology of modern war.
There was no peace to keep; East Timor's tiny capital is a dead
city _ burned, looted and evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Through the hot, still day, as dogs barked in the empty streets
and the leaves of banana trees rustled quietly, more than 1,000
Australian soldiers spread out through the city with their heavy
packs and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Then as the sun went down, three large fires were set in
villages near the airport, their black smoke and bright orange
flames filling the sky, a sort of initiation for the invited but
unwelcome guests.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of a departing troop-transport plane mingled with the
popping sound of burning buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they are testing us,'' said an Australian trooper,
adjusting his night vision goggles as he stood beside an armored
vehicle, watching the flames. ``They want to make us do something
we don't want to do, but as long as we stick to our game plan we'll
be all right and we'll move them out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires have been burning in Dili since the terror here began on
Sept. 4, the day the United Nations announced that the East
Timorese people had voted nearly 4-to-1 for independence from
Indonesia, which invaded and occupied the former Portuguese colony
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, thousands of people have been reported killed and
hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes by
civilian militias armed, supported and sometimes manned by the
Indonesian military. Indonesia's top military commander disputed
that estimate of deaths Monday, saying the military had recorded
fewer than 100 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was soldiers, men in green berets,'' a villager said of the
men who started one of the fires Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the commander of the multinational
force _ which is to include some 8,000 troops from a dozen
countries _ praised the cooperation of the Indonesian military
Monday and said the initial deployment of troops had proceeded
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   He said that once the capital had been secured his troops would
begin moving through the territory _ where 800,000 people had lived
before the recent terror _ to neutralize any opposition and provide
support for a huge aid operation.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Mark Evans, who commands the Australian troops who
make up the bulk of the forces here, said the first day had gone
``very smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the support we have had from the TNI
today,'' he said, using the initials for the Indonesian armed
forces. ``That augurs well.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Indonesian transport trucks, with armed
Indonesian escorts, helped ferry the foreign soldiers through town.
But only the foreigners returned the waves of onlookers; the
Indonesians stared back grimly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good reception by the TNI and had a guarded _ I would
call it guarded _ welcome by the local people,'' said Maj. Chip
Henriss-Anderssen, who arrived on the second aircraft Monday
morning in the first wave of Australian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw men I would call militia,'' he said. ``They were
carrying homemade weapons and they were wearing a mixture of
camouflage and civilian uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kennedy, who coordinates relief efforts here for the
United Nations and has remained in Dili for the last two weeks,
said: ``I think the militias are taking flight or keeping a very
low profile. When we see them we stay in our cars and keep going.
We have armed TNI escorts. It's a yin and yang thing. They don't
press the TNI. Many of them are TNI.''
</P>
<P>
   As they drove through the town Monday, the newly arrived
soldiers passed block after block of burned, vandalized and
roofless buildings, their windows smashed, their contents looted.
The home of the Roman Catholic bishop, Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo,
is a burned shell. So is the city's main hotel, the Mahkota. The
city's tiny shopping district disappeared in flames.
</P>
<P>
   As in the rest of Dili, the vandalism at the small airport _
where giant transport planes landed, unloaded and took off again
all day Monday without cutting their engines _ seemed to have been
an act of violent passion.
</P>
<P>
   In the departure lounge, people had picked up and flung here and
there the rows of molded plastic chairs, as if in a convulsion of
anger. The floor was smeared with feces.
</P>
<P>
   In the offices, the trash was ankle-deep. Computers and
telephones had been looted but someone had gone to the trouble of
dumping a can of blue paint over an old typewriter. A framed poster
of smiling flight attendants had been ripped from the wall and
smashed.
</P>
<P>
   Convoys of yellow civilian trucks rolled out of the city, filled
with refugees and their belongings, evacuating as the peacekeepers
arrived. They were native Indonesians or people who opposed
independence _ the families of militiamen or of civil servants
here, one resident said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are afraid of new fighting,'' said the resident, Misuar
Santos, as he watched them drive past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier, a man with long hair, several strings of necklaces and
a black Che Guevara T-shirt said he expected that the militias
would withdraw for a while, wait their moment, then resume their
trouble-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are waiting,'' he said. ``Maybe they still prepare
a bad plan. The militia will not stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, Julio das Dores Soares, 25, said he was a fighter for
independence _ an enemy of the militias _ who had left the city
after the referendum to go to Dare, a stronghold for the guerrillas
just south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is back, he said, with seven of his friends, to assess
the situation. ``Now there is still panic in Dare,'' he said, where
relief officials say as many as 30,000 people have taken refuge.
``They want to come back to Dili but they are still afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The people in Dare are not yet starving, Soares said, but they
are hungry. ``Many people need food,'' he said. ``Many children are
sick and some have already died.''
</P>
<P>
   Soares stopped abruptly. One hundred yards away two Indonesian
soldiers began slowly walking in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, excuse me,'' he said, disappearing quickly among
the banana trees of his village. ``Indonesian soldiers. I go now.''

   MIAMI _ The U.S. Customs Service and its counterpart in Colombia
will sign on Tuesday an agreement that, Customs officials say, will
help the two countries investigate drug smuggling and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Customs officials said, both countries can
obtain evidence and assistance in building cases directly from
their customs counterparts, rather than through slower, diplomatic
channels.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they said, it will help both countries in
investigations into the ``black market peso exchange,'' which
funnels some $5 billion in drug profits into Colombia every year.
</P>
<P>
   With the signing of the agreement, customs officials in both
countries will be able to exchange information on products and
producers often used in the laundering scheme. In the past, such
information was gained only informally, or through diplomatic
exchanges.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Get ready for the Brookline Stampede. By
mid-week, the U.S. and European players might think they're at the
Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   Locals remember The Country Club, an traditional-style,
close-proximity course, as severely cramped in 1988, when it hosted
a U.S. Open and crowds were in the range of 22,000 to 25,000. From
best estimates, the 33rd Ryder Cup has been oversold by about
10,000 tickets per day.
</P>
<P>
   At least they won't all be out on the course at the same time.
There are 59 corporate tents and 200 tables on the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can be oblivious to it,'' said American Jim
Furyk, ``because half the course is white (tented) out there. With
the noise and that amount of people out there, I'm sure we'll start
noticing it tomorrow.''

   Wadkins predicts rout
</P>
<P>
   Between now and Friday, when the matches begin, there will be
much talk about the strength of the U.S. team and the pressure on
it to produce after two straight losses to Europe. None of this
will matter to Lanny Wadkins, the 1995 U.S. captain at Oak Hill.
``I think our team is going to hammer 'em,'' Wadkins said. ``This
year I think is going to be the first rout in a while.'' . . .
European captain Mark James, who arrived with his team on the
Concorde from London, about the potential for fan rowdiness:
``Kiawah Island was an unfortunate chapter in the history of the
Ryder Cup. . . . Ben (Crenshaw) and I are very much keen to see
that various possible standards _ not only crowd behavior but
player behavior and sportsmanship _ are in every aspect this
week.''

   Parnevik-Garcia pairing?
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, who has been campaigning for a pairing
with 19-year-old Sergio Garcia, got some advance playing time with
the young man Sunday as the first players on site. Garcia birdied
four of his last six holes to beat Parnevik 1-up in an informal
match. ``He has that fire that Tiger Woods has,'' said Parnevik,
``so I think he's going to do great in match play.'' While some are
assuming Garcia will be teamed with Jose Maria Olazabal, a Miguel
Angel Jimenez-Olazabal pairing in best ball is more likely, largely
because of Ollie's erratic driving. Garcia can get a bit loose from
the teebox, too. Parnevik, on the other hand, is known for his
accuracy and solid ballstriking.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes the public shareholders are the last to
learn the really important things about companies they own.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, the J. Jill Group, a catalog and Internet
retailer of women's fashions aimed at affluent 35- to 55-year-olds,
announced that it would post a loss for the third quarter, which
ends on Saturday. It is ending one of its two catalogs, formerly
called Nicole Summers and lately called Nicole, only three months
after announcing that it had repositioned the catalog to aim for
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement came after the company asked NASDAQ to
halt trading, which it did at 2:07 p.m., with the share price down
$4.50, or 40 percent, to $6.875. Trading resumed at 3:22 p.m., and
the stock fell further, closing at $6.125.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a month ago, the shares were trading above $20. From
then through Monday, as the business was evidently deteriorating,
the company made no announcements. By the time it did talk, the
stock had fallen by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   During the last couple of weeks, the share price had declined
slowly, on gradually increasing volume. Then, on Monday before the
announcement, the floodgates opened. By the time trading was
halted, volume came to 3.6 million shares, more than the total
traded over the preceding seven weeks and equal to more than a
third of the total shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear just how much of the bad news got out, or how it
did. But the heavy volume and the rapid decline of the stock Monday
morning made it appear that something had leaked over the weekend.
A company spokesman said that management would not discuss the
stock price, and Gordon Cooke, the company's chief executive, did
not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke, who took over the company at the end of 1995, had
developed a following on Wall Street as sales and profits grew
rapidly and the company announced plans both to sell on the
Internet and to open J. Jill stores in upscale malls. On Monday it
said that the Internet business, which began Sept. 1, was already
accounting for 5 percent of sales and that plans for the stores
were going well.
</P>
<P>
   But it also said that sales for the quarter would be about $46
million, roughly the same as in the quarter last year, and that the
company expected to lose about 11 cents a share in the quarter, in
contrast to a profit of 14 cents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Cooke had been optimistic about both the Nicole catalog
and the J. Jill catalog in an interview with Bloomberg News on July
15, in Monday's announcement he was quoted as saying that ``the
inevitable slowdown of J. Jill's rapid growth has happened sooner
than we expected.'' The company blamed intensive competition and
the ``proliferation of e-commerce'' for its problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicole catalog was begun in mid-August to replace the former
Nicole Summers catalog. It was supposed to feature looser,
less-tailored clothing than Nicole Summers had emphasized. The fact
that it is being abandoned a month later presumably is an
indication that reaction to it was far worse than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The real losers here are those who read the company's press
releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and assumed that if anything important was going on, they would be
told.
</P>

<P>
   Pay Attention to Those Tender Offers
</P>
<P>
   The pros on Wall Street who owned stock in Comsat, the satellite
communications company, have made a lot of money at the expense of
the amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin completed its purchase of 49 percent of Comsat
on Saturday, paying an above-market price of $45.50 a share. If
Lockheed buys the rest of the company _ which it may not be allowed
to do _ it will pay considerably less for the remaining shares.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, it was in the interests of all shareholders to
tender their shares into the Lockheed offer. Yet only about 90
percent of the shares were actually tendered, Lockheed announced
over the weekend, and it will accept 54.26 percent of the shares
tendered.
</P>
<P>
   Those who did not tender passed up a significant profit
opportunity. While there is no way to know who they were precisely,
you can be sure that the vast majority were individual investors
who failed to understand what was going on. Many discount and
Internet brokerage firms feel no obligation to offer advice when
their customers are confronted with tender offers, and some
investors may not have brokers at all.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that those who did tender _ including many
professional traders and institutional investors _ are about $38
million richer than they would have been if all eligible shares had
been tendered. That is money lost by the ones who did not tender.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Comsat fell $5.56, to $30.44. If Lockheed is able to buy
the rest of the shares, it will exchange one of its shares _ which
closed Monday at $33.875 _ for each remaining Comsat share. That
purchase, however, is contingent on getting Congress to change the
law to approve such a deal, and so far the House has refused to do
so. Until it does, Comsat shares are likely to trade at a discount
to Lockheed shares.

VALENZUELA GET ANOTHER CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Valenzuela, the oft-suspended jockey, is getting yet another
chance under a unique, one-year ``conditional'' license granted by
the California Horse Racing Board.
</P>
<P>
   The CHRB announced Monday that Valenzuela signed an agreement
over the weekend to submit to random drug and alcohol testing and
continue substance-abuse treatment. His new license, effective with
the Sept. 29 opening of the Oak Tree Racing Association season at
Santa Anita, can be revoked if he fails to meet those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   CHRB spokesman Mike Marten said executive director Roy Wood was
swayed by favorable reports on Valenzuela's battle with substance
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 36, hasn't competed since October 1997, when Santa
Anita stewards barred him indefinitely for missing riding
assignments without being excused, his eighth suspension for
absence and drug-related infractions in a nine-year span.
</P>
<P>
   When Valenzuela shows up, he can be brilliant: He won the 1989
Kentucky Derby and Preakness aboard Sunday Silence, has ridden six
Breeders' Cup winners, and has been the leading jockey six times at
Southern California thoroughbred meets.

WASHINGTON BACKS MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA, LATE TALLY SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Alaska, Ariz., Calif., Nev., Ore., Wash)  (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 10 months after they cast ballots,
residents of the District of Columbia were told Monday that they
had overwhelmingly voted in favor of a measure that would allow
marijuana to be used for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional opponents of the measure had blocked a count of
the initiative, but Judge Richard W. Roberts of U.S. District Court
here ruled on Friday that the restriction was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The count that was released Monday found that 68.6 percent of
the voters approved the medical use of marijuana, with 75,536 in
favor and 34,621 opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the measure maintain that marijuana is valuable in
relieving the pain of glaucoma and the nausea associated with AIDS
and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vote, it is not certain that the measure will become
law because, under the authority that Congress maintains over the
District of Columbia, lawmakers have 30 days in which to block the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to gear up to do a lobbying campaign,'' said Wayne
Turner, the sponsor of the initiative and leader of the anti-AIDS
group Act Up.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House of Representatives and the Senate would have to
vote against the law to block it, and a spokesman for Rep. Bob
Barr, a conservative Republican from Georgia who sponsored the
measure that prevented the vote count, said Barr's office was
studying what steps would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he drew hope from the fact that one-third of the
members of Congress were from states that have voted to legalize
the medical use of marijuana. Such laws were approved in
referendums in Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said Monday: ``The results of this initiative do not change
my determination to ensure our nation's capital does not legalize
any mind-altering drugs, including marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and it would send
a terrible message to America's young people to allow those laws to
be openly flouted in the same city where they were passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said: ``Bob Barr has called it a hidden agenda and says
that we want to legalize heroin and crack, but that's not so. The
original sponsor was my partner, Steve Michael, who died of AIDS in
1998. We started this project for patient access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a pot smoker and neither was he until a doctor told
him to try marijuana to try to stimulate his appetite. He tried it
and it worked. He stopped losing weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union,
which pressed Turner's case in court, pointed to the vote as a
ratification of home-rule rights for residents of the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance,'' said Mary Jane DeFrank, executive director
of the ACLU chapter, ``when you have people very, very ill, it is
really the humane thing to allow them to use marijuana so they can
keep their food down and keep their pills down.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Thomas, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, a
group based in Washington that campaigned for the measure, said the
vote in Washington was in line with that in referendums elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, these initiatives have passed in every state in which
they have appeared on the ballot,'' Thomas said. ``This confirms
what every scientific public opinion poll has found since 1995: 60
to 80 percent of the American people support legal access to
medicinal marijuana.''

VALENZUELA CLEARED TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ The California Horse Racing Board cleared
jockey Patrick Valenzuela for a return to racing, according to a
press release issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which regulates horse racing in the state, issued
Valenzuela, 36, a one-year conditional license. Valenzuela, who was
suspended from racing in October 1997 for missing too many mounts,
was unavailable for comment late Monday. His attorney Donald
Calabria, of Encino, did not return two phone calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela will return to the saddle on opening day at Santa
Anita's Oak Tree meet, which begins Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   `This has been an ongoing discussion for months,` said CHRB
spokesman Mike Marten. `As of Sept. 29 he's eligible as far as
we're concerned. There's no ta whole lot more to say.`
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Valenzuela was arrested inside a Garvey Avenue
bar on suspicion of robbing a cab driver at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to the Los Angeles County jail and bound over for
trial following a preliminary hearing dispute the fact that the
alleged victim couldn't identify Valenzuela as the man who robbed
him. The case was thrown out by a Superior Court `In the interest
of justice.`
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, Valenzuela, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby
aboard Sunday Silence, began to make his appeal for reinstatement .
In a May interview with Roy Firestone on ESPN, Valenzuela said he
had found religion and was living a sober lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   During hearings on his request, CHRB officials said they
received favorable information about Valenzuela's effort at
reforming from Calabria, other members of the horse racing industry
and Don Murray, executive director of the Winners Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, based at Santa Anita, is an assistance program
for people in the horse racing industry experiencing problems with
alcohol or drug abuse. Valenzuela is required to participate in the
program for the term of his conditional license, Marten said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement paving the way for his return, Valenzuela
agreed to submit to random drug and alcohol testing for one year.
His license can be revoked if he fails the test or quits the
program, Marten said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, Valenzuela was already at work. He took some
training rides at Hollywood Park in preparation for his return,
officials said. He is also working at getting his weight down from
120 to 117 pounds in time for the Oak Tree Meet.
</P>
<P>
   The rider, known affectionately as `P-Val,` has been suspended
from racing on eleven separate occasions for a variety of
violations, according to Marten. Nine of those suspensions were for
failure to show up for work.
</P>
<P>
   News of Valenzuela's return to racing was greeted with mixed
emotion Monday at Fairplex Park.
</P>
<P>
   `Pat Valenzuela is just like all the other athletes who have
been in this position, said trainer Barry Abrams. `He deserves the
chance. Drug addiction is a hard thing to fight. Hopefully, he will
see this as his last chance.`
</P>
<P>
   Privately, several jockeys expressed skepticism that Valenzuela
would be successful.
</P>
<P>
   `But, they'll give him the mounts, because he's that good,` said
one rider, who asked no to be identified. `He's like a cat -- nine
lives.`
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, who has had success with Valenzuela, said he wouldn't
hesitate using the jockey.
</P>
<P>
   `He's got the talent,` Abrams said. `He can ride with the best
of them. He ital on was ital off the best of them at one time.
</P>
<P>
   `The only way I wouldn't use him is if one of the owners didn't
want him,` Abrams continued. `But, it's not like he went and killed
someone.
</P>
<P>
   `If he can prove on the track he's as good as he was before,
he'll get the (mounts),` Abrams said. `I think a lot of trainers
feel the same way.`

IN JAPAN THESE DAYS, FEW SPEAK KINDLY OF CENTRAL BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Bank of Japan is under siege. At no time since the
central bank was granted independence from government control last
year as part of a sweeping reform of the nation's financial system
has it come under so much pressure.
</P>
<P>
   International experts ranging from the U.S. Treasury Department
to prominent private economists and investors want the central bank
to loosen what the bank already considers a loose monetary policy.
A looser monetary policy, they say, will help give the Japanese
economy the jolt needed to loft it, finally, out of a decade-long
slump.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure is the unexpected strength of the yen,
which hit a three-year high against the dollar last week, setting
off concerns that it would derail the start of any economic
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, however, says it can do little more to spur the
economy _ having dropped interest rates practically to zero,
injected large sums into the money markets and yet produced little
in the way of increased demand for money to spend and invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large amounts of excess reserves currently exist in the
banking system,'' Kazuo Ueda, a policy board member, said in a
recent speech. ``Not a single bank has said that a further increase
in reserves would increase their lending.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling has evoked a sense of deja vu among economists
here. ``It's very, very reminiscent of the bad old days,'' said
Brian Rose, an economist at Warburg Dillon Read, ``when the Bank of
Japan had no independence and the press would announce its policy
changes ahead of its own announcements, the Ministry of Finance
ordered it around, and politicians felt free to weigh in as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank has resisted the appeals to do more, but on Tuesday,
the policy board will hold its regular meeting, where monetary
policy and the strength of the yen will undoubtedly be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders, the country's leading financial daily
newspaper and others were betting Monday that the bank would
capitulate and announce plans to increase the money supply that
would work in tandem with some sort of foreign intervention to
suppress the yen's rise.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations of an announcement weakened the yen in Tokyo
trading and contributed to a surge in the Tokyo stock market, where
the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 1.34 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese government officials also think that the bank will move
on Tuesday to ease monetary policy _ but in such a subtle way that
the markets may miss it at the outset, and foreign governments may
be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The officials are betting that while the bank would not reverse
any of its policies, it would begin increasing the money supply,
probably by adding to the 1 trillion yen pile of money _ $8.9
billion at current exchange rates _ it leaves in the market every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Such an increase would achieve the same effect as the
abandonment of Japan's ``sterilized'' currency interventions to
influence the yen's exchange rate. In such interventions, the
central bank offsets the surge in the money supply created by
selling yen with other actions in the money market.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others who are concerned about the yen's
strength have said such interventions have only limited effect. But
the Bank of Japan does not want to be seen as caving in to the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the central bank over yen intervention
underscores the steadily rising tension between the central bank
and its former masters, the Ministry of Finance and ruling
political party. That tension has been simmering since April 1998,
when the bank was made independent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There also is a continuing confrontation over government bond
purchases, with the Finance Ministry and prominent politicians
urging the central bank to underwrite government bonds and the bank
refusing to take on that role.
</P>
<P>
   The bank contends that would give the government unfettered
ability to spend money at a time when the country's debt has
climbed precariously. Central bank officials are still resentful
that pressure to purchase government bonds was perceived as the
impetus behind its decision in February to reduce interest rates to
one-quarter of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to defend its independence thereafter, the bank
has further compromised the perception that it makes monetary
policy solely on its own. ``The Bank of Japan seems always to be
driven into these untenable situations,'' a senior official said in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, when it made moves to aid corporations with
financing, it was seen as responding to political pressure at home,
and in February, when it lowered interest rates, the bank was
accused of bowing to the dictates of Robert Rubin, then the
American secretary of the Treasury, who had inveighed upon the bank
to ease monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sympathetic to their rationale for doing what they do, but
markets and the political environment change rapidly and sometimes
it's better to act preemptively,'' said a senior Finance Ministry
official, who insisted that the ministry had not tried to
strong-arm the central bank. ``Unfortunately, they have tended to
wait until the last minute before taking action, and thus appear as
if they're being forced into it by those who have already advocated
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the bank evidently feels as if it has been backed
into a corner. No one could have made that clearer than its
governor, Masaru Hayami, during comments after a meeting with
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa's remarks were those of the seasoned politician he is.
He said he had not discussed any specific issues regarding monetary
policy with Hayami. ``We had an important exchange of opinion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he apparently angered Hayami by telling reporters that he
had arranged the meeting, thus suggesting that once again, the
Finance Ministry was trying to dictate to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Hayami subsequently declared that the bank had no intention of
changing its policy on ``sterilized intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The zero interest rate policy is already more than sufficient
as a monetary easing step,'' he said, forgoing the even more
nuanced language with which most Japanese officials speak.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps even more telling was the choice of venue for the
meeting. Apparently, neither man wanted to be seen on his
opposite's turf, and so they met in a hotel room in central Tokyo.

HOW SAFE ARE THRILL RIDES?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, my husband and I took some grandchildren to watch a
tiny circus set up on a baseball field in Maine. We particularly
hoped to see the elephant put up the tent poles with her trunk. No
such luck. A backhoe was used.
</P>
<P>
   The elephant's owner shouted to bystanders that the elephant
could do the job better, but that animal-rights people usually
arrived as she started, and by the time all the documents and
veterinary certificates were inspected, the tent-pitching was
behind schedule, and it was easier to use a machine.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, the tale indicated that people had their eyes on
the elephant in her daily work life giving rides and lumbering
along in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   That memory returned while I was researching amusement park and
carnival safety in the light of the recent cluster of four roller
coaster deaths. Whose eyes are on the carnival rides, and what
powers do they have to protect the customers, especially young
ones?
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, that one-ring circus, which performed twice and
struck its tent, was inspected by the Maine Department of Public
Safety when it came into the state, and the rides were checked
after they were set up. But that show was also under the eye of the
federal government because the rides traveled from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the big rides in Ocean City, N.J., Santa Clara, Calif.,
and Doswell, Va., that brought four deaths last month, or those
involved in the two earlier reported deaths this year, in Coney
Island, and in Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Congress shifted jurisdiction over nonportable, or
``fixed,'' rides _ roller coasters, whirling devices, water rides
and the like _ to the individual states to inspect and regulate. At
this time, legislatures in 42 states have established some
oversight of amusement rides, according to the Federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission, and 8 states have none: Alabama, Kansas,
Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The state laws have some relationship to the importance of
amusement parks to a state's economy. Florida, for example, home of
Disney World, Universal Studios Escape, Busch Gardens, Sea World
and Wet 'n Wild, has a law that exempts from inspection permanent
facilities with 1,000 full-time employees that maintain an
inspection staff approved by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Isadore Rommes, head of the Bureau of Fair Rides Inspections in
the Florida Department of Agriculture, says his bureau inspects 120
to 125 smaller parks twice a year, as well as mobile rides. ``We
think we have the most stringent law in the United States,'' he
said. Since 1987, there have been no recorded deaths on fixed rides
in Florida but two on mobile rides and two on rides whose status
was not known.
</P>
<P>
   California has 72 permanent theme parks and 48 roller coasters,
the most of any state. But although it has had 15 ride-related
deaths in 25 years, its law has remained as it was in 1968, with
mandatory inspections only for mobile rides and aerial tramways.
</P>
<P>
   However, this year the legislature was still in session in
August, when the four ride deaths occurred nationally, and on Aug.
25, when the Boomerang ride at Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo
stuck, stranding 28 people above the ground in 100-degree heat for
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators had before them since January a bill presented
by Tom Torlakson, a democratic assemblyman from Antioch, in the
East Bay area, to end the exemption for permanent rides. It was
Torlakson's second attempt with such a bill, and there had been
three other efforts since 1979, when there was a rash of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of the legislature, Torlakson's Assembly Bill
850 was approved. ``It was unfortunate that we had such a
mysterious rash of accidents,'' Torlakson said. ``But they raised
public awareness, and people began to ask why we were not
regulating this area. The bill was poised for passage this time,
but events clinched it.'' The assembly confirmation vote was 66 to
6.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis said he looked forward to signing a bill to
enhance consumer safety. His signature will mean that beginning
Jan. 1 all permanent amusement parks will be checked annually. Los
Angeles County, which performs its own inspections, is not covered
by this law.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency's summary also shows that six states with
regulations do not have government employees conduct inspections,
but assign this to insurance companies or other private
organizations. These are Arizona, Minnesota, Mississippi, New
Mexico, Tennessee and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The amusement park industry often describes its rides as less
hazardous than the automobile trip the family may take to get to
the park. Noting that there were 900 million rides taken in 1998,
John Graff, president of the International Association of Amusement
Parks and Attractions, said that the possibility of being injured
seriously enough to be hospitalized was 1 in 25 million and the
possibility of being killed was 1 in 450 million.
</P>
<P>
   It also compared 43 deaths listed by the government Consumer
Product Safety Commission since 1987 to the 141 people killed by
air bags in cars since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Although it does not regulate most of the rides, the safety
commission compiles data on ride-related deaths through death
certificates, hospital records and news reports. The injury
statistics are developed from the National Electronic Injury
Surveillance System, which sorts through hospital emergency room
data by codes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, 1987, to June 30, 1999, the agency's list of 43
deaths linked to amusement rides _ deaths of employees are excluded
_ included 21 children under 16.
</P>
<P>
   The reports for 1998 and '99, the agency said, are still
incomplete, but the agency said the largest group of deaths, 11 in
the 1987-99 period, involved roller coasters. Whirling rides like
the one at Coney Island were involved in 10 deaths, water rides in
4, trains in 3 and Ferris wheels in 2.
</P>
<P>
   The agency noted a trend toward increased injuries from 1994 to
1998, which may be a result only of an increase in the number of
rides and riders, or may have additional causes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the agency estimated, there were 9,200 amusement-park
injuries treated in emergency rooms: 2,100 involving mobile rides,
4,500 fixed rides and 2,600 where the type of ride was not known.
The agency estimated that 0.8 percent of these injuries required a
hospital stay, a very low rate since the overall hospitalization
rate for all areas was about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agency gathers and publishes amusement park injury
and death figures, as it does for other sorts of products, it has
no power to investigate or link injuries and deaths to four
potential causes: consumer behavior, operator behavior, mechanical
failure or design limitation.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Brown, chairwoman of the product safety commission,
describes herself as frustrated. A number of officials in the
industry, including a spokesman for the International Association
of Amusement Parks and Attractions and a spokesman for the Six
Flags theme park company, say that rider behavior _ ``horseplay,''
one spokesman called it _ is at fault in more than 75 percent of
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know if there is a pattern,'' Ms. Brown said.
``The industry can say something, and they may be right and they
may not be right. We need federal oversight of amusement park
rides. We need to do what we do in other areas. We need on-site
surveys, so we can come up with recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said her agency considered children a major concern.
``When a product is investigated,'' she said, ``we separate out the
cases involving children under 5 and work on what needs to be done,
and then at the next level and so on.'' In the cluster of four
deaths last month, there were two children, one 8, who died with
her mother in the roller coaster in New Jersey, and a disabled
12-year-old, who died on the Drop Zone, a ride at Paramount's Great
America in California.
</P>
<P>
   The amusement park trade organization has been fighting on
several fronts to avoid injuries and to improve its reputation.
Boyd F. Jensen, a lawyer who serves on the safety committee of the
amusement park group, said his group was pressing states to adopt
``patron safety laws'' and that 15 jurisdictions had. ``There are
three causes of injuries,'' he said, ``customer behavior, operator
behavior and mechanical safety. These last two are heavily
regulated but there aren't any laws that attempt to regulate the
behavior of patrons. We are just trying to even the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen's model laws provide civil penalties for patrons who
interfere with rides or do not comply with posted rules. ``People
need to know there will be a consequence if they cause accidents,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel L. Cliff, a spokesman for the amusement parks group, which
has a convention in Atlanta in November, said that guidelines for
safety signs were being worked on. One version adopts the three
shapes and colors used in skiing because, the literature said, it
is logical to have a uniform standard for all forms of recreation.
A ``mild thrill attraction'' would have a round green sign, a blue
square would indicate ``moderate thrills'' and a black diamond,
``high thrills.''
</P>
<P>
   One version of a black diamond sign had this text: ``High speeds
with extremely unusual and stressful physical forces. This ride
contains startling and unexpected thrills appropriate only for the
most healthy and physically able riders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission's directory of state
amusement ride safety officials can be read on the commission's Web
site at www.cpsc.gov. Or a copy of the information for a particular
state may be obtained by sending a request and a stamped
self-addressed envelope to the commission, whose address is simply
Washington, D.C. 20207.

MORTON UPSTAGES McCULLOUGH FOR USC 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One of the pressing questions to emerge from USC's
narrow victory over San Diego State is what happened to freshman
tailback Sultan McCullough?
</P>
<P>
   After rushing for 83 yards in 17 carries against Hawaii,
McCullough carried the ball just three times for 10 yards against
the Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In (McCullough's) case, I felt like Chad Morton was having a
good game,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``Nothing against Sultan
at all. It was a close game.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton gained 91 yards in a career-high 30 carries against San
Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad's going to go as much as he can go. I never felt at any
time that he needed to rest,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton thought the Trojans had difficulty running because San
Diego State's defense had more players rushing than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the plays got messed up because they brought an extra
guy we couldn't block,'' Morton said. ``It was a great job by their
defensive coordinator. He knew when we were going to run the ball
and brought an extra guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes probably out: Wide receiver Windrell Hayes doesn't expect
to be available for Saturday's game against Oregon, but his first
thought after spraining his right ankle Saturday while delivering a
block was the fear that the injury was more serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to hold back the tears,'' Hayes said. ``I had all kinds
of stuff going through my mind. I'm just looking forward to
rehabilitation now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky call: One play that worked in USC's favor was a no-call on
an incomplete pass from Carson Palmer to Morton in the fourth
quarter, with the Trojans leading 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Morton was behind the line of scrimmage, and the play was
technically a lateral, meaning it should have been a live ball with
two San Diego State players nearby. But the officials ruled the
play an incomplete pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they missed that,'' Hackett said. ``It looked like a
fairly quick whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Right place, right time: Cornerback Kris Richard had two
interceptions against San Diego State, and was grateful for his
good fortune since both came on poorly thrown passes from
quarterback Jack Hawley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing my assignment, and it was like, `Oh look. A nice
gift. A gift from God,' '' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State game time: Kickoff for the Oct. 2 game against
Oregon State at the Coliseum will be 3:30 p.m. The game will be
televised on Fox Sports West 2.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Hackett had this analysis of USC's performance
against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked like a team playing its first game,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Palmer, Hackett felt the sophomore had a good game,
despite two interceptions that were not entirely his fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't play as crisp a game as the game before but it's
hard to,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed 14 of 16 passes in Hawaii, and 16 of 24 passes
against San Diego State.

ADVERTISING: 5 STARS FOR SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike the world's fanciest hotels and restaurants, car
dealerships are hardly the kinds of places people think of as
rating five stars, where how people are treated matters as much as
what they've come to buy.
</P>
<P>
   But DaimlerChrysler is spending big bucks _ more than $30
million _ on a new advertising campaign by Bozell Worldwide, a unit
of Bozell Inc., to try to change that perception, at least for its
4,500 dealers nationwide. More important, the ad campaign reflects
the company's response to the changing environment for car dealers,
who have come under pressure in recent years as auto superstores
like Car Max have come on the scene, and again as more people try
to buy cars on the Internet to avoid repeating bad experiences in
car dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler will try to harness its vast purchasing power to
offer dealerships that treat customers right the chance to save
money by buying goods and services through the auto company. The
savings could amount to $500 a vehicle, a collective $1 billion in
the first couple of years, according to James Holden,
DaimlerChrysler's executive vice president for sales and marketing.
``This can be huge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most automakers have been experimenting with dealer
relationships in the United States _ from buying up car dealerships
and grouping them together to create superstores to taking them
public to selling cars through the Internet. DaimlerChrysler
studied all of their attempts, and has finally settled on a
strategy. Instead of possibly angering its dealers by sidestepping
them with Internet sales and corporate ownership, it will hold out
several carrots to encourage them to provide better customer
service for new car buyers as well as those bringing cars in for
oil changes or repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Dealerships willing to spend time and money training employees
and spiffing up showrooms are given the so-called Five Star rating,
and only dealers with that rating qualify for a number of goodies.
Advertisements like those to be introduced this weekend will
encourage buyers to look for the Five Star signs; Internet
inquiries will be referred only to Five Star dealers, and most
important, Five Star dealers can cut their costs by buying supplies
_ from phone service to office supplies to health insurance _
through DaimlerChrysler. Other automakers have more of an
arm's-length relationships with dealers.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's American dealers spend $40 billion a year
buying goods and services, not including cars, nearly as much as
the $44 billion a year DaimlerChrysler spends in North America. All
dealers will initially be allowed to buy products and supplies
using negotiated discounts from the company's procurement team _
Chrysler was known for its ability to winnow costs from suppliers
before its merger with Daimler last year. But within two years,
dealers who want to use the service must be certified as Five Star
dealers or lose eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The new effort, called Five Star Market Centers, is now being
tested at 10 dealers in Indianapolis and will roll out nationwide
in the next 12 months. To illustrate the potential savings, Holden
told of an initial meeting with a national telephone-service
provider in which the phone company offered to drop its preferred
rate by 40 percent for affiliated car dealerships. ``We believe we
have the makings of a competitive advantage that is not readily
copyable,'' he said. Dealers selling former Chrysler company brands
_ Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth and Jeep _ will be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler hopes that by promising to save dealers money,
they will buy in to the changes the company wants them to adopt.
``This is a change in the culture at our dealerships that must be
bought into,'' said M. John McDonald, DaimlerChrysler's senior vice
president for sales and service.
</P>
<P>
   To become Five Star certified, dealerships must follow 350
steps, including sending sellers to special training in customer
service and agreeing to follow certain processes for selling cars.
So far, after a two and a half year effort, 1,600 of the 4,500
dealers eligible have qualified, and 400 more are expected by
year's end. Ten have fallen off the wagon and been decertified,
Holden said.
</P>
<P>
   Television ads will start on Sunday during an NFL football game
and on ``60 Minutes,'' and will then be shown in a rotation that is
intended to reach 95 percent of the target market, 25- to
54-year-old heads of households. The ad campaign is so heavy that
the company calculates that each person in the target group will
see the ads 17 times. There are two TV ads now, and three will be
added soon.
</P>
<P>
   Print ads will follow in Time, Newsweek, Forbes, Fortune,
People, Architectural Digest and other magazines, as well as in 37
local newspapers for four Sundays later this year. Starting next
Tuesday, there will also be ads in The Wall Street Journal and USA
Today. And radio ads will run in 20 large markets.
</P>
<P>
   One television ad shows dealership employees working together to
get a customer's car ready quickly, and uses a motif of employees
tossing his keys to each other with impeccable timing.
``Introducing Five Star: a new approach to selling and servicing
cars and trucks,'' an announcer intones. The tagline is: ``Five
Star. It's better. We'll prove it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marketing experts said the ads would probably speak to dealers
as much as to potential customers. ``It is going to make the
dealers feel pretty proud,'' said Jan Thompson, chief executive of
Designory Inc., a marketing firm based in Long Beach, Calif. that
specializes in building automotive brands. ``That would make me, if
I weren't one of those dealers, want to be one.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said dealers should already want to be Five Star
dealers because the elite dealer group is more profitable. Five
Star dealers, on average, earn a 4.6 percent return on sales, while
other dealers for DaimlerChrysler and other companies typically
earn between 2 percent and 2.5 percent, Holden said.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the ads was a challenge because the Five Star
certification amounts to a business process. ``Advertising a
process is very, very difficult,'' said A.C. Liebler,
DaimlerChrysler's senior vice president for marketing. ``It can be
duller than dog food.'' In fact, one of Bozell's ad campaigns was
panned by dealers and was scrapped, Liebler said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said it would spend as much on these ads as it
spent on ads introducing a new car, and Liebler confirmed the
amount was well above $30 million. DaimlerChrysler spent $1.4
billion on advertising for all its brands in 1997 and 1998, and
spent $734 million in the first six months of this year, according
to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU that tracks
advertising spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Five Star name has been used by the company since the 1960s,
but was less widespread and did not refer to the same rigorous
customer satisfaction program. And of course Chrysler's corporate
symbol has been a pentastar since 1963.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Even in France, surrendering to a hostile takeover is
not tantamount to the next French Revolution. Nevertheless,
Philippe Jaffre sounded eerily like Marie Antoinette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was preparing a cake, but now we have bread,'' said Jaffre,
chairman of the French oil conglomerate Elf Aquitaine SA. ``It is a
good bread, OK Now we have to accommodate and make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre is about to lose his job, not his head. Last week, after
a two-month takeover battle, he reluctantly agreed to let his
company be acquired for $48 billion by its upstart French-Belgian
rival, Totalfina SA.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will bring the end of what was until recently France's
state-owned oil company. It will also elevate Thierry Desmarest,
the combative chairman of Totalfina, to the top ranks of the world
oil industry. The new company, which has yet to be named, will be
the world's fourth-largest petrochemical company and will have
revenue of about $70 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And once Elf is digested, there may be more. ``In the medium
term, I would say that if we have a good opportunity we would try
to take these opportunities,'' Desmarest said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal also highlights the fissures that still divide
European oil producers. In the wake of mammoth oil mergers around
the world, as well as Europe's steady march toward a single market,
European oil companies are scrambling to consolidate as well. Yet
they remain riven by issues of national pride and their heritage as
former state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Desmarest surprised the industry in July by making a
hostile takeover bid for Elf, Jaffre was trying to hammer out a
friendly merger with Italy's dominant oil company, Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi SpA, or ENI.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks failed in part because of skittishness in Italy,
where the government owns a 37 percent stake in ENI. But they also
ran afoul of the French Ministry of Finance, which adamantly
opposed any deal between Elf and a foreign oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Desmarest takes command of Elf, many questions remain
unanswered. Is it better to be a strong national producer or a
European producer? Are more mergers on the horizon? And will
Desmarest be able to deliver the savings and ``synergies'' he has
promised?
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest _ whose corner office in La Defense, the jumbled
complex of post-World War II office buildings on the western edge
of Paris, provides a clear view of Elf's glass tower just a few
blocks away _ is clearly in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred to start with a friendly deal, but we
got the sense that it was urgent because the consolidation in the
oil industry was taking place so fast,'' he said. ``If your larger
competitors are four or five times larger in terms of market cap,
then you are in danger of losing your independence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Desmarest is far more than a defensive player. Less than two
years ago, he was buried deep in the second tier of the world's oil
producers as chairman of what was then simply Total SA. The company
was a distant second in size to Elf, which had once been France's
state-owned oil company.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed abruptly last December, when Desmarest carried
off a brash deal to acquire the Belgian company Petrofina SA in a
stock transaction worth $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal dramatized the contrast between Desmarest's
buccaneering penchant for risk and Jaffre's focus on fiscal
orthodoxy. Jaffre, at Elf, had been negotiating with Petrofina and
its biggest shareholder, Albert Frere. But Jaffre balked at Frere's
demands on price and the talks bogged down last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a major opportunity, Desmarest began his own talks with
Frere last June and soon reached a deal to pay what was then a 40
percent premium over the market price for Petrofina. The takeover,
which was completed this summer, suddenly catapulted Total to a
size bigger than Elf.
</P>
<P>
   The new Totalfina had sales last year of 35 billion euros, or
$36.3 billion, compared with 32.2 billion euros, or $33.5 billion,
at Elf.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre was convinced that Total was wildly overpaying. ``It was
an unacceptable price to me,'' he said in an interview here. ``It
would have been destroying shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   Many investors were rattled as well. Totalfina's stock slumped
badly in the first six months of this year amid anxiety that the
shares had been too heavily diluted.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts believe Desmarest viewed the deal more as a
stepping stone toward a much bigger target _ the takeover of Elf
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest demurred on that question. As it happened, however,
Totalfina began its unsolicited takeover bid for Elf on July 5,
just one working day after Total and Petrofina formally completed
their exchange of shares.
</P>
<P>
   The hostile bid apparently caught Elf executives by surprise.
Executives on both sides confirmed that Jaffre had been pinning his
hopes on a deal in Italy with ENI.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages, according to those who supported such a deal,
were that the Italian company had many exploration and production
sites in the same parts of Africa as Elf, particularly in Libya,
Gabon and the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre also believed, executives said, that a cross-border deal
would form the start of a more European network.
</P>
<P>
   But Desmarest, willing to take the plunge when Jaffre deferred,
won points for boldness. When worldwide oil prices abruptly jumped
earlier this year, his acquisition of Petrofina suddenly looked
much cheaper and smarter and Totalfina's shares recovered their
lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Elf was also plagued with image problems thanks to a series of
scandals under the company's previous chief executive, Loik le
Floch-Prigent.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre, who took over in 1993, put Elf through a painful
overhaul accompanied by big reductions in staff and the sale of
poorly performing businesses. Yet Elf still had a reputation as
sluggish and bureaucratic, while Total had burnished its image as a
fully private enterprise that was more competitive and responsive
to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Desmarest had strong support from the
French government. Before starting his takeover attempt, he
outlined the plan to the French finance minister, Dominque
Strauss-Kahn, as well as to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest, according to the French newspaper Les Echos, actually
accompanied Jospin on a trip to Moscow to get his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Because both Strauss-Kahn and Jospin were eager to promote a
French national champion, they quickly blessed Total's offer and
quietly cautioned Jaffre against looking for a foreign partner that
could serve as a white knight.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Jaffre was trapped. Though Elf began a so-called
Pac-Man defense _ a counteroffer to take over Total for about $52
billion worth of Elf stock _ institutional investors strongly
preferred Desmarest's deal. That was because the premium offered by
Elf was based largely on the run-up in its own share price as a
result of the Total bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way that any institutional investor would have
taken the Elf offer,'' one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Jaffre forced Desmarest to raise his original
offer from $42 billion to $48 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Sept. 13, Jaffre will step down as soon
as the merger is complete and Desmarest will take over.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say the new company will be able to significantly
slice its costs in refining and sales. The two companies each have
three refineries in France and numerous others elsewhere in Europe.
They also have more than 12,000 service stations across Europe,
half of them in France.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the potential savings promised by Desmarest are surprisingly
modest _ slightly more than $1.5 billion. In deference to French
government objections to job reductions, the company plans to
eliminate only 2,000 of the 65,000 people it employs in France and
another 2,000 others worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts assume Desmarest will have to shut down at least
one refinery in France and perhaps others around Europe. But that
will ignite a storm of protest, and Elf has already been plagued
with strikes this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people believe the potential savings are well above two
billion euros,'' said Nick Davies, an oil industry analyst at J.P.
Morgan. ``The difficulty is knowing how long it would take to
deliver those savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest says he is merely being conservative. ``We had a very
strong conviction that this was the right fit, the right choice,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the merger, Totalfina will hardly have a lock on the
market. The combined company would have about 27 percent of the gas
stations in France and about 12 percent of the European retail
market as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The new company's daily production, about two million barrels a
day, would be about half that of the proposed merger between Exxon
and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Desmarest is betting on the future strength of
oil prices. His plan calls for raising oil production 6 percent a
year, three times the pace of the market as a whole. The plan
assumes that oil prices, which have soared to more than $22 a
barrel from $10 since the beginning of this year, will stabilize
somewhere about $15 or $16 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, meanwhile, are convinced Desmarest is hungry for other
oil companies, and speculation remains intense about a deal with
ENI or perhaps Compania Espanola de Petroleos SA of Spain, known as
Cepsa, in which Elf holds a minority stake.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear if such deals are feasible. Elf and ENI,
for example, had comparable stock market capitalizations and could
have pursued a politically palatable merger of equals. But
Elf-Totalfina will be much bigger, which could easily raise
national hackles in Italy about a foreign takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest, now that he has raced to swallow Elf, said he was no
longer in such a hurry. Outside of North America, where the French
companies have little presence, his company has power comparable to
the new supermajors like BP Amoco or the proposed Mobil-Exxon
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not absolutely necessary for us to have another big
phase of consolidation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest showed little interest in American companies like
Chevron or Texaco, which have been left out of the recent mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Totalfina plans to sell off Petrofina's network of
American gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   But once Elf is digested, he may be interested in further
acquisitions. Meanwhile, some analysts are quietly worried that
Elf-Totalfina may already be stretched too thin. Elf is a big
producer and refiner in Africa, while Totalfina is a big producer
in the Middle East, Indonesia and South America. Though that
provides a huge portfolio of reserves, it could also prove
unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management has got to show us it is up to the job,'' said Sue
Graham, an industry analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. ``It is not
a question of being able to compete. It's a question of management
realizing that it has a different sized company. Can it face up to
the fact that some of the assets no longer belong there?''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre, looking gaunt and weary in the wake of his unsuccessful
battle against Desmarest, says he would have liked another outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first choice for Elf was making it a European champion, not
a French champion,'' he said. ``With another European company, the
synergies would have been greater.'' &QL;

JAPAN, WITHOUT THE URBAN SPRAWL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All my sons wanted to do was look for arrowheads and old swords,
not old sun goddesses. But legend had it that the sun goddess had
hiked up the same trail we were on, 2,000 years earlier, and so I
urged my sons, Gregory and Geoffrey, to keep a sharp lookout for
anything she might have left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Perking up at the thought that a Japanese sun goddess would come
equipped with an amazing sword, they scrutinized the faint trail
closely. It seemed vaguely plausible to my 7- and 4-year-olds that
they might find something because the trail appeared to have been
scarcely used in the last couple of thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   A faint path through the cedar and cypress forests to a holy
Shinto mountain, the trail was marked with signs and blazes, but we
never saw other hikers on that trail or any other hiking path in
the area on our most recent visit in May.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the attractions of Omiya, a traditional little
farm town in the lovely hills of Mie Prefecture in central Japan.
In a country famous for its crowds and skyscrapers, Omiya is a
refuge of hiking trails, bicycle paths, rice paddies, tiny shrines
and lake-speckled forests. It marries Japan's ancient history and
culture with a fabulous landscape, and so in the last four years
living in Tokyo, Omiya has become my refuge from the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, there is nothing special about Omiya. It is simply
a group of farming hamlets, with a total population of 5,700,
separated by rice paddies and tea plantations. The homes are
sturdy, old-fashioned buildings with tile roofs and tatami floors,
all connected by winding narrow lanes and interspersed with tiny
shops and shrines.
</P>
<P>
   Few Japanese have ever heard of Omiya (this town should not be
confused with the well-known city of the same name on the outskirts
of Tokyo). I ``discovered'' the smaller Omiya only because a
childhood friend had been living there for a couple of years,
teaching English at the local junior high school.
</P>
<P>
   At first I came to Omiya strictly for work, writing an
occasional series for The New York Times about life in small-town
Japan. But gradually I found myself falling in love with Omiya, and
when I brought my wife and children, they felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans pass through Japan, the two customary stops are
Tokyo and the ancient capital of Kyoto. Both are worthy
destinations, but they are also modern cities _ even Kyoto, once
you step outside of the temples, is a bustling metropolis where
kids eat at McDonald's _ and neither has the charm and beauty and
friendliness of traditional Japan.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems to me that friends visiting from America miss
something when they come to Japan on the Tokyo-Kyoto circuit, and
that is the traditional loveliness of Japan as it is lived in rural
areas, a loveliness that abounds in little farm towns like Omiya.
</P>
<P>
   That is why I urge visitors to get out and visit some small
town. My fondness for Omiya may arise from the similarities with
the farm town in Oregon where I grew up, or from its combination of
history and hiking, charm and convenience. Less than four hours
from Tokyo or three hours from Kyoto, it is tucked into a valley
surrounded by jutting green hills of dense forests.
</P>
<P>
   The area still has deer, Japanese antelope and wild boar, and
although the last confirmed wolf kill in Japan was early in this
century, there are still tales that some wolves have survived in
these wild hills of Mie.
</P>
<P>
   For all the wildness in the hills, the valleys have been
inhabited for 10,000 years or more, and there are several
archeological sites in Omiya of the Jomon people who lived in Japan
between 2,000 and 12,000 years ago. At one of the digs, experts
have recreated a Jomon house, and the pleasant little Omiya museum
displays some of the Stone Age tools that have been discovered in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The most important deity in Japan is the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu,
supposedly the ancestor of the emperors. One local legend has it
that Amaterasu herself came to Omiya a bit more than 2,000 years
ago and stayed for a few months, even climbing Noritoyama, the hill
that I climbed with Gregory and Geoffrey.
</P>
<P>
   Another version of the legend is that the visitor was not
Amaterasu herself but Princess Yamatohime, who is supposed to have
wandered through Mie two millennia ago to look for a place to build
a shrine for Amaterasu. There is considerable doubt about whether
either Princess Yamatohime or her father, Emperor Suinin, ever
existed, and even if they did the dates are hundreds of years too
early to be plausible.
</P>
<P>
   But legends are often more interesting and powerful than
history, and these tales had drawn me and my family toward
Noritoyama.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, I found the trail and tried to climb to the top
with Gregory, but we ran out of time and had to turn back. On our
most recent visit, all three of us got to the top _ a two- to
three-hour hike round trip along a steep trail, occasionally
crawling over or under trees that have fallen over the path _ and
at the summit we looked out over the surrounding countryside just
as the princess may once have done. Or perhaps as Amaterasu herself
did.
</P>
<P>
   For on top is a marker, erected in 1890, declaring in Japanese:
``This historic spot was visited by the Great Goddess Amaterasu.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other hiking trails in Omiya, all of them deserted
while we were there. One of the best and most historic is the old
Ise-Kumano Road, which for hundreds of years was the main road in
the region. Samurai warriors and peasants hiked this road together,
since Japan did not have horse carriages and was never much for the
wheel until modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks like nothing more than a forest trail or an old
logging road, for it is unpaved and abandoned. But in places the
old stone walls are still visible along the side, and it is a bit
eerie to walk quietly along through the forests and realize that it
was once the major thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, people came to Omiya mainly to visit the grand
shrine (Omiya means big shrine) in honor of Amaterasu. The shrine
is a branch of the more famous grand shrine in the nearby city of
Ise, and like the one at Ise it is torn down and rebuilt every 20
years in exactly the same fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The Omiya shrine, called Takihara Shrine, is set beside a lovely
river in the middle of a 140-acre woods with some of the biggest
cedar trees in Japan, some of them five feet in diameter. One of
the cedars fell in a typhoon in 1990 and turned out to be 340 years
old; it sold for lumber for $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Takihara Shrine is the most sacred in Omiya, but perhaps
more interesting is the nearby Kobenomiya, or Head Shrine. It was
founded in 1191 when some children found a severed head in the
nearby river and happily played with it. According to legend, the
head belonged to a powerful samurai warrior whose ghost became fond
of the children and threatened the nearby farmers with harm unless
they built a shrine in his honor at that location.
</P>
<P>
   So now the Head Shrine is a beautiful old wooden structure
beside the river, and it has become renowned for making people
smarter. Consequently, students come before university exams to pat
the holy boulder and sip the holy water and pray to the God of
Wisdom.

   For $50, the Shinto priests will even do a school-exam ceremony,
in which they pound on drums, ring bells, wave a stick over a
child's head and pray to the God of Wisdom for divine help on the
tests. The shrine has also diversified with a ``trickling breast
rock,'' a fountain that is supposed to resemble a breast oozing
milk. Nursing mothers come to drink the water and pray for more
milk.
</P>
<P>
   I confess that I bought a charm here a few years ago to make me
smarter, and it didn't do any good. But the Head Shrine is still
fun to visit, and the physical setting beside the rushing river is
delightful.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers and lakes abound in Omiya, and normal fishing is
permitted without a license. I haven't fished, but we picnicked
beside a river, and after lunch threw left-over sandwiches to hawks
that swooped down and gobbled them up. My kids were very impressed;
you can't do that in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   It was dusk when we drove back to the hillside cabins where we
were staying, passing paddies where old couples were planting their
rice, tea plantations where women were harvesting the leaves, tiny
roadside Jizo Buddhist sculptures to bring good luck, and the
traditional wooden Japanese homes with tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   At one cluster of homes, a group of men were going door to door,
doing the lion dance in front of each house to bring fortune and
prosperity. Groups do the lion dance in Omiya twice each year, once
at the New Year and once in the rice-planting season, when I saw
it.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades from now, the hiking trails may be crowded with
backpackers, and Omiya will have its own McDonald's. For now,
however, it is still a refuge from city life and a window into an
ageless Japan where Amaterasu lingers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting There &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Omiya, too small to be on many maps, is 25 miles southwest of
Ise, a major city. Whether coming from Tokyo or Kyoto, the easiest
way to get there is by taking the bullet train first to Nagoya, a
major city, and then taking local trains for two hours. There is no
station called Omiya; the best stop is Takihara, the main hamlet in
Omiya.
</P>
<P>
   Trains to Takihara run only a few times a day, so it may be
easier to take a local train to Misedani and then a taxi (about
$10) to Takihara.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can take a train to Matsusaka from Nagoya and rent a car
there, if you have an international license. But remember that
Japanese drive on the left and that signs are often only in
Japanese. It may be easier to get around Omiya either by taxi or on
foot or bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in Takihara is walkable, and from Takihara Station it
is about 10 minutes on foot to the town-run Cycling Terminal, which
rents bicycles for $7.50 a day (at 107 yen to the dollar). The
terminal also offers maps to four bike routes, taking from one to
five hours each. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have usually stayed with friends in private homes in Omiya,
but the simplest place to stay is probably the Cycling Terminal,
with rooms in both Western and Japanese style (a tatami floor, and
you sleep on a futon). Prices range from $14 to $33 a person, less
for children. The rooms are clean and serviceable, but toilets are
outside in a corridor.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cafeteria and also a wonderful Japanese-style bath
(separate facilities for men and women) on the ground floor in
which to soak away the pains of the day with other travelers. The
Cycling Terminal telephone number is (81-5988) 62501, but you will
not find anybody there who speaks English.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in the outdoors, a better alternative is
Hanashino, a hillside resort just above the town. Hanashino, where
I have stayed a few times, is about a 10-minute walk from Takihara.
There are three cabins along a creek, with hiking trails in every
direction. The cabins vary in size, accommodating four to eight
people, and each has air-conditioning, television and a
refrigerator. The toilets are outside and the kitchen is shared.
The price is $37.50, less for children. Guests must do their own
cooking, or Hanashino will prepare barbecue meals to eat in a
pleasant spot.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, guests can walk to one of the several restaurants
in the area, or Hanashino can arrange delivery from those
restaurants. Families can bathe together at a Japanese-style
hot-springs bath; my kids loved it. Hanashino's number is (81-5988)
63061, fax (81-5988) 62052; someone can read an English fax but no
one seems to answer the phone. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Activities &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Canoeing and kayaking can be arranged if you are accompanied by
a Japanese speaker. An American friend whose hobby is metal
detecting has found the Omiya area a treasure trove: he has
discovered countless ancient coins, 16th-century bullets, bits of
swords and other odds and ends. There are also several public
tennis courts, usually empty.
</P>
<P>
   Since few people speak much English, getting around Omiya may be
a bit difficult, so be prepared to get lost. The signs pointing the
way to the trail to Noritoyama peak are all in Chinese characters.
You can get someone to write the characters on paper so you get
help in being directed to the right trail. People are very warm and
helpful in trying to figure out what you want.
</P>
<P>
   None of Omiya's restaurants are particularly high class; all are
typical little Japanese restaurants offering the equivalent of
family cuisine for less than $10 a person. Right in Takihara there
is a soba noodle restaurant called Shichifuku. Then nearby there
are a couple of others: a restaurant made of logs called Marutanbou
that offers some Japanese versions of Western food, and a pleasant
little place called Okura that offers sushi and other foods; my
favorite dish at Okura is the Tororo Teishoku, with various foods
made out of a grated yam substance called tororo.
</P>
<P>
   None of these restaurants has a street address or employees who
can speak English on the phone, but Omiya is small enough that it's
easy for foreigners simply to ask to be pointed in the right
direction.

HEARINGS ON RUSSIAN MONEY MOVES ARE LIKELY TO BE PARTISAN
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: N.C., Iowa)  (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress opens hearings this week into
allegations of Russian corruption and money laundering, lawmakers
expect an extremely partisan fight over President Clinton's
policies, as well as an examination of the effects on American and
international financial systems.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the House Banking Committee's first session on
Tuesday, the witnesses will include top administration officials,
banking executives and a member of the Russian parliament. The
panel plans to explore how billions of dollars in Russian money
flowed through the Bank of New York and how it was used.
</P>
<P>
   At his request, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers will be the
first witness. He is certain to face stiff questioning about what
the administration knew about a federal criminal inquiry into the
reports of money laundering before they became public and what
steps it took to compel Russian leaders to crack down on
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the panel is to hear from the chairman and chief
executive of the Bank of New York, Thomas A. Renyi. People with
knowledge of the bank investigation say that $4.2 billion, and
possibly as much as $10 billion, went through Bank of New York from
early last year until last month, when The New York Times reported
on the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money laundering is a modest crime that reveals a far graver
circumstance, how that money was accumulated to be laundered,''
Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, who leads the banking committee, said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have noted, however, that some of the money may have
been deposited by importers who were trying to avoid Russian taxes
or through capital flight when the ruble neared collapse. Some
witnesses are widely expected to make those arguments to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said the goal of his hearings, which also are to examine
the role of the International Monetary Fund, should not be
perceived here or in Russia as a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But many other congressional Republicans said the hearings would
provide a stage to voice long-simmering criticisms that the
administration turned a blind eye to the corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the
administration's top Russia expert, will probably face hostile
questions from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other Republicans on
the Foreign Relations Committee. Republicans want to know whether
Talbott and other top American officials could have done more to
compel Russian leaders to stop corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several weeks, the House International Relations
Committee will hold hearings on American policy toward Russia,
including the close relationship between Vice President Al Gore and
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The panel will first
hold a closed briefing to hear an assessment from CIA Director
George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions are when did we lose Russia and why did we lose
Russia?'' Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., who heads the committee,
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   One task for the committees will be to sort out the legal from
the illegal, in both the money and the operations. That debate, and
the problems that the panels face, is reflected in a cable that the
American Embassy in Moscow sent to Washington this month.
</P>
<P>
   The cable, stamped sensitive and not for distribution to foreign
governments, outlines the schemes used by Russians to skirt Russian
laws in sending money out of the country and converting it into
U.S. dollars. The schemes are used by many, from individuals who
want to help relatives abroad or have a nest egg, just in case, to
large companies that use offshore shell companies to hide the
sources of the money, the embassy reported.
</P>
<P>
   But, the embassy continued, criminal groups also use the schemes
to disguise and launder illegal proceeds. And it cites a Russian
study that 33 percent of the so-called capital flight was illegal
money and that 37 percent was questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are also hoping to get to the bottom of what happened
at the Bank of New York, a highly sophisticated operation that
involved tens of thousands of electronic transfers and layers and
layers of companies, many registered on offshore islands. One
investigator said last week that there may not even be the
traditional paper trail.
</P>
<P>
   Even as lawmakers dig into their inquiries, the administration
is searching for measures to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The options under consideration include requiring American banks
to take a hard look at all their Russian customers and putting
pressure on President Boris Yeltsin to enact legislation to counter
laundering, or perhaps even to deny visas to Russians who are
implicated in siphoning of assets, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to appear active before Congress hits us with a
sledgehammer,'' said one administration official.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy to combat laundering, due this month, is being
amended, the official said, to have it go beyond the traditional
blue-collar laundering by drug dealers and to include what he
described as white-collar laundering. Those involve the electronic
transfers, from a variety of sources including government funds and
corporate assets, that have been found in the Bank of New York
case.
</P>
<P>
   But officials are not sanguine that the problem can be easily
fixed. American banks have steadfastly lobbied against laws that
would require them to investigate customers' backgrounds, and
pressure on Yeltsin could serve to fuel his political enemies, who
are even more resistant to reforms.

REPORT BY U.N. AGENCY ASKS TRADE OPENING TO THIRD WORLD
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Industrial nations must relax trade barriers and open
their markets to the developing world, lest Third World countries
be forced to rely on unpredictable foreign capital for economic
growth, the United Nations trade and development agency said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A study of some 40 developing countries showed increased trade
deficits and declining economic growth, the agency, the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, said in its annual
report. It urged that the concerns of poorer countries be the
centerpiece of forthcoming global trade negotiations, contending
that market access, not foreign capital, was the key to growth.
</P>
<P>
   Its concerns were seconded by the World Bank, which backed a
far-reaching trade round Monday _ including agriculture and
construction, areas of prime interest to emerging economies _ to
start at the World Trade Organization's ministerial meeting in
Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist for the World Bank, speaking to
reporters at a meeting on developing countries that was organized
along with the WTO, said that the ``liberalization of agriculture
should be a priority.'' Cutting back farm subsidies, a sensitive
political issue, particularly in Europe, is on the agenda of the
next round of trade negotiations, which is expected to last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank research indicated that a 40 percent reduction in
global agricultural export subsidies would be as effective as an
equal percentage reduction in manufacturing tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Nations agency's annual review, Rubens Ricupero,
head of the agency, said it had found that economic growth in the
1990s was an average of two percentage points below what it was two
decades ago. At the same time, trade deficits were, on average,
three points above their 1970s mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have the worst of two worlds,'' said Ricupero, a
former Brazilian finance minister. ``We have had a deterioration in
trade balances, and a very sharp deterioration in trade deficits,
whereas economic growth has been going downward.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``disturbing trend,'' he maintained, stems in large part
from the sluggish growth in industrial economies, especially Japan
and European Union nations. That, combined with other factors like
trade barriers, has made it hard for developing countries to
increase their exports enough to cover balance-of-payment deficits,
which have been created by a surge of imports.
</P>
<P>
   Predicted gains by Third World countries from trade
liberalization have not materialized in many cases, the 146-page
report said. Instead, there has been increased poverty and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Ricupero urged the advanced economies to ``work harder to
convince a sometimes skeptical public that there are direct
benefits, in terms of more jobs and rising incomes, from expanding
trade'' with developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Opening market access to them means lowering tariffs and
dismantling agricultural subsidies, which total some $350 billion _
twice developing nations' agricultural exports from 1996 to 1998,
according to the report. It cited European Union producers of dairy
products, who despite having the world's highest costs, have
retained a 50 percent share of the world market.
</P>
<P>
   Among other impediments to trade by Third World countries, the
report cited the use of health and safety standards to control
imports, antidumping procedures and increasing export restraints.

A KEY SERIES IN SEPTEMBER HAS THE FEEL OF OCTOBER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mets have been gazing at the scoreboard, staring at the
standings, watching the Braves on television and hearing more
questions about Tuesday night's series opener in Atlanta than a
17-year-old hears about prom night. This should be a memorable
experience, everyone tells the teen-ager. The Mets have heard that
same promise and should believe it, three times over.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mets were calm and some were giddy as they discussed their
enticing chance to finally overtake the Braves in the National
League East _ they are one game back, and Tuesday they begin a
three-game series in Atlanta _ a journey that officially began in
April. But, although many of the players have changed from last
season's fiasco of a finish and only John Franco has endured the
long stretch of exasperating seasons in Queens, the wait for this
chance started before 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been the premier team in the league over the
past decade, so, in essence, the Mets, who have not advanced to the
post-season in 11 years, have been pursuing them in some way for
the entire period. The Mets have not been this close to the Braves
this late in the season since Atlanta was shifted to the NL East in
1995, more reasons for hyping these three games and the three that
will be played next week at Shea Stadium. The setting provides more
reasons for the Mets to hope they can reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prudent approach is to not overestimate and overanalyze
these games because we still have a playoff spot to fall back on
with the wild card,'' Orel Hershiser said. ``But the secondary
thought is since the Mets' organization has been chasing Atlanta
for so long, that it sure would be nice to finish first.''
</P>
<P>
   First place would mean more to the Mets, who have the best
record in the major leagues since June 6, five games better than
the Braves. If the Braves faltered and ended their streak of seven
straight division titles, they could blame it on their shocking
spate of injuries and cite how their experience will help them in
the post-season, anyway, even if they are a wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, first place is about grabbing respect and
eliminating any belief that they are similar to last season's team,
an 88-victory squad that gagged by losing five consecutive games to
botch a one-game lead for the wild-card berth. As much as these
Mets have proved to be much better and much different than that
team and are on a pace to win 99 games, that image of last season's
failure will linger in some fashion until they reach the
post-season. Finishing ahead of the Braves, who have won the NL
East by a whopping average of 14 games in the last four years,
would be a major achievement for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought process before every series is winning the
series,'' Al Leiter said. ``It's the same way with this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone in this clubhouse is thinking about winning
the division. I hope everyone is focused on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Softly, yet firmly, John Olerud said: ``This is our opportunity
to go down and win it. We're going head to head. If we play them
well, we can win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Manager Bobby Valentine, who had danced around questions
about the Braves like a hyper Rockette before Sunday, sounded like
the boxing referee Mills Lane when he declared, ``Let's get it
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Of course, this will not be an easy chore for the Mets
since the Braves have their rotation aligned imposingly with John
Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux, all Cy Young award winners,
expected to start the three games. The Mets will counter with Rick
Reed, Hershiser and Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious yet unspoken concern for the Mets is starting
Reed in the first game because, since being activated, he has
surrendered seven earned runs on 13 hits and six walks in 10
innings (6.30 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   Reed has escaped with two no-decisions, but he cannot continue
allowing two base runners in an inning and expect to beat Atlanta.
Especially since the Mets have lost four of six games to the Braves
this season and eight of nine at Turner Field in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser said the Mets should treat the series ``like do-or-die
games,'' and compared the team to a high-wire act. But, instead of
walking on the wire without a net below, the Mets have a net in the
form of the wild card. But Mike Piazza warned that the Mets'
four-game bulge over the Reds is not invincible and said, ``If one
team comes out and takes the whole thing and Cincinnati is playing
good baseball, they could sneak up on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, besides one additional home game in the division
playoffs and possibly the League Championship Series, the Braves
and the Mets could also be fighting for a chance to face Randy
Johnson. If the post-season opened today, the Braves, as the
first-place team in the same division as the wild-card winner,
would oppose Arizona in a three-of-five-games series and face
Johnson twice. Yet, Leiter said: ``Randy can be dominant, but you
have to win a maximum amount of games. You can't try to map out
your post-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite appropriately, that has been done for the Mets and the
Braves in the regular season. The two finest teams in the NL East
will play six times in the next 10 days, giving September an
October feeling and giving the Mets the sweet chance that they have
pursued throughout the 1990s. For the Mets, a prom night of sorts
is finally here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure would be more fun to answer questions about catching
Atlanta and we can say, `Isn't that great?' instead of `Do you guys
feel like you're second fiddle again because you're getting in by
the wild card?''' Hershiser said. ``It would be nice to make our
day a little easier.''

IN EAST PEORIA, AN INTOLERANCE FOR HATE
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ind., Pa., Idaho, Colo.)  (nk) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST PEORIA, Ill. _ For years, the hard-working residents of
this mostly white town on the eastern bank of the Illinois River
did not take seriously the white supremacist views of Matthew F.
Hale, 27, the son of a retired local policeman.
</P>
<P>
   They recall trying to ignore his leaflets and appearances on
public-access television. When he set up the headquarters of the
World Church of The Creator in his parents' home, some thought it
was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   But after the July 4 weekend, when Benjamin Smith, a former
World Church member, went on a two-state rampage against Jews,
blacks and Asian-Americans, killing two and injuring nine before
shooting himself, the laughter stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sickened,'' said Dennis Triggs, 54, the city attorney.
``We had the sense that benign neglect must come to an end.''
Triggs called Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law
Center, a non-profit civil rights organization, to ask what East
Peoria could do.
</P>
<P>
   Dees sent Triggs and Mayor Charles Dobbelaire, 59, a copy of the
center's publication ``Ten Ways to Fight Hate,'' and advised East
Peoria city leaders to do two things: Speak out immediately and
form a broad-based coalition on race issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dees also put East Peoria leaders in touch with the Rev. David
Ostendorf, a United Church of Christ minister in Chicago who leads
the Center for a New Community, a group dedicated to fighting white
supremacist ideas and organizations in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Ostendorf, who believes ``the only way this movement is going to
be stopped is if communities stand up and say no and organize to
oppose it,'' added a stop in East Peoria to a civil rights tour
that retraced Smith's deadly trip through Illinois and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, with members of Ostendorf's caravan and 200 local
residents present, the mayor announced that East Peoria, which has
only a few dozen non-whites in its population of 23,400, would set
up a Human Relations Commission ``to guide us in combating hate and
teaching tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not surrender the minds of our young to Matt Hale,''
Dobbelaire continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that still today there are those who believe we should
not attract attention to the hatemongers,'' he said. ``They believe
that if we quietly go about our everyday life, those who preach
hate will fade slowly into the night. I ask you this: If we do not
speak out, loud and clear, when the hate messages spewing forth
from this so-called church lead to death, then when do we speak
out?''
</P>
<P>
   Dobbelaire's speech was followed by a prayer vigil in front of
the Hale family home. On the other side of the ordinary, tree-lined
street, a neighbor had posted a sign saying ``Hate Has No Home
Here.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who grew up in East Peoria and said racial issues
rarely crossed his mind, appointed a new Human Relations Commission
on Aug. 17 and does not intend to let the matter drop. ``We're in
this for the long haul,'' he said. He wants the commission to
``oppose hate, preach tolerance and celebrate diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   East Peoria has survived severe blows before, the worst being
the closing of a Caterpillar tractor plant that had been the
cornerstone of the economy. But it has enjoyed a comeback in recent
years, with a new riverboat casino and jobs in entertainment,
tourism and service industries.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that their town might be seen as some kind of hate
capital horrified the mayor and the Human Relations commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really causing a bad image for our tri-county area,
not just East Peoria,'' said David Mingus, the commission chairman.
``It's unfortunate and unrealistic. Our towns are good towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Mingus, 48, a mental health professional, said the commission
intends to take a broad look at diversity and tolerance: ``We will
keep it open to all areas. It's something nobody has on the scope
all the time. We have to change attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the commission, Charles Randle, 53, who is
black, said he has lived in an upscale neighborhood of East Peoria
for 17 years with no difficulty. But Randle said he cannot forget
the searing experience of childhood on a cotton plantation in
Mississippi, where two of his brothers, then young boys, were once
jailed for supposedly whistling at a white woman. To escape that
life, their father, a sharecropper, moved his wife and 10 children
to Peoria, where he worked at a slaughterhouse and then started a
series of successful family businesses.

   Randle, the director of economic development for Illinois
Central College, said he sees the Human Relations Commission as a
chance for East Peoria ``to step outside the box and look around.''

<P>
   Other communities have made similar efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho's image began to worry the staff at Hewlett-Packard in
Boise several years ago, said Cindy Stanphill, the diversity and
staffing manager there. ``When we recruit, people know about Idaho
potatoes and the Aryan nations,'' she said. ``The image does not
necessarily represent the reality, but you have to deal with
both.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the Hewlett-Packard staff has tried to find
ways to insure that people they recruit and employ in Boise feel
welcome at work and in the community. Staff members are now trying
to organize an Idaho Inclusiveness Coalition, a group of major
employers and human rights groups to promote tolerance and
celebrate diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, the state's Human Relations Commission has
helped more than 50 communities form groups to do something about
hate. One group started in Boyertown, a historically all-white
community northwest of Philadelphia where the Ku Klux Klan
distributed recruitment literature once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Residents formed a unity coalition and asked citizens to pledge
5 to 50 cents for each minute the Klan spent in town. The money
went to civil rights groups and helped organize the town's first
rally to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the local Klan complained that the group, which was
collecting $1,051 an hour, was using the Klan's name to raise
money, said Louise Doskow, a member of the coalition. But the group
persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have raised over $11,000,'' Ms. Doskow said. ``We did it
every month for 13 months, then they didn't show up again for a
year. One person came to the corner at the end of June, so we did
another collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of these communities and others, collected by
Jim Carrier, a former Denver Post reporter, have been added to an
updated version of ``Ten Ways to Fight Hate.'' Carrier said the
Southern Poverty Law Center will distribute a million free copies
of the booklet and a companion, ``Responding to Hate at School.''
The booklets will go to every school principal, mayor and police
chief in the nation, as well as to human rights groups, religious
leaders and interested citizens.
</P>
<P>
   One group profiled, Coloradans United Against Hatred, formed
after an African immigrant was murdered by a skinhead in 1997.
Seeing the use of the Internet by hate groups, the group set up its
own Web site to offer an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we making a huge impact?'' said Anita Fricklas, the
Colorado director of the American Jewish Committee, which helped
underwrite the project. ``It's hard to know. But an impact?
Definitely.''

SECOND DEFENDANT GUILTY IN JASPER DRAGGING DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ A white supremacist who boasted that he was
``soaring like an eagle'' after the ``rush'' of chaining a disabled
black man to a pickup and dragging him to death near Jasper last
year was convicted of capital murder Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which included no black members, deliberated for four
hours before delivering its verdict against Lawrence Russell Brewer
Jr., 32. Jurors then returned to the courtroom to begin the
punishment phase of the trial, which continues Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, the second white man to be convicted in the June 7,
1998, slaying of James Byrd Jr., showed no reaction as state
District Judge Monte Lawlis read the verdict before a packed
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's father, siblings and other relatives who had sat in the
front row of the courtroom through five days of testimony nodded in
agreement, and some cried silently. Lawlis had warned spectators
against any verbal outbursts in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the family approached the courtroom rail
and hugged each of the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel as though a second weight has been lifted from our
shoulders,'' Byrd's sister, Mary Verrett, said outside the
courthouse. ``We knew from the beginning that the prosecution had a
very good case, a very strong case. It wasn't based on sympathy for
the Byrd family. It wasn't even based on the murder just alone by
itself. They had facts to show that this person enjoyed what he did
to my brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tortured and then he was killed, and they got much
satisfaction out of that,'' she said. ``So needless to say, the
Byrd family, we too, are satisfied right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Verrett said that while she expects Brewer to get the death
penalty, she and her family will again put their faith in the jury
and will accept whatever punishment it gives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relieved, that's the word,'' Jasper County District Attorney
Guy James Gray said, adding that the prosecutors were getting
nervous awaiting the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jasper returned the case against (Brewer's co-defendant)
Bill King, some people would say they were just trying to protect
themselves,'' he said. ``When you move it half way across the state
of Texas, and another jury returns a guilty verdict, it kind of
broadens the scope. It speaks for all the state of Texas I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is we're long past those days that we were
embarrassed by. Race relations have improved a whole lot and we
don't want to see them slide backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's defense team, Doug Barlow and Layne Walker of Beaumont,
left the courthouse without commenting, as did Brewer's brother,
John.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is expected to begin deliberating Wednesday on the
sentence for Brewer, the former ``Exalted Cyclops'' of the
Confederate Knights of America, a small prison gang affiliated with
the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   He faces either death by injection or a life prison sentence,
for which he would have to serve at least 40 years before becoming
eligible for parole. Gray agreed with the Byrd family that a death
sentence would be appropriate. ``I don't like the death penalty,''
he said, ``but that's what he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's former prison buddy and fellow racist, John William
``Bill'' King, 24, of Jasper, was convicted by a mostly white jury
in his hometown earlier this year and sent to death row. The third
defendant, 24-year-old Shawn Allen Berry of Jasper, will be tried
next month in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, whose trial was moved to Brazos County at lawyers'
request, spent more than four hours on the stand Friday in an
unsuccessful attempt to convince the jury that while he kicked Byrd
and spray-painted his face black, he did not kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said it was Berry who offered an intoxicated Byrd a ride
as he walked down Jasper's Martin Luther King Boulevard on his way
home from a friend's anniversary party.
</P>
<P>
   And, Brewer testified, it was Berry who killed the 49-year-old
father of three, slashing his throat with a knife, stripping him,
chaining him by his ankles to a pickup and dragging him more than
three miles through the East Texas woods.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments, Gray reminded jurors that Dr. Tommy
Brown, the pathologist who performed Byrd's autopsy, had testified
that Byrd's corpse showed no evidence of a knife wound.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had shown jurors more than a dozen color photos of Byrd's
remains and explained in graphic detail how Byrd had used his
elbows, knees and heels to shift his weight from side to side to
ease his pain and keep his head off the pavement as he was dragged
down a logging road and then a blacktop road east of Jasper. Byrd's
torture ended, Brown said, after two miles when his body slammed
into a concrete culvert, decapitating him.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's head, shoulder and right arm were found the next morning
in a ditch next to the culvert. The rest of his mutilated body was
found a mile down the road, outside the gates to a rural black
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was alive and he was conscious, and Shawn Berry didn't cut
his throat,'' Gray said. If he had, he said, Byrd's shirt and
undershirt would have been soaked with blood. There was no blood
found on either, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said Brewer's testimony was filled with lies and had a
recurring theme: ``Bad things happened to Russell and it wasn't his
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn Berry is not exactly a powerhouse,'' he said. ``It took
all three of these men to subdue James Byrd. One of them had to
hold him down while they put chains on his feet. He's not going to
take that without fighting with all his energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said Brewer had concocted his story in an effort to
convince the jury that his involvement in the killing was minimal
so he could escape the death penalty. In his version, Brewer
insisted that Berry chained Byrd and King unchained him, and he
indicated that Byrd may already have been dead when he was chained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell Brewer crafted his story to stay just short of a
capital offense,'' Gray said. ``He's not afraid of that
penitentiary. Out here on the street, he can't hold a job. He can't
do much of anything. But in that penitentiary, he's an officer,
he's a big shot. He's the Exalted Cyclops of a prison gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gray said his best evidence in the case was Brewer's DNA
found on a cigarette butt and beer bottle at the crime scene and
Byrd's blood on the defendant's tennis shoe. That evidence became
moot, however, when Brewer took the stand and admitted his
participation.
</P>
<P>
   And even before he testified, Brewer had written several
incriminating letters to friends and jailhouse notes to his
co-defendant, King. He called himself a ``star'' and said he was
``the hero of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In one note, intercepted by jailers as the three defendants sat
in the Jasper County Jail, Brewer assured King that they would both
go free, just like O.J. Simpson, if they could agree on a story and
blame Berry. And he mentioned the logging chain, wondering if
authorities would be able to pull their fingerprints from it.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Barlow said Gray had ``a very vivid
imagination'' about what happened the night of Byrd's killing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if jurors decided that Brewer was lying, he said, the state
still did not prove its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has proven that he was there, he has racist
tendencies and he popped off and bragged in his prison talk and
nothing more,'' Barlow said. ``You have to ask yourself, where is
the proof of who did what?''

MICROSOFT AND FORD IN WEB VENTURE FOR CAR BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Wyo.)  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A joint venture of Microsoft Corp. with Ford
Motor Co., offering built-to-order automobiles via the World Wide
Web, shows the potentially wrenching changes that electronic
commerce is bringing in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Monday, Microsoft and Ford executives
took pains to argue that their venture _ allowing online customers
to configure their own cars and obtain detailed information on
product availability _ would not displace the traditional role of
the car dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a world in which anyone is confused that the
virtual world will replace the physical world,'' said Steven
Ballmer, Microsoft's president. But he acknowledged that some car
dealers were skeptical that the new partnership would continue to
be a win-win situation for dealers as well as manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several dealers said they believed that Ford was quietly
trying to circumvent them, pre-empting their relationship with the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a classic battle, but we won't back
down,'' said Edwin Mullane, president of Ford Dealers Alliance, a
national organization representing 1,700 dealers, based in
Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do everything we can to protect ourselves and the
consumer,'' he said. ``The consumer has to be serviced and taken
care of. These guys at Microsoft don't even own a screwdriver.''
</P>
<P>
   Other dealers, however, expressed optimism that there was at
least as much potential for gain as risk in the rise of World Wide
Web commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about linking up with Ford,'' said Peter Greiner,
owner of Greiner Ford in Casper, Wyo. ``If we give our customers
the best Internet experience, they'll tell their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan outlined Monday, prospective buyers would enter
data about their preferences online and would be referred to
dealers through whom to negotiate a price and take delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers are concerned that by providing more information
about product availability, pricing and options, Ford may shift
power from the dealer to the car shopper, effectively lowering
profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement Monday, Microsoft said Ford had made an
undisclosed minority investment in Carpoint, the car-shopping
service that is one of the most popular features of Microsoft's
online service MSN.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Microsoft said it had entered into an agreement with
American Honda Motor Co. to license Microsoft's Dealerpoint
technology, which is part of the Carpoint service. Dealerpoint is
an online lead-management system to help dealers manage and respond
to prospective Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Honda agreement did not include an investment in
Carpoint, Ballmer said Microsoft was actively seeking investments
from other automakers. He also said that Microsoft would at some
point offer stock in Carpoint to the public, but that it had not
decided on the size of the offering.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford-Microsoft venture on Carpoint, as it was described
Monday, will directly link customers to Ford's manufacturing-system
database.
</P>
<P>
   That feature, which will be available on Carpoint beginning in
the first quarter of 2000, will transform the automobile business,
according to Jacques Nasser, Ford Motor Co.'s president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact is going to be huge,'' he said. ``This is a
different way of running our business.''
</P>
<P>
   By making information on product availability easily accessible
to customers, he went on, the service will put them in charge of
the transaction, and will ultimately increase customer
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Microsoft executives also said that consumer preference
information that Ford can obtain through the service was a
significant factor in its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said such information was vital for inventory and
manufacturing, as well as design decisions, and could significantly
reduce manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said that Microsoft did not plan to sell data on
individual customers' preferences, citing consumer privacy reasons,
and that it planned to make its aggregate information available to
Ford's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's commitment to consumer privacy was challenged by
at least one of the company's major online competitors.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft begins working with other carmakers, ``will Ford
have access to purchase requests?'' asked Mark Lorimer, president
and chief executive of Autobytel, a leading Internet car site. ``I
don't think it's clear from what they said today.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Ballmer said Carpoint now generates
140,000 referrals and $600 million in sales each month. Lorimer
said Autobytel generates $1.7 billion in auto sales a month based
on more than 200,000 referrals.

FAN GROUP HOPING NFL WILL ACCEPT ITS BID FOR JETS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Internet investment group formed last month to acquire the
Jets from the Leon Hess estate said Monday that it had received
pledges totaling $17.5 million from about 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The group, BuytheJets.com, has also received local political
support from New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, state
Controller H. Carl McCall and three members of Congress to persuade
the National Football League to change its rules to permit its bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are starting to think this can happen,'' John
Crotty, a co-founder of the group, said. ``The demand is there. Our
numbers are real.''
</P>
<P>
   However, NFL rules bar partnerships of more than 25 individuals
to own a team, and require that the general partner own at least 30
percent of the team. ``Their interest is flattering, but their
structure doesn't comply with our rules,'' Greg Aiello, a league
spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the league waives its rule to permit BuytheJets.com to
enter the bidding process, it will not receive the confidential
sale prospectus that other potential buyers have received from
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment bank handing the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty has held one meeting with Goldman, Sachs and said that
``we are encouraged by the recognition and optimistic about the
bid's potential.'' Crotty said his group wants to emulate the
publicly owned corporation that runs the Green Bay Packers, a
structure that has been grandfathered by the league but is
prohibited for anyone else. If the BuytheJets.com bid succeeds, the
fan-owners would elect a board of managers and name a president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple idea and the response has been overwhelming,''
Crotty said. Since going on line on Aug. 17, the BuytheJets.com Web
site has received 500,000 hits. At least week's season opener for
the Jets, about 8,000 ``Let Us Bid'' signs were handed out to fans
by 30 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the game, people wanted to give us cash,'' said Crotty, who
first suggested the idea of buying the team to his friend Peter
Lyons during a golf game on Memorial Day. ``We didn't know if
people wanted to do it, but they've been enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   With the price for the Jets expected to exceed $500 million,
Crotty said. his quixotic initiative must raise at least $180
million to become the majority owner of the team. He said the
fan-initiated bid would consider linking up with other bidders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a letter to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, Vallone said:
``We only ask that the people of New York be afforded the
opportunity to coordinate a bid for the Jets, and not be summarily
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``If fans are able to have a vested interest in their team, it
can only extend and enhance the traditions that define the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   In his response to Vallone, Tagliabue rejected the online bid as
a structure that ``presents many serious issues and concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote: ``We have found that stable, locally based ownership
of the sort that the Giants and Jets have had for so many years is
a model most likely to result in successful club operations that
advance the interests of fans and communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six potential buyers have signed confidentiality
agreements with Goldman, Sachs to read the financial prospectus.
Among the suitors are Charles F. Dolan, Cablevision's chairman;
John McMullen, owner of the NHL's N.J. Devils; Fred Wilpon, the
Mets' co-owner; real estate developers Samuel LeFrak, Steve Ross,
Bill Mack and Sam Grossman; cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder; and Kirk
Kerkorian, the billionaire from Las Vegas.

FOR ATLANTA, IT'S CRUCIAL TO STAY ON TOP
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forget unacceptable. For anyone associated with the
Atlanta Braves in the 1990s, anything less than a division title is
inconceivable. This is, after all, a team that has won an
unprecedented seven consecutive division crowns.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, events could be set in motion that force the
Braves to abdicate their throne. On Tuesday night at Turner Field,
the Braves open a three-game series with the Mets in what has
turned into Atlanta's most important series since 1993, the last
full season the Braves were in any real danger of finishing
anywhere but first place.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite a seasonlong succession of injuries that would
have finished off most other teams long ago, the Braves (93-57)
take both the best record in baseball and a one-game lead in the
National League East over the Mets (92-58) into the final two weeks
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Braves and the Mets have 12 games to play. Six of them
are head to head over the next 10 days, with the three in Atlanta
and three in New York, Sept. 28-30.
</P>
<P>
   Though both teams might qualify for the post-season anyway, that
is not assured, as Cincinnati began Tuesday night trailing the Mets
by four games in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   So how important is holding off the Mets, Atlanta's All-Star
third baseman, Chipper Jones, was asked last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important only in that we've got a string of them
going,'' he said, referring to all those division titles. ``The
main focus is to give ourselves a chance to win a World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have won only one World Series in Atlanta, in 1995,
despite their four NL pennants in the 1990s and the seven straight
division titles.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Braves' legacy is on the line, too, these next
two weeks: as the team of the decade, over the Yankees, or as the
most underachieving team. It will probably take a second World
Series championship to assure the acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be validation,'' Atlanta General Manager John
Schuerholz said. ``And from a players' standpoint, it would be the
proper validation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said: ``I think it would be nicer to win it all this year
over any other year. People don't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason this has been the Braves' most interesting
one season in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' said Atlanta's team president, Stan Kasten. ``But
the Chinese have a proverb, one that you might call a curse: `May
you live in interesting times.' And while it hasn't been good times
this season, it has been interesting and challenging. And you'd
have to say, the Braves have met every challenge thus far.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges started with the loss of their best power hitter,
Andres Galarraga, to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and their closer,
Kerry Ligtenberg, to elbow surgery before the season began. It was
an ominous harbinger of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz went on the disabled list with a sore elbow on May
17 and again on July 5, and has changed his delivery, forsaken his
best pitch (his slider) and is experimenting with a knuckleball.
</P>
<P>
   Within two days in late July, Odalis Perez the rookie fifth
starter who injured his elbow, and Javy Lopez Atlanta's No. 1
catcher who hurt his knee, went down for the season because of
their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine got off to
horrendous starts. Maddux (18-8, 3.35 ERA) has righted himself.
Glavine (11-11, 4.35 ERA), who won his second Cy Young award last
season, has not. Smoltz, meanwhile, is a mediocre 9-8, though he
has a 3.51 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are scheduled to face Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux this
week. As a result, this week the Mets will actually miss the
Braves' best starter _ Kevin Millwood, who is 18-7 with a 2.78 ERA
and who shut the Mets out on two hits over eight innings on July 3.
Millwood, however, is in line to pitch at Shea Stadium on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also might not see Brian Jordan, the slugging
outfielder who has a team-leading 106 RBIs. His season might be
over because of a nagging injury to his right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Millwood said, ``it's not like we haven't had to deal
with things like that all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have taken four of six games from the Mets this
season and swept the Mets in the final three games last season to
knock them out of the wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets have been the hottest team in baseball since June
6. For one day in July and eight in August, they were alone in
first place. Since Aug. 20, however, the lead has again belonged to
Atlanta, which has not finished out of first place since the
strike-shortened 1994 season. And there was no post-season play
that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of sit back and wonder how you are where you are,''
said Jones, who is hitting .320 with 41 homers and 98 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said this season did not remind him of 1993, when the
Braves won 104 games and beat out the San Francisco Giants for the
NL West title by one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We added a player, Fred McGriff, of high quality that
season,'' Schuerholz said. ``This year has been the opposite. Our
roster has been depleted of those kind of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet we sit here talking with the best record in
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the next two weeks, the Braves will either have an
eighth straight division title, a first wild-card berth or an early
vacation. How they play the Mets will almost certainly determine
which one.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no matter how you cut it, we've played well for 10
years,'' Manager Bobby Cox said. ``And we're still playing well.''

ROLLS-ROYCE TO BUY VICKERS FOR $933 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Rolls-Royce PLC has agreed to acquire Vickers PLC for
$933 million, saying the deal will create a giant in the growing
market for engines and other propulsion systems to push ever-bigger
ships at ever-higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from making marine engines and power plants, Rolls-Royce
is the world's second-biggest manufacturer of aircraft engines, and
the chairman, Ralph Robins, told reporters the purchase of Vickers
was intended to achieve the same status in marine power systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to get to No. 1 or 2 in the various markets in
which we operate,'' he said. ``We are up there in aerospace. This
will put us there is marine.'' Chris Springham, a Rolls- Royce
spokesman, said the two companies' combined sales in 1998 were some
$1.36 billion with combined operating profit of $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase brings together two of Britain's oldest engineering
companies. Vickers began in 1828 in the Sheffield steel business
and became nationally known as a shipbuilder, military contractor
and engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as part of a reshaping, Vickers sold Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars Ltd. _ which is not connected with the engine maker
Rolls-Royce PLC _ to Volkswagen for $790 million.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal, finalized in secrecy over the weekend and signed
late Sunday night after less than a week of negotiations, came as
``a huge surprise,'' said Brian O'Keefe, an analyst with
Commerzbank here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, investors appeared to be perplexed by the price
Rolls-Royce paid to buy a company that includes not just marine
propeller, diesel engine and turbine parts businesses but also a
land-based military business whose future is uncertain in the
post-Cold War era. Shares of Rolls- Royce fell 10.75 pence, to
close at 215.25 pence, in trading here.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Vickers contract is a $2.4-billion order from the
British military for the Challenger II tank, which ends in 2001.
Vickers, which is credited with having invented the tank in World
War I, has already said that it will lay off 650 workers when it
closes one of its two Challenger II factories late this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marine business is a good fit, but the defense business is
not something that anyone would like to go out and buy,'' O'Keefe
said. Indeed, Rolls-Royce indicated in a statement that the Vickers
tank business would be spun off and that Rolls would ``examine its
options to participate'' in military industry consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction of the deal, Rolls-Royce said in a
statement, was the Vickers marine businesses, which grew
significantly last year with the purchase of Ulstein Holding of
Norway, the world's second-biggest manufacturer of propellers and
other marine power equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal values Vickers stock at 250 pence, a 50 percent premium
on Friday's closing price of 165.5 pence. Additionally, the two
companies said, Vickers shareholders would keep a proposed interim
dividend of 2.85 pence, meaning a total premium of 53 percent on
Friday's close. Vickers shares surged 80.5 pence Monday, to 246
pence.

WHITMAN NAMES FBI SUPERVISOR TO TAKE OVER N.J. STATE POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to clarify, Dunbar's father is black and his
mother is white.) (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman announced Monday that her
nominee to head the state police is Carson Dunbar, an FBI
supervisor in New York, who promised to strengthen the force's
recruitment and disciplinary procedures and change its culture so
that racial bias is no longer tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first steps, Dunbar said, would be to make the
Internal Affairs Bureau more accountable to the public and to
review incentive programs for drug seizures that may have
encouraged racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   In surprisingly introspective comments for a news conference,
Dunbar, who was a N.J. state trooper in the early '70s, said Monday
that he had accepted the nomination to be superintendent of the New
Jersey State Police because of his mixed racial background. His
father is black and his mother is white, he said, adding that he
wanted a chance to build on the civil rights advances he has
witnessed during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   He even said that several years ago, he was subjected to racial
profiling himself at a traffic stop by a New Jersey state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Dunbar said he thought that the news media had
overstated the extent of the problem and assured officers that ``I
do not come with a chip on my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Dunbar's status as a former state trooper and his
extensive experience as a federal law enforcement administrator,
however, some civil rights leaders questioned Monday whether he had
the leadership skills and vision to lead a deeply divided agency
through a politically charged overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness to him, we'll have to wait and see whether he's a
strong superintendent,'' said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson,
director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey. ``But if
he's not a strong leader, we're going to end up in the same
situation two years from now that we're in now. Nothing this
administration has proposed will outlive the end of the governor's
term, and that is quickly drawing to a close.'' Whitman, who cannot
run for a third term, leaves office in January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate is expected to hold public hearings on Dunbar's
nomination next week, and legislators from both parties say that he
is likely to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   For Whitman, Dunbar's formal nomination ends seven months of
embarrassing fits and starts in an effort to address an issue that
has become the most persistent crisis of her five-and-a-half-year
tenure in office.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the governor fired the previous superintendent,
Col. Carl A. Williams, for making racially insensitive statements
in a newspaper interview. After years of insisting that the state
police did not engage in racial profiling, the governor made
history this spring when she became the first state official to
acknowledge that troopers discriminated against minority drivers
and harassed female and minority officers.
</P>
<P>
   But her attempt to replace Williams and enact change has been
fraught with miscalculations and political squabbles. The
governor's first choice for the top police job, a commander with
the Illinois State Police, withdrew from consideration after
encountering fierce resistance from state legislators who wanted
Whitman to choose someone from within the state police ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar's nomination was also stalled for months, as the governor
pressed Attorney General Janet Reno to approve an administrative
arrangement that would allow him to receive his full federal
pension.
</P>
<P>
   In naming Dunbar, the governor said she hoped his familiarity
with the protocol of the state police would allow him to enact
thorough reforms while being fair to the officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to be an advocate for the outstanding men and
women of the state police and someone who will ensure the
confidence in the public in the job that those men and women are
asked to do every day,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar seemed relieved that his wait for the nomination had
ended at last, and asked the news media and the public to be
patient as they measured his attempts to change the force.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in measured tones, Dunbar that his first priority would
be to bolster the department's internal affairs unit. That bureau
is now so autonomous that its commanders refuse to release any
information about discipline, even to citizens who file complaints
against officers.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar also said there were several other systemic changes he
would tackle, including recruitment and promotional policies, but
he cautioned that results might not come quickly. His job might
also be complicated if the U.S. Justice Departments Civil Rights
Division, which is now investigating the force, decides to appoint
an outside monitor.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complexity of the task ahead of him, Dunbar, said he
looked forward to returning to the force where he worked as a
trooper from 1973 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   As one of only a handful of minority troopers, Dunbar said he
had witnessed bias, but no real hostility, during his four years on
the force.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said, he was not surprised to read reports that
many black and female troopers have been victims of discrimination
and harassment from their white colleagues and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar rose quickly through the FBI, to his current position as
chief of administration in the bureau's New York office, but
co-workers and supervisors have given mixed reviews of his
performance. Lewis D. Schiliro, current head of the FBI's New York
office, said Dunbar was dedicated, experience and unfailingly
professional.
</P>
<P>
   But other FBI officials have criticized Dunbar's ill-fated
decision to end surveillance of a group of terrorists in 1992, six
months before they bombed the World Trade Center. One of those
critics, Oliver B. Revell, who was a deputy director of the FBI in
Washington during the early 1990s, said he had always viewed Dunbar
as a better administrator than an executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the governor, I would want him to work for me
because he's honest and hard-working,'' said Revell, who is now
retired. ``But leadership isn't his strong suit, so I wouldn't want
to hire him for the superintendent's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar calmly rebutted questions about his leadership and his
role in the World Trade center case during Monday's news
conference, saying that he was an independent thinker who wasn't
afraid to make a tough decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to come back and say, `Why didn't you do this?
Why did you do that?''' Dunbar said. ``It's a little bit more
difficult when you're making the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Dunbar's supporters argue that he will not have to
overhaul the force himself because the governor has already
appointed three members of the state attorney general's office, who
already have drawn up a detailed plan to improve the force.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But one brief exchange during the news conference suggested that
the racial politics of revamping the state police could make for
some tense moments. When the governor was asked whether Dunbar's
race was a factor in his nomination _ and she quickly responded
that he was chosen solely because of his professional
qualifications _ Dunbar jumped in before reporters could ask
another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question that you just asked is just what I talked about
before,'' he said. ``There is no place that I can go, no matter
what I accomplish, without somebody asking that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why couldn't I just be the best possible candidate?'' Dunbar
said. ``Every time something happens and a minority happens to be
the person, then why is it that that question has to be raised?''

IN OPPOSITE CORNERS: THE WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION AND PLAYBOY
MAGAZINE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ According to the lawsuit, it is a dispute over
``intellectual property rights.''
</P>
<P>
   That in itself would not be surprising, but the combatants in
this rarefied legal battle are the World Wrestling Federation and
Playboy magazine. And the intellectual property at issue is the
character Sable, described in the lawsuit as a ``sultry temptress''
in a skintight cat suit who, as wrestling fans well know, was once
the WWF's women's champion.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF, producer of the widely watched Wrestlemania and other
televised wrestling shows, Monday asked a federal district judge in
Manhattan to block Playboy from exploiting the WWF's trademarked
name Sable for a nude photo feature next month. Playboy is planning
to publish an issue sold only at newsstands, the suit said,
entirely devoted to Rena Mero, who wrestled as Sable.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF, a private entertainment company based in Stamford,
Conn., said in its suit that it had created Ms. Mero's Sable
character, who was also known for carrying a whip and ``gyrating
her hips and body in a highly suggestive, sexual manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said it gave Playboy permission to feature Ms. Mero
as Sable on its April cover and inside the magazine, but Playboy
then had published a second nude pictorial without permission in
September, billing it as: ``The Rematch. Sable Returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the suit contends, Playboy is preparing a special issue,
again without permission, with headlines like ``The Woman You Loved
as Sable in the Raw.''
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, the lawsuit says, is ``brazenly flaunting WWF's
valuable intellectual property rights.''
</P>
<P>
   A Playboy spokeswoman, Elizabeth Norris, had no comment, saying
the magazine's lawyers had not yet seen the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry S. McDevitt, a lawyer for the WWF, said Playboy's
continued use of nude photos of the Sable character was tantamount
to the wrestling federation's ``using the Playboy Bunny to sell our
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending its legal claim on the Sable trademark, the
company's lawsuit also offers a revealing glimpse at how its
down-and-dirty matches are scripted, with preordained results.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says, for example, that Sable was introduced in April
1996, in a minor role, and ``gradually developed a personality and
character over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Sable was portrayed as a ``valet'' to escort a male
wrestler, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, into the ring, to hold his robe
and cheer for him, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, the suit said, ``the Sable character was
scripted to become, and did become, the WWF Women's Wrestling
Champion.''
</P>
<P>
   An initial hearing in the suit, which also seeks unspecified
monetary damages from Playboy, was set for Wednesday, McDevitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mero quit her role as Sable in June, and filed her own suit
against the World Wrestling Federation that month, charging breach
of contract, unfair trade practices and intentional infliction of
emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   McDevitt said the WWF had reached a settlement with Ms. Mero,
the financial terms of which were confidential. Her lawyer could
not be reached by phone Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's largest local phone
company, and the international wireless giant Vodafone Airtouch PLC
could announce as early as Tuesday a joint venture to combine the
two companies' U.S. cellular telephone operations, valued between
$70 billion and $80 billion, people close to the companies said
</P>
<P>
   While negotiations could break down at any point, one person
said that the discussions were proceeding well and, at least as of
early Monday evening, both companies were committed to getting the
deal done. Executives and advisers from Vodafone and Bell Atlantic
spent much of last weekend in New York hammering out the details of
a coast-to-coast combination that would rival the national wireless
networks of the AT&AMP;T Corp. and the Sprint Corp., and comprise more
than 23.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone merged with Airtouch Communications, the largest United
States cellular company, this summer after snaring the company away
from Bell Atlantic. Executives from Vodafone and Bell Atlantic have
been discussing the joint venture since July.

THE PALER SHADE OF WHITENESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Normally, I wouldn't begin feeling guilty for being a
White man in America until April. Maybe even May.
</P>
<P>
   This year, my timetable for Caucasian self-reproach was pushed
forward by the folks at Arizona State University, who of fered for
the current semester a one-credit course titled ``Exploring Your
White / Euro American Roots.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of this class caused a small controversy on
campus, which (nat urally) was blown all out of proportion by the
local papers and TV stations. This, in turn, jump-started my
otherwise dormant sense of pasty-faced remorse, regret and
recrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The course originated at the universi ty's Intergroup Relations
Center and was condemned last week by one ASU staff member for
``providing a space for Whites to navel-gaze without compelling
them to squarely face their role in perpet uating racial oppression
in this society.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, however, that facing our role in racial oppression
is exactly what students in the course are supposed to do _ while
gazing at their milky-white na vels.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the director of the center told a Republic reporter,
``It is not a course on Euro-American history. It is more about
looking at oppression, dis crimination, this concept of
Whiteness.''
</P>
<P>
   Kris Ewing, who is the center's assist ant director, told me she
is most inter ested in ``creating a dialogue'' in which people of
different races, sexes, ethnici ties and sexual orientations can
come to gether and mull over issues like, ``What does it mean to be
White?''
</P>
<P>
   Given the anxiety that question causes me, I always try to put
it off. &QL; 
Look at those legs
</P>
<P>
   Most years, I don't begin to contemplate my Whiteness until
early spring, and only then because I have no choice. That's the
time of year when temperatures rise, long trousers give way to
cutoff jeans and I'm forced to switch on the blindingly fluorescent
light bulbs known as my legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, are you white!'' I'll invariably be told, often in
public, forcing me to confront the heckler about how impolite it is
to mock another human being _ particularly if he's your father.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at ASU apparently didn't produce this course for me
and my kids, however.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ewing, ``We are raising a lot of good discussion
over issues that have challenged a lot of communities. This is a
dialogue course, a chance to bring students together and dialogue.
La tinos and Whites. Men and women. Afri can-Americans and Whites.
All with the goal to provide some level of understand ing through a
safe space.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing points out that ``there's some privilege to being White.''
She said her course is designed to ask, ``Whom does it advantage?
And, whom does it disad vantage?''
</P>
<P>
   While exploring my own personal White / Euro American roots,
back in Pittsburgh, I discovered that my two grandfathers had the
advantage of riding in steerage from Italy to the United States,
where they had the privilege of working in a steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   Along with African-Americans, Lati nos, Poles, Serbs, Irish and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   My father, my brother and I had the same privilege.
</P>
<P>
   And, while I've always considered my self pale-skinned, I didn't
know I was White _ with a capital ``W'' _ until I, too, attended a
university. &QL; 
Strange fixation
</P>
<P>
   Skin color is a lot more important to college professors than it
is to people of all shades slaving away in some industrial hellhole
to save the cash needed to provide their children the privilege of
attending a college. Such as ASU. Where students can waste their
time and their folks' money contemplating Whiteness.
</P>
<P>
   Or not.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, ASU had to cancel the class after only four people
(of unknown color or IQ) registered for it.
</P>
<P>
   The course will be available next se mester, though, and
everyone at the uni versity seems pleased and proud to offer it.
Which is enough to make your white, black, brown, red or yellow
skin crawl. &QL;

CHOICE OF CLINTON FOR HUMANITIES TALK MEETS RESISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since 1972, the National Endowment for the
Humanities has selected a leading scholar to give its annual
Jefferson Lecture on the Humanities. Past recipients of the honor
have included Lionel Trilling, Robert Penn Warren, John Hope
Franklin, Sidney Hook, Toni Morrison, Gwendolyn Brooks, Gertrude
Himmelfarb and Barbara Tuchman.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the chairman of the endowment, William R. Ferris, said
the lecturer in 2000 would be President Clinton, and some scholars
are not happy.
</P>
<P>
   John Hammer, the director of the National Humanities Alliance,
said he was concerned that the choice of Clinton, who appointed
Ferris chairman, would politicize the endowment, a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list of lecturers until now has been very distinguished,
without regard to politics,'' Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
   John H. D'Arms, president of the American Council of Learned
Societies, told The Chronicle of Higher Education, which first
reported the selection of Clinton on its Web page Monday, that he
was also concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when one is very careful about trying to
depoliticize the humanities and the arts in the United States in
the eyes of Congress,'' D'Arms told The Chronicle, a ``speech by
President Clinton might have the reverse effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris defended the choice. ``You take a little heat when you
make a change,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of inviting Clinton, he said, was to begin a
tradition in which all presidents would deliver a Jefferson
Lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expanding the endowment to reach the whole country,''
he said. ``We're opening all the doors and windows. Having the
president reflect on his or her relationship to the history of the
nation is part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because history is one of the endowment's main components, the
endowment has helped to finance many presidential history projects,
Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if what he was doing would be considered an injection
of politics, Ferris replied: ``In a way it is. We're a political
reality. We depend on Congress and the White House for our very
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   But any politicizing, Ferris insisted, was bipartisan because
the Clinton invitation would set a precedent to be followed in
future administrations, regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   One former chairman of the endowment, William Bennett, said that
the invitation to Clinton was not only a politicization of the
endowment, but a partisan one as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is horrible, corrupt, but it fits the pattern of this
administration,'' said Bennett, a conservative Republican who
served in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bipartisan?'' Bennett asked. ``I don't think so. The
Clinton-appointed chairman picks the guy who picks him to give the
lecture, a guy who has no qualifications, and calls it bipartisan
and broadening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett added, ``Clinton has not only been corrupted; he has
corrupted all of those around him, and this is an example of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris said of Bennett's criticism, ``It's short-sighted to
couch this as a partisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to create a historical record,'' he said. ``We
will have a bipartisan record.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris said Clinton, a friend, had not answered the invitation
by Monday evening but that he expected the president to accept. The
White House did not respond to a call seeking comment. The lecture
is given in the spring in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Clinton could be regarded as a scholar, Ferris
said: ``The endowment's founding language calls for bringing the
humanities to the American people. No matter how visible the
lecturer is, very few Americans have ever heard of the Jefferson
Lecture. This will bring it to every American. People will become
aware of what the humanities are. It will broaden the humanities
and touch the lives of all citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris acknowledged that Clinton, whose advanced degree is in
law, was not a scholar in the traditional sense, adding, ``But he
is in the Jeffersonian sense that every citizen has the right to
express their thoughts about the nature of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the typical president would not simply assign the
speech writing task to an aide, Ferris said he thought each
president would write every humanities speech, seeing it as an
opportunity to express his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, the director of the National Humanities Alliance, said:
``I understand they are hoping it will provide more publicity. I
imagine that's true.''

   Sometimes Cynthia Cooper, the shy, skinny girl from the Watts
section of Los Angeles _ who was beaten by her father and older
brother and molested by a stranger _ the middle child of eight who
dreamed not of wealth but of having enough to eat, is tempted to
pinch herself to make sure she is not sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walk down the streets of New York and people recognize
me, when the coach asks me to translate something in Italian for
one of my teammates, when Michael Jordan says: `Great job, Coop.
Congratulations on the MVP,' when I'm sitting next to Alonzo
Mourning at a game and little girls come up to me first and ask for
my autograph, it blows me away every time,'' Cooper said. ``Things
like that aren't suppose to happen to little girls from Watts.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless they grow up to be Cynthia Cooper, the superstar point
guard of the Houston Comets of the Women's National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The player who led her team to championship titles three times.
The player whose mantle bears two league most valuable player
awards, and whose garage holds the three Buick Regals given to the
Most Valuable Player of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Cooper dreamed she would grow up to be, well, Cynthia
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from impoverished neighborhoods don't dream of being
kings and queens of nations,'' Cooper said. ``They dream of getting
out of the ghetto or about having something to eat the next day.
They dream about real stuff. Stuff other people take for granted,
like being able to go to the store to buy clothes for school.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, still sporting a glow from the Comets' third
consecutive WNBA championship, Cooper arrived in New York to
promote the release of her autobiography, ``She Got Game: My
Personal Odyssey,'' published by Warner Books.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the 36-year-old Cooper recounts a life shaped by personal
lows and highs: her mother's lifelong struggle to raise eight
children on her own, her being molested as a child, her brother
Ricky's stabbing death, her estrangement with her father and older
brother, Kenneth.
</P>
<P>
   She also tells of her years of insecurity as a college player at
the University of Southern California, followed by a highly
successful 11-year pro career in Europe, including two trips to the
Olympics, where she earned a gold and a bronze medal, only to be
overlooked by the American Basketball League and unappreciated by
the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a basketball book, Cooper stressed during an
hour-and-a-half interview in a private lounge at a New York hotel.
It is, she said, a book about life.
</P>
<P>
   ``About winning at the game of life,'' said Cooper, who at 5
foot 10 looked fashion-model chic in a black sleeveless dress and
black sandals. ``It's really about living life to the fullest. I
want people to read this book and to be inspired by it. Maybe I can
help people with my story. In one chapter, I talk about being
molested. In another, I'm in a foreign country in America when I go
to USC and find myself in a different world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is going to experience that. Somebody is going to go
to school for two years and sit on the bench and then finally get
their opportunity. Somebody is going to experience a childhood of
nothing but beatings from your dad or getting hit by your brother,
and they are going to want to hate all men. But because they read
this book, they're not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   An intense competitor who combines athleticism with grace,
Cooper has drawn criticism from her peers for being cocky and
aloof. That is how she first appeared to one teammate, point guard
Kim Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   The two players later became best friends. During Perrot's
battle with lung cancer this past season, Cooper was at her side,
offering emotional support and financial aid. When Perrot died last
month, Cooper was at her bedside in the hospital. Perrot's death
came six months after Cooper's mother, Mary Cobbs, died of breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kim died, I was like, can't play,'' Cooper said. ``I was
there. I held her hand. Nope. Can't do it. That was the first game
I missed in my entire professional career. But I didn't care
because there was nothing important at that moment that I had to
do. But I sat out during the game and I saw my teammates struggle,
and they were struggling with the same thing, maybe on a smaller
scale, that I was struggling with. That was their teammate. Their
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of their moms had passed away six months ago, but so
what? They were still struggling and grieving and that bothered me
that I was sitting out and they were struggling and still
fulfilling their duty to the team and the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who led the league in scoring with an average of 22.1
points a game, said her behavior would have angered her mother and
Perrot. Neither one would have wanted her to use them as an excuse
for failing to do her job, she said. She returned the next game and
scored 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a year that saw the loss of her mother, her best friend
and her Houston home to fire, Cooper says without hesitation that
she feels blessed. Her five nieces and nephews, whom she is raising
and plans to adopt, were home at the time of the fire and escaped
unharmed. The fire was accidentally set by a nephew who was playing
with a lighter.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Cooper opened her own company, Coop in Motion, which
manages her career and includes her foundation, Building Dreams,
which donates to charities in the Houston area. Her endorsement
deals with Nike and General Motors are estimated to be worth
$500,000 a year, and as one of the league's elite players, she is
finally earning in the six-figure range. She recently got her own
Nike shoe, C-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, got the necklace people,'' she said with a girlish giggle
as she fingered a gold necklace with the initial C and her jersey
No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are times, even now, after all that she has
accomplished in her life and career, that Cooper still feels like
the overlooked middle child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through life, I've always been fighting this uphill battle,
trying to prove to someone: This is who I am,'' Cooper said. ``When
I started in the WNBA, I said that these people don't know. They
don't know my story. That there was a road I had to travel to get
where I am now. Sometimes I walked. Sometimes I hitchhiked.
Sometimes I took a bicycle or a bus or a plane. But it was a slow,
winding journey that was well worth the effort.''

JOHN W. VANDERHOFF, 74, CHEMIST INVOLVED IN PIONEER SPACE PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John W. Vanderhoff, a chemist who was the chief scientist of a
National Aeronautics and Space Administration project that produced
what was said to be the first commercial product made in space,
died on Thursday at his home in Bethlehem, Pa. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1997 from the faculty of Lehigh University in
Bethlehem, Pa., because of ill health, said Kurt Pfitzer of the
Office of University Communications at Lehigh.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderhoff joined Lehigh's faculty in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He and associates at Lehigh developed a chemical process that
made plastic spheres so small that 18,000 of them could fit on the
head of a pin. Officials in Washington announced in 1985 that
nearly a billion of the tiny spheres, which had been produced in
the absence of gravity aboard the orbiting space shuttle
Challenger, had been sold to eight companies, to the Food and Drug
Administration and to the University of Utah for use as microscopic
yardsticks.
</P>
<P>
   The spheres were 10 micrometers, or about one-2,500th of an
inch, in diameter. It was said at the time that perfect spheres
that small were almost impossible to make on Earth because of the
interference of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that bought the spheres were manufacturing finely
ground powder products like paint pigments, flour and cosmetics.
The spheres were to be used to calibrate instruments for measuring
the size of particles in the products.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, a vial containing about 30 million of the spheres
was selling for $384, and 29 vials had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent experience showed that the high cost of
manufacturing products like the spheres in orbit was a substantial
problem. The spheres are no longer in production.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderhoff won awards from NASA, the American Chemical Society,
Union Carbide and Lehigh.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Niagara Falls, N.Y. and received a bachelor's
degree in 1947 from Niagara University and a doctorate in chemistry
in 1951 from what is now the State University of New York in
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the Dow Chemical Co. before joining Lehigh's
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, the former Joan T. Moir; a daughter,
Jane A. Vanderhoff of Bethlehem; a son, John M., of Center Valley,
Pa.; two sisters, Rosemary K. Vanderhoff and Eleanor V. Asklar,
both of Niagara Falls; and a grandchild.

DOCTOR HAD PRESCRIBED ANTI-DEPRESSANT FOR CHURCH SHOOTER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A doctor had prescribed the anti-depressant
drug Prozac for Larry Gene Ashbrook, but investigators are unsure
whether he was taking it when he killed seven people and then
himself in a Fort Worth church last week, police said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's Lt. Mark Krey, who is heading the investigation
into the largest mass shooting in the city's history, said police
have found a Prozac vial in Ashbrook's name and want to ask doctors
why it was prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Krey said Ashbrook, 47, may have slipped past the brink of
sanity after his father died in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of paranoia within his life had advanced to an
extreme stage,'' he said. ``We're investigating the possibility
that with the death of his father, Mr. Ashbrook stopped taking
medication. We believe when he lost his father, who was his anchor
to reality and his caretaker to ensure he took his medication, he
lost any connection to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, police said a homemade pipe bomb exploded in
Wedgwood Baptist Church with enough velocity to send a piece of
shrapnel hurtling 80 feet before slicing through a wall and landing
in the hallway outside the sanctuary, Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than blasting out into a sanctuary where more than
150 worshippers were taking part in a youth service, shrapnel shot
toward the ceiling and then rained down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very blessed in the manner in which it detonated ... or
it would have caused serious bodily injury,'' Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said they found nine vials of prescription drugs
for Jack Ashbrook in the family home in suburban Forest Hill as
well as a diary in which the father documented his pill use, said
spokeswoman Marjorie Poche. It is unclear where the Prozac was
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing changed in the last couple of weeks of the diary.
It's only speculation, but (Larry Ashbrook) may have started taking
his father's medication,'' she said. ``Either that or he started
recording when his father took the pills. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The final three of his seven victims were laid to rest on
Monday, but Ashbrook's body remained unclaimed at the Tarrant
County Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Ashbrook, his brother, said the family is finalizing
funeral arrangements, but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there probably has been more said than there needs to
be, and a lot of it's untrue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't make any difference,'' he said. ``I think the
damage has already been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators classified information on Monday from nearly 70
depositions taken the night of the shooting, reinterviewed the
wounded and tried to trace Ashbrook's final, fatal steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigators are going though a number of depositions to
determine the exact sequence of events,'' said homicide Sgt. Dave
Loftis. ``We want to know, first of all, specifically what happened
and how everything went down that day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the search for the most asked questions _ what set Ashbrook
off and why did he choose Wedgwood _ may never pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any motive right now,'' Loftis said. ``I don't
know if we'll ever have an answer to those questions. If we can, we
certainly will get them. It's like any of those senseless acts of
violence, there aren't any answers. And can any motive explain it
and make sense of it?''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Ashbrook details a vast, unspecified conspiracy
against him by law enforcement. His brother described him to Wise
County sheriff's deputies as a paranoid schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   Krey said Ashbrook apparently was such a loner that few people
have been found to help explain his activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we won't find anybody because there is nobody to
find. And that is consistent with the mental illness he appeared to
be afflicted with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church, Ashbrook fired all six rounds from a
.380-caliber semiautomatic gun, then fired up to 50 more shots from
a Ruger 9mm semi-automatic pistol, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Six of his seven victims died from gunshot wounds to the head,
autopsy reports show. The seventh was fatally shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook shot himself with the 9mm, police said. He apparently
was alive in a back pew when paramedics rushed into the sanctuary,
but was pronounced dead a short time later, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook's victims were Christi Beckel, 14; Shawn Brown, 23;
Susan Kimberly Jones, 23; Cassandra F. Griffin, 14; Joseph ``Joey''
D. Ennis, 14; Sydney R. Browning, 36; and Justin M. Ray, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and a woman separately videotaped Ashbrook's rampage, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Forest Hill said Ashbrook also may have made a
futile effort to contaminate the city of Forest Hill's water
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put concrete in the commodes and, working for the city, I
wanted to make sure he didn't do something else,'' said Forest Hill
Public Works Director Michael Duehring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure he did not contaminate our water system.
I can't go any further than that and tell you what he did, but he
didn't do any damage.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials inspected plumbing in Ashbrook's home Thursday
after the concerns were voiced. They did not, Poche said, consider
it a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agent said it looked like he was just trying to mess up
the inside of the house,'' said agent Marjorie Poche. ``The agent
who was out there said he had ripped off the shower head and neck
and put one of those paper cones and a quart of motor oil to back
down into the pipes. He said it was stuck in there still.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A doctor had prescribed the anti-depressant
drug Prozac for Larry Gene Ashbrook, but investigators are unsure
why and whether he was taking it when he killed seven people and
then himself in a southwest Fort Worth church last week, police
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Lt. Mark Krey, who is heading the investigation into
the largest mass shooting in the city's history, said police found
a Prozac vial in Ashbrook's name and want to ask doctors why it was
prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Krey said Ashbrook, 47, may have slipped past the brink of
sanity after his 85-year-old father died in July.

<P>
   ``The level of paranoia within his life had advanced to an
extreme stage,'' Krey said. ``We're investigating the possibility
that with the death of his father, Mr. Ashbrook stopped taking

Wedgwood Baptist Church with enough velocity to send a piece of

<P>
   But rather than blasting out into a sanctuary where more than
150 worshippers were taking part in a youth service, most of the
shrapnel shot toward the ceiling and then rained down. No one was
seriously injured by the shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very blessed in the manner in which it detonated ... or
it would have caused serious bodily injury,'' Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   Prozac is commonly used to treat various forms of clinical
depression, including depression in children, as well as bulimia
and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Kowlaski, a psychiatrist in private practice in Fort
Worth and former medical director for Mental Health and Mental
Retardation Services of Tarrant County, said the medical community
generally views Prozac as a good antidepressant that does not
contribute to, or prevent, violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who is ill will sometimes act out violently, but
most people with psychiatric illnesses are not likely to act
violently,'' he said. ``Those who do most often do evil independent
of their psychiatric conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear where police found the Prozac bottle; it was not
on the list of items that law enforcement officers took from
Ashbrook's suburban Forest Hill home. FBI officials said they did
find nine vials of prescription drugs for Jack Ashbrook, who died
after a battle with cancer, as well as a diary in which the father
documented his medication, said spokeswoman Marjorie Poche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing changed in the last couple of weeks of the diary.
It's only speculation, but he (Larry Ashbrook) may have started
taking his father's medication,'' she said. ``Either that or he
started recording when his father took the pills. ...''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Ashbrook interrupted the youth rally at
Wedgwood by firing methodically into a crowd of students, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Kristi Beckel, 14; Shawn Brown, 23; Susan Kimberly
Jones, 23; Cassandra Griffin, 14; Joseph ``Joey'' Ennis, 14; Sydney
Browning, 36; and Justin Ray, 17. Seven others were injured.

   Police also said on Monday that they have found no connection
between Ashbrook and any hate group.
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Larry Ashbrook details a vast, unspecified
conspiracy against him by law enforcement and others. His brother
described him as a paranoid schizophrenic to sheriff's deputiesin a
neighboring county. But the state mental health system said last
week that it has no record of any contact with Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   Krey said Ashbrook apparently was such a loner that few people
have been found to help explain his activities.

futile effort to contaminate the city's water system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put concrete in the commodes and, working for the city, I
wanted to make sure he didn't do something else,'' said Public
Works Director Michael Duehring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure he did not contaminate our water system.
I can't go any further than that and tell you what he did, but he
didn't do any damage.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials inspected plumbing in Ashbrook's home Thursday but
did not consider the threat serious, Poch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agent said it looked like he was just trying to mess up
the inside of the house,'' she said. ``The agent who was out there
said he had ripped off the shower head and neck and put one of
those paper cones and a quart of motor oil to back down into the
pipes. He said it was stuck in there still.''

F-16 CRASH 7TH FOR LUKE PILOTS THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - A fighter jet crashed on Sept. 20 just north of Luke
Air Force Base, the seventh accident in the past year involving
pilots from the West Phoenix base.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16 jet appeared to have overrun the runway, after the
pilot was unable to stop and ejected safely. The jet then plunged
through a fence that surrounds the air base, crossed Northern
Avenue and hopped over an irrigation canal before coming to a rest
in a field owned by the Air Force, just south of a rural
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Thompson was out in his work shed tinkering with an old
car engine when he heard what he describes as ``a loud poof.'' He
guessed immediately it was the sound of another F-16 jet crashing
near his home _ the second jet from Luke to crash within a mile of
his property this year.
</P>
<P>
   This one landed in a field a few hundred meters south of his
home, in an area his neighbor calls ``The Kill Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Crashes) keep getting closer,'' said Thompson, who has
lived a half-mile north of the base for 17 years. ``They're getting
too close.''
</P>
<P>
   After witnessing two of the crashes, he said he's surprised no
one has been seriously hurt of killed. In each F-16 crash this
year, the pilots have been able to eject safely. However, this most
recent accident was the first in which the $20 mil lion jet was not
completely de stroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Air Force officials say there's no question the F-16D jet
involved in the Sept. 20 crash sus tained more than $1 million in
damage, making it a ``Class A'' mishap. That makes it the eighth
F-16 jet to crash in Arizona since fall, all but one involving Luke
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Four Luke crashes have been attributed to engine problems. Offi
cials say a landing gear malfunction caused another crash, and
pilot error was blamed for a sixth. The report hasn't yet been
released for the crash of an Air National Guard jet near Gila Bend
in June.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials say they don't know the cause of the Sept.
20 crash. They say it does not appear to be related to any past
crashes, nor was it likely an engine problem.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Maj. Sharon J. Preszler, had reported an electrical
malfunc tion about 10 minutes before she reached the base. The jet
was returning from training at Beale Air Force Base, near
Sacramento, Calif., with another Luke jet, which landed safely on a
parallel runway.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to stop her jet, Preszler, who was alone in the
two-seater jet, ejected from the ground about 1,000 feet from the
end of the runway, officials say. The 34-year-old pilot landed
safely in a grassy area just north of the runway. She was treated
and released from the base hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Base firefighters arrived at the scene within seconds and put
out a fire sparked by the crash. Maj. Derek Kaufman, a base
spokesman, said they likely saved the plane from total destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Preszler, an instructor pilot at Luke for almost two years, has
been in the Air Force about 13 years. She had more than 3,400 hours
of flight experience _ nearly one-third of it in the F-16 jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very well-qualified,'' said base spokesman Mary Jo
May.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the electrical mal function may have prevented Pre
szler from lowering the jet's hook, an alternate method of stopping
the aircraft. A cable was stretched across the north end of the
runway as a measure of last resort for pilots making emergency
landings, but Kaufman said the plane's hook was not lowered to
catch the cable.
</P>
<P>
   Though the jet crashed onto a field owned by the Air Force, it
came to rest just a dozen feet from the property's boundary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This underscores why we think it's vital that we don't develop
this area,'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has sent a team of investigators to the scene. It
will likely be two to three months before the accident report is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Luke is the largest F-16 training base in the world, flying
about 180 sorties a day. But all jets were grounded after today's
incident. Base commander, Brig. Gen. John L. Barry was out of town
Monday and unavailable for comment. &QL;

<P>
   It was the beginning of the workweek Monday, a day when
thousands of people throughout the New York region were hoping to
return to work, slide into a set of comforting routines and give
themselves a little more cushion from the jarring effects of
Tropical Storm Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in parts of New York and New Jersey, the day turned out
to be no better than Sunday, Saturday or Friday. Thousands remained
homeless. Thousands continued to scratch by without electricity or
telephone service. Schools stayed closed. Some automated teller
machines failed to spew money on demand.
</P>
<P>
   And the supply of water, all of a sudden, became a major concern
in a region still trying to wring itself dry, as thousands of
people were urged to stop using water for mundane chores, and
dozens of corporations, including some of the largest employers in
New Jersey, were urged to close because of low water pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after Floyd whipped through the area, many people were
still reeling from its aftereffects, even those who thought they
had escaped the worst of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water, you think it's always there,'' said Julie Capelo, a
housewife in Bridgewater, N.J., who was in line Monday for free,
potable water arranged by the township. ``But now, it's like you
can't do the wash. You can't bathe. You can't do the dishes. You
can't really cook, and all the restaurants are closed. It's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranford police announced that on Saturday night, one of their
officers, Lt. Russell Scott Wilde Sr., 33, apparently killed
himself after working 48 hours nonstop on rescue and evacuation
efforts related to the flooding of the Rahway River.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 people in Cranford were evacuated from several hundred
flooded homes, and police received 750 flood-related calls, said
Capt. Eric Mason of the Cranford Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extensive hours that Lt. Wilde worked and the level of
responsibility that he had, we feel greatly contributed to this
tragedy,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the death toll from Floyd for the New York region now
stands at six. The damage has yet to be assessed, though officials
believe that the storm has caused hundreds of millions of dollars
in property damage. President Clinton has declared eight New Jersey
counties and four New York counties federal disaster areas,
enabling homeowners and businesses to seek federal disaster relief
in the form of housing, grants, loans and other assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, more than 1,000 people, mostly in the center of
the state, in places like Bound Brook and Manville, remain
homeless, driven out first by raging rivers and later by the threat
of contamination. They sulk and pray in makeshift shelters at
schools, forlorn and disoriented, feeling as if life's rug has been
pulled out from beneath their feet.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, more than 100 people remain dislocated,
including 17 or so who were evacuated from their homes in
Haverstraw Monday afternoon because of soil erosion, said Robert
Wingate, a spokesman for the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   And while those numbers have dwindled as cleanup efforts
continue and more people return to their water-logged homes, there
is a chance, as early as Tuesday night, that more rain and even
more flooding may come. An inch of rain is expected Tuesday, and
the National Weather Service has declared a flood watch advisory
for northeastern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly bears repeating that just because Floyd struck
the area several days ago, it doesn't mean that conditions can't
change on short notice in the days to come,'' Wingate said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some signs of improvement Monday, the fruit of
continuous efforts by emergency officials, volunteers and repair
crews.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic said the major telecommunications hub in Rochelle
Park, N.J., that was inundated by flood waters on Thursday night,
knocking out telephone service to a million customers, returned to
full operation Monday. New Jersey's major utility companies
reported that the number of customers without electricity had been
reduced to 30,000, mainly in the northern and central parts of the
state. By day's end, most of the region's transportation network
was back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, thousands of people around the country were finally able
to withdraw cash from automated teller machines. On Friday, flood
waters had forced the evacuation of the Rochelle Park data
processing center run by Electronic Data Systems Corp., one of the
country's largest operators of ATMs. By late Monday, 90 percent of
the machines affected around the country were back in order, said
Reed Byrum, a corporate spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, big problems remained Monday, related to the impurity
and inadequacy of the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, flood waters from the Raritan River roared
into the primary pumping and filtration plant of Elizabethtown
Water Co. in Bridgewater, N.J. Ever since, company officials have
urged its 550,000 customers in Union and Somerset Counties and
parts of Middlesex and Mercer Counties to boil water for three
minutes before using it. As a precaution, officials at other water
companies have asked customers to do the same, bringing the total
to 2 million around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabethtown officials have also been concerned about low water
pressure. So they have urged their largest customers, including
major corporations and the Bridgewater Commons mall, to remain
closed to conserve water for firefighting and other vital purposes.

<P>
   SLEEPY HOLLOW, N.Y. _ Philipsburg Manor, one of the oldest
historic sites in New York state, came close to being swept away in
the flood from Tropical Storm Floyd, but was saved when museum
curators and security guards, neighbors and history buffs and even
a local girls' soccer team all pitched in to divert the flow of a
furious river.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers returned Monday to shovel debris, clean colonial
knickknacks and carefully excavate antiques from the caked mud.
Burns Patterson, director of public relations for Historic Hudson
Valley, which operates the manor and five other historic sites,
said the support was gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people you sit side by side with at a computer desk
were hip deep in water getting their khakis wet,'' he said. ``I
sacrificed a pair of wingtips, but it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started Thursday night when uprooted trees and
debris caught on the supports of a 17th-century-style wooden
footbridge here and obstructed the flow of the Pocantico River, a
small tributary of the Hudson. Blocked from its course, the river
turned east and cut a wide swath through a hillside right between
the stone manor house built in 1685 and a 1960s reproduction of a
Colonial-era grist mill.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five feet of water flooded the first floor of the manor
house, cracked the foundation and sent some antiques, including a
brass milk pitcher, floating downstream. A rare 18th-century Dutch
cupboard was bobbing in the kitchen when Geoffrey Carter, the
director of preservation, was summoned by security guards around 4
a.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were huge trees coming down the Pocantico River, and
they were battering the side of the mill,'' Carter said Monday
afternoon. ``I thought for sure we were going to lose it. We
didn't, but we lost a retaining wall and a dock.''
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m. on Friday, nearly 70 employees of Historic Hudson
Valley were enlisted to don life jackets, loosen the logjam and
load sandbags in front of the manor house, which was once one of
the busiest commercial centers in New York and is now a living
museum of Colonial life popular with school groups. Later in the
day, museum volunteers and neighborhood residents arrived and
offered their services. By 3 p.m., a dozen girls from the Hackley
School, a private school in Tarrytown, gave up their soccer
practice to load sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good time,'' said Emily Cleveland, a junior. ``We
felt like we were helping people, and we were happy not to be at
practice for once.''
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts stemmed the tide until later that night when a
nearby company, County Asphalt, filled the river's channel with 12
truckloads of rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if this had been a computer factory, if people would
have chipped in like they did,'' Burns said. ``I think it shows
what history means to people.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Thursday morning, as rain beat against the
windows, Calvin Klein was in his office giving a reporter a preview
of the spring collection he planned to show the next day.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned Babe Paley, as a model appeared in the sort of
sheath she might have worn, except it was in trendy nylon. As Klein
went on, making a lot of hip references to the nerd style now in
vogue with London teen-agers, but blandly, without obvious personal
associations, it was hard not to notice a photograph leaning
against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   It was a portrait of Nicholas de Gunzberg _ Baron de Gunzberg, a
well-connected Vogue editor of the 1950s and '60s who knew Diana
Vreeland, Cecil Beaton; well, everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Was it true, Klein was asked, that Baron de Gunzberg had
discovered him?
</P>
<P>
   The designer brightened with that. ``Yes,'' Klein said, ``he was
my mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, four blocks away, in Bryant Park, another of the
baron's proteges was getting ready for his final show. Bill Blass
had come along in an age when everything in fashion was personal.
The feuds, the glamour, the excitement. One felt something, and it
showed in the clothes. It was not for nothing that John Fairchild,
the former Women's Wear Daily editor, and a very personal tone,
once said that ``you can hear the sound of the traffic of New York
in Bill's clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, who could you say that about? Someone like Tommy
Hilfiger may be a genius at marketing, but take away the rock
bands, the models, the videos of screaming teen-agers, and what do
you have but a graying businessman with no personal identification
with the clothes. This was the thing, more than any other, that was
noticed as the New York shows ended last week. And it wasn't
confined to middle-aged esthetes trying to project an air of hip
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Duke sent out a collection on Friday that didn't seem
especially personal _ broad-striped balmacaans, beaded slip dresses
and long shirt dresses that could have been designed by Oscar de la
Renta or Halston, and in fact probably were.
</P>
<P>
   Klein tends to say more through his sensational advertisements
than his fashion shows, which tells you how the focus has shifted.
On the runway, his clothes look drained of life and the emotions
consonant with it; one doesn't look at a pale gray sheath of papery
nylon or a silvery white suit of something called ``compact nylon
micro-check'' and think, Marvelous, let me at it. One thinks,
Sanitarium. It would have helped if Klein had injected into his
cold palette of white, nickel and pale blue a rebellious streak of
fuchsia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if one ignored the presentation, there was much to admire
in the collection, especially Klein's clever use of flagrantly
square men's-wear fabrics like tattersall and seersucker shirting
stripes. Before his show, Klein said the inspiration was the homey,
workaday fashion that one used to find at J.C. Penney's _
button-down shirts, skinny belts and shrunken vests over polo
shirts. It is also a look currently being revived by men's-wear
designers, including Klein: the nerd as a sexy individual.
</P>
<P>
   There were other familiar styles that modern-thinking women will
gravitate toward _ namely, shells and tops in paper-thin leather or
cotton worn with slim skirts or poplin trousers; shirt-waist
dresses in those almost invisible shirting stripes and checks;
georgette slips veiled with beaded tulle in a grid pattern, and a
singular python skirt in vivid azure. Given the sleek prettiness of
the clothes, it's hard to tell if Klein's hip nerdiness mattered or
simply gave the collection a with-it spin. Either way, women won't
care.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan had a doubleheader on Friday, showing her main
collection in the morning and her DKNY line at night in a tent
pitched in Central Park. Although both shows were something of a
no-brainer _ simple tops and bottoms at DKNY, variations of the
wrap shirt and scarf skirt in the main line _ Ms. Karan was so
firmly in familiar territory that one couldn't help but think the
day belonged to her.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, she rarely deviated from the idea of showing a
close-fitting top, whether in jersey or tightly wound chiffon or
crinkled cotton, worn with an asymmetrical skirt fluttering around
the knees. The look was a clean, intelligent update of her original
notion of pairing a bodysuit with a soft skirt. And though the show
was hardly more than a variation on a single theme _ now a stretch
chiffon wrap dress over a sheer navy slip, now an ivory jersey tank
with an ivory suede wrap skirt _ the upshot was a solid expression
of a designer's personal ideals. For too long she has dabbled in
the weird and Zen modern, when all anybody wants is the modern.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, with a klieg light ricocheting off the granite
front of Fifth Avenue, Ms. Karan sent out her DKNY collection.
Actually, it came pounding out as male and female models advanced
in columns of suede and skimpy leather. There were lacquered jeans,
bright sleeveless tops puckered with zigzag seams, tie-dyed
effects, and apron dresses with plastic stripes. It was young and
sexy, with no mental leaps.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the runways, Duke's perky knit hot pants and
popover tops looked warmed over. Ditto shiny trousers with a white
undershirt in the frisky sports style of Isaac Mizrahi. But then
too much in this otherwise colorful collection seemed a reprise of
other designers' greatest hits. The design team of Bruce continued
to perfect its idiosyncratic take on elegance, with raw denim
dresses, crochet knits and leather versions of the '80s blouson
top.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Richard Tyler seemed to come undone by his
under-the-sea theme. His show delayed by Floyd, he opened with
signature leather pants open at the sides with crochet insets.
There were sharply cut jackets, some looking slightly shrunken over
a bandeau top and hot pants hoisted up the rear. Things hit a snag
as the models, their heads plaited to resemble kelp, came out
dragging long skirts of misty chiffon, one overlayed with netting.
</P>
<P>
   So the collections, at least in New York, are over. The big
themes that stood out were a return (again) to pretty clothes, with
prints and sweet-pea tints like pink, lavender and pale blue offset
with flashes of peony, and some inventive uses of men's-wear
fabrics like glen plaid and tattersall.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was a moment when one felt something close to
emotion, even a sense of privilege, it was Bill Blass' show. Not
only were the clothes with-it, in a nonchalant way _ flared black
trousers with raffia fringe, jackets as casual as a windbreaker _
they evoked the unerring hand of Blass.
</P>
<P>
   As people poured backstage to greet him after a standing
ovation, Hila Ekelman, a buyer at Neiman Marcus, burst into tears.
Blass smiled, and what he told her could have served not only as a
balm, but as a warning to those who stray too far from what they
are and, in the deepest sense of the meaning, what they have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you dare,'' he said.

OWNERS OF SOUTH KOREAN CONGLOMERATES GAIN MORE CONTROL AFTER
ECONOMIC CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., name Ssangyong, 9th graf, is CQ) 
(af)  
 By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The government has spent much of the last
two years trying to shrink the size and power of South Korea's big
business conglomerates, which are widely blamed for the reckless
expansion and heavy debts that helped cause the country's financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, the owners of these big conglomerates, known
as chaebols, have become more powerful, making it increasingly
difficult for the government to force them to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Some persuasive evidence of this trend was released last week by
the Korea Stock Exchange, which analyzed the stock ownership of 91
listed companies that are subsidiaries of South Korea's 10 biggest
chaebols.
</P>
<P>
   The stock exchange's analysis showed that the average stake of
one subsidiary held by another subsidiary within the same
conglomerate increased from 19.9 percent in January of last year to
28.7 percent at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis also showed a record increase in the so-called
internal shareholding or the amount of shares of a chaebol's
affiliates that are held by its owners, their relatives and the
sister companies that they control.
</P>
<P>
   The average internal shareholding rose to 34.6 percent at the
end of last month, compared with 27.2 percent before the economic
crisis that battered South Korea in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The increased shareholdings do not result from rises in share
values that reflect the recent stock market boom in South Korea,
exchange officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is quite the contrary,'' said Chung
Chul-hong, a spokesman for the exchange. ``Through capital
injections from one affiliate to another, chaebol group leaders
have increased their control over their lineup of subsidiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ssangyong Group topped the list in terms of stockholdings by
owners or top executives. The founding family of the group held
6.52 percent of the group's total shares, followed by Daewoo with
5.2 percent and SK with 3.88 percent, the exchange said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation of Korean Industries, a trade group that
represents the chaebols, declined to comment on the findings.
Representatives of the big chaebols also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who have been pressing for changes in the chaebols
have called the exchange's analysis a telling reminder that South
Korea's business elite remains a powerful force. ``This is the
result of chaebol business owners continuing to prop up their
subsidiaries through capital injections from one affiliate to
another,'' said Lee Seok-hyun, a lawmaker of the ruling National
Congress for New Politics and member of a parliamentary committee
monitoring fair trade practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The control wielded by chaebol owners is still substantial,
achieved through one affiliate raising its shareholding of another
affiliate,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Chun at the stock exchange cited Hyundai Group, South Korea's
largest conglomerate, as a textbook example. In a bid to lower its
debt-to-equity ratio as required under South Korean economic
reforms, the Hyundai Electronics Co. required signficant capital
injections. But at the height of South Korea's economic recession
last year, the chip maker could not raise capital by issuing new
shares because few investors wanted to buy shares of risky
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than selling off its assets, Hyundai Group decided to
funnel cash from its construction unit, the Hyundai Engineering and
Construction Co. into the chip maker. The result was an increased
shareholding by the group's honorary chairman, Chung Ju-yung, who
was the largest shareholder of the construction unit. He
subsequently became the new majority shareholder of the chip maker
through the capital injection.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government, however, has scored some victories
in its battle to strip some power from chaebol leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the government made chaebol leaders personally
accountable for losses from risky business investments. The
chairman of Samsung Group, Lee Kun-hee, was pressed to hand over
2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion) of his personal wealth to cover
extensive losses incurred by the group's failed auto maker, Samsung
Motors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   And affiliates of South Korean business groups have been barred
from investing more than 25 percent of their assets into sister
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the government plans to strengthen the role of
outside directors by increasing their numbers at the boards of
chaebol companies, Lee said. He said the government also might form
an independent group of auditors composed of outside directors,
while allowing chaebol owners to exercise control in proportion to
their shareholding amount.
</P>
<P>
   But others are skeptical that chaebol leaders will easily
relinquish their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The methods used by people running the chaebols should not be
underestimated,'' said Cho Dam, a professor of business
administration at Chonnam University.

SHOW FEEDS ON BOOMER INSECURITIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - It was bound to happen. &QL; 
The thirtysomething set has grown older if not up. Oh, sure,
Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, who created the baby-boomer
hit in the '80s, call their new show Once and Again, but
fortysomething would have been a perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me while I gag.
</P>
<P>
   Once and Again is being touted by critics as a welcome, mature,
honest look at single parents learn ing to date again while raising
their children _ who are learning to date for the first time. It's
sensitive, it's so beautifully made it makes your teeth hurt, it
screams Big Monster Hit.
</P>
<P>
   It stinks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. A lot of people are going to love this
show. They all shop at the Pottery Barn, drive sport utility
vehicles and con sider it one of life's tragedies when Starbucks
closes early.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of the pilot sets the tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ever wanted, I think, was to be safe,'' Sela Ward's
character says, moving into the overly arty, talking-to-the-camera,
black-and-white device that is just one of the show's irritants.
</P>
<P>
   If you like that line, you'll love the show. The rest of us can
only roll our eyes and watch as Once and Again's Nielsen numbers
rise. (At least temporarily. ABC is putting the show in NYPD Blue's
slot until November, then shelving it till Janu ary and moving it
to Mondays.)
</P>
<P>
   The show stars Ward and Billy Campbell (called Bill when he
starred in The Rocketeer). Ward's character is separated;
Campbell's divorced. They meet at their chil dren's school. Coy
phone calls are made, they arrange a date, they like each other and
. . . there are, of course, complications.
</P>
<P>
   They involve, naturally, those darn kids as well as the two main
characters' doubts and insecurities. It's the kind of show where,
at least in the first two episodes, they can do nothing _ really
nothing, not just big things like having sex but also things as
small as making phone calls _ without worrying about it out loud in
that stupid black-and-white stunt.
</P>
<P>
   It's life lived in an Eddie Bauer catalog. Beautiful people
moving through their difficult lives _ many, if not most, of the
difficulties are self-imposed _ with all the depth of a
long-distance phone-carrier commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz and Zwick specialize in just this type of
navel-gazing, having created not only thirtyso mething but also the
far-superior (and short-lived) My So-Called Life. Once and Again is
the inevitable, if logical, extension.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they fake depth with Big TV Issues: sex, divorce, the
ever-popu lar parenting. But it's all just win dow-dressing for
what is basically the adult version of Dawson's Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Teen shows, even the smart ones like Buffy the Vampire Slayer,
are often ridiculed for being nothing more than wish-fulfillment
fantasies played out by beautiful young peo ple. But Once and Again
is just an older version, something to make baby boomers feel good
about themselves. The difference is that these people are supposed
to be old enough to know better, and, more significantly, it's all
So Very Serious that it's difficult to care.
</P>
<P>
   This should come as no surprise. As the most self-centered
generation of the century begins to lose its grip on popular
culture, advertisers no longer find it the most desirable de
mographic. TV is lousy with beauti ful teens, wearing expensive
clothes and emoting. How is a baby boomer to fight back?
</P>
<P>
   Once and Again is a start. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Other new Tuesday night shows:
</P>
<P>
   Judging Amy: Amy Brenneman, late of NYPD Blue, based this story
of a judge and single mom moving back in with her mom on her own
mother. Man, they must have fought a lot. Still, if you wish NBC's
Provi dence was shown more than once a week, this should be a
sufficient fix to get you through till Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mike O'Malley Show: Did you know that Mike O'Malley _ ``The
Rick,'' the obsessive fan in ESPN commercials _ is a play wright in
real life? Or that he's star ring in his own sitcom? Did you care?
Didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Shasta McNasty: If you can't say something nice. . . . How about
this? Scheduling this opposite The Mike O'Malley Show is inspired,
giving cretins twice the choices.
</P>
<P>
   Angel: Buffy's vampire boyfriend is now in LA. No pilot was
avail able, but David Boreanaz will doubtless sink his teeth into
the role. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   The Strip: The lead character is named Elvis, and he lives in
Vegas. No pilot was available, but that should tell you all you
need to know. &QL;

VIRGIN EXPRESS CHIEF QUITS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Heading two public companies on two continents has
taken its toll on Phoenix executive Jonathan Ornstein, who resigned
as chairman of Virgin Express, a low-cost European airline.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein, chairman, president and CEO of Phoenix-based Mesa Air
Group, will remain on the Virgin Express board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when you just want to simplify your life,''
Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He will turn more attention to running Mesa, a major regional
carrier that operates as America West Express in the Southwest and
as US Airways Express in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Sept. 20 of Ornstein's decision to retire as
chairman coincides with other changes at Brussels, Belgium-based
Virgin Express.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Hoare will replace Orn stein as executive
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   John Osborne, managing director of GB Airways, will join Virgin
Express as managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne replaces Jim Swigart, a business partner of Ornstein's
who serves on the board of Mesa Air Group.
</P>
<P>
   GB Airways is a franchised airline linked to British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Swigart and Ornstein are working on some airline-related
business opportunities, according to Ornstein, but he declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Express, patterned after U.S. low-cost carrier Southwest
Airlines, is owned by billionaire Richard Branson, whose business
empire includes airlines, travel, retail and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``John (Osborne) has had great success at GB Airways and I
believe that he and David (Hoare) will be great additions to the
Virgin team,'' Branson said in a prepared statement. ``I would also
like to thank both Jonathan and Jim for their contributions over
the past three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein helped start Virgin Express in 1996 and served as CEO
until last year when he resigned to take the reins at Mesa. Virgin
went from five to 23 aircraft and now serves 10 European cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein worked at Mesa before joining Conti nental Express in
1994 as president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein still has a strong interest in Virgin Express. He and
Swigart and their Barlow Partners, a private investment fund, own
about 5 or 6 percent of the airlines' stock, making them the
largest shareholders behind Branson, Ornstein said. &QL;

   Samuel James Ervin 3rd, who was the chief judge of the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals from 1989 to 1996, died on Saturday in a
hospital in Morganton, N.C. He was 73 and lived in Morganton.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin continued to serve on the court after his retirement as
chief judge. At the time of his death, he was North Carolina's only
federal appellate judge in active service.
</P>
<P>

County from 1954 to 1956. He was elected to the state House of
Representatives in 1964 and 1966.

Superior Court judge. He was named to the U.S. Court of Appeals in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin is survived by his wife, Elisabeth C. Ervin of Morganton;
and four children, Sam J. 4th, of Morganton; Elisabeth Fore Ervin
of Asheville, N.C.; Robert C., of Morganton; and Margaret Ervin
