JERUSALEM -- Unemployment rate in Israel reached 8.6 percent of the
workforce, or 195,000, in January, up from about 8.5 percent in
November and December, said the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).
</P>
<P>
The rise came despite the government's efforts to allocate more
resources for professional training courses and create thousands of
new jobs in the public sectors.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted a decrease in the jobless rate in the coming
months as the demand for workers is increasing.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The number of Internet users in Israel is expected to
reach one million within the next two years, surveys show.
</P>
<P>
So far, the number of Internet users is estimated at approximately
300,000 and there are nearly 30 firms providing Internet service.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S., British Warplanes Continue Attacks on Iraqi Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Thursday continued their attacks on Iraqi civilian facilities and
military sites, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying that
at 15:30 local time (1130 GMT) eight formations of enemy warplanes
coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi
airspace over Basra, Samawa and Nasiriya provinces.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes dropped 16 bombs at civilian facilities and military
targets, said the spokesman, adding that Iraqi air defenses fired
surface-to-air missiles at the planes and forced them to flee to their
bases at 16:50 local time (1250 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S.and British air strikes against Iraq,
U.S. and British jets patrolling the no-fly zones and the Iraqi air
defenses have clashed regularly, almost on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 gulf war with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed to continue confrontation against any allied
planes violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> NATO Aircraft Tanks Found on Romanian Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Two fuel tanks identified as
belonging to a F-15 war plane were found on Thursday on a field in
western Romania close to the border with Yugoslavia, the national
Rompres news agency quoted sources in the Romanian Interior
Minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is the first incident of this kind since NATO began its
airstrikes on Yugoslavia some three weeks ago. No missile or bomb
were reported to fall on Romanian territory till now.
</P>
<P>
The tanks fell in Graniceri of the Timis county, some 1.5 km
from the border with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two tanks could be additional fuel tanks belonging to a
F-15 aircraft, "that were released over the Yugoslav territory,
but were drawn to our country's territory due to inertia," the
sources say.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President Tours Burundi to Renew Bilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu flew to the Burundi capital Bujumbura Thursday morning
to mend ties, Rwandan Minister in the President's office, Patrick
Mazimhaka said in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
''The aim of the visit is to renew our relations, after a long
period of economic embargo imposed on Burundi by its neighbors,''
Mazimhaka was quoted by the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The last time Bizmungu was in Burundi was in 1995, before major
Pierre Buyoya swept into power in 1996 following a military coup.
Buyoya has in the part visited Rwanda three times.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka said apart from trade-related issues, the two
presidents will discuss security problems faced by their two
countries because of the Hutu rebels who have formed a coalition
to topple both regimes, the RNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Another topic on the agenda is the war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo. While Rwanda openly acknowledges the presence
of its troops in eastern Congo (K), the Burundi authorities has
adamantly denied that it is backing the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The capital Bujumbura is reportedly in a festive mood at
present. It is said that this Saturday, the Burundi Chamber of
Commerce and Industry will organize a festival commemorating the
lifting of the embargo by the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
President Bizimungu will join in the celebrations. He will also
visit different development projects in the country, official
sources in Bujumbura said.

<HEADLINE> UK, Irish Leaders to Hold Fresh Talks Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- British and Irish governments will
begin a series of meetings next week in an effort to end the arms
impasse in Northern Ireland, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at
Downing Street No. 10, Ahern told reporters he and Blair would
meet in London on Monday with the parties who are supposed to form
the province's new power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
Further discussions will take place in Dublin and Belfast later
in the week, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said it was now clear that a working draft known as the
Hillsborough Declaration which the two governments agreed earlier
this month had failed to win as much widespread support as they
wanted.
</P>
<P>
"I also feel at times that the Prime Minister and I are like
two long distance runners running into a desert," Ahern said,
adding that they could take the lead but needed others to follow
them.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, meanwhile, said
there was no doubt that the talks had hit "difficult times" but
added: "We must never forget the parties are still talking. That
is what is important."
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's first minister David Trimble urged in
Belfast once again the Irish Republican Army to disarm.
</P>
<P>
"It is time that the leaders of the republican movement stood
up to the handful of paramilitarists in their ranks," Trimble,
also leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, however, refuses to hand over their arms, arguing
decommissioning is not a precondition of the peace agreement for
its political wing Sinn Fein to join the Northern Irish cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says NATO's Bombing on Kosovo Civilians Very Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia said on Thursday
that NATO's Wednesday bombing on a civilian vehicle in a convoy in
Kosovo, the Federal republic of Yugoslavia, was a very serious
incident.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the event, Sergei Lavrov, Russia's Ambassador
to the United Nations, told reporters that "Unfortunately, we
were right when we were warning before the beginning of this
NATO action that this would bring suffering exactly to those
people whom NATO claimed it is protecting."
</P>
<P>
"I wonder whether this particular terrible incident would also
be called collateral damage, " Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said the Council members who opposed a March 26 Russian
resolution calling for a stop to the NATO's raids could have
avoided this bombing of the convoy by supporting the resolution.
</P>
<P>
He said he has requested the United Nations Secretariat to
provide information about NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
NATO admitted on Thursday that it had mistakenly hit a
civilian vehicle in a convoy in Kosovo . But it also said this
tragic accident would not weaken its resolve to forge ahead with
its air war against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Helps Ocean to Trap Carbon Dioxide: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite causing anomaly of weather
and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by
temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the
Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Feely and colleagues form the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have found that during the El
Nino years between 1991 and 1994, the release of carbon dioxide
from equatorial Pacific Ocean was between 30 and 80 percent of
that in 1996, a non-El Nino year.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino clearly has a marked influence on the overall carbon
dioxide flux," the researchers wrote in a letter to the British
science journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The oceans exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide with the
atmosphere each year. Areas where water is sinking absorb the gas,
those where water is rising to the surface release the gas.
</P>
<P>
The most important of gas-releasing areas is the equatorial
Pacific, where is also the home of El Nino, the quasi-biennial
warming event in the surface waters of the eastern equatorial
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the equatorial Pacific Ocean is the source
of 72 percent of the annual flux of carbon to the atmosphere from
the equatorial oceans.
</P>
<P>
Scientists usually estimate how much carbon dioxide should be
in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned.
But some 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide go unaccounted for each
year.
</P>
<P>
The NOAA team's new research helps explain the lower growth in
carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere during those years.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have found that reduced carbon dioxide releases
in the Pacific during El Nino could account for up to a third of
this "missing" carbon dioxide.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Accuses Ethiopia of Bombing Civilian Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian fighter planes Thursday
bombed the town of Adi-Kaieh and the village of Forto in Western
Eritrea, killing two children and wounding eight others,
according to a news release by Eritrean Foreign Ministry reaching
here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The high-altitude bombings, which hit a school and partially
demolished a church at the place about 100 km south of the
capital Asmara, were "indiscriminate", the news release alleged.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces have carried out the air aid on the
civilian targets only two days after the U.N. Security Council
renewed its appeal for an immediate halt of hostilities and the
implementation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Framework Agreement, said the Eritrean Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
But Ethiopia said it had struck only "military targets".
</P>
<P>
Some 27 civilians were killed and 42 others wounded in the
previous bombings by the Ethiopian army since February 6 this
year, the Eritrean foreign ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eritrean News Agency Thursday quoted a senior
Eritrean official as saying that Ethiopia has violated the Geneva
Convention by arresting and detaining 1,500 Eritrean civilians
and deporting 54,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have accepted the OAU framework
agreement which demands both sides pull back their troops and
allow international monitors into the disputed areas while a
border commission establishes a mutually recognized boundary.
</P>
<P>
The 11-month border dispute between the two countries escalated
into fierce fighting in June 1998 and renewed in February and
March this year.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Proteins to Body Clock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Certain proteins could play an
essential part in keeping the body's natural clock synchronized
with the 24-hour rhythm, scientists in the Netherlands said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jan Hoeijmakers and colleagues, at Erasmus University in
Rotterdam have isolated two proteins called Cry1 and Cry2 in mice,
which have close similarities to proteins that mediate the
light-dependent processes in plants.
</P>
<P>
The findings, published in the science journal Nature, suggests
that "mammalian Cry proteins may be the body-clock's biosensors,"
the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The importance of these proteins was underlined when the
scientists created strains of mice that lacked either one of these
proteins.
</P>
<P>
When the mice were tested in conditions of constant darkness,
those mice without Cry1 were found to have body clocks that run
too fast, and those without Cry2 have body clocks that run too
slowly.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that mice without either protein lack any
natural rhythm to their daily activities.
</P>
<P>
The proteins seem to adjust the body's clock to changes in
light during the different seasons and are an integral part of the
clock itself, and without these proteins there is no biological
clock running, the scientists suggested.
</P>
<P>
They believed that a better understanding of how circadian
rhythms work could allow scientists in the future to adjust the
body's internal clock and to treat people who have disturbed
biological rhythms because of a defect in the Cry proteins.

<HEADLINE> Tomatoes Grow Faster in Loud Rock Music: Finding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have discovered
that tomatoes grow faster when listening to loud rock music and
thumping drum and bass tunes.
</P>
<P>
The research, carried out by scientists at British Tomato
Growers' Association, showed that the vibrations caused by loud,
fast-paced music boosts the quality of production by dislodging
pollen so that it falls on the stigmas causing self-pollination.
</P>
<P>
Tomatoes only grow once this has taken place and the musical
vibrations speed up the process. Until now, bees have been used to
hurry along the growing cycle.
</P>
<P>
"The bees are doing an excellent job but we must do everything
we can to satisfy demand," said Alan Parker, chair of the British
Tomato Growers' Association.
</P>
<P>
"Music with a good, strong beat is best," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Completes Budget for Fiscal 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-controlled
Congress approved a final 1.74-trillion-U.S.-dollar budget for
fiscal 2000 on Thursday that Republicans hope will sharpen their
image as tax cutters and as a party that has moved beyond
President Bill Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the Republican plan Thursday by a 54-44
vote that was along party lines. The House passed the same package
Wednesday by 220-208 in another sharply partisan vote.
</P>
<P>
The measure maps a 10-year tax cut of at least 778 billion
dollars and underlines other issues the Republicans will emphasize
during this year's run-up to the 2000 elections: using Social
Security's enormous surpluses to reduce the national debt and
spending more for defense and schools.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which does not require Clinton's signature, sets
overall tax and spending targets for later legislation that will
fill in the details. Clashes with Clinton over those bills seem
certain.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Republican plan would do nothing to extend the
fiscal solvency of Social Security and Medicare, which face
pressures in coming years from the retirement of baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
"The budget... falls short of what the American people need for
meeting the challenges of the 21st century," he said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wants smaller tax cuts. In addition, Republicans say
they will pay for their defense and domestic spending increases by
cutting other programs, which Democrats and even some Republicans
say will never survive votes in Congress.
</P>
<P>
This year's measure was a compromise between similar House and
Senate budgets approved last month. It envisions a budget surplus
of 141 billion dollars in fiscal 2000, which begins on October 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans call for using all 1.8 trillion dollars in
expected Social Security surpluses over the next decade to reduce
the national debt -- or to revamp Social Security or Medicare,
should a bipartisan compromise emerge on either.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would spend a small portion of those surpluses on
domestic programs. Neither side has proposed changes in benefits
or taxes for Social Security and Medicare that many experts say
will be needed to buttress both programs for the long run.
</P>
<P>
Most economists agree that reducing the national debt would
strengthen the economy by keeping interest rates lower. A larger
economy should make it easier for the government to raise money to
pay benefits to future retirees, they say.
</P>
<P>
By setting aside the Social Security surpluses, Republicans
also hope to prevent Democrats from accusing them of diverting the
money to tax cuts for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
Republicans say their tax cut might grow if new projections
expected this summer show larger surpluses than now expected. It
will start relatively small, about 15 billion dollars next year if
Republicans can find spending cuts or new revenue to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders plan to decide which taxes to cut later this
year. Lawmakers will also decide later this year how much to spend
on specific programs.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Shas Party Leader Sentenced to 4 Years in Prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Aryeh Deri, leader of Israel's
powerful right-wing Shas Party, was sentenced Thursday to four years
in prison for bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
Deri was also convicted of fraud and breaching public trust by the
Jerusalem District Court last month.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling said Deri took 155,000 dollars in bribes in return
for using his senior position in the interior ministry in the late
1980s to provide some organizations with special treatment and
government funding.
</P>
<P>
Judge Yaacov Tzemach said on Thursday that the tough sentence
reflects the gravity of the crime.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is not a one-time mistake made by Deri and taking
bribes has been "part of his life style" over a period of over five
years.
</P>
<P>
Tzemach stressed that Deri is the first sitting Israeli minister
convicted of taking bribes, and that this "presents an extreme danger
to the nation and the people."
</P>
<P>
Deri is expected to appeal to the High Court within 45 days after
the sentence. The district court will suspend the implementation of
the sentence until the High Court rules on the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Shas Party, which currently has 10 seats in the 120-member Knesset
(parliament), is made up of Jews of Middle East origins.
</P>
<P>
Followers of Shas has regarded the conviction as a ruling against
the whole party, and have held several demonstrations in the past
several weeks. They also insist that Deri will remain as the
leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 elections, Shas joined forces with the left-wing Labor
Party and ensured Yitzhak Rabin's premiership. But in the 1996
elections, Shas switched its support to the right-wing Likud Party and
helped hard-line Benjamin Netanyahu become prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Although Netanyahu and Deri have formed a close alliance in the
past two years, Rabbi Ovadia, the Shas spiritual leader who has the
final say in the party, has not declared his preference for the
candidates of premiership in the May elections.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, both Likud and Labor leaders have avoided
forswearing cooperation with Deri in the future, for fear of losing
this potential ally.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very difficult day for Deri's family," Netanyahu said in
response to Thursday's sentence, but adding Israel is a democratic
country and all should act according to the law in the political
sphere.
</P>
<P>
Labor chairman Ehud Barak also said that "this is tough day for
Israeli politics, but everyone must respect the court's ruling."
</P>
<P>
However, Amnon Shahak, leader of the newly established Center
Party, said that Deri should resign now. As long as the court's
verdict stands, there should be no political negotiations with Shas if
Deri remains as its leader, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local political analysts said that the conviction of Deri may rally
Shas supporters to the polls. And if the current alliance between
Likud and Shas does not break up, the conviction might help Netanyahu
in his pursuit to retain premiership in the coming elections.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels have accused
president Laurent Kabila of violating human rights by executing
innocent people, rebel-held radio Goma monitored in Rwanda
announced.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda News Agency quoted the radio as saying that the
charge followed the public execution of 11 people Wednesday in
Mbuji-Mayi, the diamond-rich capital of the Oriental Kasai
province. The Kabila government said the eleven people had been
involved in armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
Radio Goma claimed that the eleven were just "innocent people
who were executed for their alleged sympathy to the advancing
Congolese rebels."
</P>
<P>
In an another development, radio Goma reported Thursday morning
that the governor of Congo's Oriental Kasai Province, Jean Charles
Okoto has called on the population to arm themselves with machetes
spears and join the government loyalists in checking the advance
of Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
It is said that fear of imminent assault on Mbuji-Mayi by the
rebels aided by Rwandans and Ugandans has increased following the
capture of Lubefu and Lodja towns early this week. Both towns are
situated at about 150 and 300 kms, northeast of that town
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese rebels took up arms to oust Kabila in August last
year and they are made up by former armed forces of late dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, the Tutsi ethnic Banyamulenge, and disgruntled
elements from Kabila's forces.

JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Rejecting fresh U.S. criticism over
the accelerated construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel and the
U.S. have always had their differences on this matter.
</P>
<P>
"With all due respect for the friendship between the two countries,
the Prime Minister is committed to ensure -- first and foremost -- the
interests of the State of Israel," Netanyahu's office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin charged Wednesdayeral actions which might change the status
quo in the West Bank and prejudge the result of the final-status
talks, which have yet to start.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers in the West Bank are one of the core constituencies
of hard-line Netanyahu, who came to power in 1996. During his tenure,
the number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank has grown by 30 percent
to 200,000.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, he asked about 100 settler leaders to work for
his re-election, pledging to "do a lot more" to expand settlement
construction.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Thursday held consultations of the whole on
Iraq with focus on fate of Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler and his weapons teams.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Council exchanged views on the two
six-monthly reports on Iraq which were submitted by the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency(IAEA), two U.N. bodies in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of destruction.
</P>
<P>
In its report, UNSCOM said it could not give the Security
Council assurances about the disposal of Iraq's prohibited
weapons programs and their possible reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, UNSCOM's report prompted a lot
of arguments among the members of the Security Council, manily
on the fate of UNSCOM and its chief Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Lavrov, Russia's Ambassador to the United Nations,
declined to attend Council consultations, saying the session is
waste of time. Lavrov left an aide to sit in on the closed-door
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Lavrov, who has called for UNSCOM to be
removed and Butler be fired, said "I mentioned that we would not
be participating in the discussion of the UNSCOM and IAEA reports
for the simple reason that these reports do not add anything new
to the Security Council's work on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Lavrov has blamed Butler for triggering the U.S.-led military
strikes against Iraq last December with a report saying that
Iraq had failed to cooperate fully with the United Nations
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. diplomats said Chinese Permanent Representative to the
United Nations, Qin Huasun, also called for the removal of Butler,
saying he had lost credibility by playing unprofessional role in
U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said most of the Council members shared the
common view that UNSCOM was dead and there should be a new U.N.
weapons regime in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM withdrew from Iraq ahead of U.S.-led military strikes
against Iraq, which has pledged not to allow UNSCOM to return.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan OIL Workers Complain over Unpaid Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 160 workers sacked by the
state-owned petroleum Company, Petrorwanda, have threatened to sue
the government for the failure to meet their terminal benefits
equivalent to six-month wages.
</P>
<P>
The employees accused the Rwandan government and the company,
among other things, for putting down their request, the Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) Reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the company's general manager, Jean Pierre
Ruburika, Petrorwanda has decided to give the workers just
one-month salary.
</P>
<P>
"Petrorwanda has cleared all their monthly salaries and
allowances, but there is no money to pay the terminal benefits
they are claiming for as the company is faced with dire deficits
due to excessive corruption," Ruburika underlined.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the National Trade Union (Cestrar)
said more than 3,000 former employees in various privatized
parastatals have filed complaints against the government for
neglecting their concerns, mainly unemployment and terminal
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Ruburika said that most of these workers were sacked from the
Petrorwanda company early this year due to excessive embezzlement
and corruption that had led the company into terrible losses.
</P>
<P>
For Jean Marie Vianney Shumbusho, the head of the national
secretariat for privatization in the Rwandan Ministry of Finance,
some of the parastatals that were privatized had run out of
production because of poor administration and corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Companies like the National Printery, Kabuye Sugar Works and
banana wine manufacturing, Ovibar, were completely pushed out of
production due to making losses," Shumbusho indicated .
</P>
<P>
However, the government is soon having a comprehensive plan to
solve all the problems affecting the employees in privatized
companies, he promised.

<HEADLINE> Long Way to Go on Cyprus' EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A lot of hard work needs to be done
to push forward Cyprus' bid to join the European Union (EU), but no
problems seen so far, a Finnish envoy for Cyprus said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jaako Blomberg said that he conducted "very useful discussion" with
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, during which he expressed the
Finnish government's support to the settlement process on the Cyprus
issue and to the U.N. effort in this respect as well.
</P>
<P>
He said there are encouraging signs that the urgency to find a
settlement to the protracted Cyprus issue has been felt.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite natural that any prolongation of a settlement would
not be benefitting either party, Cyprus would be gaining by achieving
a satisfactory and lasting settlement."
</P>
<P>
Their talks also covered Finland's forthcoming EU presidency in the
second half of the year, the EU enlargement and accession negotiations
which Finland during its presidency will give high priority.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and launched its accession
talks with the EU in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and controlled the northern third of the island in the wake of a
failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Jailed S. Leone Rebel Chief Granted Leave for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Appeals Court of Sierra Leone
has granted permission for rebel leader Foday Sankoh to leave
prison for peace talks with his followers outside the west African
country, a report reaching here quoted Justice Minister Solomon
Berewa as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The approval followed Sankoh's application Wednesday, said
Berewa, who is also the country's attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
However, both government officials and a senior rebel spokesman
have set a condition that security issues had to be cleared before
rebel delegates can travel to Togo to meet their leader on April
18.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh is in custody in the capital Freetown appealing a death
sentence for treason. He is expected to meet his commanders in
Togo as demanded by his followers as a key condition for ending
their armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
"Three Appeal Court judges sat yesterday on a government
request to the court to grant the RUF (Revolutionary United Front)
leader legal permission to leave Sierra Leone and travel to Togo
for consultations with his commanders and supporters," Berewa told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The judges granted Sankoh permission to go to Togo but on
three conditions," Berewa said, citing the key condition as
Sankoh's eventual return to the Sierra Leone judiciary.
</P>
<P>
A sheriff would take custody of Sankoh and sign an undertaking
to produce him before the court after the talks, added the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah said a sheriff
designated by the government would immediately submit a memorandum
on the court's custody demands.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah is also said to have written to the United Nations
asking the world body to waive a travel ban on Sierra Leonean
rebels so Sankoh and his men could go to Togo.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) will provide a clear environmental input to the
upcoming discussions at the U.N. Commission on Sustainable
Development (CSD), which begins on April 19 in New York.
</P>
<P>
UNEP's senior policy advisor Barkary Kante said here Thursday
that the agency is to offer suggestions on sustainable tourism,
ocean issues, sustainable production and consumption, small island
issues and biodiversity to the CSD debate next week.
</P>
<P>
"While contributing to social and economic development, tourism
can also have serious negative environmental impacts resulting
from resources consumption, pollution and waste generated,
destroying the sound environment on which the tourism industry
depends," Kante said.
</P>
<P>
UNEP has been working with its partners, such as the World
Tourism Organization, to ensure that environmental considerations
are fully integrated into economic and social aspects of tourism
development, the policy advisor told a news conference here in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
On ocean issues, he said the UNEP has been carrying out various
 programs, including the International Coral Reef Initiative, to
reduce the pollution in oceans.
</P>
<P>
Regarding sustainable production and consumption, Kante said
greater attention is needed to improve resource efficiency of
industry and adoption of cleaner and safer methods of production.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP will also announce a new biodiversity information and
 assessment project at the CSD's high-level ministerial meeting,
Kante added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sees Clinton's Remark As Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday cited the recent
rei}rks of U.S. President Bill Clinton on Washington's relations with
Tehran as a change from Washington, but called for more changes in
U.S. policies and behaviors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks indicated a change in the statements of the U.S.
officials and "they contain traces of a kind of realism towards the
Islamic Republic of Iran and its r+h culture," Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the remarks are an admission of the miseries and
agonies the U.S. has imposed on tov Iranian people over the past 50
years, the Islamic RepublihNews Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said on Wednesday that Iran may have been
disfavored by the western countries, including the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian people had the right to be indignant at what "my country,
my culture or my allies may have done to them 50 years or 150 years
ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Terming Clinton's remaras an adm3sion to Washington'sjunjust
relations with Tehran, the Iranian spokesman said, the remarks are "a
matter Tehran haQKbeen stressing upon over Ge past 20 years."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "the ya'stick in relations between countries is
the behavior of United States."
</P>
<P>
"For the great people of Iran, what is important isq practical
change in the U.S. policies and behaviors towards the Islamic Republic
of Iran," he said, "and the basis of evaluation is practical and
tangible steps that the U.S. government should take towards Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. broke off their diplomatic ties in 1980 after the
takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by the Iranian students in
November, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Iranian leaders labeled the U.S. as "the
Great Satan" and strongly condemned the U.S. "arrogant and hegmonist"
policies in the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Washington has nabbed every opportunity to isolate Tehran
from the international political arena by accusing Iran of support-O (ovvrrori@
, undermining the Middle East peace process and seeking weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The two sides softened their verbal attacks against each other after
Iranian President Mmmad Khatami in January past year called for talks
between the two nations in order to break down the "wall of distrust"
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, under strong pressures both from the U.S. and Iran, the
two governments have not succeeded in moving toards a compromise in
their relations, though they have taken some practical steps.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday urged international agreements which
could regulate missiles.
</P>
<P>
Annan was responding to the recent missile tests by India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, he said " The
recent tests by India and Pakistan of medium-range missiles, as
well as actions by other countries in the area of ballistic
missile development and missile defenses, have underscored the
need for multilaterally negotiated norms against the development
of such weapons."
</P>
<P>
"Currently there was no treaty regulating missiles.
International agreements on such norms would substantially improve
prospects for future progress on existing bilateral and
multilateral disarmament and arms control," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
India at the weekend launched its intermediate range Agli-II
missile, describing the test as a complete success.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan countered on Wednesday by firing its medium-range
Ghauri-II missile and a second one on Thursday, saying the tests
helped maintain South Asia's strategic balance.

very serious, even worse than in the 1993-1994 civil war period,
citing the spreading of diseases and mal-nutrition.
</P>
<P>
According to Vaal, the present assistance work of the WFP
should give priority to the "most fragile group", namely the aged,
women, the sick, orphans or the forsaken.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that women, children and the aged people now
account for more than 70 percent of all those in the refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, due to lack of fund and poor
transportation, her organization has initiated a "labor for food"
program to encourage refugees to grow crops in the land around the
camps so as to partially solve the problem of food supply.
</P>
<P>
Refugee problem has long plagued the war-torn country. The
country used to have three million refugees. According to the
United Nations Humanitarian Assistance Coordination, before the
civil war broke out once again last year, there were nearly one
million refugees who were not yet settled.

<HEADLINE> World Drug Giants Unite for New Genome Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Some of the biggest multi-national
drug companies and several world's leading academic centers
Thursday unveiled a new scheme to create a high-quality map of
human genetic markers which could herald a revolution in medicine.
</P>
<P>
The two-year, 45-million-U.S. dollar initiative, called SNP
Consortium, will "help researchers find out why some individuals
are susceptible to certain diseases," Britain's Wellcome Trust,
the world's largest medical research charity, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide a powerful new tool to enhance
understanding of disease processes and facilitate discovery,
development and delivery of safer and more effective medications,
said the Wellcome Trust, which is spearheading the initiative with
four of America's most prestigious genetics centers.
</P>
<P>
The group of ten pharmaceutical companies include AstraZeneca,
Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, F.Hoffmann-La Roche, Glaxo
Wellcome, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Novartis, Pfizer, Searle, and
SmithKline Beecham.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the project is to identify the smallest genetic
variations that distinguish one person from another, known as
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
</P>
<P>
Pinpointing these changes will lead to an understanding of why
some people are predisposed to diseases such as cancer, diabetes,
depression and arthritis, whilst others are not.
</P>
<P>
It will also allow new drugs to be more effective and tailored
to an individual's genetic make-up.

<HEADLINE> NATO Only Says Regret For Killing Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) spokesman said here Wednesday that "NATO
deeply regrets the loss of life to civilians from the attack"
Wednesday on a convoy "travelling between Prezren and Djakovica".
</P>
<P>
"As you all know, NATO pilots have orders to strike only at
military targets. We have taken every possible precaution to avoid
causing harm to civilians. Our Operation Allied Force was launched
to save civilian lives, not to expend them," NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told a daily news briefing for air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, a NATO pilot was operating over western Kosovo,
</P>
<P>
...the pilot attacked what he believed to be military vehicles
and a convoy. He was convinced he had the right target, he dropped
his bomb in good faith, as you would expect a trained pilot from a
democratic NATO country to do," Shea said at NATO headquarters in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"The pilot reported at the time that he was attacking a
military convoy. The NATO bomb destroyed the lead vehicle which we
now believe to have been a civilian vehicle. I again stress NATO
deeply regrets the loss of life from this tragic accident," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said there no conflict in human history
has ever been accident-free or will ever be. "We can reduce the
risks of accidents, but we can not eliminate them altogether," he
told correspondents from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The so-called accident reportedly killed more than 60
civilians, causing the largest civilian casualties so far since
NATO started its air strikes against Yugoslavia, an independent
and sovereign country in Europe. But NATO refused to acnowledged a
similar "accident" in which at least six civilians were reportedly
killed at the same day.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Reaffirms to Maintain Restrictions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong has reaffirmed that his government will
maintain regulatory restriction on foreign banks in the domestic
markets with a view to protecting and building up local banks.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who doubles as the Chairman of Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS), made the point in a written answer to a question
by a parliament member who asked whether the government's position
in determining the pace and path of banking mergers in Singapore
is contradictory to the principle of adhering to free market
forces in Singapore's open economy.
</P>
<P>
Lee said: "while we have promoted competition in the banking
industry, the MAS has restricted foreign banks' activities in the
domestic retail markets to protect and build up local banks."
</P>
<P>
"The government must set the pace of liberalization in the
banking sector, because we do not start from a totally laissez
faire situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister reiterated that foreign banks are
subject to limits on opening branches, setting up off-premises
ATMs, participating in shared-ATM networks and offering Electronic
Funds Transfer at Point-at-Sale (EFTPOS) services.
</P>
<P>
Billing the banking system as a key component of the country's
economy, Lee said strong domestic banks anchored in Singapore have
interests closely aligned to the interests of Singapore and a
financial system in which the local banks have a large market
share is therefore likely to be more stable and resilient.
</P>
<P>
Lee also noted globalization and rapid technological change are
transforming the banking environment globally and inevitably this
means more foreign competition for local banks.
</P>
<P>
"By taking steps to liberalize the banking industry now, we can
pro-actively manage this change. But we can not simply remove all
restrictions overnight because the industry needs time to adjust
to the new environment and we must maintain confidence and
stability in the banking system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The transition from the present state to the new one must be
paced so as not to jeopardize this confidence and stability. MAS,
therefore, drawing up a five-year program to do this," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
In June last year, MAS announced that it would be opening up
the financial sector to greater competition and that it would make
the change progressively over the five years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimming Body Determined to Fight Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, northeast China, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
Swimming Association (CSA) has once again announced its
determination to further tighten the control on the use of
performance-improving drugs, saying that it had drawn bitter
lessons from the past.
</P>
<P>
CSA officials said at an anti-doping meeting here on Thursday
that the association is determined to co-operate in an even better
way with the International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA), the
sport's world governing body, in the concerted, worldwide fight
against drugs in sports.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken by the Chinese association last year had won
wide appreciation from the world as well as a special FINA
delegation which visited China in November last year.
</P>
<P>
FINA made a decision earlier this month to widen the scope of
its screening on swimmers from the current random selection of the
world's top 50 swimmers to all that have registered to FINA-
affiliated member federations (associations).
</P>
<P>
Any association with four positive tests during the 12 previous
months will be banned from FINA-sanctioned competitions for up to
two years.
</P>
<P>
FINA announced in Hong Kong that all the 345 urine samples
including 65 from Chinese swimmers, collected since the beginning
of this year by FINA doping controllers had been tested negative.
</P>
<P>
The 142 samples collected from 81 Chinese swimmers in or out of
competitions since February last year were also tested negative.
</P>
<P>
The CSA said that it carried out 600 drug tests last year on
its registered swimmers including 424 out-of-competition ones,
with four turning out positive.
</P>
<P>
The CSA added that up to October, four cases came out positive
out of the 104 out-of-competition tests carried out by FINA
controllers on Chinese swimmers last year.
</P>
<P>
The CSA has in recent years considerably intensified doping
tests on its own swimmers, including trial use of blood tests
prior to this year's short-course world championships.
</P>
<P>
FINA carried out trial blood tests during the world
championships but the results were not taken as official as that
of urine sample testing.
</P>
<P>
CSA officials said that it plans to carry out 610 doping tests
on Chinese swimmers this year, with most being out-competition
tests.
</P>
<P>
The association will continue to adopt harsh punishment on any
drug offenders. According to current CSA rules, first-time
offenders will be suspended for four years and any Chinese swimmer
who is found to have used drugs will be banned for life.

<HEADLINE> Russia Strongly Condemns NATO's Bombing of Albanian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday strongly
condemned NATO's bombing of ethnic Albanian refugees on a road in
Kosovo, calling the killing a criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry, Russia expressed
its deep indignation over the incident, which took place on
Wednesday when NATO's pilots bombed a convoy of ethnic Albanian
refugees in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At least 64 ethnic Albanians were killed and more than 20
others wounded. The majority in the convoy were women and children.
</P>
<P>
The incident served as an testament of NATO's brutal
infringement of international humanitarian rules, the Interfax
news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry requests that a swift and fair
investigation be launched, the Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the number of innocent civilian
casualties rose sharply in recent days when NATO warplanes
targeted more and more non-military facilities in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> British, Irish Premiers to Discuss N.Irish Peace Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
was set for urgent talks with his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern
at Downing Street on Thursday to find a way to unlock the Northern
Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the deadlock over the issue on arms
decommissioning at 0500 p.m. local time as expectations fade that
the on-going talks between the parties will produce a breakthrough
this week, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is following the rejection by Sinn Fein and the
Progressive Unionists of the Hillsborough Declaration which the
British and Irish governments proposed early April as a way to
break the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The lack of progress makes it increasingly unlikely that Blair
or Ahern, who also met at the European Union meeting in Brussels
on Wednesday, will travel to Belfast later this week to push for a
deal on the disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said it was time "for the parties themselves
to come up with suggestions. If they don't like the suggestions on
the table, they can come up with their own."
</P>
<P>
An Ulster Unionist Party spokesman, meanwhile, said in Belfast
that the party would like to see the two prime ministers to be
present this week, but still hoped progress could be made.
</P>
<P>
"The UUP is determined to break the deadlock and sees the
declaration as the basis for negotiation," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of African
Football (CAF) said on Thursday that it has made a formal appeal
to FIFA, and to the presidents of the five other soccer
confederations, for the 2006 World Cup finals to be awarded to
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"In the spirit of the principle of rotation, which saw the USA
host the finals in 1994, Europe in 1998 and Asia to host the next
finals in 2002, it is only fair that the 2006 finals go to Africa,
" CAF said in a statement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"For the 2002 edition, in a stand of solidarity and mutual
respect, all the confederations backed Asia as a sole candidate to
host the World Cup finals through the bids of Japan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
"Given that several African countries already fulfil the
conditions required for the organisation of the World Cup it would
be fair to have the 2006 edition held in Africa."
</P>
<P>
The 2006 World Cup hosts will be decided by FIFA next March.

TOKYO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus in
February fell 32.2 percent from a year earlier to 1,111.9 billion
yen (9.3 billion U.S. dollars), as falling exports overwhelmed a
drop in imports, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the current account surplus to post a
year-on-year decline since last November. The surplus surged 72.2
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Goods and services trade in February registered a surplus of
620.9 billion yen (5.2 billion dollars), down 41.6 percent, the
ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade decreased 25.9 percent to 1,
097.6 billion yen (9.3 billion dollars), with exports down 13.0
percent to 3,461.2 billion yen (29.2 billion dollars) and imports
down 5.4 percent to 2,363.6 billion yen (19.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In February, Japan's exports to its Asian neighbors tumbled 17.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says NATO Air Campaign Not to Be Quick or Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen told Congress Thursday that the U.S.-led NATO air campaign
in Yugoslavia "is not going to be quick or easy or neat",
signaling it could stretch into Summer.
</P>
<P>
Referring to committing ground forces to the effort, Cohen said,
"The reason that we have gone forward as we have with an air
campaign is that there was not a consensus in the NATO alliance to
do anything but this."
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cohen
said he regretted the death of civilians that resulted when a NATO
bomb struck a convoy Wednesday. "It was under extraordinary
circumstances," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said, "We do value human life. We do try to reduce the
risks to innocent human beings."
</P>
<P>
In closed-door meetings this week with congressional officials,
U.S. military leaders suggested NATO is poised to continue the
3-week-old air campaign for several weeks longer, possibly into
midsummer if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces
continue fighting Kosovar Albanians in the Serbian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Hoint Chiefs, told
lawmakers that while bombing has been frequently hampered by
weather, conditions usually improve in the Balkans in June and
July, according to the officials attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a sustained campaign," said one lawmaker
who was briefed.

<HEADLINE> Hubble Captures Most Distant Object in Universe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists using the Hubble
Space Telescope have discovered the oldest and most distant known
object in the Universe.
</P>
<P>
The object, a galaxy of new stars, is 13 billion light-years
away from Earth, a distance corresponds to when the Universe was
only 5 percent of its present age.
</P>
<P>
Professor Kenneth Lanzetta and colleagues from the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, made the discovery using
the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph aboard Hubble.
</P>
<P>
This instrument enables them to study the light from very faint
objects, which is invisible to conventional telescopes.
</P>
<P>
Their results, published Thursday in the British science
journal Nature, showed the object is a galaxy broadcasting
particularly strongly in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum,
suggesting star formation of particularly youthful vigor.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that the new finding can help them determine
when galaxies formed and developed, and learn more about the
origins of the chemical elements that make life possible.
</P>
<P>
They believed that as technology available to astronomers would
gradually improve, there would undoubtedly be further discoveries
of objects even further away in space than the galaxy just
identified.

<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
of ECOMOG will begin to withdraw the 15,000-strong troops in
Sierra Leone later this year, Nigerian Chief of Defense Staff Air
Marshal Al-amin Daggash said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a one-day extraordinary meeting of defense chiefs
of troops- contributing countries held here Thursday, Daggash said
contributing countries must build on planning, training and
development of the Sierra Leone armed forces to enable them
replace ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which provides 12,000 of the ECOMOG troops and had
borne most of financial, material and human burden, is being
involved in the training of that country's military personnel at
its defense academy as part of its military aid, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting discussed command and control of the force,
the training of Sierra Leone armed forces and other problems being
experienced by the force.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG troops helped restore President Tejan Kabbah of
Sierra Leone in March last year after 11 months of junta rule
supported by the rebel Revolutionary United Front, which has been
launching a seven-year rebellion in that country.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Find First Solar System outside Our Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. astronomers have discovered
the first solar system other than our own which has three planets
orbiting a Sun-like star, the BBC News Online reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The star, called Upsilon Andromedae, lies four hundred thousand
billion kilometers away from Earth and is easily visible to the
unaided eye in the night sky.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, astronomers Geoff Marcy and Paul Butler of San
Francisco State University found evidence that a planet, about the
same mass as Jupiter, was circling the star.
</P>
<P>
Now they have discovered that two other planets are also
orbiting Upsilon Andromedae, said BBC News Online, adding that
astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
have also made observations of the star and confirmed the
findings.
</P>
<P>
Until now, astronomers have detected many Jupiter-sized planets
orbiting nearby solar-type stars but not a solar system. The new
finding by U.S. scientists offers the first evidence that solar
systems like our own could be commonplace in our galaxy.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the most important astronomical discoveries for
decades," Professor Geoff Marcy, one of the key discoverers of the
system, was quoted as saying.

<P>
MAPUTO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's incumbent President
Joaquim Chissano will run in the coming presidential elections as
candidate of the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo), a
senior official from the party has said.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Joaquim Chipande, member of Frelimo's political
commission and former defense minister, revealed this Thursday in
the country's northern Nampula City, where he was making
preparations for the elections slated for October, this year, the
Mozambican News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that senior officials of the ruling
party stated publicly that Chissano will run for a second term.
</P>
<P>
During the country's first multi-party elections in 1994,
Chissano won 53.3 percent of votes, beating his rival Afonso
Dhlakama, the candidate for the country's largest opposition --
the National Resistance of Mozambique, who obtained 33.7 percent
of the total votes, and became president of the southern African
country.

<P>
ATHENS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- While expressing concern about the
Kosovo crisis being prolonged, Greece on Thursday urged all sides
concerned to make efforts to immediately end the crisis by
political and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas made the statement
at his regular press briefing. He stressed that as a member of
NATO and the European Union (EU) and as a Balkan country, Greece
was exhausting all limits and possibilities to contribute to
efforts aimed at solving the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Greece would not send troops to participate in any possible
ground military operations in Yugoslavia by NATO forces, the
spokesman reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Reppas also repeated Athens' position on refugees that no
refugee would be accepted unless there was some comprehensive
European plan to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
He described Wednesday's NATO attack on a column of Kosovo
refugees as "a tragic event," saying that it was however not
enough to express sorrow. "This is the abhorrent face of war and
the consequences of choices which downgrade the human factor," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Legislator Says Sino-Thai Ties Enjoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting top Chinese
legislator Li Peng said here on Thursday that through joint
efforts, the friendly relations between China and Thailand will
continue to develop by leaps and bounds in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Meechai Ruechupan, speaker of the Senate
of the Thai National Assembly, Li said that it was the common
wishes and duties of the two countries to continue to promote the
friendly cooperation between them in all areas.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that through our joint efforts, the friendly
relations between China and Thailand will continue to develop by
leaps and bounds," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) of China, arrived here on Tuesday on a
five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there had been increased exchanges between the NPC
and the Thai parliament, he said such exchanges had helped
increase mutual understanding and trust between the two
parliaments, and at the same time, push forward the over-all
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meechai said that Thailand had been watching closely the
development of China. He said China, with a great sense of
responsibility, managed to keep its currency the Renminbi stable
as the financial crisis hit Asia.
</P>
<P>
It cost China a lot not to devalue its currency, he noted. But
it helped Asia avoid another round of crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that in the process of economic globalization, it
is important for developing countries to seize opportunities of
development. However, he stressed, it is even more important for
them to realize the challenges accompanying the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Given the lessons of the Asian financial crisis, the developing
countries must learn to protect themselves in the process of
economic globalization, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the people of Thailand, the country
first hit by the Asian financial crisis, are able to overcome the
current difficulties and bring the country's economy back on the
track of healthy development.

ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said the Ethiopian
air force Thursday attacked and inflicted heavy damage on
Eritrea's Sawa Military Training Camp.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Office of Ethiopian Government
Spokesperson Selome Taddesse was quoted by the Ethiopian News
Agency as saying that "the Eritrean government, which lost
considerable number of troops during Operation Sunset and various
other successive engagements, has embarked on a ninth round forced
conscription and was preparing to launch training at the Sawa
Military Training Camp this week."
</P>
<P>
Sawa Military Training Camp is located at Mendefera, some 54
kilometers south of Asmara, the Eritrean capital.
</P>
<P>
However, Eritrean foreign ministry in a statement Thursday
claimed that Ethiopian Jets bombed civilian targets, killing two
children and wounding eight at a school and a village 100 km south
of capital Asmara.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson said, "the
Ethiopian air force, in its strikes today, inflicted heavy damage
on the training camp and the conscripts," adding that "the damage
would significantly hamper the planned training."

<HEADLINE> African People's Rights Urged to Be Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A three-day workshop on
"litigating economic and social rights in Africa" opened in Accra
Thursday with a call on African politicians to adopt positive
strategies to advance the effective use of human rights
protection mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The workshop that has brought together about 60 participants
from across Africa, Europe and the U.S., is under the auspices of
the Africa Legal Aid, a body formed in 1995 to champion human
rights in Africa, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the group of lawyers and human rights
practitioners would be on labor and employment, women's rights
and contemporary forms of slavery and children's rights in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Obed Asamoah, Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, said a
lot remains to be done in curbing human rights violation in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Legislation alone, Asamoah said, may not be enough mechanism to
stop human rights violation on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"We need to step up our social education to bring people in
tune (to) their guaranteed rights which will also promote social
stability and development."
</P>
<P>
He said the time has come for African lawmakers to pass into
law conventions and other decisions on human rights reached in
international forums.
</P>
<P>
Asamoah said Ghana has made some progress in promoting human
rights through abolishing slavery such as "trokosi" and making
female circumcision a criminal act and will continue to enforce
human rights laws guaranteed by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to him, economic, social and cultural rights and
civil and political rights are universal, indivisible,
interdependent and interrelated.

<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing students at the Rand Afrikaans University in
Johannesburg, Mbeki said people in the country need not worry
about an outbreak of violence in the run-up to the June 2 election
because the police and the army are working hard to identify
possible flash points.
</P>
<P>
He said some parts of the Transkei region (former black
homeland), Western Cape Province, KwaZulu Natal Province and
Gauteng Province had already been identified as potential trouble
spots.
</P>
<P>
"Our law enforcement agencies and the Independent Electoral
Commission are working on the matter. They will continue to do so
and we don't expect to return to the crime levels (that existed)
prior to the 1994 elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, chairman of the ruling African National Congress, is
expected to become the country's next president.
</P>
<P>
Referring to challenges facing his presidency in the next five
years, Mbeki said the most important was fostering cooperation
among all South Africans in addressing national issues such as
crime, poverty and joblessness.
</P>
<P>
"These issues are not partisan. They are of national character
and they therefore need the effort of everyone," he said, adding
that just as South africans rallied together to defeat apartheid,
it was the time that they again joined hands in addressing
national problems.

NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ghana and Burkina Faso Thursday
began a meeting at Bolgatanga, a Ghanaian border Town, to resolve
 current cross-border travelling violations of immigration and
customs procedures and cattle rustling.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will promote closer cooperation between the
administrative authorities of the two regions and the heads of
their respective security agencies and review past agreements on
common security issues, according to the Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Amidu Sulemana, Upper East Regional Minister, called
for regular consultations to boost inter-regional trade and
cooperation within the frame work of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) protocol on trade and the free
movement of people and goods within the sub- region.
</P>
<P>
He said the government and the chiefs and people of the region
would do everything possible to maintain the historical links
between the two countries in the socio-cultural, economic and
political fields.
</P>
<P>
Sulemana called for cooperation to address common problems of
poverty, environmental degradation, health, smuggling, cattle
rustling, game and wildlife protection and the influx of alien
herdsmen, which, he said, "if not tackled properly, could lead to
conflicts of interest".
</P>
<P>
Jean Christophe Compoare, Commissioner of Nahouri Province of
Burkina Faso and leader of the Burkina Faso delegation, emphasized
the importance "my government attaches to issues on cross-border
smuggling, evasion of customs duties, cattle rustling and
unauthorized poaching in its game reserves".
</P>
<P>
He said the unauthorized poaching is denying Burkina Faso, a
landlocked country, of much-needed revenue, saying this has "the
potential of straining relations between the two neighboring
states."
</P>
<P>
He urged the two governments and their regional authorities to
make firm commitments toward implementing agreements to be
reached at the meeting for their mutual benefits.

LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices posted new gains again
Thursday despite discouraging inventory data.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark UK Brent blend for June loading closed 36 cents
firmer at 15.16 dollars a barrel in London, but below the day's
high of 15.27 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the resilience around the 15 dollar mark for Brent

forecasting a correction back towards 14 dollars a barrel after
recent strong gains.

"We're holding up well despite this week's disappointing

Weekly U.S. inventory data and monthly European statistics

crude and product stocks.

<HEADLINE> Coffin Unearthed in Heart of London Reveals Roman Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A complete skeleton found in a
lavish stone coffin unearthed in the heart of London could be that
of the most important Roman person ever found in Britain,
archaeologists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The stone sarcophagus, with a sealed lead coffin inside, was
buried in the early fourth century. It was uncovered a few weeks
ago in a Roman cemetery at Spitalfields Market near the City of
London.
</P>
<P>
After lifting the lid on Wednesday evening, archaeological
teams of the London Museum discovered inside the skeleton of a
young women.
</P>
<P>
Scientists were excited by the elaborate nature of the coffin
and items left in the grave, Simon Thurley, director of the London
Museum, told BBC radio on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This coffin without doubt belongs to someone very important,"
he said. "We know a huge amount about Roman London, but very
little about the very, very important people who governed it."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the bones themselves will, after analysis,
reveal the diet and health of rich Roman Londoners.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists were most excited by the inch of mud in the
bottom of the coffin, suggesting it may have been waterlogged.
</P>
<P>
They hoped that DNA tests will establish exactly where the
woman, thought to be in her early 20s, came from.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Blasts the Vatican on Bishop's Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has been
outraged by the Vatican's reaction about the arrest and preventive
detention of the Bishop of Gikongoro, Augustin Misago for alleged
involvement of genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Vatican had expressed shock at the arrest of the cleric
saying that it is a serious blow to the Rwandan Roman Catholic
Church and the Catholic Church as a whole.
</P>
<P>
But the Rwandan government spokesman, Major Wilson Rutayisire
said, "the state prosecutor arrested Misago because of his
personal involvement in the crimes he committed. We do not
believe he acted on behalf of the Catholic Church whether in
Rwanda or anywhere else,'' the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported
late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added if the Catholic Church believes Bishop
Misago was acting on its behalf, then the Vatican should answer
for his charges of genocide in the court of law.
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the Vatican came as a surprise to many Rwandans
who still recall the Pope's letter to the Rwandan Catholic Church
calling for individual clerics suspected of the crimes of genocide
to respond to the charges against them.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Bishop Misago has filed a request to
the Kigali prosecutor requesting a temporary release for alleged
heart problems.
</P>
<P>
This request for special treatment for the genocide suspect has
angered the community of genocide survivors who claim that Misago
is not different from any other genocide suspects crammed in
Rwandan jails.

<P>
BONN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The German automobile giant
Daimler-Chrysler Thursday rejected the allegation of anti-trust
violations by the European Union (EU), planning to defend itself
at the European Court of Justice if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission Wednesday issued a statement alleging the
company, the producer of luxury car Mercedes, was prohibiting its
dealers in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain from
selling cars to EU citizens who come from another country than
where the dealers are located.
</P>
<P>
By involving the practice of so-called reimport, the company
has violated EU anti-trust laws, the EU Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Chrysler denied the charge, saying, "We have never
pursued a strategy of segregation of national markets and have
always conducted our business to the complete satisfaction of
millions of our customers."
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement there was no substantial
evidence to back claims of unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
The EU charges are basically directed against an alleged
practice of preventing cross border sales to retail customers, a
business that Daimler-Chrysler had not involved, the company said.

WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) --Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told Congress Thursday that the United States has failed
to find a co-sponsor for a resolution critical of China at this
year's meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
"This is an uphill battle," she said at a House of
Representatives subcommittee during a hearing on the U.S. budget
for foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese have been lobbying the Europeans... No other
country has agreed to co-sponsor a resolution, which is depressing
to say the least," Albright added.
</P>
<P>
The United States decided to submit a resolution at this year's
meeting in Geneva, after a gap last year. But members of the
European Union have not been supportive.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the United States would not give up. "All our
ambassadors are making demarches. We are pulling out all the
stops... We are pursuing it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said even if the United States does find a co-sponsor,
an anti-China resolution has little chance of passing. All
previous such resolutions have failed to pass the commission.

<HEADLINE> Forex Demands Double at Weekly Auction in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Demands for foreign exchange
doubled at the Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market (AFEM) Wednesday
from last week's 88 million U.S. dollars to 171 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said that the official figures at the weekly
auction could herald a fresh devaluation of the local currency of
naira.
</P>
<P>
Naira has witnessed a major plunge in exchange rate before the
end of March when the Central Bank of Nigeria devalued the naira
by 4.34 percent from 86.25 to 90 naira to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The doubled demands for foreign exchange are a further
indicator of the economic difficulties facing the most populous
African country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, it was disclosed that the Nigerian
government had recorded 422 million dollars budget deficit for the
first quarter of this year and had already surpassed the overall
budget deficit for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserves which stood at 7.1 billion dollars at the
end of December 1998 has gone down to 4.2 billion dollars which
can barely finance one month imports as against three months which
Nigeria had maintained since 1997.
</P>
<P>
One economist was quoted as saying the deficit of the first
quarter is a very bad omen since the position may worsen
dramatically as the in-coming civilian government is likely to
spend more money than it can make.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers predicted that Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar's administration had been reluctant to
devalue the currency again before the military government goes.
</P>
<P>
Loss of confidence in the naira is linked to low world oil
prices in the first three months of 1999 and an increase in
government spending.
</P>
<P>
Analysts fear that the drop in the naira's value and consequent
rise in the price of imports will further stoke a trend which has
lifted inflation above 14 percent in January from nine percent the
year before.

MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Duma (lower house of the
parliament) Friday urged the parliaments of the European countries
to press NATO to stop bombing Yugoslavia in a bid to avoid an
ecological calamity throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
A Duma resolution passed by a vote of 317 to 1 noted that
NATO's missile and bomb attacks against Yugoslavia will result in
a serious ecological disaster in the whole European continent
because the chemical pollution caused by the alliance's bombing of
Yugoslav oil refineries and chemical plants is destructive.
</P>

It warned that the Danube River has already been polluted by
oil spills, which is floating to a Bulgarian nuclear power plant
and will lead to nuclear radiation pollution in the regional

SINGAPORE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN environment ministers
agreed at a meeting on haze Friday in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei,
agreed to strengthen the enforcement of zero-burning policy and
take immediate actions to stop the newly-found fire in Central
Sumatra, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Singapore Ministry of the Environment
said satellite imagery has detected a few hot spots since April 12
in the central part of Sumatra and moving-in smoke has resulted in
a rapid rise in Pollutant Standard Index over Peninsular Malaysia
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to take immediate actions to address the
hot spots to prevent them from spreading.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to focus their efforts on promoting
the zero-burning policy among plantation owners and timber
concessionaires, particularly in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Singapore which were most affected by fires and haze in 1997 and
1998, it added.
</P>
<P>
As the dry season is drawing near in parts of the region, the
ministers reiterated the importance to remain vigilant and to take
immediate and firm actions in accelerating the implementation and
operation of the Regional Haze Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to intensify their efforts in addressing the
incidents of land and forest fires which may occur during the
coming drier months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Euro-Med Meeting Passes Crisis Management Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from 15 European
Union (EU) members and 12 Mediterranean states on Friday approved
guidelines for a crisis management and preventive diplomacy
charter in the city of Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
The main instrument of the charter, loosely modeled on the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), will
enhance dialogue through regular meetings at the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
The primary function of the charter is "to prevent tensions and
crises and to maintain peace and stability in the region," the
guidelines said.
</P>
<P>
The "Euro-Med Charter for Peace and Stability" will not
actually be founded until 2001 at the earliest, officials said.
</P>
<P>
In order to win support for the charter from both Israel and
Arab states, the role of the future body has been strictly limited.
</P>
<P>
The charter will only be politically, not legally, binding. Any
joint actions, measures and mechanisms will have to be approved by
all members under the rule of consensus.
</P>
<P>
At its regular meetings, the charter will seek to boost
political cooperation and establish cross-border projects. In the
later stages, it will try to launch confidence and security
building measures such as disarmament and arms control commitments,
the guidelines said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day Euro-Mediterranean conference, the ministers
were expected to reaffirm the aim of creating a free trade zone
between the EU and the Mediterranean by 2010. This would only
include manufactured goods and not agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The EU aid to the Mediterranean states was a further major
issue at the talks.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Fu Suffers First Loss (Corrected) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Fu Mingxia
suffered first loss after coming back from a two-year retirement
as she finished third in the three-meter springboard event at the
National Champions' diving tournament here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who won one Olympic gold at Barcelona in 1992 and two golds
at Atlanta in 1996, collected a total of 556.41 points to place
third in the finals.
</P>
<P>
"You go interview the champion," the 21-year-old cried before
the reporters after the competition.
</P>
<P>
The top place went to the 15-year-old Liang Xiaoqiao, who was
the 3-meter springboard champion in the World Cup diving
tournament in Wellington, New Zealand, early this year.
</P>
<P>
Fu's long-time coach Yu Fen was satisfied with Fu's performance
but angry with the judges. "Fu Mingxia was always treated unfairly
in domestic competitions."
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jihong, leader of Chinese national diving team, said: "The
top three finishers all displayed world-level performance. It's
not easy for Fu to achieve this result since she resumed training
only eight months ago."
</P>
<P>
Fu led the qualifying competition of the National Champion's
Tournament in Guangxi last month and had looked sure to dominate
the women's diving of China.
</P>
<P>
"The loss will help her study more as to her technique and way
of training," Zhou said. "The loss may be more helpful than a
victory."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Construction Falls Again in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing construction
dropped 1.3 percent in March, a second monthly decline after
hitting a 12-year high in January, the Commerce Department
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that builders of new homes and apartments
started work on 1.77 million units in March, at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate, compared to a revised 1.79 million
construction rate in February.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction reached a high of 1.82 million units in
January, the best monthly showing since December 1986, as builders
continued to benefit from the robust economy, which has given the
country the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years and no signs of
an up-tick in inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe housing activity will not be as strong this
year, viewing that mortgage rates are headed higher.
</P>
<P>
However, with strong personal income growth and high consumer
confidence rates, analysts are looking for only a modest slowdown
from last year.
</P>
<P>
Building permits, a good sign of future activity, dropped a
sizable 6 percent in March, the biggest decline in four years,
since an 8.2 percent fall in January 1995. Permit applications had
been down 2.1 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The fall in construction starts reflected a small 0.1 percent
dip in single-family homes, which dropped to an annual rate of 1.4
million units. Apartment construction was down 5.9 percent to an
annual rate of 365,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile. mortgage rates had hit a 10-month high of 7.11
percent in mid-March. This week Freddie Mac, the mortgage company,
reported the nationwide average for 30-year mortgages dipped to
6.87 percent, the lowest level since mid-February.

UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) welcomed a vote of 23-17 by the U.S. House
of Representatives International Relations Committee to restore
American funding of the U.N. agency, which was stopped in
September 1998, U.N. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA Executive Director NAfis Sadik welcomed the renewed
commitment by Members of Congress to restore funding, saying "the
United States has always been a leader in the population field and
played an important role in global family planning efforts."
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which
was passed Wednesday, received bipartisan support by members of
Congress who argued that the U.S. should support UNFPA, which
plays a critical role in protecting women's health and curbing
population growth. The full House of Representatives is expected
to vote on the amendment next week.
</P>
<P>
As passed, the amendment would authorize a contribution of 25
million U.S. dollars to UNFPA in fiscal year 2000 and 25 million
U.S. dollars in 2001 under a strict set of conditions.

<HEADLINE> 20 Kurdish Rebels Killed in Eastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 members of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' party (PKK) were Killed on Friday in an armed clash
with the Turkish security forces in eastern Turkey, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The clash occured when a group of PKK militants opened fire at
military vehicles carrying government troops for military operations in
the Cicekli region in Tunceli province Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Six soldiers of the security forces were also killed in the clash,
said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 15-year-old war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over 37,000
lives since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured by the Turkish
authorities and jailed on the Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near the
western province of Bursa for trial on charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
A series of bombing attacks have been launched by Kurdish rebels in

<HEADLINE> Visitor Arrivals to HK Continue to Increase in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) - The total number of visitors to
Hong Kong amounted to 861,347 in March this year, representing a
12.4 percent increase from the corresponding month last year.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Tourists Association (HKTA) has registered the
steady growth in the number of visitors to Hong Kong for the ninth
consecutive month with longhaul markets joining the strong
recovery recorded from Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The statistics newly released here Friday show that cumulative
arrivals for the January-March period rose by 13.4 percent over
the first quarter of 1998 to a total of 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Notable year-on-year increases in March among the longhaul
markets included a 16.5 percent boost in arrivals from the United
States and 15.4 percent from Canada.
</P>
<P>
Healthy economies and special packages offered by the trade
were contributory factors, the association said.
</P>
<P>
Most European markets also recorded increases, notably the
Netherlands and France, up 18.2 percent and 13.9 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
It said that keen competition from destinations in the region
was the main reason for the decline in arrivals recorded by New
Zealand, Britain and Germany, down 37.9 percent, 6.5 percent and 3.
4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Strong growth was also seen from the shorthaul markets. Japan
continued its recovery with a 28.1 percent increase of visitors
than in March 1998. This came against the background of an
improving economy and stable currency.
</P>
<P>
The association said that countries most affected by the
economic turmoil last year are also showing strong revivals.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from Indonesia surged by 113.5 percent in March, those
from Thailand rose by 93 percent, from the Republic of Korea by 53.
4 percent, from the Philippines by 37.8 percent and from Malaysia
by 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's two biggest source markets, the Chinese mainland
and Taiwan, both recorded a growth of 7.5 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The association said the average hotel room occupancy rate in
March this year was 81 percent, up from 73 percent in March last
year. The rate for the first quarter was 78 percent, compared with
70 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Amy Chan, executive director of the HKTA, said: "the continued
recovery in visitor arrivals and hotel occupancy is most
encouraging, and is a reflection of the tremendous efforts all
sectors of the tourism industry have been making to keep Hong Kong
competitive."

<HEADLINE> Interview: NATO Bombing Only Gets Yugoslavians United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO's air attacks against
Yugoslavia has only served to get the Yugoslav people closer and
more united and people have been living normally despite the NATO
bombing, a Yugoslav diving teacher visiting in restful Singapore
said.
</P>
<P>
"People just behave normally," said Ostojic Bozana Wednesday in
an interview with Xinhua. "They simply stay in their houses,
watching TV and even shopping out. But mothers and children stay
in the basement."
</P>
<P>
Bozana, a resident owning a diving school in Belgrade, capital
of Yugoslavia, is now in Singapore attending a five-day
international diving event.
</P>
<P>
"If you did not hear the bombs at nights, during daytime you
would think everything was normal, people still working, market
prices the same, no panic, no war profiteers and even no criminals
in the streets," said Bozana.
</P>
<P>
Despite NATO planes roaring over their heads, 23,000 people,
among them singers and dancers, gathered in organized concerts in
central Belgrade, singing and dancing, said Bozana.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that the bombing has put us together," said Bozana.
</P>
<P>
She said the Serb people are "people of strength."
</P>
<P>
NATO began its air raid on Yugoslavia in late March under the
pretext of protecting Kosovo ethnic Albanians from Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
NATO had expected a big split among the Yugoslav people after
the first bombing. "But they made a big mistake, because what
happened was actually the opposite," said Bozana.
</P>
<P>
The bombing only put the Yugoslav people together and united
them, just as CNN had reported, said Bozana, adding that all
Yugoslav people are ready to die for freedom and not scared of
death.
</P>
<P>
""It is the first time that NATO bombs a totally independent
country. They do not have the right to interfere in our internal
problems," said Bozana.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who talked with
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, cried in front of the TV
and pleaded that NATO stop bombing because both Serbs and also
Albanians got killed, she said.
</P>
<P>
NATO admitted on Thursday that it had mistakenly bombed a
civilian vehicle and Yugoslavia said 64 refugees were killed in
the incident. Yugoslavia said about 1,000 civilians had been
killed since NATO's air attack began last month.
</P>
<P>
Bozana said NATO should be blamed for the refugee problem,
"before the bombing, there was no refugee at all and it only
started after the bombing started."
</P>
<P>
Bozana said she would return to Yugoslavia after finishing her
job here, though some friends had advised her to stay in
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Tajikistan Sign Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his Tajik counterpart Imomali Rakhmonov signed a cooperation
agreement geared toward the 21st century here Friday, calling for
stronger military ties and deepening economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A declaration released on the occasion said that at the turn of
the century, both countries are determined to continue to value
and further consolidate bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
The two sides promised to build bilateral ties in the spirit of
mutual trust and on the basis of respect for independence,
sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-interference in each
other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said Tajikistan has scored great achievements
in national reconciliation since the two warring sides in the
country signed a general peace and national reconciliation treaty
in Moscow on June 27, 1997. It said that Russia will continue to
provide necessary support for the Tajik peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin spoke highly of the agreement after the signing
ceremony. He said that the cooperation agreement was not a common
plan or intention but an action guide. He said the smooth
implementation of the document would bring the Russian-Tajik
relations to a brand new level.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov, who arrived Thursday on a three-day visit, said the
new treaty, together with a series of other bilateral documents,
will provide a solid legal basis for bilateral ties and uplift
their relationship to that of a strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
"Russia was and is the guarantor of maintaining peace and
stability not only in our region but also in the whole world,"
Rakhmonov said at a briefing with Yeltsin in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tajikistan is prepared to expand military
cooperation with Russia and build the military of its own with
Russia's assistance. He said the Russian-Tajik military
cooperation was not aimed against the "interests or security of
any third nation."
</P>
<P>
The Tajik president also said he and Yeltsin tentatively agreed
Friday to allow Russia to establish a military base in the Central
Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Russia already has about 25,000 Russian troops stationed in the
Tajikistan. The new agreement would allow Moscow to keep forces at
a base that would be outside of the Tajik government's control.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops are currently deployed as part of a force
from various former Soviet states to police the 1997 peace
agreement that ended a civil war between the Tajik government and
the mostly Islamic opposition.

<P>
JI'NAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Fu Mingxia
suffered first loss after coming back from a two-year retirement
as she finished third in the three-meter springboard event at the
National Champion's Tournament here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who won one Olympic gold at Barcelona in 1992 and two
golds at Atlanta in 1996, collected a total of 556.41 points to
place third in the finals.
</P>
<P>
"You go interview the champion," the 21-year-old cried before
the reporters after the competition.
</P>
<P>
The top place went to the 15-year-old Liang Xiaoqiao, who was
the 3-meter springboard champion in the World Cup diving
tournament in Wellington, New Zealand, early this year.
</P>
<P>
Fu's long-time coach Yu Fen was satisfied with Fu's performance
but angry with the judges. "Fu Mingxia was always treated unfairly
in domestic competitions."

Zhou Jihong, leader of Chinese national diving team, said: "The
top three finishers all displayed world-level performance. It's
not easy for Fu to achieve this result since she resumed training
only eight months ago."
</P>
<P>
Fu led the qualifying competition of the National Champion's
Tournament in Guangxi last month and looked sure to dominate the
women's diving of China.
</P>
<P>
"The loss will help her study more as to her technique and way
of training," Zhou said. "The loss may be more helpful than a loss.

KIEV, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has told Yugoslavia that it
is willing to take care of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova and the three U.S. servicemen captured by Yugoslavia in an
effort to create an "atmosphere of trust" so that the Kosovo
conflict could be settled soon.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the Ukrainian side plans to send a plane to
Belgrade to take Rugova and the three U.S. servicemen to Kiev,
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk told a news conference
Friday.

He said the move would help determine whether some western
reports about Rugova were true or not. The reports said that
Rugova had been forced to stay in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said that Ukraine is willing to have
the three U.S. captives stay in Kiev until a peaceful solution to
the Yugoslav conflict is reached, if the Yugoslav side accepts the

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire In Sichuan Province Brought Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A major forest fire in southwest
China's Sichuan Province that broke out on April 13 was brought
under control this afternoon thanks to the efforts of more than 1,
000 firefighters, Provincial Agriculture Department officials
report.
</P>
<P>
The firefighters are still fighting the blaze but it is no
longer the threat that it was to the vast forests in the Muli
Tibetan Autonomous County, about 500 kilometers southwest of
Chengdu, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The fire is the third in the area this year and spread over
nearly 100 hectares of forests that are 3,300 meters above sea
level. It was first spotted by a local aircraft on April 13, and
local officials and firefighters rushed to the scene, but poor
transport conditions made logistics and supplies extremely
difficult and the dry weather and very low humidity made things
even worse, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has asked local officials to keep up
the fight and to prevent casualties. Meanwhile, they are preparing
to use anti-aircraft guns and rockets to try to increase the
possibility of rain when weather conditions permit.

<HEADLINE> Asian Gifts Fair Attracts Record Number of Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Signs of an improving market
situation were apparent as a record 46,000 visitors flocked to the
largest giftware trade fair in Asia, Jeffrey Lam, chairman of the
Organizing Committee of the Hong Kong Gifts and Houseware Fair' 99,
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors to the two-in-one event -- the Hong Kong
Gifts and Houseware Fair' 99 and the Hong Kong Premium Show '99,
increased by 18.3 percent over last year, according to Germany-
based independent audit specialists, the Voluntary Control of Fair
and Exhibition Statistics (FKM).
</P>
<P>
Of all visitors, more than 25,000 came from areas outside Hong
Kong. Among them, traders from the United States topped the list (
up 31 percent on 1998), followed by visitors from Taiwan (up 11
percent), China's mainland (up 71 percent), Japan (up 14 percent),
Australia (up 22 percent), Germany (up 21 percent) and Britain (up
28 percent).
</P>
<P>
A significant increase in the number of visitors from Asia was
recorded, including Korea (up 93 percent), Malaysia (up 42 percent)
, the Philippines (up 19 percent) and Singapore (up 12 percent).
</P>
<P>
Other growth countries/regions were France (up 10 percent),
Italy (up 22 percent), the Netherlands (up 25 percent), Spain (up
16 percent), Israel (up 41 percent) and Saudi Arabia (up 26
percent).
</P>
<P>
The growth in both numbers of attendance and exhibitors were
indications that the market situation was improving, said Lam.
</P>
<P>
This year 40 percent more exhibitors, totaling 3,376 companies,
came to Hong Kong to showcase their giftware despite the economic
slowdown. The fair is the largest in Asia and ranks third in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Peter Joseph, leader of the Sydney Olympics buying group, said
during the fair that his buying mission was finding more products
and good ideas to help meet the soaring demand for Olympics
branded products.
</P>
<P>
"We have found plenty and we know that this is the place to buy
in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Johnny Thai, manager of International Manufacturing Licensee
Incorporated from the Philippines, said it has always been a
highly satisfactory experience to come to the fair every year to
look for business partners to manufacture licensed gift items.
</P>
<P>
It is also where he can keep track of the trends in the Hong
Kong and U.S. markets, he added.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Museum of Chinese History
plans to spend more than a million yuan (120,000 U.S. dollars) on
its latest renovation project for newer personal computers and
servers, other electronics, and a new exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yanping, a senior museum official, said today that museum
staff will also install a system to help visitors, which will
explain most of the museum's exhibits.
</P>
<P>
The museum in downtown Beijing is China's largest history
museum, with the largest collections of historical relics, more
than 300,000 items, but a survey has shown that 35 percent of the
visitors say they wouldn't visit it without a guide.
</P>
<P>
"We must upgrade our hardware as well as our service," says Qi
Jixiang, a research fellow at the museum. So the proposed
exhibition hall will hold some of the country's finest and rarest
cultural relics and many valuable works.
</P>
<P>
The museum has started looking for a suitable logo to make
cultural exchanges with other countries better and its
publications more distinctive and is asking for suggestions.

<HEADLINE> U.S., SADC Agree to Disclose UNITA's Arms Provider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) have agreed to provide all
the information they have in hand on illegal arms supply to the
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
movement to the United Nations Sanction Committee.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a meeting held Wednesday and
Thursday in Gaborone, capital of Botswana, at which SADC members
discussed the situation in Africa with U.S. experts, the official
Angola News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution in September,
1993, imposing arms and oil embargo to Angola's opposition UNITA.
</P>
<P>
However, since the civil war renewed in the southern African
country in mid-November of last year, UNITA forces have
demonstrated strong fighting power, and have been facilitated with
many advanced weaponry such as T-62 and T-55 tanks, ground-to-air
missiles and middle and long range cannons.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government therefore accused some African countries
of illegally providing weapons to the UNITA forces led by its
Chairman Jonas Savimbi, and named Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia and
Burkina Faso in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, a SADC member, firmly denied the accusation, and in the
mean time requested evidence for the charge. Relations between
the two countries hence suffered much tension.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council held a meeting Wednesday on Angola,
expressing "great concern" to the worsening war situation in the
country. As revealed by its spokesman Fred Eckhard, the United
Nations might enhance its sanctions against the UNITA.

WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The NATO alliance and the Pentagon acknowledged Thursday
that allied warplanes mistakenly attacked refugee convoys in
Kosovo, but President Clinton redoubled his defense of the allied
air campaign, saying Americans must stomach civilian tragedies and
possibly months of warfare if they are to play their rightful role
in restoring stability to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
-- Elated astronomers Thursday announced the discovery of the
first multi-planet system ever found around a normal star other
than our own, moving civilization a step closer to its ancient
quest for kindred havens where life might have arisen.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Pentagon plans to ask President Clinton for the
authority to call up about 30,000 reservists and National Guard
members to bolster the NATO attack against Yugoslavia, senior
Government officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- Pakistan, for the second time in two days, tested a missile
that is able to carry a nuclear warhead. The tests were in
response to an Indian missile trial, and Pakistan renewed its call
to India to agree to restrain their arms race.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Boeing reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings,
reflecting a run of jet deliveries and efforts to improve
operating margins.
</P>
<P>
-- The World Bank plans to provide guarantees to help poor
nations sell bonds to international investors, a bid to bring
private capital back to emerging markets. The program, limited to
2 billion U.S. dollars, is expected to be approved Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Swimming Champions' Meet Opens, Major News Out of Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, northeast China, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 Chinese
national swimming champions' meet opened in an Olympic-size indoor
pool here on Friday, but major news seemed to come from outside
the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the four-day event are 344 swimmers in 31
teams representing Chinese provinces, municipalities, autonomous
regions, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), PLA's navy and the
Beijing Sports University.
</P>
<P>
Scores of journalists from across the country gathered here had
been giving the event a wide coverage in the past two days, even
before the swimmers took the water in the heats Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
But more fascinating news were but out of conference rooms,
with media attention focused on the two meetings before the meet
opened in this city famous for its oil fields and petroleum
industry.
</P>
<P>
Attended by sports officials and coaches, the meetings
concentrated on issues on fight against drugs in sports and a
general scheme named Project Olympic Games 2000, which profiles
China's preparations for next year's Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Swimming Association (CSA) declared its
determination to further tighten the control on performance-
improving drugs, offering all-round cooperation with swimming's
world governing body International Amateur Swimming Federation (
FINA) in a concerted battle against doping in the sport.
</P>
<P>
CSA officials had played down high expectation on the general
performance here as Chinese swimmers failed to have systematic
training sessions during the winter season.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly due to their tightly-scheduled participation in
the Asian Games last December in Bangkok, the World Cup short-
course swimming series and the short-course world swimming
championships earlier this month in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Manila Cuts Interest Rates for 10th Time in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines Friday cut its key overnight borrowing and lending
rates for the 10th time this year.
</P>
<P>
The overnight key rates were cut by 50 basis points and the
reduction brings the overnight borrowing rate to 10.875 percent
from 11.375 percent and the overnight lending rate to 12.875
percent from 13.375 percent, said Gabriel Singson, governor of the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Before he left for Osaka, Japan, Singson told reporters that
the bank decided to approve the cut as there is still room to
align the rates with the treasury bill rates.
</P>
<P>
The 91-day treasury bill rate, used by commercial banks to
price their loans, dropped to 10.972 percent during last Monday's
auction, from an earlier rate of 11.487 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's new rates will be effective on Monday,
Singson said.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange situation is relatively calm
after the bank's rate-cut announcement.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has continued to lower its key interest rates
since the beginning of this year to encourage the commercial banks
to lend more and get the economy moving.

<HEADLINE> Australia Continues to Seek Close Ties With Asia: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Friday that Australia would continue to seek
closer engagement with Asia because of the profound benefit which
flows from its friendship with Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Foreign Correspondents' Association in
Sydney, Downer said Australia has substantial and abiding
interests at stake in Asia and Australia has proven to be an
all-weather friend to its Asian neighbors during the past 18
months when Asia has been suffering from the current economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Take a glance at any map - it doesn't take an expert in
strategic policy to understand that what happens in our own
neighborhood will affect us more deeply and more quickly than
events that occur in most other areas of the world."
</P>
<P>
"Australia also has substantial trade and economic interests at
stake in the region. Even after the onset of the Asian economic
crisis, East Asia takes more than 50 percent of all our exports,
and even more would be transported through the region to markets
elsewhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
"If it is true that Australians have...enjoyed a high degree of
stability and prosperity in recent decades, much credit must go to
the fact that the region that surrounds us has also been quite
prosperous and stable."
</P>
<P>
"It is very much in our own interests, therefore, for us to
help keep the region on an even keel," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The region contributes to our own prosperity and security and,
just as importantly, we contribute to the prosperity and the
security of Asia."
</P>
<P>
He went on to list the steps taken by Australia to cement its
ties with Asian countries, during the past several years,
particularly its recent financial assistance to Indonesia,
Thailand and South Korea hard hit by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Australia made several billion U.S. dollars available through
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the three countries, and
persuaded the IMF to ameliorate the conditions of its package for
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The onset of the Asian economic crisis...allowed us to
prove... that the ties we had built (with Asia) were deep and
lasting."
</P>
<P>
"Australia has long counted itself lucky to be located in the
dynamic Asia, a region, despite its current setbacks, will one day
recover, and go on to even greater things."

<HEADLINE> NATO Continues Bombing Despite Huge Civilian Toll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO continued its bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia overnight Friday despite huge civilian
deaths caused by its raids in the previous days.
</P>
<P>
In the 23rd night of attacks on the Balkan country, NATO planes
and missiles attacked Belgrade, Pancevo, Novi Sad, Smederevo,
Subotica, Paracin and Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, fierce anti-aircraft gunfire could be heard and
seen from 22:45 Thursday and the capital's Rakovica municipality
came under NATO air raids for the second time in two days.
</P>
<P>
Two projectiles were dropped on the Strazevica Hill at around
02:30 Friday, the Tanjug reported, quoting the city emergency
center.
</P>
<P>
Pancevo, a city about 20 kilometers northeast of Belgrade, was
subject to three waves of NATO attacks overnight. The targets hit
included a facility of the local petrochemical complex and a fuel
oil depot in the town fertilizer factory, according to the town
emergency center.
</P>
<P>
Several workers of the petrochemical complex were injured,
Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the relentless bombing campaign, Yugoslavs continued
their defiance by forming "human shields" along bridges around the
country.
</P>
<P>
In Novi Sad, capital of the northern Voivodina province,
thousands of people gathered at the Zezelj bridge, the city's only
remaining road link across the Danube after NATO destroyed the
other two, and staged a mock funeral of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, Belgraders sang and chanted slogans on the
Brankov and Gazela bridges well after the air-raid alarm that
sounded at 20:42 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NATO continued its attacks on bridges. One bridge
linking Smederevo and Kovin near Belgrade was heavily damaged
after being hit by NATO bombs shortly before 23:00 Thursday,
Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Amid heavy anti-aircraft gunfire from the Yugoslav air defense
system, NATO planes bombed Novi Sad's oil refinery in a raid that
last about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
Four projectiles were fired at the refinery facilities and fire
broke out shortly afterwards, Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
In Subotica, a city about 200 kilometers northwest of Belgrade,
the most densely populated quarters in the Mali Radanovac suburb
were hit in NATO air raids, and several people were slightly
injured, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
A refugee settlement in the outskirts of Paracin, about 180
kilometers southwest of Belgrade, was also targeted.
</P>
<P>
At least three bombs or missiles were fired at 02:20 Friday at
the former July 7 youth settlement, where refugees from Croatian
and Bosnia-Herzegovina are housed, Tanjug reported, quoting the
Pomoravlje district civil defense headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the death toll from NATO attacks on a
train on Monday and two refugee convoys on Wednesday rose to 130,
Yugoslav Assistant Foreign Minister Nebojsa Vujovic told a press
conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vujovic said 55 bodies have been found from the site of NATO
bombardment on an international passenger train in Grdelicka
Klisura gorge and that 75 people were killed and 26 gravely
wounded in four waves of NATO air raids on two convoys of refugees
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia will try its best to defend itself from NATO
air strikes, but it will work energetically on the political
process on the Kosovo issue at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Vujovic said the victims of the NATO bombardments were people
of all nationalities and that 1,000 have been killed and 4,000
wounded, in addition to the destruction of civilian facilities
such as apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, and bridges.
</P>
<P>
The total material damage now stood at 100 billion U.S. dollars,
Vujovic said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Manufacturers' Orders-on-hand Continue to Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The value of manufacturers'
orders-on-hand for Hong Kong production decreased by 19 percent in
February 1999 compared to February 1998, according to the results
of a monthly survey released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The results, announced by the Census and Statistics Department,
showed a decline in orders-on-hand across all the major
manufacturing industries surveyed.
</P>
<P>
Comparing February 1999 with February 1998, the value of orders
in the fabricated metal products industry fell sharply by 57
percent.
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, this was due to the relocation of production
lines by some major manufacturers of fabricated metal products
from Hong Kong to China's mainland areas, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The value of orders in the plastic products and electrical
products industries also registered significant decreases of 44
percent and 42 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman expressed concern about the
sustained downtrend in orders-on-hand in recent months.
</P>
<P>
As a leading indicator of the performance of domestic exports,
this decrease in the orders position might point to continued weak
domestic exports in the near term, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Monthly Survey of Orders-on-hand covers a sample of some
300 manufacturing firms each engaging 50 or more workers.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers' orders-on-hand refer to orders and parts of
orders received earlier by manufacturers for local production
which remain unfilled as at the end of the reference month.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Ruling Council of
Nigeria has finally dropped the 1995 draft Constitution in favor
of the 1979 Constitution, a member of the Nigerian highest ruling
body disclosed.
</P>
<P>
After a four-day meeting of the provisional ruling council,
Rear Admiral Taiwo Abiodun Odedina, flag officer commanding the
eastern naval command, said in capital Abuja Friday that the 1979
Constitution was deliberated upon and ratified by the council.
</P>
<P>
"We have deliberated on the 1979 Constitution and the final
copy will be out shortly."
</P>
<P>
He added that the constitution will be released "in a few days'
time."
</P>
<P>
The provisional ruling council's obvious preference for the
1979 Constitution may be informed by the recommendation of the
Niki Tobi Constitutional Debate Coordination Committee which
submitted its report early this year, said Friday's Punch
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The coordination committee had recommended, among others, a
return to the 1979 Constitution and the rejection of the 1995
draft copy along with its radical provision of zoning and
rotational presidency.
civilian president from removing the service chiefs of the
Nigerian army.
</P>
<P>
The Transitional Monitoring Group, a coalition of about 60
civil rights groups in the west African country, alleged Wednesday
that the provisional ruling council might dilute the powers of the
next president.
</P>
<P>
The group said that the amendment of the constitution would
ensure that "the president cannot remove the service chiefs except
with the consent, not only of the National Assembly, but also of
the Army Council which is purely a military body."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Holds Talks With Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
held friendly talks with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai here on
Friday and the two leaders exchanged views on issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Chuan extended warm welcome to Li, who is chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Bangkok from the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai
on Friday morning to continue his official goodwill visit to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Chuan greatly appreciated the constructive role China plays in
regional organizations such as the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) and the significant contribution it makes to
maintaining regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He highly appraised China's reform and opening-up policy and
the achievements it has made in economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has maintained correct economic and
financial policies, accumulated precious experience and enhanced
its economic strength. Therefore, under the attack of the current
economic and financial crisis, China is able to minimize the
impact of it, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government and people are grateful to the generous
assistance China offered to Thailand in both bilateral and
multilateral ways despite its own difficulties at a time when
Thailand suffered most from the crisis, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai people are making efforts to turn the crisis
into an opportunity and change the economic downturn into a
one-percent growth within this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Chuan said, always backs China's entry into the World
Trade Organization and believes that China's membership will
contribute greatly to the improvement of the world's trading
system.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said he felt relieved to know that the Thai economy
will recover this year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that under the circumstance of economic
globalization, developing nations, if they keep eyes only on
opportunities while being unaware of the challenges and risks,
will be affected and suffer great losses.
</P>
<P>
Li said he believes the economic recovery in Thailand is
promising so long as the country draws lessons from the past and
take advantage of its own favorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
Li said China was also under great pressure while Thailand was
affected economically and financially.
</P>
<P>
However he said, China, for the sake of economic and financial
stability in the region as well as the Sino-Thai friendly
relations, refrained from devaluating its currency while trying to
do what it can do to help Thailand. China regards what it has done
to Thailand as a gesture of friendship towards the Thai people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li said China has always pursued a policy of establishing
friendly relations with its neighbors and attached great
importance to the friendly cooperation with ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) countries.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope of pushing forward such relations to a
new level.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher on Gold, Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar powered
ahead Friday to close at a two-month high after receiving
encouragement from Thursday night gains in gold and a leading
commodity index.
</P>
<P>
BNP senior strategist, group treasury, Clifford Bennett said
most of the action in the Australia dollar came in the offshore
session, with possibly one large buyer causing the skip.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, traders attributed the buying to an International
Monetary Market player in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed in Sydney at 64.28 U.S. cents from
Thursday's close of 63.48 U.S. cents after spending the day
between 64.38 and 64.21 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Also in New York Thursday night, gold staged a recovery with
COMEX gold for current delivery stepping up 2.10 U.S. dollars to
close at 283.70 U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
And the Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB) rose 1.10 points
to close at 188.99.
</P>
<P>
The CRB is an index of 17 U.S. futures markets and although not
weighted to Australia's exports, traders follow it as an indicator
for the commodity price-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney the Australian dollar was buying 0.6031
euro from 0.5876 at Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also closed at 76.12 Japanese yen from
75.47 yen.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Calls For Better Access to Intellectual Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the world
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Kamil Idris has called
for a better international intellectual property system to promote
economic development and spur social and cultural well-being.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 21st century, the fundamental question is how
policy-makers, thinkers, individuals and international
organizations can help release the creative and inventive
potential and channel that energy into tangible, sustainable
development, Idris told the inaugural meeting of the Policy
Advisory Commission (PAC) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The WIPO chief said that it is one of the critical question
faced by the international community to assist developing
countries and countries in transition "to unleash the creative and
inventive potential of their peoples by canalizing that potential
into commercially viable applications for the market place".
</P>
<P>
There is an urgency to address these issues in the light of
statistics that show that of the 4.4 billion people in the
developing world, where one in three lacks safe drinking water,
one in four lacks adequate housing, and one in five children do
not reach the fifth grade, Idris underlined.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to enable these countries to use the
intellectual property system to help them produce, trade and
compete, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting chaired by Idris, PAC members offered their
insights on the significance of placing intellectual property in a
wider economic, social, and cultural context.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, Vice-Chairman of the People's Political Consultative
Conference of China, is among the 24 participants who attended the
one-day meeting.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Welcomes Release of Abducted Army Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Friday welcomed the release of two army officers by the
New People's Army (NPA) and assured that the government will
resume peace talks with the rebels once the last hostage is freed.
</P>
<P>
The NPA Friday released Philippine army general Victor Obillo
and his aide Captain Eduardo Montealto who were abducted on
February 17.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in a statement that upon the release of the last
hostage, Sergeant Wivino Demol, the government will be ready to
resume confidence-building measures leading to the resumption of
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The NPA had abducted and held five military and police officers
in hostage. One police inspector and one army officer of the five
were released earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Estrada suspended formal peace talks with the rebels after the
abduction and said the talks will resume only after all the
hostages are released.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Estrada said it is vital that the government
receives a commitment from the rebels that there will be no future
acts of terrorism, including the abduction of non-combatants.
</P>
<P>
Once such a commitment is secured, "we can move forward
speedily to a lasting, enduring and principled peace," he added.

China as a member, considering the role China is now playing in
world trade.
</P>
<P>
As new rounds of talks on China's accession to the WTO are to

<HEADLINE> French Water Supplier Helps China Tackle Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The French General Motors Vivendi
Group, the world's largest water supplier, announced today that it
will enhance cooperation with China to deal with China's worsening
water pollution.
</P>
<P>
De Beauce, president of the group's international section, made
the remark at the two-day Sino-French Economic Symposium held here
yesterday and today.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's economic development has maintained an
annual growth of about 10 percent over the past two decade, but
with the process of urbanization and industrialization, China's
water resources have been severely polluted and the sewage problem
is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China focus on the construction of
infrastructure such as water-treatment and sewage-treatment plants
in every city where the population exceeds 5 million.
</P>
<P>
He added that sewage-treatment techniques should be updated and
rubbish-incineration plants established.
</P>
<P>
He said his group will take concrete measures to cooperate with
China on the effective use of funds and technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
Vivendi plans to set up research centers in the Hong Kong
Science and Technology Institute and at Qinghua University to
conduct research on water and sewage treatment and train
personnel.
</P>
<P>
It also will join hands with the Beijing municipal government
in tackling the capital's water pollution. Specific projects are
on the way, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vivendi has established joint ventures in Tianjin, and carried
out Building-Operation-Transfer (BOT) projects in Chengdu. It also
set up a sewage-incineration plant in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The Vivendi Group's total business worldwide exceeds 35 billion
U.S. dollars annually, with 16 billion U.S. dollars coming from
its worldwide water-treatment operations.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium will close here today.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Torch Race for Mentally Handicapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The China Special Olympics
Committee will stage the '99 Beijing Great Wall Torch Race from
May 21 to 24, to try and encourage all sectors of society to help
the mentally handicapped.
</P>
<P>
The activity, entitled "Love for Living and Life", will also
help and encourage mentally handicapped people to participate in
sports, and persuade them to take part in society generally.
</P>
<P>
China now has over 60 million disabled people, with 10.17
million mentally handicapped. One out of every one hundred newly
born babies is mentally handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Yan Minfu, chairman of the China Charity Federation, said that
the mentally retarded are a group with special difficulties in
adapting to society. They need not only the care of their families,
concern from society, help from the government, but must also make
their own efforts to attend sports activities to improve their
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that organizing and guiding mentally handicapped
people to participate in the Special Olympics Movement has not
only enlarged their sphere of life but has improved their
potential and enabled them to bring their talents into full play.
</P>
<P>
The events include the torch race through the Juyong Pass of
the Great Wall, a fund gathering party and special meetings
between officials from the Special Olympics International and
mentally handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
The China Special Olympics Committee was founded in 1985, and
held two national Olympics games in 1987 and 1991. In the past 15
years, 15 cities and provinces have held 90 sports games for
mentally disabled people.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Special Olympics China has promoted community
sports games for mentally handicapped people. Up to now, over 50,
000 families with mentally disabled members have participated in
these activities.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Launches New Business Charter to Restore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has launched a new business
charter and code of conduct aimed at standardizing commercial and
business practises in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony here Thursday, Chairman of
Kenya's Export Promotion Council, Samuel Muumbi said that the aim
of the charter was to restore Kenya's "lost glory" by applying the
current international standards of conduct.
</P>
<P>
The new business charter and the code of conduct would
establish a clear set of standards for the supply of goods and
performance of services, and bring together the buyer, the seller
and the facilitator, the Daily Nation newspaper Friday quoted
Muumbi as saying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that unless each of the three parties are
committed on their part, business will not be conducted smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that we strictly adhere to a business charter
that incorporates a code of practise for all business and
commercial contracts," said Muumbi.
</P>
<P>
He added that the charter would also raise expectations and
changing attitude on the transparency of contracts and
accountability for the use of resources in both public and private
sectors.
</P>
<P>
For the charter to be effective, Muumbi stressed, it would
have to be adopted and promoted at the highest level in all
sectors and also be strongly supported by the government.
</P>
<P>
The new charter was based on the studies undertaken within the
 framework of the European Union and the trade development program
of the Kenyan Export Promotion Council.

<HEADLINE> China Targeted by Camera, Film Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The world's camera and film
manufacturing giants have made strenuous efforts to try and grab
as big a chunk as possible of the world's biggest potential market
by putting their most advanced products on show at a major
exhibition in China this week.
</P>
<P>
At the '99 China International Photographic and Electrical
Imaging Machinery and Technology Fair, which closed here today,
Japan's Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. put on display three of its
latest digital cameras, and even one not due on the market until
later this month.
</P>
<P>
James Wong, chairman of Microcom International Co., Ltd.,
Olympus's authorized agent in China, said it might take some time
before the digital camera takes off with Chinese families, but
said he is convinced it is bound to win ordinary consumers at some
point.
</P>
<P>
He revealed Olympus's digital camera sector is discussing with
its traditional camera colleagues about jointly exploring the
Chinese market. "Olympus can't miss it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Like Olympus, other leading companies in the industry have
targeted China as the most important market.
</P>
<P>
Ricoh Co., Ltd. also showed their newly developed digital
camera at the exhibition, the largest ever held in China, also
before the product is marketed properly elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Eastman Kodak Co., the biggest exhibitor, put on display its
digital cameras aimed at both photo buffs and amateurs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Administration of Machinery Industry
show that China's annual demand for digital cameras will reach one
million by 2000. But the market is confined to professional
photographers, the media and graphic design businesses.
</P>
<P>
Aside from cameras, Kodak is working to strengthen its No. 1
position in China's film developing market. It expects to bring
all "Kodak Express" printing centers nationwide to its world
standard by improving the quality of resolution control,
operational skills and service, and standardizing interior design.
</P>
<P>
A model "Kodak Express" was set up within its exhibition space.
</P>
<P>
Kodak's long-time competitor in China, Fujifilm, showed its new
range of film, Superia 200, 400 and 800 with which Fujifilm
expects to increase its market share over Kodak.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises are making all efforts to catch up with the
international level. and the Shanghai Seagull Camera Co., Ltd.
exhibited its own digital camera which it jointly developed with
Fudan University and a Taiwanese partner.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Procuratorial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to introduce a
"chief prosecutor responsibility system" to replace the existing
practice whereby decisions are mainly made by a procuratorial
committee composed of officials, top procurator Han Zhubin
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the new procedures, decisions on whether or not to
pursue a case shall be made solely by the independent prosecutor
investigating the case, said Han, procurator-general of the
Supreme People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
He detailed his reform plan at a national conference held here
today which was attended by provincial procurators.
</P>
<P>
"Those 'chief prosecutors,' to be selected through competition,
shall be accountable for all their decisions; while procuratorial
committees will only assume a supervisory role," Han said.
</P>
<P>
The new practices will serve the purpose of judicial
independence and help cultivate a large contingent of high-level
and high-quality prosecution professionals, he said.
</P>
<P>
When too many people are held accountable for a decision, it
often turns out that no one is responsible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Han also set forth five major objectives for the restructuring
of the nation's prosecution system:
</P>
<P>
-- Leadership from above and within the judicial system shall
be further strengthened to ensure orders from procuratorates at a
higher level is enforced;
</P>
<P>
-- The existing redundant system with no clear-cut
responsibility for each decision shall be streamlined to promote
efficiency;
</P>
<P>
-- To combat judicial corruption and ensure that justice is
served, internal and external checks and balances shall be
furnished;
</P>
<P>
-- A new personnel system characterized by opportunity and
competition should be instituted to encourage the growth of talent
and expertise;
</P>
<P>
-- Theoretical studies on prosecution work should be encouraged
to provide guidance to judicial reform.
</P>
<P>
According to Han, some reform measures have been introduced
beginning last year that yielded good results, such as an open-
door policy that allows thorough public supervision over
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting that began today will showcase successful
reform experiments such as the one mentioned above.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda's northeastern Mutara
region is faced with serious water shortage, the official Rwanda
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>

Agriculture as saying that the prefectures of Kibungo and Umutara
were hit most seriously.

prefectures go for water as far as 15 to 30 kilometers away from
their homes.

bore-holes to hasten water restoration in Umutara prefecture.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to such donor agencies as Oxfam U.K. and the
African Development Bank to give the first priority to the
villages which are in dire need of water.

<HEADLINE> French Gaullist Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The chief of France's Gaullist
Rally for the Republic (RPR), Philippe Seguin, announced on Friday
his resignation from the presidency of the party.
</P>
<P>
Seguin will no longer head the list of the RPR for European
Parliament elections to be held on June 13.
</P>
<P>
"My resignation from my functions and the withdrawal of my
candidacy to these elections take effect immediately," he said in
a statement to the AFP.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Seguin was apparently caused by the split of
the RPR, which has presented two separate lists of candidates to
the European elections.
</P>
<P>
Seguin allied with the Liberal Democratic Party of Alain
Madelin, while another heavyweight of the RPR, Eurosceptic Charles
Pasqua, is leading a separate RPR list in the forthcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
When announcing his resignation, Seguin complained that
President Jacques Chirac, who is from the RPR, refused to support
him in his rivalry against Pasqua.

<HEADLINE> Large SOEs Report Profits in First Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's large state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) registered a total net profit of 1.26 billion
yuan in the January-February period this year, the first of its
kind in three years.
</P>
<P>
Profitability of the large SOEs has been increasing in contrast
to net losses recorded in the same periods in previous two years,
Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC), told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The large SOEs witnessed a net loss of 630 million yuan in the
first two months last year.
</P>
<P>
The SETC also reported that in the meantime, net losses of
medium-sized SOEs fell to 2.08 billion yuan from 2.99 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shi attributed the improvement this year to the pro-active
fiscal policy and crackdown on rampant smuggling taken by the
state since last year, as well as the deepening of the enterprise
reform.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in economic returns of the large and medium-sized
SOEs in the past months gives us an encouraging signal for the
rest of this year," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that about one-third of China's SOEs were in the
red last year. Large and medium-sized SOEs account for 21.45
percent of the total SOEs.
</P>
<P>
China's central government has vowed to turn most of the loss-
making large and medium-sized enterprises into profitable ones by
the end of next year, by means of reform, restructuring,
renovation and improving management.
</P>
<P>
Describing this year as having a decisive importance in
achieving the goal, Shi said that a series of measures will be in
place to make one-third of the loss-making large and medium-sized
SOEs profitable this year.
</P>
<P>
Noted economists including Professor Li Yining of the Beijing
University and Professor Yu Zuyao of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences also regarded the favorable trend in the performance of
SOEs as encouraging. Yet they pointed that the improvement is just
in its initial stages and it will be an arduous task for SOEs to
speed up reform and eventually shrug off the shadow of losses.

<HEADLINE> Crocodiles Kills 20 People in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Crocodiles have killed 20 people
in Kibwezi Division in East Kenya, which aroused fears among
local people.
</P>
<P>
A crocodile have taken sanctuary a few meters from local
residents' houses, posing a threat to people in the neighborhood,
the Kenya Times newspaper on Friday quoted Member of Parliament
Onesmus Mboko as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mboko urged the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to response
swiftly and curb the crocodile menace before more lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
The KWS has promised to move the crocodile to a national park.
</P>
<P>
Residents affected have voiced concern at the sluggish manner
in which the KWS responded to distress appeals following the
crocodile invasion.
</P>
<P>
They complained that it took many days before the KWS personnel
came to rescue.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they protested over the delay in remitting of the
compensation fees. Most families said it had taken them over 10
years or so to get the reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, local media reported a Masai woman who was
mauled by a hyena ten years ago was still seeking a compensation
from the KWS.
</P>
<P>
In kenya there are many national parks with various wild
animals, which have attracted many foreigners to visit the
country. The KWS is a governmental agency in charge of national
parks in the Eastern African country.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Issue Press Communique on Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To implement these anti-missile programs will be a violation of
the basic obligation of the ABMT, that is, not to establish a
territory-wide missile defense system and not to make preparation
for the buildup of such defense systems.
</P>
<P>
The two sides consider that the move to damage or violate the
ABMT will bring a series of negative consequences. It could
generate new factors that may result in regional, even global
instability, or provide an excuse to restore the arms race, thus
far setting new barriers for the disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, both China and Russia consider
it is imperative to make the international community fully aware
of the possible consequences of damaging the ABMT.
</P>
<P>
Even though China is not a signatory of the ABMT, China
expresses its support for Russia's efforts to prevent any move to
damage or dodge the pact with consideration that China has
consistent concern about safeguarding strategic stability and
consolidating international security.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side will also fully support China's efforts to
consolidate international and regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Both sides consider that the buildup and deployment of anti-
missile systems in certain countries in the Asia-Pacific region
may escalate the tension in the hot spots in the region, so the
two sides have expressed their worries on the progress of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue to consult and cooperate with each
other on issues to safeguard the ABMT in accordance with the

<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia today issued a
press communique on the consultation of Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty (ABMT) and relevant problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the communique:
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached between Chinese Premier and
Russian Prime Minister on February 25, 1999, Chinese Assistant
Foreign Minister Wang Guangya and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Georgy Mamedov held consultations in Moscow on April 14, 1999 on
issues of strategic stability. Military and diplomatic experts
from the two countries also attended the consultation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held discussions on the situation and issues
related with ABMT. According to the understanding agreed by the
China-Russia summit on November 23, 1998 in the joint statement
entitled China-Russia Relations at the Trans-century Period, both
sides considered that it is important to protect and consolidate
the ABMT signed in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The pact has been and will still be a cornerstone to safeguard
the world's strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
The mutual understanding on the issue forms the basis for the
two sides to discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
Because the United States has declared its intention to prepare
for the deployment of anti-missile systems, there is a serious
threat to damage the ABMT, a situation arousing serious concern
from both China and Russia on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Release Chinese Version Windows 2000 in Early Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. will launch the
Chinese version of its most important new product, Windows 2000,
early next year.
</P>
<P>
The English version is set to come out before the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Windows 2000 is designed for business and large-scale
networking and computing. It has several versions meant to serve
customers ranging from individual users to large businesses. It is
the new name for Windows NT (for new technology) 5.0.
</P>
<P>
The change is a continuation of Microsoft's strategy to
allocate its products a name ending with the approximate year of
introduction rather than a serial number like x.x that might sound
too technical.
</P>
<P>
Many are sceptical of the timely shipping of Microsoft's new
baby. But John Jekins, Microsoft's Worldwide OEM Sales and
Marketing General Manager, said here Thursday that Windows 2000 is
"extremely solid," and Microsoft is shooting to release it on time.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel Re-annexes South Lebanon Village Into Occupied Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 16 (Xihhua) -- Israeli troops Thursday night stormed
into a village in south Lebanon and re-annexed it into the occupied
border zone, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 25 soldiers accompanied by two armored vehicles, a truck, a
jeep and a civilian Mecedes, approached the western edge of Arnoun and
set up a checkpoint at the entrance to the village.
</P>
<P>
The village, on the edge of the border zone, was first occupied by
Israeli soldiers on February 17 and was blockaded with a
three-kilometer barbed-wire.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of unarmed Beirut university students liberated the
village nine days later by tearing down the fence with their bare
hands.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that the village was used by Lebanese guerrillas to
stage bombing attacks on Israeli troops manning the neighboring
Beaufort castle.
</P>
<P>
It was still unclear whether the fresh incursion was a limited
action in retaliation for the roadside bomb attacks on Monday which
killed an Israeli soldier, or a full-fledged bid to re-incorporate the
village into the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement, spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust
Israeli forces and their militia ally South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has charged the Lebanese
delegation at the United Nations headquarters in New York to lobby for
intervention by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China is giving priority to
ensuring the safe operation and construction of its nuclear power
plants as the country's nuclear industry moves into a hectic year.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official in charge of the nuclear

European Union (EU) should see the war in the Balkans as a chance
to build joint security and defense policies.
</P>

The Italian news weekly "Liberal," quoted Dini as saying that
this would not mean breaking the present solidarity with the U.S.
and Canada, but would give a "more solid foundation to the concept
of the West." "The first real war in which the European states are
involved after fifty years requires the EU, as a complement to
NATO, to find its own personality in security and defense," said

NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A Phoenician tomb, believed to be of
a royal family, has been uncovered in Cyprus' southern Larnaca town
and rare archaeological artifacts were revealed, the Cyprus Weekly
newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The built-up tomb, the first of its kind found on the island, was
discovered last December during construction work.

<P>
The tomb, believed to date from 700 BC, was intact and unlooted,
with the remains of three horses and 27 pieces of gold buried with the
tomb owner.
</P>
<P>
That horses were found buried in the tomb indicates the tomb owner
might be of royal estate, said Director of the Antiquities Department
Sophocles Hadijisavvas, adding that the findings were of great
archaeological value.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Vastly improved revenue
helped the government record a much lower deficit figure in
1998-99 than had been estimated, South African Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel was quoted as saying by local media.
</P>
<P>
He said Thursday that the deficit was 3.3 percent of the gross
domestic product, lower than the 3.7 percent estimated when the
government released its 1999-2000 budget on February 17.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the improvement was higher than estimated
revenue collection of 3.4 billion rand (557 million U.S. dollars).
Expenditure was also higher, but with a much less significant
increase of 393 million rand (64 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the higher revenue "is further evidence of the
success of the revenue authorities in strengthening our tax
system".
</P>
<P>
The lower deficit is good news for the country: the lower the
government' s deficit, the less it has to borrow and the more room
for interest rates to come down.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Calls for Release of Mainland Fisherman Detained by Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) today called for the release of
Fang Zhongxiao, a mainland fisherman detained by Taiwan police
under the charge of "illegal border-crossing" on January 6 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS made the call in a letter to Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), explaining that Fang, led by a Taiwan
fisherman to meet a fellow townsman working on another Taiwanese
boat, had received approval from Taiwan police.
</P>
<P>
The letter also calls for apology and compensation for another
18 mainland fishermen who were falsely detained by Taiwan police
on February 25 under the same charge as Fang.
</P>
<P>
The letter says that those fishermen, led by their new Taiwan
employers, were detained by Taiwan police before reaching their
destination. Police interrogated all the fishermen and tortured
some of them. The fishermen were released on March 3 when it was
confirmed that they all had completed procedures.
</P>
<P>
The letter asks the SEF to convey all the information to
concerned departments of the Taiwan authorities, and seeks a
pledge that similar incidents will never happen again.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A major forest fire in southwest
China's Sichuan Province that began on April 13 is continuing to
spread despite the efforts of more than 800 firefighters who have
been battling the blaze for the past four days.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been no reports of casualties and the cause
of the fire is as yet unknown.
</P>
<P>
The fire has already spread over nearly 100 hectares of
woodland in the Muli Tibetan Autonomous County in Liangshan Yi
Autonomous Prefecture, about 500 kilometers southwest of Chengdu,
the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Poor communications is making it difficult to secure an
efficient logistic supply line for the firefighting effort,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Governor Zhang Zhongwei has urged local officials to
increase the number of firefighters and prepare to generate
artificial rainfall with anti-aircraft guns and rockets when

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China voiced its concern today
over the recent hijacking of a civilian airliner by a Colombian

<HEADLINE> Oversupply of Air Conditioners in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- There is now strong competition
for shares of the air conditioner market across China although
there's quite some time to go before mid-summer arrives.
</P>
<P>
Sector insiders attribute the heated competition to an
oversupply of air conditioners on the market, pointing to this
year's estimated air conditioner total output of 15 million units,
while the consumer market needs only some 11.5 million units.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, some air conditioner manufacturers cut
prices several times in an attempt to win a greater market share,
supported by huge amounts of money spent on advertising. As a
result, they devoted less money to after-sale services, causing a
rise in the number of complaints.
</P>
<P>
They are now turning to post-sales services instead. The
manufacturer of Feige brand air conditioners, for example, has
given top priority to after-sales services, offering 1,000 yuan to
any buyer who finds fault with the company's product within three
days after the machine is fixed.
</P>
<P>
Feige has also set up a nationwide post-service network ready
to respond to any maintenance calls. In return, the manufacturer
is now selling 300 units a day in Nanjing, capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Other manufacturers are following suit. However, experts say
that air conditioner producers should not use post-sale services
as an expedient, but rather should consider it a long-term
strategy.

speaking at the close of a four-day financial management
workshop for senior civil servants in Bulawayo, the country's
second largest city on Thursday, Murerwa said, "We continue to

According to the report of the daily Herald on Friday, the
minister said there was need for the country to find ways to
further reduce its levels of taxation in order to attract
investment and retain manpower.
</P>
<P>
Lower taxes, he said, would make a more conducive environment
for investment and expansion, which, in turn, create job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The minister also appealed to the government to ensure greater
accountability and efficient use of limited resources, keep public
expenditure in check and enhance its revenue collection capacity.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet is considering establishing a revenue
authority and introduce a value-added tax system to yield higher
revenue than the current sales tax system.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Laptop computers are becoming

The trend continued through this January, when 2,228 notebook
computers were imported, worth 9.1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the rising number of imports is accompanied by
declining prices, with the 1997 per-unit 2,579 U.S. dollars cost
dropping to 1,725 U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The computers are mainly imported from Japan, Taiwan and the

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (33) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 33 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Is the Commission Against Corruption an organ independent of
the Government of the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
Article 50 of the Basic Law says that the Commissioner Against
Corruption is a principal official nominated and reported by the
Chief Executive to the Central People's Government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
The Commission Against Corruption is undoubtedly part of the
Government system in Macao. In view of the nature of the
Commission, the Basic Law stipulates clearly that a Commission
Against Corruption shall be established in the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
It shall function independently and its Commissioner shall be
accountable to the Chief Executive. It is clear from this
provision that the Commission Against Corruption shall be under
the direct leadership of the Chief Executive and shall
independently exercise its powers and functions vested in it by
law.
</P>
<P>
There is no relationship of subordination between the
Commission and other government bodies.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is in Macao a high commission against
corruption and illegal activities in administration which operates
according to the regulations of the High Commission Against
Corruption and Illegal Activities in Administration.
</P>
<P>
According to the Regulations, though the Anti-corruption
Commissioner is appointed and empowered by the Governor or to the
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The Commission itself is not a part of the Judiciary. It
operates only according to law and is not subject to any orders or
instructions.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the existing Commission is not of the same nature as
the Anti-Corruption Commission as specified in the Basic Law. To
converge with the Basic Law, the existing regulations shall be
amended where necessary.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (34) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 34 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administration Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
In what way will the Government of MSAR be accountable to the
Legislative Council?
</P>
<P>
Article 65 of the Basic Law says the Government of MSAR must
abide by the law and be accountable to the Legislative Council in
three areas.
</P>
<P>
It shall implement the laws passed by the Council and already
in force; it shall present regular policy addresses to the Council;
and it shall answer questions raised by the members of the Council.
</P>
<P>
These provisions in effect constitute the necessary checks on
the power of the Government, reflect the principle of acting
according to law, embody the supervision by the legislature over
the executive body to prevent the Government from abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Will the Chief Executive of the Macao Special Administrative
Region have legislative power?
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of the Organic Statute of Macao,
Macao has since 1976 practiced a double-deck legislation system,
which means both the legislative Council and the Governor of Macao
have legislative power.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council exercises legislative power by enacting
laws while the Governor by promulgating acts and laws. The
Legislative Council and the Governor each has different
legislative powers, and they have overlapping legislative powers
over certain issues.
</P>
<P>
Some matters come under, however, the exclusive power of the
Legislative Council. The legislative Council may still authorize
the Governor to make a law on them by passing a bill.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 67 of the Basic Law, the Legislative
Council of the MSAR shall be the legislature of the Region after
its return to China.
</P>
<P>
This provision has two means: one is that the Legislative
Council is a legislature in nature which has legislative power.
And the other is that the Legislative Council is the only
legislature of the MSAR and excludes any one else from having this
power.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is clear from this provisions of the Basic Law
that the future Chief Executive shall not have legislative power
and that MSAR shall practice a single-deck legislative system
instead of the double-deck system.
</P>
<P>
But the Chief Executive shall have the power to formulate and
promulgate, and promulgate administrative rule and regulations.
</P>
<P>
This power will enable the Chief Executive to lead the
government and exercise the power of administrative management.
</P>
<P>
As far as their legal force is concerned, the administrative
rules and regulations issued by the Chief Executive are not
legislation and should not contravene the laws enacted by the
legislative Council.

<HEADLINE> China to Take Emergency Measures to Clean Up Algae </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to take some
emergency measures to clean up the blue-green algae expected to be
rampant in southwest China's Dianchi Lake in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA) say this project will guarantee a beautiful
environment for visitors attending the '99 Kunming World
Horticulture Exposition which will open on May 1 in this capital
of Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The emergency project, with an investment of over 13 million
yuan (1.56 million US dollars), will take place from April 25 to
October 31 and will cover a total area of nearly three square
kilometers, removing the algae with mechanical equipment to
improve the water quality.
</P>
<P>
This year has been the driest and hottest year in the
meteorological history of Kunming. The recent high temperatures
and lack of rain in the region will probably lead to the rampant
growth of the blue-green algae, according to experts.

<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation
rate has reached an all-time high of 52.8 percent for the month of
March with no signs of coming down as a result of underlying
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The rate has gone up by 2.8 percentage points from 50 percent

uniforms went up significantly in the month.
</P>

25 percent to remain viable, the statistical office said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1990s, Zimbabwe's annual year-on-year inflation

Development Community (SADC) has expressed concern that the free
trade accord between South Africa and the European Union (EU)
would frustrate its efforts to liberalize trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
EU exports of grain, dairy and livestock products threatened to
wipe out vast chunks of the region's labor-intensive agriculture
sector, South Africa's Business Day newspaper Friday quoted SADC
Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Dairy, beef, wheat industries are some of the areas where
(South African) free trade with the EU could cause considerable
problems."
</P>
<P>
"The dumping of cheap beef and dairy products... is our fear,"
Mbuende said. "There is greater capacity in Europe, especially in
the dairy industry. We cannot compete."
</P>
<P>
Agriculture employed about 70 percent of the SADC's workers,
but produced only 12 percent of regional gross domestic product of
176 billion U.S. dollars. That paled in comparison with output of
the EU's highly mechanized, subsidized farming operations.
</P>
<P>
Though the South African-EU trade accord is supposed to involve
only those two parties, Mbuende said he was under no illusion that
duty-free products from the north would end up in other SADC
markets.
</P>
<P>
Lost tariff revenue aside, the imports threatened to render
local agricultural industries redundant, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mbuende said the bilateral trade pact would also offer
benefits, like speeding up trade reforms. In lowering duties on EU
goods and services, South Africa was obliged to offer identical
preferences to the other SADC states.
</P>
<P>
EU ambassador to South Africa, Michael Laidler, said Thursday
night: "It is not for me to criticize the remarks of the (SADC)
executive secretary, but I'm surprised.. given the consultations
between the EU and the SADC and between South Africa and the SADC
(during the talks)."
</P>
<P>
Laidler said the EU and South Africa took "genuine steps" to
ensure SADC interests were not prejudiced by the deal, which would
benefit the region. Failure of the talks would have cast doubts on
the review of the EU relationship with its African, Caribbean and
Pacific partners.
</P>
<P>
South Africa made no comment Thursday, but Pretoria has
stressed that trade preferences given to the EU will be no better
than those extended to SADC partners. South Africa has offered to
open its markets to SADC partners within five years under the
proposed SADC free trade plan. South African officials have said
that South Africa was ready to accelerate implementation of agreed
trade concessions to its SADC partners.
</P>
<P>
SADC comprises 14 members: Angola, Botswana, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambian
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Approves More Overseas-Funded Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai, an inland province with a
backward economy in northwest China, approved 24 overseas-funded
enterprises last year despite the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
These projects involved a total investment of 200 million U.S.
dollars, with contractual foreign investment amounting to 75.8
million dollars, up 285 percent and 184 percent, respectively,
from 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the provincial Foreign Trade and
Economic Relations Department, a total of 19, equivalent to 80
percent, of the approved overseas-funded enterprises are engaged
in the development of local resources and productive projects.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Qinghai has organized delegations to
participate in various kinds of overseas investment and trade
fairs in a bid to attract more investment.
</P>
<P>
Besides businessmen from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, more
investors from the United States, France, Canada, Norway,
Australia and other European countries have shown their interest
in investing in the province, which abounds with oil, natural gas,
water, electricity, potash fertilizer and nonferrous metal
resources.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Attends Chretien's Grand Reception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji on Thursday attended a grand banquet hosted in his honor by
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien at the National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the banquet, Zhu said he was very happy that
friendship between China and Canada had enjoyed significant
progress through frequent exchanges and cooperation at the
government and parliament levels as well as in various areas.
</P>
<P>
"We've made effective progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu praised Chretien, who has been to China three times since
he became the head of the Canadian government, for his "important
contribution to the friendship and cooperation between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Zhu also thanked members of the Canadian Parliament for their
efforts to have pushed the Sino-Canadian cooperative relations to
a higher level.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Zhu visited the parliament and met with Senate Speaker
Gildas Molgat and House of Commons Speaker Gilbert Parent, Jack
Austin and Reg Alcock, co-chairs of the Canada-China Legislative
Association, and 75 members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He invited all the members of parliament present to visit China
on behalf of Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said there were some Canadians who had "misunderstandings"
about China because they had never been to China and knew very
little about it.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to address it is to have mutual communication,"
he said, encouraging Canadians, including members of parliament,
to pay more visits to China for a better understanding of the
country.
</P>
<P>
At the banquet, Chretien admired China's "amazing
accomplishments" in its economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said Canada had been by China's side as a friend and partner
during its "long march of progress," and promised to continue to
stand by its side in meeting new challenges in the next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has dropped ministerial appointee Deo Rwabita to comply with the
constitutional provisions.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Parliament Speaker Francis Ayume at a
session of the Appointments Committee Thursday, the New Vision
daily said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He withdrew him to bring the number of cabinet ministers within
the constitutional number of 61. In the latest cabinet reshuffle
on April 5, 13 ministerial nominees were forwarded to the
Parliament, making the cabinet list as long as 62.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996 Parliament passed a resolution allowing the
president to increase the number of ministers from the
constitutionally required 42 to 61 to accommodate and balance
various interests.
</P>
<P>
The resolution allowed the president to increase the full
cabinet ministers from 21 to 25 and state ministers from 21 to 36.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of Uganda
Railways Corporation (URC), Enos Tumusiime has been remanded for
financial loss of 46,774 U.S. dollars to the corporation.
</P>
<P>
Tumusiime, 43, was whisked off to Luzira prison from his firm
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a Monitor daily report on Friday, he knowingly
made the company lose money contrary to the Penal Code Act by
authorizing it to pay Tanzania Railways on behalf of Pearl
International Commodities of Britain.
</P>
<P>
Tumusiime, who pleaded not guilty before Buganda Road court,
described the charge as frivolous and vexatious.
</P>
<P>
Buganda Road Resident State Attorney Michael Elubu told the
court that inquiries into the case were almost complete and prayed
for a hearing date to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
After the chief magistrate's ruling that he be remanded,
Tumusiime confidently asked for the way to the cells as he left
the dock.
</P>
<P>
Tumusiime was retired in 1997 following an investigation by a
parliamentary committee on statutory bodies, parastatals and state
enterprises which accused him of running down the corporation and
financial impropriety among other things.

<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The China Development Bank (CDB)
announced today that it has been given approval by the People's
Bank of China, the central bank, to enter the national market for
interbank lending businesses.
</P>
<P>
This is the first instance of a policy-oriented bank joining
the national interbank market.
</P>
<P>
A CDB spokesman said that the bank has been using some
temporary measures to control its monetary position. Since the CDB
began to raise capital through public bidding in the second half
of last year, it has become a necessity for the bank to set up
market operation functions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that CDB's access to the interbank market
will be critical for the bank's balanced position and further
improving its banking functions.
</P>
<P>
The CDB is one of China's three policy-oriented banks, mainly
providing financing support for the state's key construction
projects in the infrastructure sector.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Imports 75 Pct of Edible Oil Needs Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh spends 15 billion taka
(312.5 million U.S. dollars) to import more than three-fourths of
the edible oil consumed in the country each year, The New Nation
Business and Finance reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh produces only about 200,000 tons of edible oil a
year, less than 25 percent of the country's total domestic needs,
Agricultural Extension Department (AED) sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Even with the imports, the country's per head vegetable oil
consumption is about five grams a day, showing only 4 percent of
per capita calorie consumption, which is less than the
recommendations of the Untied Nations Food and Agricultural
Organization and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
In the last two decades, demand for edible oil has increased
substantially. As the country's per capita income increases, it is
expected that the demand will rise rapidly to meet the present
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Oilseeds like mustard, groundnut, sunflower, soybean, and
castor are grown in the country, and mustard is the most important
oilseed crop in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Several high-yielding varieties of mustard have been developed
by the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute and the
Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The production capacity of the new varieties is almost two-fold
against the traditional ones but it does not suit the cropping
pattern in many areas of the country because of its longer field
duration.
</P>
<P>
A mechanism should be developed for the private sector
involving contract agro-seed production, and the AED should
develop a large-scale production plan using existing high-yielding
mustard seeds for the suitable agro-ecological regions and
cropping patterns of the country, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Waive Dennis Rodman </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers
couldn't bear anymore about Dennis Rodman and his bizarre behavior,
waiving the rebounding king Thursday night after the forward
showed up late again.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, 38, showed up late for the team's morning practice and
was slow getting ready because he couldn't find his socks and
shoes.
</P>
<P>
Lakers coach Kurt Rambis told him to go home and said the team
was through with its special treatment of the eccentric actions.
</P>
<P>
"At this time we feel it's in the best interests of the Lakers
to end the relationship," Lakers vice president Jerry West said in
a statement. "This obviously didn't work out like we had hoped,
but we would like to thank Dennis for the contributions he did
make to the team and wish him the best of luck in the future."
</P>
<P>
Rodman had missed several practices and showed up late many
times during the seven-week with the Lakers. He also missed four
games earlier this season due to personal problems.
</P>
<P>
He divorced actress Carmen Electra recently. Rodman signed with
the Lakers on February 23 and played his firs tgame three days
later. He refused to return to a game four times in his 23
contests.
</P>
<P>
Rodman averaged 2.1 points and 11.2 rebounds in 28.6 minutes
per game.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers won their first 11 games with Rodman, but are 6-6
since that time with him. They are 8-9 without him.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Deploys Army to Ensure Water, Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
deployed army troops to guard water and power stations in the wake
of a persistent water and power crisis gripping the capital city
for the past few days.
</P>
<P>
All jobs under the Power Development Board and the Dhaka
Electric Supply Authority have been declared essential services to
meet the exigencies, as the worst electricity and water crisis of
recent years fueled violent protests in the capital and power
workers threatened strikes, press reports here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations said
troops had been deployed at water supply stations in Dhaka and the
southeastern port city of Chittagong following Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina's order Wednesday night to deploy army soldiers to
assist the administration to ease the crisis in the supply of
water in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The release did not mention the army deployment at power supply
stations. But an official was quoted as saying that troops went to
some of the power stations as part of their "routine movements."
</P>
<P>
The army personnel were guarding the pump stations, especially
the system control rooms to monitor mechanical faults and
disputation in the pump stations around the clock. They also
extended their help in rationing water from water carriers and
trailers to residents in different problem-ridden areas of the
city, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority is currently
supplying 800-900 million liters of water every day against the
actual demand of 1,400 million liters, leaving a shortfall of
500-600 million liters on average, while the gap between power
output and demand in the country is about 400 megawatts at peak
hours.
</P>
<P>
The power generation units in the country have an installed
capacity of about 3,000 megawatts, but their actual production
capacity is about 2,000 megawatts only.

<HEADLINE> China to Change Olympians Selection Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, NORTHEAST CHINA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
Swimming Association (CSA) decided to change its long-standing
ways for the selection of swimmers for international competitions
as a new formula is believed to be adopted for choosing the
country's representatives in the Sydney 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
According to a proposal drafted by CSA, Chinese swimmers will
have to guarantee themselves a spot in the Olympic line-up through
various means: by earning high enough world rankings or
performance points accumulated through various Olympic qualifying
competitions sanctioned by the International Amateur Swimming
Federation (FINA), the world ruling body.
</P>
<P>
Such qualifiers include this year's World University Games and
the Pan-Pacific Swimming Championships, and, for Chinese swimmers,
the National Cities Games in September in Xi'an and the National
Swimming Championships in October and next spring's National
Swimming Championships, which are yet to be sanctioned by FINA.
</P>
<P>
These measures are desired to ensure a fair and accurate
judgement in the process of selection, a CSA spokesman said here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
More and more controversies have arisen from the current way of
selection which was based on a rough judgement of swimmers'
overall performances in domestic and international events.
</P>
<P>
The principles CSA set for the new selection formula are "Open
Criteria, Fair Competition and Just Selection", added the
spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 15 (Xinhua)-- The main challenge for
humanity in the new millennium is to build a world free of weapons
and promote peace among all countries, President of the World
Conference of the International Junior Chamber, Manuel Barrios,
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The International Junior Chamber is conducive to the civic
integration and participation of its members in different
community social programs, giving priority to work with youth and
children, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the four-day conference, attended by 800
representatives from Asia, Europe, Africa and America, he said the
chamber rejects wars, massacres and violence against all refugees
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Participants deplored the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (
NATO) for its indiscriminate bombings against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Barrios said Panama is to face the great challenges in the new
millennium -- the taking over of administration over the
Interoceanic Canal that will be returned on 31 December 1999.
</P>
<P>
But he assured a promising economic future for Panama with the
Canal's return bringing investments to the areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Torrijos-Carter canal treaties signed by the
two governments in 1997, the United States will have to give back
to Panama the final military bases and civil infrastructures it
administers in the areas before the end of the year.

KIEV, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
Thursday urged NATO to start peace negotiations with Yugoslavia
and stop bombing on Belgrade, Interfax-Ukraine news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a press conference held in Klaipeda,
Lithuania, where he was on a two-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
He said the current situation would do no good to either side
of the conflict, expressing regret that NATO spent such a huge sum
of money on military actions on Yugoslavia instead of on
assistance to countries whose economies were transforming from
planned to market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that any solution to the Kosovo crisis would be based
on one principle: respecting the territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia and giving Kosovo a broad autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He added that separatism was dangerously in a trend of spreading
over the world and any support to it could add impetus to the
process.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma was visiting Lithuania to discuss transportation
cooperation with his Lithuanian and Polish counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parents Ignore Creativity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey indicated that
Chinese parents will educate their children at any cost, but place
little emphasis on developing the creativity of their offspring.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the first of its kind in China, was jointly
conducted by the Ministry of Education, the Chinese Communist
Youth League Central Committee and the China Association for
Science and Technology. The goal of survey, which covered 12,000
middle school and college students, was to determine the level of
creativity exhibited by Chinese youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed the 38 of respondents permit their children
to experiment in various areas such as disassembling clocks.
However, 40 percent of respondents noted that they scold their
children for related creative activities.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight percent of respondents offered perfunctory
responses or exhibited disdain when responding to questions
concerning children.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that 39.1 percent of fathers and 61.9
percent of the mothers had primary school educations.
</P>
<P>
China adopted its one child policy more than two decades ago.
Parents have since placed great hope on the futures of their
children. Parents have exerted significant energy and dedicated
vast sums of money on education, but have nonetheless virtually
ignored developing creativity of their children, according to Ma
Kangmei, an expert who participated in conducting the survey.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ying, an expert from the All-China Women's Federation,
noted that domestic education plays a vital role in developing
creativity. She added that 54 percent of Nobel Prize winners come
from well-educated families.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the federation has opened more than 300,000 schools
for Chinese parents in order to alter their concepts of education
and enhance cultural levels.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Needs 38 Mln Dollars to Tackle Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam needs an estimated 500
billion Vietnamese Dong (VND) (38 million U.S. dollars) to tackle
the millennium bug (Y2K) problem in the country, Vietnam News
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tran Luu Chuong, head of Vietnam's National Y2K Steering
Committee, was quoted as saying: "For developed countries, this
amount money may be small, but for a poor country such as ours, it
is a huge burden for the State Budget."
</P>
<P>
Chuong said officials responsible for dealing with the
millennium bug in most of Vietnam's cities and provinces have now
completed training courses on tackling the problem, the English
daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Vietnam's cities, provinces, ministries, and
industries have already assessed the impact that the Y2K problem
will have on them.
</P>
<P>
"First, we are focusing on tackling the problem for spearhead
sectors such as electricity, telecommunications, traffic and
banking. The bug could cause severe damage to these sectors and
thus disturb the lives of many people," Chuong said. "We are
planning for the airline and banking sectors to be prepared by
June 30 and we will inspect their results in July."
</P>
<P>
Chuong also said Vietnam's Steering Committee would check
sectors that would not be greatly influenced by the bug, such as
education and administration, as soon as they were sure the
spearhead sectors were fully prepared.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot tackle every sector at once because we are facing
many difficulties," said Chuong. "The toughest problem is how to
organize the work effectively. We are short of both capital and
experts."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has 4,000 to 5,000 computer programmers but the
number needed to solve the Y2K Problem is around 10,000, according
to Chuong.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the computers and relevant equipment in many
sectors are obsolete and unsystematic," Chuong said. "We should
replace the old computers with new ones now, thus avoiding wasting
time and resources preparing old computers which can only be used
for a couple of more years."
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee had suggested combining the program of
tackling the Y2K problem with the task of modernization, Chuong
added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Rise by 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The largest wool offering of the
season and a two-week wool sale break over Easter have failed to
dampen prices, which rose three percent on average at auctions
this week.
</P>
<P>
The week's wool offering of 123,884 bales was the largest this
season and was seen as a possible test for the market on whether
rising prices would be maintained.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian Wool Industries Secretariat (AWIS) indicated
in its weekly report that the offering had not deterred buyers
with the AWEX eastern market indicator gaining 17 cents to end the
week at 551 cents per kg clean.
</P>
<P>
This was based on increases of 18 and 17 cents in north and
south Australia respectively which saw their regional indicators
finish at 554 cents and 540 cents/kg clean.
</P>
<P>
A rise of two cents in the west saw that region's indicator
close at 484 cents/kg clean.
</P>
<P>
Of the large offering 13.4 percent was passed in, comprising
10.6 percent in Sydney, 14.2 percent in Melbourne and 15.2 percent
in western Australia's town of Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
Finer wools were again responsible for much of the price rises.
</P>
<P>
"The principal price increases were again found in the finer
microns which remain in short supply but the market was also
boosted by increased demand and competition from processors in
Europe," AWIS said.
</P>
<P>
Another large offering of 102,000 bales will be up for sale in
Sydney, Adelaide and Fremantle next week.

<HEADLINE> Prices of Production Materials Remain Stable in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Last month saw a stable
production materials market in China with prices of some products
rebounding, according to the State Information Center (SIC).
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by SIC shows that prices of 83
production materials, 47.7 percent of total products surveyed,
dipped in March, while prices of 93 materials, which account for
52.3 percent of the total, remained unchanged or edged up a little.
</P>
<P>
Prices of steel remained low amid a rise in demand, as a result
of the ample supply of products, said the China Chemical Industry
News.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices of major non-ferrous metals continued to
decline during the month in the face of weak export, while the
magnesium and aluminum products enjoyed 1.7 percent and 0.25
percent increase in prices respectively.
</P>
<P>
Prices of natural rubber underwent a sustained increase in
March while the average prices of chemical products fell against
that of February.
</P>
<P>
Increased infrastructure construction has helped pull the
prices of timber and cement up by a small margin while no big
change has taken place in the prices of plate glass.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, prices of energy products remained
comparatively stable with only a slight drop in petroleum and
diesel prices.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Misses Practice Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman, whose seven-
week career with the Los Angeles Lakers has been filled with
erratic behavior, missed another practice Thursday after a late
arrival.
</P>
<P>
He was several minutes late at Los Angeles Southwest College,
and claimed he couldn't find his socks and shoes, so coach Kurt
Rambis sent him home.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the Lakes lost to Portland 113-86, in which
Rodman sat out the second half, saying his left elbow was
bothering him.
</P>
<P>
Injured players should show up an hour before practice to
receive treatment, but Rodman ignored this policy.
</P>
<P>
"I just asked him what was going on, he said he was looking for
socks and shoes, and I told him practice was 11 a.m. and then I
said, 'Why don't you just go home,'" Rambis told reporters after
practice.
</P>
<P>
"Any player being late at any time was not how I handled Dennis.
I don't think anybody handles it that way. We made exceptions in
special cases to accommodate him, but in my mind, the
accommodation period is over."
</P>
<P>
Rodman has told the coaching staff four times in his 23 games
with the team that he was unable to take their order to return to
a game.
</P>
<P>
Rodman is averaging 11.2 rebounds in 28.6 minutes of playing
time. He signed with the Lakers on February 23 and played his
first game with them three days later.

<HEADLINE> Outlaw Makes Long-Awaited Return for Magic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Orlando Magic starting forward
Bo Outlaw, sidelined for more than a month, was activated from the
injured list and played 18 minutes in an 83-80 loss to the Indiana
Pacers last night.
</P>
<P>
Outlaw originally was expected to miss up to two weeks after
being diagnosed with a fracture of his left fibula on March 22.
Before that, he missed four straight games and six of seven due to
what was termed a sore left knee.
</P>
<P>
To open a roster spot, rookie guard Miles Simon was placed on
the injured list with patella tendinitis in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
One season after being the only member of the Magic to play all
82 games, Outlaw apeared in only half of his team's 38 contests
before last night's game.
</P>
<P>
Without Outlaw, the Magic managed to remain atop the Eastern
Conference. But they had a six-game winning streak snapped with
the latest loss and fell to 28-11. They are two games in front of
the Miami Heat (25-12) and the Central Division-leading Pacers (26-
13) for the top spot in the East.
</P>
<P>
Outlaw is averaging 6.8 points and 6.9 rebounds. He is shooting
50.5 percent from the field but only 43 percent from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
Last season, Outlaw led the team in field goal percentage and
blocked shots while averaging 9.5 points and 7.8 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka to Start Port Development Project in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will begin a five-year
construction and operational work of the 240 million U.S. dollar
Colombo Port's Queen Elizabeth Quay (QEQ) development project in
July, the Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Thilan Wijesinghe said the
project, on a Build-Own and Transfer (BOT) basis, is the single
largest investment to be undertaken here, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The promoters of the venture is South Asia Gateway Terminals
(SAGT) (Pvt) Ltd., in which Sri Lanka's John Keels Holdings Ltd.
holds 26.25 percent equity.
</P>
<P>
John Keels Chairman Ken Balendra was quoted as saying that
everything was moving smoothly for the project which will give Sri
Lanka's economy a huge boost.
</P>
<P>
SAGT has ordered the necessary equipment and work on the first
stage was scheduled to begin soon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Funding for the project will be from the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Capital
Development Corporation (CDC) and the Colombo-based Private Sector
Infrastructure Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to John Keels Holdings, the other shareholders of
SAGT are P&AMP;O (Netherlands) Ltd., Sri Lanka Ports Authority, P&AMP;O
Nedlloyd Ltd., Evergreen Shipping Lines Ltd. and a consortium of
the ADB, IFC and CDC.
</P>
<P>
The project encompasses the widening of the QEQ by a further
100 meters to 940 meters, which would mean the quay would reach
out to the original turning circle for ships which has a depth of
14 meters.
</P>
<P>
This will enable ships with additional tonnage to berth in
Colombo. It is also expected that the project would increase the
cargo handling capacity of the QEQ from 250,000 Twenty-foot
Equivalent Units to 1 million.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Trend of East-West Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The new trend in economic
cooperation between east and west China centers on two-way
transfers of technological achievements.
</P>
<P>
Scientific research institutes in the west have benefited
greatly from hi-tech development achievements provided by eastern
provinces and have reciprocated by offering new technology to
industrial firms in the east.
</P>
<P>
The trend was apparent during the recent '99 Seminar on
Investment and Trade between East and West China (SITEWC), one of
the largest annual trade fairs in China.
</P>
<P>
Governor Cheng Andong of northwestern Shaanxi Province said
that the promotion of east-west cooperation is strategically
important for maintaining the rapid and sustained national
economic development.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese economist noted that eastern China has stimulated
economic growth of the west by pouring funds and technology into
the region, with the latter supporting sustained growth in the
former by providing abundant natural resources, cheap labor and
low production costs.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that investments in west China grew
by 31.2 percent in 1998, some 14.9 percentage points higher the
level for east China.
</P>
<P>
"East-West cooperation benefits both sides," according to Vice-
Governor Yu Xingde of east China's Jiangsu Province. For example
Shaanxi enjoys abundant natural resources, as well as numerous
institutes of higher education and research organizations.
Industrial firms in Jiangsu have actively sought partners to mass
produce hi-tech products developed by institutes in west China.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi alone signed 127 technological cooperation projects
with enterprises in other provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions during the SITEWC.
</P>
<P>
Lu Bingheng, a professor at Xi'an Telecommunications University,
inked a 300,000-yuan (36,000 US dollars) contract with the Luohu
district in the city of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province for the
transfer of laser technology.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hu Angang, an expert on China's development, acknowledged
that provinces in west China are capable of expanding development
in eastern coastal areas. He pointed to the constantly narrowing
gap between east and west China, and said that mutual promotion
will help to ensure the nation's balanced economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese city of Tianjin has
signed a contract with the Egyptian government to build an
industrial town on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
The 150,000-sq.m. area will have factories for manufacturing
motors, assembling calculators, lighters and other items.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative project was agreed upon during Egyptian
President Hosni Mobarak's visit to China, when other contracts on
aquaculture and water were signed.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is the largest port city in northern China and has been
active in trade with Egypt over the past few years. Egypt had 3
enterprises in Tianjin by the end of last year, with total
investment worth 2 million U.S. dollars, 1.08 million dollars of
that from Egypt. Their imports and exports are worth 28 million U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development
Zone is building the Suez Special Economic Zone in Egypt, China's
first overseas cooperative zone in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Seen Driving Up Philippine Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Fueled by the positive growth in
the agriculture sector, the Philippine government expects the
county's GDP to expand between 0.5 percent to 1 percent in the
first quarter of this year, the Business World newspaper said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla was quoted as
saying that the agriculture sector is to register a growth of 3
percent to 4 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
With the expected growth rates, the government is confident it
will be able to meet its 1999 target of 2.6 percent to 3.1 percent
for the gross domestic product (GDP), Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
The gross national product (GNP) is also expected to grow
between 1 percent to 1.5 percent in the first quarter of 1999, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector accounts for more than 20 percent of the
country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
The sector posted a dismal performance last year after it was
badly battered by the El Nino weather phenomenon that caused a
prolonged drought in many provinces of the country.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Joint Security Policies for EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said the European Union (EU) should see the war in the
Balkans as a chance to build joint security and defense policies.
</P>
<P>
The Italian news weekly "Liberal," quoted Dini as saying that
this would not mean breaking the present solidarity with the U.S.
and Canada, but would give a "more solid foundation to the concept
of the West."
</P>
<P>
"The first real war in which the European states are involved
after fifty years requires the EU, as a complement to NATO, to
find its own personality in security and defense."
</P>
<P>
He said this was the only way it could overcome the weakness
created by its lack of an independent defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in another Italian news weekly "Panorama," he denied
claims that he is "pro-Serb" in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing has proved effective in destroying Yugoslav
military objectives," he said, "but has not convinced Milosevic,"
adding that since NATO can't go on bombing for ever, an
alternative has to be found.
</P>
<P>
Dini confirmed his past proposal of a total blockade of Serbia,
which would presumably be made easier by NATO's destruction of
bridges in the country.

JAKARTA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic attacks continued
against Madurese migrants in Indonesia's West Kalimantan regency
of Sambas, The Jakarta Post Friday quoted provincial police chief

</P>
<P>
During an overnight incident, an ethnic Malay man was killed

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien held a 19-gun fire salute welcome ceremony for Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji at MacDonald-Cartier International Airport here
Thursday as the two leaders pledged to enhance bilateral
cooperation in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
Red carpets were rolled out and national anthems of the two
countries played at the ceremony, during which Zhu reviewed the
guard of honor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, which was attended by several hundred
people, Chretien welcomed Zhu and his wife, Lao An, and the
Chinese government delegation.
</P>
<P>
"During your visit, we are looking forward to signing an accord
on cracking down international criminal activities and promoting
an action plan of cooperation on protecting environment," Chretien
said.
</P>
<P>
In the international aspect, he said, Canada hopes to
strengthen cooperation with China on the crucial issues of world
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said Canada hopes for progress on China's entry to the
World Trade Organization (WTO).

The friendly cooperative relations between China and Canada
have developed to a mature stage, he said.

<P>
Zhu's current visit, which is a return one to Chretien's, is
his first to Canada in the capacity as Chinese premier.

The purpose of his visit, Zhu said, is to consolidate the
common ground reached by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Chretien during Jiang's visit to Canada in 1997 so as to advance
the 21st century-oriented Sino-Canada partnership of all-round
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Supporters Continue to Seek His Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government's first
official reaction to British Home Secretary Jack Straw's ruling to
extradite Pinochet to Spain was to reiterate its decision to
continue making efforts to achieve the objectives of sovereignty
and justice for the release of General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza Thursday refuted
Straw's ruling, saying that Chile will use all judicial and
political means available to achieve the release of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Britain's resolution "isn't really any surprise at all and it
seems important to point out that Straw has chosen once more not
to go any further," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, under house arrest in London since last October 16,
will go through a process of extradition in one or two years,
which Spanish judge Baltazar Gracian has requested, in order to
try him for alleged human rights offenses during Chile's military
regime.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government has sought Pinochet's release since his
arrest in London, saying foreign courts have no right to try
alleged crimes committed in Chile. The government contested that
its efforts are in the defense of principles, not of an individual.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pro and anti-Pinochet groups in Chile showed their
pleasure or displeasure after hearing Britain's decision.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's supporters held protests near the British and
Spanish embassies in Santiago. However, anti-Pinochet groups
danced joyfully in the streets.

PBSI chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo said the association would
announce the names of Indonesia's squad members after both
simulations.
</P>
<P>
He said PBSI had intensified athletes training to prepare for
both events.
</P>
<P>
"I think the shuttlers are highly motivated because it's been
12 years since our first victory in the Sudirman Cup," he said.
</P>
<P>
Subagyo emphasized that PBSI would provide a second chance to
top women's shuttler Mia Audina, although her name was not
included for the simulation.
</P>
<P>
"Mia is still needed by PBSI. We hope she can take care of her
physical and technical condition, specially after her marriage,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mia skipped training for three weeks, after her quarter-finals
loss at the All England badminton championships, to marry
Surinamese Tylio Lobman on March 30.
</P>
<P>
"Mia is our daughter. We can't just punish her. Don't consider
her as our enemy. Giving her a warning letter is a way to show
that we care and we don't want her to ruin her life," said Subagyo,
who is also the Army chief of staff.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Toilets In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Citizens and tourists in
Shanghai nowadays find it much easier to find public lavatory
facilities, thanks to the installation of an increasing number of
mobile toilets in the city.
</P>
<P>
By depositing a one yuan coin, people can use the one-square-
meter mobile toilet equipped with clothing pegs, mirrors, and
handrails.
</P>
<P>
The use of these mobile lavatories is expected to help problems
involving land, water, power and disposals which are caused by the
regular public toilets in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The Hongchang environmental-friendly equipment factory in
Shanghai's Baoshan District plans to invest 40 million yuan to
install 1,000 mobile toilets in Shanghai this year. And the
company intends to produce organic fertilizers by using the waste
it collects from the facilities.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Thursday
that the United States and its NATO allies are determined "to
maintain and intensify attacks" against the Serbs until Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's forces are so weakened they must
yield their grip on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to the American Society of Newspaper Editors in
San Francisco, California, Clinton said the preconditions that
could stop NATO's bombing are: Serbian security forces must leave
Kosovo; the displaced Kosovars must be able to return; and, there
must be an international security force to protect all Kosovars,
including the Serb minority there, as they work towards self-
government. (Clinton-Kosovo)

<P>
BRASILIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Brasil will be able to obtain
this year a trade surplus of 14 billion U.S. dollars, thanks to

<P>
LONDON April 15 (Xinhua) - European stock markets slipped on
Thursday with investors' confidence sapped by the Kosovo conflict
and uneasiness over Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
London and Paris ended down 0.4 and 0.9 percent respectively,
while German shares were flat. Mixed signals from New York markets
did nothing to calm European nerves.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index was undermined by weakness in the drugs
sector, which trumped a spirited 3.8 percent gain from oil giant
BP Amoco and cyclical shares.
</P>
<P>
The index eventually lost ground to close down 27.5 points, or
0.42 percent, at 6,466.1 points.

Frankfurt managed to claw back some losses as a decline by
Deutsche Telekom offset gains by chemical sector and many other

time championship winner Brazil and Uruguay in the quarter-finals,
which will be played on Sunday.
</P>

<P>
In the second half, the Americans came back forcefully and
Taylor Twellman was on target four minutes after the break and
found the net again at the end of the regular time.
</P>
<P>
The match in Bauchi was more dramatic. Yasuhito Endo scored in
the 49th minute to put the Japanese ahead but Portugal equalized
through Claudio.
</P>
<P>
After a barren extra time, the game resorted to penalty
shootouts to determine the winner with Japan scoring all the five
kicks against four by the Portuguese.

Mali beat Cameroon by a golden goal, scoring in the first half
of the extra time by Mahamadou Dissa to qualify. Mali and

<P>
BONN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Swimming League (LEN)
is resisting pressure to switch its long-course championships from
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
LEN official Hans-Peter Burk said on Thursday his organisation
wanted the championships to remain in Istanbul, despite worries
about security by several top swimmers.
</P>
<P>
"The LEN is politically and denominationally neutral and does
not interfere," Burk told German sports agency SID.
</P>
<P>
German Swimming Federation (DSV) president Ruediger Tretow
hinted earlier this month that because of the conflict between
Turkey and Kurdish rebels Germany might shun the event if it was
to remain in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The DSV president argue the championships should either be
moved or cancelled. "Otherwise it will be a mini-European
championships with very few teams," he said.

the first foreigner to be fined in China for putting a computer
virus into industrial computer software.

The higher court of Chongqing in southwest China recently

In 1997, computer specialists discovered "logic bombs", or

the software design and the person responsible for the virus and
was fined 5,000 yuan.

The court believed that Leary was the only person to have both
the ability and opportunity to plant the bugs.

WUHAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province, has used more than three billion US dollars in
indirect foreign investment since 1985, including 158 million US

The city has attracted indirect investment in the form of loans

CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Damage from the Nation's worst hailstorm spread to the share
market late Wednesday as investors realized the impact Sydney's
havoc would have on the finance sector. More airline delays are
also expected Friday due to damage to commercial aircraft at
Sydney Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- It was the most expensive two hours in Sydney's history.
Wednesday night's hailstorm, as ferocious as it was unexpected,
has left a repair bill of more than 400 million Australian dollars
(254 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- A Yugoslav foreign affairs adviser, Milislav Paic, said
Thursday that Belgrade might be more willing to consider releasing
two Care Australian workers once NATO's bombing campaign stopped.
That suggested the men could be freed if Australia abandoned its
support for NATO's bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's business community is poised to give the green
light to federal government moves for a lower corporate tax rate,
but it wants some form of tax incentives for investment to be
retained.

<HEADLINE> British MPs Condemn the Massacre of Refugees by NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Several British Parliament Members
(MPs) on Thursday strongly condemned the massacre of refugees in
Yugoslavia by NATO and said NATO must stop bombing and start
seeking a negotiated settlement to the war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans, a special committee
chaired by Alice Mahon, a parliament members in the British House
of Commons from the Labour Party, said in an issued statement
that the killing of at least 75 Albanian refugees by NATO showed
that NATO is causing human tragedy and must stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"What are the rules of engagement governing the action of NATO
pilots over Yugoslavia? How can the government claim that NATO
goes to 'extraordinary lengths' to avoid civilian casualties when a
pilot fired a second missile into the train on Monday after it was
hit by the first missile and NATO pilots dropped up to five bombs
on the refugee column?" the statement asked.
</P>
<P>
The statement also accused that the public was not told the
truth about the war in Yugoslavia, as different government and
different spokesman were telling different stories of the same
event in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The latest human tragedies (in Yugoslavia)show that NATO must
stop bombing," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Giggs Should Be Fit to Face Juventus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United striker Ryan
Giggs should be fit to face Juventus in next Wednesday's European
Champions Cup semi-final in Italy, the club confirmed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Welsh winger, who scored the deciding goal during the FA
Cup semi-final against Arsenal, had injured his ankle after a
challenge with Lee Dixon.
</P>
<P>
Many were wondering whether the 25-year-old would be able to
play for the rest of the season after he hobbled away from Villa
Park on crutches.
</P>
<P>
But it now appears that he will only miss Saturday's
Premiership match with Sheffield Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Giggs, United manager Alex Ferguson also has other
injury worries ahead of their biggest game of the season.
</P>
<P>
Andy Cole, Denis Irwin and Peter Schmeichel, who hobbled
through injury time with a groin injury, already look major injury
doubts and captain Roy Keane will be suspended for the vital
league game at Liverpool on May 5.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson joked: "We'll have to have a roll-call for the weekend.
I might even consider playing myself.
</P>
<P>
"People go on about us chasing the treble. But there's a danger
all this could still blow up in our faces because we've got game
after game and game coming up."
</P>
<P>
Giggs is a vital member of Ferguson's side and has been
United's saviour in the past fortnight.
</P>
<P>
Not only did he snatch the thrilling clincher against Arsenal,
but he also threw United a lifeline with a last-minute equaliser
in the first leg against Juventus.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was in no doubt about the quality of his star player's
Villa Park goal: "Giggs's winner for me ranks with John Barnes
against Brazil for England, and Ricky Villa for Spurs against
Manchester City.
</P>
<P>
"Beckham's was a great goal as well - but it seems so long ago.
</P>
<P>
"I have to say that within the context of this great game, the
one from Giggs stands alone."
</P>
<P>
United captain Keane admitted he felt his side were on their
way out after being sent off for the second semi-final replay of
his career - following his red card against Crystal Palace.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately this is becoming a bit of a habit for me," he
said. "But I have no complaints with the referee. He didn't have a
choice with either booking because they were both mistimed tackles.
</P>
<P>
"But you couldn't see a better goal than that. I'm sure fate
must have been on our side after my goal was disallowed in the
first game on Sunday," he added.

<HEADLINE> Merson Brands Fowler Ban 'a Joke' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Reformed drug addict Paul Merson
has branded the punishment handed out by the FA to Liverpool's
Robbie Fowler for pretending to snort cocaine as "a joke"
</P>
<P>
Aston Villa star Merson, who will come face to face with Fowler
at Anfield in Saturday's Premiership clash, admits he has gone to
hell and back to battle back from his drug and alcohol problems.
</P>
<P>
But Merson still believes the four-match ban Fowler received
from the Football Association for his antics against Everton (he
also received a two-match ban for his bust-up with England team-
mate Graeme Le Saux and a 32,000 pounds fine) is harsh.
</P>
<P>
"It's funny how a week changes the way you feel about things,"
said Merson.
</P>
<P>
"When the Fowler incident happened, I looked upon it as just
one of those things. I'm struggling now and maybe it isn't funny.
</P>
<P>
"But I've got enough on my plate without worrying about Robbie
Fowler. Personally I think the four-game ban is a bit strong, a
bit of a joke."
</P>
<P>
Merson is waiting to see whether his inspired performance as a
substitute against Southampton last Saturday will earn him a place
in the Villa starting line-up.
</P>
<P>
But his confidence in his ability is such that he has targeted
winning an England recall after being axed by Kevin Keegan for the
squad to face Poland.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends NATO Airstrikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Thursday that the United States and its NATO allies are
determined "to maintain and intensify attacks" against the Serbs
until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces are so
weakened they must yield their grip on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to the American Society of Newspaper Editors in
San Francisco, California, Clinton said the preconditions that
could stop NATO's bombing are: Serbian security forces must leave
Kosovo; the displaced Kosovars must be able to return; and, there
must be an international security force to protect all Kosovars,
including the Serb minority there, as they work towards
self-government.
</P>
<P>
"If he (Milosevic) refuses, our military campaign will continue
to destroy as much of his military capability as we can so that
each day his capacity for repression will diminish," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Yugoslav leader also sought to divide NATO,
but after three weeks, the alliance is solid. "NATO is more united
today than when the operation began," he said.
</P>
<P>
Outside the hotel where Clinton made his remarks, about 50
protesters chanted "No war. No bombs. No New Vietnam," according
to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The editors' convention was the first stop in a two-day Clinton
trip that mixes his roles as commander in chief and Democratic
fund raiser. He was traveling to Detroit and Boston to raise an
estimated more than 1 million U.S. dollar for House and Senate
Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: NATO Air Strikes Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Under increasing pressure to
define the United States' mission in Yugoslavia, President Clinton
Thursday tried again to defend NATO air raids in a speech before
newspaper editors in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's speech came as NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia enter
their fourth week, and amid warnings from U.S. military leaders
that the campaign could last into the summer.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors at the
Fairmont Hotel, the president said that NATO is determined "to
maintain and intensify attacks."
</P>
<P>
He said that the NATO air war will be waged until Slobodan
Milsevic's forces are so weakened they yield their grip on the
province or permit ethnic Albanian refugees to go home.
</P>
<P>
Outside the hotel where the president spoke, several hundred
protesters chanted "No War. No bombs. No Vietman."
</P>
<P>
Prior to Clinton's speech, NATO has acknowledged mistakenly
dropping a bomb on a civilian vehicle in a convoy in Kosovo
Wednesday. Speaking of the bombing, Clinton said that it would be
wrong to change NATO's military campaign against Yugoslavia
because of such mistakes. "That is regrettable. It is inevitable,
" he said."You cannot have this kind of conflict without some
errors like this occuring. This is not a business of perfection."

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Euro-Med Meeting Passes Security Charter Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 15 (Xinhua)--At the meeting of Foreign Ministers
from 27 European Union (EU) and Mediterranean states Thursday in
the city of Stuttgart, the framework for a security charter for
the region was passed.
</P>
<P>
Final structure and functions of the so called Charter for
Peace and Security, based on the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), will be hammered out over the coming
years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The charter should be a functional instrument, endowed with an
appropriate institutional framework that will allow for regular
meetings of all ministers of foreign affairs," said Malta's
foreign minister, Joe Borg, co-chairman of the meeting with German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Germany hopes that launching confidence building measures under
the charter, such as those which helped overcome East-West
mistrust during the Cold War, will foster resolution of Middle
East disputes.
</P>
<P>
Fischer had said wanted to present an outline, working plan and
timetable for the body when the meeting concludes on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer told ministers in his opening speech that all 15 EU
states wanted "powerful political impulses" for expanding ties to
the Mediterranean and were willing to commit considerable funds
aimed at this goal.
</P>
<P>
From 1995 to 1999 the EU made available 4.7 billion euro (5
billion dollars) in aid to the Mediterranean partner states. The
bill for the period 2000 to 2006 has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
"The success of regional stability is dependent upon the success
of the development process of countries in the region. We need to
work hard to bridge the economic divide between the two shores of
the Mediterranean," Borg said.
</P>
<P>
The 12 Mediterranean states attending the meeting are Algeria,
Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, the
Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Together with Mauritania, Libya was invited as an observer
after handing over the two suspects in the Lockerbie Pan Am
jetliner bombing case. Both Fischer and Borg welcomed the country
to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see Libya invited to this forum and we are
confident that this will be the first step towards normalization
of Libya's relations with the international community," Borg said.
</P>
<P>
A major goal of the E.U.-Mediterranean process is creation of a
free trade zone between Europe and the Mediterranean states by the
year 2010, Fischer said. This would involve manufactured goods
while agricultural products would only be gradually liberalised.
</P>
<P>
However, no final decision on concrete measures will be made at
Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
The growing number of EU "associate accords" with Mediterranean
states are part of the process. Included under associate status
are free trade agreements after a maximum 12-year transition
period.
</P>
<P>
So far Tunisia, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and the Palestinian
Authority have concluded such agreements. Negotiations with Egypt
and Lebanon are advanced, while talks with Algeria and Syria are
in the early phase, the German Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Malta, linked to the EU by association agreements
since 1973 and 1971 respectively, are membership candidates in the
bloc. Under a 1996 agreement, Turkey was the first Mediterranean
partner to enter a customs union with the EU.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Evidence of Another Solar System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from San Francisco
State University said Thursday that they have for the first time
discovered the evidence of another solar system, suggesting that
the Milky Way, which contains about 200 billion stars, may has
many planetary systems.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press, one planet has been known to
be circulating around Upsilon Andromedae, 44 light years from
Earth. Now they spotted the existence evidence of two additional
planets circulating the star.
</P>
<P>
They discovered the two planets by using a method that measures
their gravitational pull on their star, not by direct observation.
</P>
<P>
They said that the innermost of the three planets has at least
75 percent of the mass of Jupiter and is very close to its sun,
orbiting once every 4.6 days. The middle planet is twice Jupiter's
mass and orbits the star every 242 days. The outer one has the
mass of four of Jupiter's and orbits its star every 3 to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
No theory predicted that so many huge planets would form around
a star, and this will shake up the theory of planet formation,
said the researchers.
