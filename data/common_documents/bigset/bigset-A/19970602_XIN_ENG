<HEADLINE> Italy Beats China Anew in World Volleyball League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- World top-notched Italy fought off
tough challenge to beat China 15-11, 17-15, 15-6 for its second
victory in two days at the World Volleyball League Group B
preliminaries here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China, who lost the first with three indentical 15-6 on
Saturday, once seemed to boast of a different squad overnight by
surging ahead 6-1 through fierce attacks from ace spiker Zhang
Xiang and new face An Jiajie.
</P>
<P>
However, its advatage was evaperated soon when Italy, two-time
world champion and World Cup holder, pulled back for 8-7 with five
consecutive spikes from 26-year-old Andrea Sartoretti.
</P>
<P>
Trailed again at 8-9, the Italians managed for 11-11 before
winning the first set 15-11.
</P>
<P>
The second set featured even more thrilling moments as both
sides exchanged lead six times and the Italians became the hard
nuts by winning two decisive points from 15-15 with two solid
blocks in front of a fervant home crowd.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nationals lost their rhythm in the third set,
succumbing 15-6 to the visitors, who won the world league
champions five times but finished second last year.
</P>
<P>
"The game of tonight is much better than yesterday. They were
good in receiving our serves, and it became difficult for us to
stop them attacking," said Italian head coach Bebeto de Freitas,
who replaced Argentine Julio Velasco early this year to take helm
of the squad.
</P>
<P>
Freitas explained that his disciples spared no efforts and had
done the best when they trailed in the scoreboard. "They had
played very hard from the very beginning, even at the moment we
were in the most difficult situation."
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Wang Jiawei, a former national who led China
to a record fifth berth in the World Cup tournament, said: "I told
our players not to fear in attacks because our rival is the world
champion, we have nothing to lose."
</P>
<P>
Freitas, who had coached his native Brazilian national squad
for 10 years, tigtened his lips on whether he could live up to the
legend Velasco had written since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Under Velasco's guidance, Italy had won almost all the major
titles in international volleyball arena except an Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
"It is a completely different team. The players are very young
and they have a long way to go," Freitas said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Brazilian had a glittering slate during his over
15-year coaching stint. He helped Brazil win second place in both
1982 World Championships in Argentina and 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles, and also led Italy's Palma club to win both the national
championship and European Championships.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the professional league in Italy resulted in
the great success for their men spikers in the past decade. "I
have no doubt that the pro league is the solution, which provides
stiff competiton for the spikers off the international season," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China, who was bracketed in Group B with Italy, Yugoslavia and
Spain, had played both Yugoslavia and Spain twice each on the
road, only to be defeated in all six outings.
</P>
<P>
Teams from 12 countries and regions compete in the World League
in three groups. Each team plays six home-and-away matches through
June 22. The two top teams from each group will advance to the
final round scheduled on June 30 in Moscow.

</P>
<P>
In the other match of the day, Hong Kong's Winling beat Fukien
89-82 after leading 49-43 at half-time.

China led the first half 40-33, but the score was leveled three
times in the second half before the two sides tied at 74-74 after
the 40-minute regular play.
</P>
<P>
China sprang to an initial lead at 81-74, but the Singapore
side made it even at 81-81 when there was only a bit more than one
minute left for the match.
</P>
<P>
Poor form of some of the Chinese players cost them any chance
in the dying minute when the Singapore team scored two more points
in a row to seal their victory.

Tycoon.

<HEADLINE> 4 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in Israeli Air Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Four villagers were wounded when
Israeli fighter-bombers rocketed suspected guerrilla bases in
south Lebanon at the sunset, security sources in south Lebanon
reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets carried out two consecutive rounds of bombing
at targets at Iglim Al-Toffah, a mountain area some 60
kilometers southeast of Beirut, which is often used by Muslim
guerrillas as a springboard to launch attacks on Israeli
forces in south Lebanon's border strip.
</P>
<P>
In the second bombing round, the Israeli warplanes fired
four air-to-surface missiles at vicinities of Majdal Salim,
wounding four villagers.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said that the two civilians seriously
wounded have been hospitalized and the two others were slightly
injured.
</P>
<P>
The air raid was accompanied by violent bombardment of
Israeli artillery at the heights, according to the anonymous
sources.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, announced that they attacked the Israeli outposts of Bir
Kalab and Sojoud with rocket-propelled grenades and machine-guns
at noon today. But no casualties were mentioned in a Hezbollah
statement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters carried out 26 air raids at guerrilla
targets in south Lebanon in May, and Israeli helicopters
launched other four air strikes, according to a statistics
made by the security sources.
</P>
<P>
Four Israeli soldiers, including two officers, were killed and
11 wounded in fightings with Muslim guerrillas on the last
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict last month, bringing the
Israeli casualties in south Lebanon to nine killed and 43 wounded
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Eleven members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
were also wounded in the same month, adding the casualties
of the Israeli client militia to six killed and 33 injured.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese resistance movement, on the other hand, lost
seven guerrillas in the same period, making the number of
its martyrs in this year up to 16.

<HEADLINE> President Mkapa Concludes Visit to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
left here this afternoon for Harare, Zimbabwe after a four-day
state visit to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he said that east Africa will become a
single investment and trade destination whereby the movement of
people, capital and goods will be unrestricted.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian head of state urged Kenyan business community to
do more investments in his country as Tanzania has changed the
environment to make it attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his country has adopted a liberalized market
economy to boost her financial status and privatized her economy
which is in the process of phasing out Ujamaa public investment
strategies.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa who led a trade delegation told Kenyan
businessmen that the east African leaders are not intending to
create a large market for foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
"We want to create a large market primarily for good quality
goods produced within the region by well-managed and
well-distributed industries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa asked the private sectors in the three east African
countries to mobilize their forces to guard the region from being
converted into a dumping ground for cheap foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
The president toured various development projects in Nairobi,
Athi River and Kiambu District, and attended this year's Madaraka
Day celebrations held this morning in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
In a signed article, the daily newspapers Sunday Times today
said that Mkapa's visit and his presence at the Madaraka Day
celebrations signified the excellent relations between Kenya and
Tanzania.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
left here today for the annual summit of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) to begin in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe,
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Lusaka International Airport, Chiluba said that
democracy by the ballot should be encouraged because it helps
leaders rule by the people's decision.
</P>
<P>
He also said that those who want to take power by the gun
should be shown that the democracy by the ballot is better than
through bullets.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new developments in Sierra Leone, he
expressed his hope that the OAU will help restore constitutional
rule in the country, where elected-president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
was overthrown on May 25 in a coup.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the three-day OAU summit must show that the
African continent is serious about democracy by condemning the
coup in Sierra Leone.

JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The African National Congress
(ANC) of South Africa today said it was encouraged by statement
by Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on
possible cooperation between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The ANC gave its unequivocal support to all current efforts
aimed at achieving peace and stability in South Africa, a
statement issued by the ruling party said.
</P>
<P>
The ANC was responding to a report in today's Sunday Times
that Buthelezi had given his stamp of approval to moves to unite
the ANC and IFP, which is representing eight million Zulu tribe
population in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said recognition of the rights of people to support or
belong to political parties of their choice, without hindrance
from traditional authorities or any government bodies, is an
essential element in attaining peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The ANC announced that it would now be left to the structures
and constituencies of the two parties to decide if the IFP peace
efforts would lay the basis for further advancement and
cooperation between them.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) today approved the establishment of the African Women
Committee on Peace.
</P>
<P>
African ministers proposed the formation at their
just-concluded meeting which preceded the OAU's 33rd summit due
to open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said there was need to establish a concrete
mechanism to facilitate the participation of women in the
continent's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Most African countries, in pursuance of the Global Platform
for Action, endorsed during the 1995 International Women's
Conference in Beijing various programs to enhance women's
participation in politics and development.
</P>
<P>
African ministers "recognize the important role and
contribution of women in the promotion of peace," a statement
issued at the meeting of African ministers said.
</P>
<P>
The statement called upon OAU member states and other relevant
organizations to encourage and popularize the culture of peace
and tolerance in all sectors of the African society.
</P>
<P>
The meeting required OAU member states to submit to the OAU
secretariat regular reports on the implementation of the Africa
platform for action in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers entrusted OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed
Salim to convene a pan-African conference of ministers
responsible for women's matters to coordinate women's issues into
the development agenda.

<HEADLINE> Ciller to Become Turkish Prime Minister This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller announced here today that she will become prime minister
before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
This means that the chairwoman of the True Path Party (DYP)
will take over power from Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the Welfare
Party (RP) in the coalition government, one year ahead of schedule
set in a bi-partite agreement.
</P>
<P>
The RP and DYP formed the coalition government in 1996 and
signed the power-sharing protocol which stipulated that Erbakan
would head the government for the first two years and then turn it
over to Ciller for the remaining two years.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the announcement of her early-than-scheduled
premiership at a joint press conference with Necmettin Erbakan,
the incumbent prime minister, after their talks.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan told reporters that his RP and the DYP have agreed on
early elections but the two sides will continue to work out an
exact date.
</P>
<P>
After 11 months in power, the coalition government is now faced
with growing impatience with Erbakan's inclination to inch the
country toward an Islamic entity and his reluctance to curb the
fundamentalist force in the country.
</P>
<P>
The military and opposition regarded Erbakan' policies as a
threat to Turkey's secularism enshrined in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, under the increasing pressure from within here party,
had asked Erbakan to transfer the premiership and agree on early
elections in one year.
</P>
<P>
Some DYP parliamentary deputies dissatisfied with Cillar's
weak attitude toward the senior coalition partner RP, had
threatened to withdraw from the party.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reports Progress in Egypt's Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel reported progress in
today's meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
and Egyptian peace envoy Osama Baz, who is mediating a resumption
of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Netanyahu's office said that at the
meeting some progress had been made toward solving the problems
between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). But
it did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Baz, senior adviser to Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, who is on the second shuttle mission in the past
week, would continue contacts between the two sides, although no
date was set for his next meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Baz returned to the Egyptian capital of Cairo late today after
meeting with Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, the Egyptian envoy said he was not
satisfied with the results of his current mission, but he would
continue his efforts to save the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the Netanyahu-Mubarak summit held in Egypt's Red Sea
resort Sharm el-Sheikh last Tuesday, Israel agreed to grant Egypt
the role of mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian disputes.
</P>
<P>
Baz began his first shuttle mission earlier last week,
meeting separately with Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser
Arafat in an attempt to arrange a three-way summit to break the
ice in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today before meeting with Baz, Netanyahu voiced
cautious optimism about the Egyptian efforts to revive the peace
march.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with four Israeli lawmakers who have
recently met with Arafat, Netanyahu expressed the belief that
Egypt's efforts would achieve the goal of resuming the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
According to Yehud Lankri, who was among the four lawmakers,
Netanyahu at the same time cautioned against the so-called Arafat
attempt to split Israel's public opinion and the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The four lawmakers are reportedly working to arrange a summit
between Netanyahu, Mubarak and Jordanian King Hussein, or
Moroccan King Hassan II. The Moroccan king has so far refused to
meet with Netanyahu since the Israeli leader came to power one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Erekat told Israel Radio that as long as the
Israeli government continues its settlement activities, there is
no hope for the resumption of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"So far the Israeli government insists on continuing
settlement activities, I think the gap between the two sides is
much bigger than others think," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu must stop, must freeze the settlement activities,
if he wants to give the peace process a chance, if he wants to
have negotiations that have meaning and credibility," Erekat
added.

<P>
MOGADISHU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Somali gunmen attacked and
hijacked a World Food Program convoy transporting food aid in
north Mogadishu yesterday afternoon, said a report available here
today.
</P>
<P>
The convoy consisting of three lorries of ground maize and
cooking oil were attacked by unidentified technical vehicles near
the Green Line while crossing to the south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the gunmen on board the battle
wagons had fired warning shots before succeeding to snatch two of
the food aid transporting lorries and moved them into the former
Italian embassy where the militiamen maintain a base in north
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the guards of the convoy did not return
fire and as a result no casualties was caused by the incident.
</P>
<P>
The food aid, which was part of 1,500 tons of food consisting
of lentils, maize-mill and cooking oil provided by the WFP, was
allocated to disabled former military personnel in the Martini
Military Hospital of south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
WFP local staff members in Mogadishu refused to make any
comment about the hijacked food convoy.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Attacks Qatar On Issue of Economic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel today reacted angrily to
the position taken by Qatar regarding the forthcoming Middle
East and North African Economic Summit, according to a report
of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official was quoted by the radio as saying that the
statements by the Qatari foreign minister at the end of the
two-day meeting of the six Gulf Arab foreign ministers in Doha
constituted a sign of what he called "hostile environment which
is not conducive to the regional cooperation."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on Israel's participation in the
November summit, the Qatari foreign minister reportedly replied
that, if there are improvements in the stalemated peace process
and changes of Israeli hardline position, then it will be possible
to extend invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official reacted by saying that, while such
statements are aimed at pressuring Israel, in fact, they serve to
hurt the chances of success of the conference.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the question is not whether eventually
Netanyahu or Israel is invited, but whether there is an
atmosphere conducive to economic cooperation in the Middle East
and North Africa by important businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Oman are two GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) members
to have economic ties with the Jewish state. The other four
members, Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
Bahrain have made no attempt to forge formal links with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel opened its trade office in Doha on May 26, 1996; Qatar
has so far not reciprocated.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is under pressure from other GCC and Arab League
states to break off all economic relations with Israel, under
a resolution of the Arab League foreign ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel hopes that, instead of being canceled, the conference
will be set at ministerial level as was the case in
Cairo last year, rather than inviting heads of government as
at Casablanca in 1994 and Amman in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Appeals for OAU Financial Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Liberia, cash-strapped and
war-torn, today appealed for African and international assistance
to enable it to hold post-civil war elections re-scheduled for
July 9.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Captan, who is here for the
Organization of African Unity's summit, told reporters that
Liberia had secured 60 percent of the required funds for the
elections postponed from May 30.
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to the OAU and international community to
provide some assistance to cover the remaining aspects of the
budget," Captan said.
</P>
<P>
He said part of reason the elections had been postponed was to
allow the participation of hundreds of thousands of refugees
scattered in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"Getting international support for the conduct of elections is
the most important thing at the moment," said Captan.
</P>
<P>
He commended the support his country received from the OAU
since the ethnic fighting flared up in 1989.
</P>
<P>
He said Liberia was among Africa's success stories of
effective conflict resolution by the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The OAU will hold its 33rd summit next week to strengthen,
among other things, its mechanism for conflict prevention,
management and resolution in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Gets Quarter of Supply in 6 Months: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official said that
Iraq has received only a quarter of the food supply bought by the
country under the "oil-for-food" deal, even though it has
completed its limited oil sale.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here today, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh told reporters that since the "oil-for-food" deal came
into force last December, Iraq has received 700,000 tonnes of
food, 28 percent of a total of 2.4 million tonnes to be bought by
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that up till now, no Iraqis have received all the
basket supply under the present ration system, which includes a
monthly amount of 9 kilograms of wheat flour, 2.5 kilograms of
rice, a kilogram of sugar and a small amount of other daily
necessities.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi trade minister also complained of the discontinuity
of the delivery of food to Iraq. He held the U.S. responsible for
this situation.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a spokesman of the Iraqi Trade Ministry said that
the amount of food distribution to the Iraqis will have to be
reduced next month because the U.S. representative in the
U.N. sanctions committee had canceled several contracts for rice
provision signed by Iraq with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Saleh stressed that in the past six months, about 30,000 Iraqi
children died as a result of delayed delivery of supplies to Iraq,
medicine and medical instruments in particular.
</P>
<P>
"Medicine should have arrived in Iraq to save the lives of
these children, they are the victims of the ill-policy against
Iraq adopted by the U.S. government," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister claimed that there is what he termed as
discrimination in approving the contracts signed by Iraq and
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Some contracts for food and medicine have been approved, but
other similar contracts have been canceled, said Saleh, calling
the "oil-for-food" deal a "political program rather than a
humanitarian one."
</P>
<P>
When asked by Xinhua about how Iraq will respond if the
U.N. puts forward a proposal to extend the deal for another six
months, Saleh said what Iraq wants is to normalize its oil export
and to have the sanctions lifted without any delay.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fact is neither the U.N. has raised such a
proposal nor the Iraqi government has asked for extension.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is
expected to put forward a proposal whether the deal will be
extended or not.
</P>
<P>
Iraq declared on Friday that it has completed selling 120
million barrels of oil, the total amount sanctioned for sale in
accordance with the "oil-for-food" deal.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which will expire June 9, allows Iraq to sell 1
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to buy food,
medicine and other goods urgently needed in the country hit by
stringent sanctions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Wang Jiawei Depicts Patriotism with Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- To many Chinese, the name of Wang
Jiawei is closely linked to patriotism.
</P>
<P>
As an ace spiker, he paced the Chinese national team to an
epoch-making fifth spot in the World Cup in 1981, which earned him
a nickname of "Airman of the net."
</P>
<P>
By giving up his scholarship in Japan, he backed home without
hesitation in 1986, helping China retain the title at Seoul Asian
Games with a broken finger.
</P>
<P>
And again when the national squad downgraded to a record low,
he hesitated nothing to put aside envious pay in Japan, coming
back to shoulder the task of head coach in April.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after taking the helm, he realized the real gap
between China and the world's first-class teams. The newly-formed
team lost six consecutive matches in the World League Group B
preiminaries, twice each to Spain, Yugoslavia and Italy.
</P>
<P>
But Wang was confident. "Let's do it step by step. We had
learned a lot from the losses."
</P>
<P>
In their sixth game against world top-ranked Italy in Beijing
on Sunday, the Chinese spikers staged tenacious challenge to the
visitors, only dropping the home game 15-12, 15-15, 15-6 after the
thrilling first two sets.
</P>
<P>
The surprising performance arouse a great hope of renaissance
of China's volleyball in the minds of the enthusiastic fans across
the country.
</P>
<P>
However, it needed courage to face the challenge as a head
coach since China never won an Asian title after 1990. Everyone
bears the fear of spoiling his coaching career if he fails to
bring the national team out of the shadow.
</P>
<P>
Only Wang keeps his firm determination to swim agaisnt the tide.
</P>
<P>
Behind all this, it was scrafice, earnest love for the country,
and responsiblity for the volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
"It has long been my dream to become head coach. Now I finally
have the opportunity to do something for the motherland," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
Wang revealed that he cherishes a three-sponged project -- to
reclaimed the title at the Asian championships in September, and
to make breakthroughs in Asian Games and World Championships next
year.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, Wang believes, every player under his
charge firstly must be clear that everything they do is done for
the country.
</P>
<P>
Before the team left for Spain for the World League tournament,
he led the players to Tiananmen Square, watching the
national-flag-raising ceremony at dawn.
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism is not a blank word. It should be shown in concrete
action," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In March 20, 1981, the Chinese team, spearheaded by Wang, made
a storming surge in the World Cup preliminaries in Hong Kong, won
three consecutive sets from two sets down and ensured a World Cup
berth.
</P>
<P>
Students in Beijing University, excited after watching the
thriller on TV, took to the streets by thousands and put forward
the best-known slogan "United to rejuvenate China," which has been
encouraging the Chinese people especially the youths.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years later, some 500 students from Beijing University
paid the homage to the game on Sunday by taking half an hour on
bus. A thunderous cheer was occasionally echoed overhead at the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
"The slogan has been carved in a stele in our campus. It has
become a motto of students in Beijing University, " said Wu Lijun,
a chemistry postgraduate. "They gave a boost to a whole generation
one decade ago. Now we should give them cheers when they are in an
all-time low."
</P>
<P>
Recalling the legend 16 years ago, Wang said:"I think it should
be still useful to all the Chinese people after such a long time."
</P>
<P>
Italy's coach Bebeto de Freitas, who knew Wang in the early
1980s, also expressed great admiration for his counterpart.
</P>
<P>
"He is determined to contribute for China's volleyball. It's
not a measure of money, It needs passion."
</P>
<P>
Freitas, who described Wang as one of the best players he had
seen in his life, cherished the belief that Wang will make great
changes to China's volleyball. "Not only the players, but the
whole China will take him as an example," the Brazlian said.
</P>
<P>
Some people, who were eager but found no way to go aboard for
gold rush, were bemused by Wang's act to return home.
</P>
<P>
"This is my only dream," he said. "I love men's volleyball team
of China, I should do something for it. That's my responsibility,"
Wang explained.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Hold Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the two parties in
Turkey's coalition government said here today that they had agreed
to hold early elections but failed to fix the exact date.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a joint press conference by Welfare Party
(RP) Chairman and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, and True Path
Party (DYP) leader and Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
The two partner parties in the government will continue to
jointly work out a date for the early elections, Erbakan said
after his 45-minute-long talks with Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said the exact date for the early elections will be
announced within the first two weeks of this months and a report
will be submitted to the Turkish parliament for approval as soon
as possible, said Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Cillar announced that she will take over the
premiership from Erbakan in the second half of this month, a year
ahead of the schedule set in a power-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
The RP and DYP signed the bi-partite protocol in June 1996 which
stipulated that Erbakan would head the government for the first
two years and then turn it over to Ciller for the remaining two
years.
</P>
<P>
After 11 months in power, the coalition government is now
faced with growing impatience with Erbakan's Islamic tendency,
regarded by the military and opposition as a serious threat to
Turkey's secularism enshrined in its constitution.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Plays Pivotal Role in Peace Process, US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. diplomat to Egypt
reiterated today Egypt's role is pivotal in pushing forward the
Mideast peace process and in removing obstacles facing peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Mohammed Abdullah, head of the
People's Assembly External Relations Committee, the U.S.
Ambassador to Cairo Edward Walker said the enormous efforts
exerted by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak are highly respected
and appreciated by the U.S. and global public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt plays a pivotal role in accelerating the Mideast peace
process," the Egyptian Middle East news agency (MENA) quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Abdullah urged the U.S., co-sponsor of the peace
process, to play a mightier role to restart the peace talks that
became stalled when Israel began building a new Jewish settlement
in Har Homa of Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
"People of the region expect the U.S. to salvage the peace
process as the main sponsor of peace and the only one capable of
influencing Israel to abide by the terms of reference of the
peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross made two shuttle trips to the region
last month, but failed to bridge the gap between the Palestinian
and Israeli sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accused Ross of pro-Israeli bias and called
for higher-level U.S. intervention. But Washington was not
responsive.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last weekend
that it was up to the two parties to show the political will to
end the impasse themselves.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Jordan and Egypt both affirmed the importance of
the U.S. role in the peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Intensive Egyptian diplomatic efforts to revive the deadlocked
Mideast peace process climaxed last Tuesday when Hosni Mubarak
met with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian envoy Osama el-Baz went to Israel today to continue
talks with Netanyahu at the beginning of another shuttle tour
mediating between Israelis and Palestinians in a bid to bring
them back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Baz, political advisor to the Egyptian president, is expected
to meet later today with head of the Palestinian negotiating team
Saeb Erekat. He has been shuttling between the two sides since
Tuesday's summit.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Parties Against Foreign Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean political parties
have urged foreign countries to stay away and let the country
settle its own problems arising from the May 25 military coup, a
report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's All Political Parties Association (APPA), in a
broadcast message on Saturday, said "Sierra Leone must be left
alone to resolve the present internal political crisis".
</P>
<P>
The message signed by APPA's Secretary-General Victor Foh
"condemns attempts by foreign countries to interfere in the
internal affairs of Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
The APPA is an umbrella organization of Sierra Leone's 12
political parties, including the Sierra Leonean People's Party of
ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Its message comes amid wild speculations of imminent
intervention by countries in the west African sub-region, which
insist on restoring the government of elected president Kabbah,
in case of failed peaceful resolution through diplomatic
channels.
</P>
<P>
The APPA message applauded "the current peace overtures put in
place by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council", which was set
up by Major Paul Jonny Koromah after the coup as the highest
ruling body.
</P>
<P>
The parties also urged the defense forces to observe the law
and co-operate with the Sierra Leonean forces, the police, the
AFRC and the rebel Revolutionary United Front in pursuit of
peace, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Left Victory in France Changes Europe's Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The victory of French left parties in
the legislative elections has changed the political scenery of
Europe overnight and will alter more or less the agenda of
European integration made by President Jacques Chirac and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.
</P>
<P>
After the British Labor Party won the general election on May
1, the French Socialist Party, a "sister party" of the British
Labor, carried off the legislative elections called one year
earlier by President Chirac in a gamble to win a new center-right
majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party and other leftwing parties have won 333
seats in the 577-seat French National Assembly after two rounds of
voting, according to primary estimations by French media
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's gamble thus turned out to be a disastrous
miscalculation and backfired by imposing a left government upon
himself, forcing him to cohabit, or share power with his political
opponents at a time deemed decisive for the launching of the
European single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
Socialist chief Lionel Jospin, who will be the next prime
minister of France, will surely overhaul many of the austerity
socio-economic plans adopted by Alain Juppe, the prime minister
until today, which were aimed at cutting public spending to meet
the criteria of the Maastricht treaty to qualify for the euro.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party promises to create 700,000 jobs, half of
them in state enterprises, cut work week from 39 hours to 35 hours
without reducing salary, and stop the privatization process of
some state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if the next leftwing government is joined by the
Communist Party, which completely rejects the Maastricht treaty
and opposes privatization, more unpopular policies of the former
government are likely to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
According to primary estimations, the Socialist Party alone can
form a parliamentary majority and establish a leftwing government
with some smaller moderate leftwing parties.
</P>
<P>
Although the Socialist Party does not oppose the European
single currency, it is against the policy of attaining budgetary
criteria for joining the euro at heavy social costs as was adopted
by the former government.
</P>
<P>
As unemployment stays at 12.8 percent and social discontent
remains high, the French voters have revolted against the policy
of Prime Minister Alain Juppe over the past two years and urged a
radical change of policy, which is promised by the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
The left victory in France has also coincided with the rise of
doubt in Germany over the capability of the government to launch
the euro, as the German leftwing parties are also expected to
challenge the ruling majority of Chancellor Kohl in next year's
general election.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Germany Social-Democratic Party Oskar Lafontaine
jointly issued a declaration last week with French Socialist
leader Jospin calling for the inclusion of a social clause in the
Maastricht treaty.
</P>
<P>
The gesture indicates that the leftist forces of continental
Europe are not content with the American-style free market theory
and want to keep the social tradition of the old continent built
over the past century.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Troops Leave for Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- An unspecific number of Ghanaian
soldiers left Accra, capital of Ghana, this morning for Sierra
Leone to help evacuate some 1,000 Ghanaians from the troubled
country in the wake of last Sunday's coup.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the Ghanaian continent will also be involved
in the negotiations for a political settlement of the crisis in
Sierra Leone, the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) reported.
</P>
<P>
After that, the Ghanaian soldiers may be deployed to help
stabilize the situation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, Ghana's Deputy
Foreign Minister Victor Gbeho has been recalled from Harare,
Zimbabwe, where he was attending the current summit of the
Organization of African Unity, to join the negotiation team of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The NTA reported that although the work of the team has been
95 percent completed, the possibility of military intervention
can not be ruled out as Major Johnny Koroma has declared himself
chairman of the current ruling council.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said that Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings has
cancelled his trip to Harare for the OAU summit in order to
monitor the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the coup that overthrew Sierra Leone's elected
government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah closed the
country's borders on Thursday night after the accelerated efforts
of some Western countries to evacuate their nationals.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. helicopters are reported to come back to the capital
Freetown today for evacuating more expatriates in a hotel guarded
by soldiers of the ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The reports estimated there are about 3,000 ECOMOG soldiers in
Freetown ready for a possible military intervention for restoring
Kabbah's government.

<HEADLINE> Serial Israeli Air Raids Kill Lebanese Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- One civilian was killed and four
others wounded in a series of air strikes launched by Israeli
fighter-bombers in south Lebanon this evening, the state-run
Lebanon Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets carried out the first air raid at 4:30 p.m.
(1330 GMT) at suspected guerrilla targets on the hill of Telal
Mlita on the heights of Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of
Apple, some 60 kilometers southeast of Beirut, the radio reported.

Two Israeli warplanes flew back and launched the second raid
on the vicinities of Majdal Salim at 5:45 p.m. (1445 GMT).

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright today held talks with Bosnian leaders, pushing them to
comply with the Washington-brokered Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Albright met the three members of the Bosnian presidency,
Muslim chairman Alija Izetbegovic, Serb member Momocilo Krajsnik
and Croat member Kresimir Zubak, shortly after she arrived in
Sarajevo for a one-day visit to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the meeting, the Permanent Committee for Bosnian
Military Matters, which consists of officers from all three ethnic
armies, was set up, according Bosnian Foreign Minister Jadranko
Prilic.
</P>
<P>
Prilic said that the committee would deal with state security
and the implementation of arms reduction provisions of the Dayton
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Sarajevo, Albright said that
Washington would condition its assistance on their compliance with
the Dayton accords, especially on those of returning refugees and
building common institutions.
</P>
<P>
If Bosnian authorities failed to act on U.S. demands "to knit
the multi-ethnic society together, then there will not be American
assistance," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the hanging around of the persons accused by
an international court as war criminals was "the major roadblock"
to the Bosnian peace process, but gave no clear indication as how
Washington is going to remove it.
</P>
<P>
Albright later flew to Brcko, a town in the Serb entity, to
attend a re-opening ceremony of a bridge there which connects

<HEADLINE> Seagate Wuxi's New Facility to Start Production Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An executive officer of the
Singapore-based regional office of the Seagate Technology, Inc.
said here today that the company's new facility in Wuxi, east
China, may start production at the end of this month after new
investment has been put into the firm.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Lui, Seagate Technology Inc.'s vice-president and
managing director of manufacturing in China, also said he predicts
no change in Seagate's operation in China after Hong Kong's
handover, which is less than a month away.
</P>
<P>
The new building next to the existing facility in the
Wuxi-Singapore Industrial Park represents an investment of 32
million U.S. dollars for equipment and renovation.
</P>
<P>
The disc manufacturing currently in the existing Wuxi facility
will then be moved into the new building.
</P>
<P>
The original facility will start producing E-blocks -- a main
component of disc drives -- in July, with a full daily capacity of
25,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Seagate Technology Shenzhen, Seagate's other facility in China,
has up to now produced 10 million disc drives.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen facility took four years to ship its five million
drives and only 10 months to ship another five million. "This is
a clear reflection of the progress that has been made at the
facility in both process and productivity," said Lui.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen facility's main products are 1.2 Gbyte, 1.7 Gbyte
and 2.1 Gbyte disc drives designed for desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
Seagate Shenzhen, set up in 1992, has won several awards from
China's central and local governments and various departments.
</P>
<P>
Lui said he is not worried that Hong Kong's handover could
cause any impact on his company's business in China. "We've
increased our investment in Wuxi and our operation in Shenzhen
continues to run quite smoothly. I don't see any impact on our
business by the handover," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In my personal view, things will even be better. I don't see
you'll be in any risk going into China on the expansion of
investment," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Seagate Technology, Inc, based in the Scotts Valley, California
of the United States, is a leading data technology company
providing products for storing, managing and accessing digital
information.

cities between China and Russia, where representatives from the

for the Chinese nation. The day of July 1 bears great significance
for Chinese people living in Hong Kong," Tung said at the start of
the interview with six local radios and televisions.
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Hong Kong people will no longer be the Chinese
residents under British colonial rule, but dignified Chinese
people, said the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
"After the handover, Hong Kong will be closely related with the
inland areas not only in terms of economic links, but also in
terms of culture and ties of blood. We and the inland compatriots
share the same origin," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Judging by his contact with China's leaders, Tung believed that
the Chinese government is determined to fully implement the
principle of "one country, two systems", so as to maintain the
continued prosperity of Hong Kong after the handover.
</P>
<P>
He cited the latest opinion poll, which showed that more than
80 percent of Hong Kong citizens were optimistic about the future
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As a further evidence, a recent survey conducted by the three
largest foreign chambers of commerce in Hong Kong -- Japanese,
American and British chambers -- showed that 90 percent of their
members saw a rosy picture of the investment environment in Hong
Kong over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Having been elected as the HKSAR's first Chief Executive for
more than five months, Tung reviewed his work in preparation for
the establishment of the first HKSAR government, mainly the
formation of the executive, legislative and judicial
administration.
</P>
<P>
Tung also touched on the livelihood issues Hong Kong residents
are concerned with, such as housing, education and welfare for the
 elderly. He promised to announce specific policies as soon as
possible after he assumes office.

<HEADLINE> Homicides Plunge in New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- New York City, the largest city of
the United States, has been listed as the the most safe city among
big cities with over 1 million population in this country as the
city saw homicides plunged 14 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The city recorded the number of homicides dropping to 966 in
1996 from 1,177 in 1995, according to figures released Sunday by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the city recorded fewer than 1,000
killings in the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
Homicide is considered the most accurately measured crime in
this country, and also the one that Americans fear most.
</P>
<P>
And the percentage of murder cases cleared by the New York City
Police Department last year was higher than it had been in
decades. The figure is in stark contrast to the national trend,
which has seen clearance rates plummet over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
A series of factors that contributed to the sharp decrease in
murder cases in New York include innovative police tactics,
tougher Federal gun control laws, a stabilization of the drug
trade and the aging of the baby boom population which has passed
out of its prime years for committing crime.

<HEADLINE> Gains in US Income, Spending Slow in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The personal income growth in
the U.S. slowed sharply in April, a further indication that the
U.S. economy is decelerating from its quick pace at the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department reported today that the personal
income rose just 0.1 percent in April, the smallest increase since
last October.
</P>
<P>
The small increase also resulted in a slow consumer spending
increase. The consumer spending edged up only by 0.1 percent in
April, the smallest since last September.
</P>
<P>
The 0.1 percent rise in incomes followed much bigger gains of
0.6 percent in March, 0.8 percent in February, 0.4 percent in
January and 0.7 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Private wages and salaries, which had been rising at an annual
rate of 26 billion dollars in March, decreased by 4.2 billion in
April, reflecting a drop in average weekly hours worked and
average hourly earnings.
</P>
<P>
The personal savings as a percentage of disposable income held
steady at 5.1 percent in the month, the same as in March.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 0.1 percent increase in spending in
April followed a revised 0.2 percent spending increase in March.
The small March advance represented a sharp downward revision from
an original estimate of 0.5 percent, indicating purchases were not
nearly as strong as first believed.
</P>
<P>
Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the U.S.
economy, changes in this area are closely watched for signals they
give about the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 5.8 percent in the
first three months of this year, the fastest clip in nearly a
decade, according to a U.S. government report released late last
month.

JINAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- On June 1, International Children's

dollars to help set up the 1,500-sq. m. building that can be used
for more than 600 pupils.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Sees No Threat from Left Victory in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said today he did not see the victory of the French left in
Sunday's general election as a threat to European Monetary Union
or EU reform.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that France will still hold on to its constructive
European policy even after the government change," Kinkel was
quoted as saying Monday in Luxembourg by the German media.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the new French government would stick to the
timetable of EU reform and the launch of the European single
currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new prime minister Lionel Jospin had
repeatedly stated his support for the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The EU's target launch for the Euro is January 1, 1999. But
scepticism is growing over whether the deadline can be met as few
members have been able to fulfill the criteria set out in the
Maastricht Treaty governing European Union integration.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was negotiated under the co-leadership of the late
French Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, Kinkel said. "I
have not the slightest doubt about France's loyalty to the
treaty," he added.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Luxembourg for an EU foreign ministerial
meeting, Kinkel told reporters in Bonn that France and Germany
would remain each other's most important partner even after the
government change in Paris.
</P>
<P>
However, the victory of France's left wing parties over the
governing center-right coalition has sent an encouraging signal to
German left-wing parties which are expected to challenge the
center-right ruling coalition of Chancellor Helmut Kohl in next
year's general election.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the German Social Democratic Party Oskar
Lafontaine sent his congratulations to the French Socialists
immediately after the outcome of the election became clear on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
He said, "This is a great success for the future of France and
Europe." It linked people's hopes for a reduction in unemployment
and greater social justice.
</P>
<P>
Germany's left-wing Green Party said, "The outcome of the
elections in France and Britain have shown that the Left in Europe
has become a powerful factor once again."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Artist and Calligrapher Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Xie Zhiliu, a famous Chinese
artist and master of calligraphy, as well as aesthetic theorist,
passed away here yesterday at the age of 87.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950's, Xie was in charge of collecting and
appraising calligraphy and artworks at the Shanghai Museum, and
thanks to his great effort, the museum now has a collection of
tens of thousands of artworks.
</P>
<P>
China set up an appraisal group for classical calligraphy and
paintings in 1982, with Xie as its head. Eight years from then
on, Xie Zhiliu and his colleagues visited all museums, libraries
and archaeological sites in China and made a clear order of those
rare works. They also edited the "Catalogue of China's Classical
Calligraphy and Painting".
</P>
<P>
Xie also contributed greatly to research at the Dunhuang
Grottoes in northwest China's Gansu province, where there are many
Buddhist statues, frescoes, and valuable manuscripts dating back to
366 A.D. His "Record of the Dunhuang Grottoes" and "Picture
Catalogue of Dunhuang Arts" are among the most authorative works
on Dunhuang research.

<HEADLINE> Eastern German Wages Still Lag Western Counterparts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Average monthly wages in eastern
Germany rose twice as fast as those in western Germany last year,
but east Germans still earn only about three quarters of their
western counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The monthly income of employees in eastern Germany in 1996
reached 72.5 percent of those in the west, compared with only 70.5
percent in 1995, the German federal statistics office said today.
</P>
<P>
However, with output per worker still half that in western
Germany, the rise in income has been blamed as the main reason for
the lack of competitiveness of the east German economy.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly income of a western German employee
increased from 4,914 German marks (2,900 U.S. dollars) in 1995 to
5,035 marks (2,980 dollars) in 1996, up more than 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Germany, wages rose from 3,466 marks (2,050 dollars)
to 3,651 marks (2,160 dollars), up over 5.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Go to Polls Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Canadian voters head to polls today
to decide who will lead them into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The general election comes after a five-week campaign, during
which Canadians showed little enthusiasm for the political
debates, handshakes and promises.
</P>
<P>
Though the nation's unemployment problem was rated by Canadians
as the number one issue, most of the campaign has been about
national unity.
</P>
<P>
The political debates are mostly about what strategy should be
adopted to deal with separatists and who should lead the
federalists into the next referendum.
</P>
<P>
There are about 19 million registered voters in Canada, many of
whom have indicated that they would not come out to vote.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, the ruling Liberal Party is widely expected
to win in the 301-seat parliament and form a majority government.
</P>
<P>
In the last general election, the Liberals won 177 seats out of
a total of 295.
</P>
<P>
The separatist Bloc Quebecois won 54 seats and became the
official opposition in the parliament. The Reform Party got 52
seats, the New Democratic Party nine and the Progressive
Conservative two.
</P>
<P>
This time, the right-wing Reform Party appears to have
fortified its position and is expected to displace the Bloc
Quebecois as the official opposition, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The polls open at 9:30 a.m. (local time) and close at 9:30
p.m. The final results of the election aren't expected to come out
until about 11 p.m.

impact of basic research on economic and social development and
should give more support for basic research.
</P>
<P>
He said that the initiative of young scientists and middle-aged
and senior scientists should be aroused fully and that research
centers should be improved to create better conditions and a
better academic environment.
</P>
<P>
Also, international exchanges and cooperation should be
increased to provide more opportunities for high-level personnel
in an international scientific environment.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the new research center is basic scientific
research, and "Cultivating creative scientific personnel for the
21st Century and the world, and increasing international academic

</P>
<P>
The report attributed the losses to last winter's heavy snow
falls. The five provinces of Bayan-Olgii, Govi-Altai, Suhebaatar,
Dornovovi and Hovd, which were hit hardest by the bad weather,
accounted for two thirds of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Another report said today that up to the end of May, a 98
percent survival rate for newborn animals had led to 6.8 million
new additions to the country's livestock herd.
</P>
<P>
Animal husbandry is Mongolia's single most important
agricultural sector. In 1996, the country boasted a record 29.3
million livestock animals.

<HEADLINE> AL Condemns Continued Turkish Incursion Into Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today strongly
condemned continued Turkish military incursion into northern Iraq
and called for an immediate troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based organization in a statement issued today
expressed its deep concern over the latest developments resulting
from the "wide-scale Turkish military incursion into the depth of
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Ankara should withdraw its troops immediately from these
territories and refrain from such breaches of the Iraqi lands and
the sovereignty of the state of Iraq," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Backed by air bombing and artillery fire, about 25,000 to
50,000 Turkish troops have pushed across the border into northern
Iraq, assaulting rebels of Turkey's separatists of the Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) since mid-May.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of this aggression adversely impacts on the
historical ties of friendship and cooperation between the Arab
countries and Turkey," it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a report sent to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry,
Turkish Ambassador here Yacar Yakic defended the joint
Turkish-Israeli military exercises and Ankara's military actions
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister for Arab Affairs Sayed Abu
Zeid, who received the memorandum, reaffirmed Egypt's position on
the two issues.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has criticized the Turkish military incursion into Iraq
and demanded an explanation for its planned massive military
drills with Israel in the Mediterranean this summer, which is
reportedly targeted at Israel's arch foes, Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey today termed Arab reactions to Ankara's
military operations in northern Iraq as "unjustifiable."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that Arab
countries had to understand what he termed as "Turkish fears"
emanating from the terrorist activities perpetrated by the PKK
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has declared, from the start, its respect of Iraq's
territorial integrity and its forces will be withdrawn
immediately after terrorism is wiped out in the region," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Plans to Improve Technology in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has a plan
to improve the skill and technology used in the country's vast and
often poverty-stricken rural areas, officials here said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's ninth development plan, to be introduced later
this year, has the objective of gradually encouraging and
developing the existing technologies in rural areas, according to
officials of the Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
New achievements in science and technology will be extended to
the rural people to improve the productivity of the agricultural
sector, they told a national seminar on technology development
held here today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, while opening the
seminar, said that scientific research in Nepal must define its
objectives in terms of usefulness to common people under the
economic principles of benefit and cost.
</P>
<P>
Chand, who is also minister of science and technology, called
on local scientists and researchers to come up with
recommendations that could serve as guidelines to define the
country's goals and strategies in the science and technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates show that Nepal currently spends only 0.1
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on science and technology,
far less than the average of nearly 1 percent among developing
countries in the world.

<HEADLINE> Study to Trace Cargo Movements Between Hong Kong and Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will carry out a study
to trace the fast growing cargo movements between this port city
and ports in the Pearl River Delta in southern China.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on river trade cargo handling activities in 1997, the
study would serve as the basis for future planning of port
facilities in Hong Kong, according to an official of the Hong Kong
Port Development Board (PDB).
</P>
<P>
The PDB earmarked more than two million HK dollars (256,000
U.S. dollars) for the study, which will be undertaken by Survey
Research Hongkong Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Richard Yuen, secretary of the Port Development Board, said
today: "Hong Kong is experiencing a rapid growth in river trade,
and the Pearl river is a natural highway between Hong Kong and
many manufacturing centers in southern China."
</P>
<P>
He noted that river trade throughput grew by some 27 percent to
1.7 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) last year. The
figure is forecast to rise to 2.4 million TEUs by 1998 and to 3.7
million by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, regular monitoring of river cargo performance was
essential to devising development plans for port facilities, said
Yuen. The study is expected to be completed in mid-1998.

<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, meeting with
Ho Tien Nghi, Director General of the Viet Nam News Agency, said
that he hopes that the two countries would continue their efforts
to raise the relations between the two parties and two countries
to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee, said that China and Viet Nam are joined
by common mountains and rivers, and the friendship between the
people of the two countries goes back to ancient times.

China and Viet Nam have the same social system and the
conditions of the two countries are similar, both adhere to
socialist road and the leadership of the Communist party, and
adhere to taking economic construction as the central task, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that further consolidate and develop the
existing friendship and co-operation between the two countries not
only accords with the fundamental interests of the two countries,
but also is conducive to peace, stability, and development in the
Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The news agencies of the two countries have established close
links and have had good cooperation in recent years, Jiang noted,
adding that this has served as a bridge for enhancing mutual
understanding and promoting the overall, stable development of
the good-neighborly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed the visitors on Hong Kong's return to the
motherland and China's economic construction.

has witnessed that the Chinese people have adhered to the reforms
and opening-up amd have achieved tremendous successes in politics,
economy, and culture under the leadership of Chinese Communist
Party.

<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng Sunday
spoke highly of the remarkable efforts made by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) to the national independence and political
liberation of Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory message to the OAU's 33rd annual session
which opened today in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, Li described
the OAU as a regional organization drawing great attention from
the international community.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, the OAU has made gratifying achievements in
maintaining regional stability and promoting economic cooperation,
actively dedicated itself to upholding the rightful interests of
Africa and developing countries and made unremitting efforts in
promoting the establishment of a new international political and
economic order at an early date," Li said in the message.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the concerted efforts of African countries, the
political situation in Africa has, on the whole, moved toward
relaxation, the premier added.

He said that he hopes African countries would further
strengthen solidarity and cooperation and score greater successes
in the process of seeking stability and development.

HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Kofi Annan, U.N.Secretary General,
today pledged continued U.N.support for African countries, saying
joint efforts should be intensified for peace and development in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Annan, addressing the opening session of the 33rd summit of
African countries here, said that the U.N. will continue its
long-standing efforts to help Africa create an enabling
environment for economic growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to assist your efforts to devise new
investment strategies and trade barriers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that following political independence and the end
of apartheid, Africa is experiencing "the third wave".
</P>
<P>
"Let us make this third wave one of lasting peace on
democracy, human rights, and sustainable development," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
He put forward the following proposals to "unleash Africa's
third wave in full force":
</P>
<P>
-- Embrace the primacy of democratic rule, the inviolability
of human rights, and the imperatives of sustainable development;
</P>
<P>
-- Governmental authority be based on the will of the people;
</P>
<P>
-- Restore the constitutional order in countries where
"democracy has been usurped"; and
</P>
<P>
-- Put an end to conflicts which have disfigured the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Annan condemned coups against elected governments, and the
illegal seizure of power by military cliques. He urged
neighboring states, regional groupings, and the international
community to "ostracize and isolate putschists."
</P>
<P>
"Verbal condemnation, though necessary and desirable, is not
sufficient," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us work together, and with the United Nations to develop
good governance and respect for the rule of law," he said. "When
we succeed, Africa will have taken a great step forward."

<HEADLINE> Romania, Ukraine Sign Friendship Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu and his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma today
signed a historic friendship treaty.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said that the treaty ensures peace, cooperation
and stability to the peoples of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said the signing of the treaty was a major step in
strengthening relations between Ukraine and Romania. It was a sign
that their relationship had entered a new era of partnership.
</P>
<P>
Under the 10-year pact, signed in the Black Sea resort of
Neptun, Romania and Ukraine recognize the present delineation of
their common border and the integrity of each other's territories,
thus formalizing the attribution to Kiev of territory ceded to the
Soviet Union under a 1939 secret Nazi-Soviet pact.
</P>
<P>
The infamous pact between Nazi Germany's foreign minister
Joachim von Ribbentrop and his Soviet counterpart Vyacheslav
Molotov led to the carving up of Poland and allowed Moscow to
acquire Romania's northern Bukovina and the territory then known
as Bessarabia.
</P>
<P>
During negotiations for the friendship treaty, Romania insisted
the secret accord be condemned in the text, but Ukraine refused.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Romanian government said that it was ready to
make concessions in order to promote regional stability and to
support its application for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Romania wanted the treaty to be concluded before the Madrid
NATO summit on July 8-9 which will name the first eastern
European countries to be invited into the Western military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Romania hopes to be among the first wave of countries to join
NATO.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two countries also signed a
document today on the outstanding issues, which include the
demarcation of the Black Sea continental shelf and the
determination of the status of Snake Island.
</P>
<P>
The document is included in the treaty as an appendix.
</P>
<P>
Romania's media said that the two sides will forward these
issues to the International Court of Justice in the Hague,
Netherlands, for arbitration if they are not sorted out
bilaterally.

<HEADLINE> Syria Opposes Regional Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam said today that Syria is opposed to the convocation of the
fourth Middle East and North African (MENA) Economic Summit when
Israel is still obstructing the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It is meaningless to hold such a meeting when the Israeli
policy is posing serious obstacles to the peace process," said Syrian
after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara arrived for a
few-hour visit here this morning, carrying a message from
President Hafez Al-Assad to Mubarak, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The annual MENA conference, to be held this year in Doha,
Qatar, has been regarded as a direct spin-off of the progress in
the Mideast peace process since the early 1990s and a way to
expand regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Syria, an important partner in the Mideast peace process, began
negotiations with Israel in 1991. But the sporadic talks broke off
last February after a spate of suicide bomb attacks in Israel
blamed on Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Israeli ties have further deteriorated since the
Israeli Likud assumed power last June, culminating in a
two-month-old crisis over a new Jewish settlement Israel began to
build in March in disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian Vice President said that regarding the recent
developments in the region, Arab countries should pool their
efforts in building an Arab community that is open to
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Egypt will work for the establishment of the common
Arab market, Khaddam added.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said he also discussed with Mubarak the Turkish
incursion into northern Iraq, Israeli-Turkish military agreement
and the Israeli "recalcitrant stances" in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Egypt have been in close coordination in restarting
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks that have been frozen for over one
year.
</P>
<P>
Syria refused to return to the negotiating table with the
Israeli government unless it first agrees to pull out of the Golan
Heights, captured by the Jewish state in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejects the demand,
saying that the strategic plateau is vital to Israel. But his
predecessors, Labor Party leaders reportedly verbally accepted an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for normalized ties
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria favors a pan-Arab summit to make resolute decisions to
confront the Israeli settlement practice, which has led to the
stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace track since two months
ago, but Egypt said such a move is premature.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first country to make peace with the Jewish state,
has been one of the key mediators in the peace process.

4.2 U.S. dollars) per kilogram. If the price falls below that
level, their salmon exports into the EU will automatically incur
import duties.
</P>
<P>
The deal follows an investigation which found that Norwegian
salmon was being dumped onto the EU market between 1995 and 1996,
harming the interests of salmon farmers of several EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The measures also included stand-by dumping duties, export
volume limits, an increased Norwegian export tax and tight
surveillance procedures.

<HEADLINE> OAU Summit Opens With Maintenance of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The 33rd ordinary conference of
heads of state and government of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) opened here today with the topic of maintenance of
peace and economic development stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert G. Mugabe in his official address
stressed that economic development needs maintenance of peace.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "Economic questions have now clearly come to the
fore. To solve them, however, we need a correct political
environment on the continent. Perhaps the most urgent issue
facing Africa today is the vital question of peace in a number of
our countries, for peace is such a fundamental pre-condition for
the enjoyment of all other rights by our citizens."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that without peace "every other aspiration is
stunted, circumvented, curtailed and even denied. It is
therefore, proper and indeed imperative that both our
organization and individual countries give top priority to the
establishment of maintenance of peace through our mechanism for
the resolution of conflicts".
</P>
<P>
Referring to economy in the continent, Mugabe said, "A
fundamental need in Africa is to ensure sustained economic growth
and development in order to adequately cater for the needs of our
burgeoning population and enhance the quality of life of our
people."
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Mugabe said, "Our aim, as goverrnments, is
to ensure that there is peace and tranquility in our countries."
</P>
<P>
About 30 heads of state and government attended today's
session of the OAU Summit. Other leaders of OAU member states are
represented by their foreign ministers or other high ranking
officials.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and Officials of
other UN bodies, as well as the diplomatic corps here were

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Good Use of Research Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said today
that how to turn research findings into practical productive
forces is a major task for China in its effort to create a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark in a meeting with 70 Chinese and overseas
scientists who are in Beijing for the inaugural ceremony of the
Higher Research Center of Qinghua University and a symposium on
the Prospects of Basic Science for the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China scored considerable achievements in
scientific and technologic development during the period of a
planned economy, but there were places where the findings and
their use diverged.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Chinese enterprises lack new products that meet
the market demand in China, and research findings of some
institutions have not been put to good use, he said, noting: "If
research findings are not turned promptly into practical
productive forces, they will not be helpful to the further
development of science and technology."
</P>
<P>
In congratulating the university on the establishment of its
research center, Jiang said that, since the beginning of the 20th
century, great progress has been made in science and technology in
the world, thus exerting an enormous impact on the social
development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
The thesis of the late leader Deng Xiaoping that science and
technology are primary productive forces has been proven
entirely correct, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
But turning researching findings into practical productive
forces does not mean neglecting research into basic sciences, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The leader said, "I have stated several times that as regards
basic research, we should score achievements in some areas and
don't have to so in some other areas. Developed countries ought to
spend more manpower and materials in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Chen Ning Yang, the Chinese American scientist who won the 1957
Nobel prize in physics, speaking on behalf of all scientists
present, said, "We are delighted to notice that the Chinese
government has always paid close attention to and supported
research into basic sciences."
</P>
<P>
International competition in the future will lie primarily in
the area of science and technology, he said, noting that to
improve competitiveness in science and technology, it is
imperative to develop applied sciences, and attach great
importance to research into basic sciences as well.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Prime Minister Calls for Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong said today that the government wants to bring about a mindset
change among Singaporeans by encouraging a spirit of innovation
and learning.
</P>
<P>
"We must get away from the idea that it is only the people at
the top who should be thinking, and the job of everyone else is to
do as told. Instead we want to bring about a spirit of innovation,
of learning by doing," he said at the opening of the Seventh
International Conference on Thinking.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore's vision for meeting future challenges is
encapsulated in four words: Thinking Schools, Learning Nation,
which, he explained, is a vision for a total learning environment,
including students, teachers, parents, workers, companies,
community, organizations and government.
</P>
<P>
Thinking Schools, Learning Nation is a formula that will enable
Singapore to compete and stay ahead, the prime minister said,
adding that the concept of thinking schools is central to this
vision.
</P>
<P>
Schools must develop future generations of thinking and
committed citizens, capable of making good decisions to keep
Singapore vibrant and successful in future, Goh urged.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education is undertaking a fundamental review
of its curriculum and assessment system to see how the creative
thinking and learning skills required for the future can be better
developed.
</P>
<P>
"What is critical however is that we fire in our students a
passion for learning, instead of studying for the sake of getting
good grades in their examinations," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges for Joint Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan' Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali today urged all parties in the Mideast peace process to
jointly work toward realizing regional and international peace.
</P>
<P>
Meeting an Israeli delegation, the prime minister said peace is
the ordinary state of human life and war should disappear forever.
</P>
<P>
He said peace is the common language for all the three great
religions in Arab East Jerusalem: Muslim, Christianity and
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
Peace can not be brought about as a result of building a
settlement here or there, but a comprehensive state, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hopes that the Israeli public will be more active in
pressing ahead for the goal of making peace, said Majali, who
signed a peace treaty with the Israelis in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Majali's meeting with the Israeli delegation came after the
U.S. and Egypt failed to reactiviate the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks last month and the hardline Israeli government declared to
continue building Jewish settlements in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is believed to be the birthplaces of all the three
religions and the Palestinians want it as the capital of their
future state.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Ready to Resume Diplomatic Relations with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is waiting for a formal
request from Kigali to reopen the Rwandan embassy here,
the East African today quoted a source of Kenyan Foreign
Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Once the request is received, the rest will be a formality,"
the Kenyan official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that at a regional summit on Burundi held in
Arusha last April, Kenya abandoned her hardline position against
the Tutsi military junta in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kenyan Foreign Ministry, the paper said, Kenya is
now even willing to support Rwanda's application for East African
Co-operation membership.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to look at their application favourably," an
official of Kenya's Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kenya and Rwanda were broken up in June last
year when the Kenyan government ordered the Rwandan embassy in
Nairobi to close.
</P>
<P>
Hostility between the two countries took root in 1994
following the demise of the regime of the late President Juvenal
Habyarimana and the coming to power of the Rwandan Patriotic
Front.
</P>
<P>
The new Rwandan authorities were bitter about the presence in
Kenya of senior Hutu leaders alleged to have mastermined or been
involved in the 1994 genocide against Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The worsening relations had culminated in the expulsion of two
successive Rwandan Charges d'Affaires in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted analysts as saying that Kenya's change of
position on Rwanda had come about as a result of recent
geopolitical shifts in the Great Lakes region.

close aide Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri for the post of speaker, the
Persian daily Jomhuri Islami reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Abdollah Nouri, Nateq-Nouri's rival for the
post of Parliament speaker, as saying that Khamenei had asked
him to leave the race on favor of Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
"I withdrew my candidacy after I heard the views of His
Eminence Supreme Leader that Mr. Nateq-Nouri must continue to
stay as Parliament speaker," Abdollah Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
A source close to Abdollah Nouri told Xinhua that Nouri came
under the pressure of Khamenei's office to leave the race for
speaker's seat after Nateq-Nouri lost to Mohammad Khatami by a
wide 13-million-vote margin in Iran's 7th presidential election
on May 23.
</P>
<P>
"First Mr. Abdollah Nouri was approached and pressured by the
leader's office. Then he went and met with the leader."
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the leader and Abdollah Nouri was
reported by other dailies as well. But the leftist opposition
daily Salam in today's report on the meeting left two paragraphs
blank.
</P>
<P>
This kind of move is rare in the history of printing media in
the country and could be interpreted as a strong protest against
the news censorship by the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone, the daily declined to comment on the blank
paragraph spaces that appeared in its interview with Abdollah
Nouri.
</P>
<P>
On May 22, a day before presidential elections, Iranian police
raided the printing house of Salam and closed the printing
house. The printing house was later opened on the same day but
it led to the disruption of the distribution of the popular
daily which supported Khatami's challenge to Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Unchallenged in his bid for re-election as parliament
speaker, Nateq-Nouri Sunday gained 211 out of 243 votes in
the Parliament, which will make him the speaker for another
year.
</P>
<P>
Most political analysts here believe that President-elect
Mohammad Khatami will face a tough time ahead since the
conservatives backed by Khamenei dominate the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Khatami will have to introduce the members of his cabinet to
obtain the Parliament vote of confidence for each minister. The
winning faction in the Parliament will have the last word in
determining the nature of Khatami's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Abdollah Nouri was the candidate of the Majma'e Hizbollah
(Party of God Association), a coalition of the leftists and
liberals who support the liberal policies of the outgoing
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The Party of God Association, a supporter of Khatami, is
expected to fully back Khatami against the rightists when he
introduces his cabinet to the Parliament early August.

<HEADLINE> First Hospital Train in China to Be Launched on July 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The first hospital train in
China, Lifetime Express, will depart from Hong Kong on July 1 and
travel through the Chinese inland areas, providing free medical
services to the poverty-stricken and handicapped living in poor
and remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The idea of operating the express, which is similar to a
program in India, was inspired by a group of Hong Kong people who
want to help the handicapped, the sick and the poor.
</P>
<P>
The project is proceeding under the leadership of the Chinese
Ministry of Health in conjunction with the Ministry of Railways
and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the express, Ms Nellie
Fong, said, "Comprising three carriages, the Lifeline Express is
scheduled to visit five selected areas in China each year and
provide three types of services, including corrective treatment of
cataracts and poliomyelitis as well as education on primary health
care and hygiene."
</P>
<P>
The train will emphasize cataract treatment during its first
year of operation, she said, adding Fengyang in east China's Anhui
Province has been chosen as the train's first stop.
</P>
<P>
Representing seven Hong Kong medical practitioners
participating in the program, Chairman of the Hong Kong Medical
Association Dr. Lee Kin-hung said, "According to rough estimates,
there are over 3 million people in the inland areas who suffer
from cataracts. It is difficult for them to take care of their
daily needs."
</P>
<P>
Transplant of artificial lenses to cataract patients will
improve their sight up to 70 percent of normal vision, he said.
</P>
<P>
The doctors from Hong Kong will work together with their
counterparts in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
There will be a permanent staff of 16 from the Ministry of
Health on the express to take care of the day-to-day operations of
the train. Based on the selection of stops, the ministry will also
allocate medical staff from the nearby cities to assist in the
operation of the train.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate the effective operation of the train,
the Ministry of Health will join hands with the Ministry of
Railways and provincial and municipal governments in determining
the list of places where the express will visit.
</P>
<P>
The train will stay for about 30 to 40 days in each place.
Publicity and patient registration will start ten days before the
arrival of the train.

<HEADLINE> Miraculous Escape for Saudi Passenger Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing
747 had a miraculous escape today when it landed at a wrong place
in India's southern city of Chennai.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the flight with at least 327
passengers was to arrive in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu, from
Riyadh, landed at a nearby air force station airfield instead of
the international airport. The aircraft, however, made a safe
landing and all passengers were safe.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the error, which could have led to a major
mishap, could not be ascertained immediately. An airport official
said the pilot apparently mistook the air force airfield for the
runway at the international terminal.
</P>
<P>
Customs and immigration authorities have proceeded to the air
force airfield to escort the passengers to the airport for customs
clearance.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- With the approaching of the Hong
Kong's return to China, Hong Kong people have begun to express
their joy and happy feelings in a wide variety of celebration
activities.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that from June 1 to the end of July,
more than 200 mass celebrating activities will be staged by
various local organizations and social groups.
</P>
<P>
These activities vary in style and content, involving sports
events, theatrical performances, exhibitions, banquets, bus and
ship tours, public carnivals, flying and film shows.
</P>
<P>
Sunday saw the unveiling of several major events all at once.
They included a month-long marathon-style relay race from Hong
Kong to Beijing, an international basketball tournament, a grand
prayer meeting attended by thousands of Christians and a
997-meter-long scroll painting by young people depicting the past,
present and future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The celebration sentiment is expected to peak on the nights of
June 30 and July 1, when several mass activities are staged.
</P>
<P>
The largest event, the Hong Kong 97 Spectacular scheduled for
July 1, is a light and sound show which includes an illuminated
flotilla, music, water fountains, special effects, lights, lasers
and fireworks display on Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the event said the show offers the community an
unforgettable spectacle in which the people of Hong Kong can
participate to celebrate and show their confidence in the future.
</P>
<P>
A large TV evening party is planned on June 30 at the Cultural
Center, which will draw over 400 artists from the inland areas and
more than 600 noted figures from local artistic and performing
circles. The party will be broadcast live worldwide by local TV
stations.
</P>
<P>
A carnival in Victoria Park organized by the Hong Kong Women's
Association for Celebrating Hong Kong's Return to China will start
at 10 a.m. on June 30 and last until the morning of July 1.
Thousands of families participating in the carnival will be able
to watch the grand handover ceremony through large TV screens
mounted on the site.
</P>
<P>
Industries and districts have all set up their respective
committees for organizing celebration activities, the latest
addition Sunday being the Cheung Chau Association for Celebrating
Hong Kong's Return to China.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the association said people living on Cheung
Chau Island will have a sleepless night on June 30 with
celebrating banquets, lion dance and sirens. On July 1, people
will take to the streets to join performance tours. A dragon boat
race will also be held on June 8 to mark the handover.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, nine dragons, 100 lions and over 60 performing
teams will be dancing through the streets of Yuen Long in the New
Territories, while on the night of June 28 a 3.5-kilometer-long
dragon delineated with neon lights will show its prowess along the
Nathan Road in Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
Most of these activities have been self-sponsored and
self-funded. Hong Kong people are generous in handing out money to
make the whole thing possible and also show their excitement at
the historic event by active participation.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Intense in Freetown With No Clear Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Intense fighting is still going
on in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown between Nigeria-led west
African intervening troops and the coup soldiers allied with
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian peacekeeping troops took control of the
international airport at Lungi, north of the capital earlier
today while the rebels and coup soldiers outnumbered the
peacekeepers outside a Freetown hotel.
</P>
<P>
According to a commander of the ECOMOG, west Africa's
peacekeeping forces, Nigerian troops already gained full control
of the airport to protect it from rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We took it this morning. There was a fighting with the
Sierra Leonean forces but it didn't last long at all," said the
officer.
</P>
<P>
The international airport would immediately be put into use to
bring in rapid reinforcements from other west African countries
including Nigeria, Ghana and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
However, despite earlier reports that an estimated 3,000
ECOMOG soldiers surrounded the 1,800 rebels allied with coup
soldiers, the coup soldiers and rebels gained an upper hand in
some districts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
They massed around a Freetown hotel guarded by Nigerian troops
after ECOMOG launched a bombardment and ground attack against the
coup leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The Nigerians are outnumbered and outgunned, there is no sign
or prospect of reinforcement. The rebels are massing closer and
closer to the hotel," said a Nigerian peacekeeping officer at the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
The hotel holds a few foreign journalists and about 1,000 west
African foreigners who took refuge their after the May 25 coup
when hundreds of foreigners fleeing looting and violence have
been evacuated from Freetown by U.S. marines.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after last night's failure of striking a peace
agreement between British and Nigerian diplomats, and Major Jonny
Koroma, who led his coup soldiers to topple civilian President
Ahmed Kabbah on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Koroma last night announced a new cabinet in a radio broadcast
in Freetown, defying the growing international pressure which
called on coup soldiers to step down and hand back power to
elected President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) which has been fighting a civil war in the tiny west
African country for the last five years, has been appointed
vice-chairman of the new cabinet.

<HEADLINE> WB to Help Address Philippines' Garbage Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is funding a
five-year project to help the Philippines address the worsening
garbage problem across the country.
</P>
<P>
Delfin Ganapin, Undersecretary of the Department of Environment
and Natural Resources, told a press conference here today that the
bank is lending 145 million U.S. dollars to help Manila start the
Solid Waste Ecological Enhancement Project.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, local government units that are willing to
put up environmentally less critical landfill sites will receive
financial support, Ganapin said, adding that some towns and
municipalities have expressed their willingness.
</P>
<P>
The garbage problem has been aggravating across the country
over the past few years. In Metro Manila alone, 6,100 tons of
garbage were generated per day, but there are only two landfills
available and one of them will be closed this month after a number
of years in service.
</P>
<P>
The dire consequences of the serious problem were experienced
when tropical depression Bining caused heavy rains last month,
bringing Metro Manila under water and catching the World Bank's
attention.
</P>
<P>
Ganapin emphasized that landfills are the last measure to
address the worsening problem in the country. He said that garbage
recycling reduces the volume of garbage by 50 percent and
therefore prolongs the life of a landfill.
</P>
<P>
"People should know and practice garbage recycling and garbage
re-use. The residual garbage which can't be recycled shall be
absorbed by the landfills," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Falls on Rate Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar fell to
levels not seen in almost four months today, driven lower by
speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could ease
its official cash rate in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 75.85 U.S. cents, a level not
seen since February 12, after ending locally last Friday at 76.03
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The RBA holds monthly board meeting Tuesday. An announcement on
monetary policy is generally not expected to follow, with most
analysts predicting any movement would more likely follow the July
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The last rate cut, on May 23, brought the domestic overnight
cash rate from 6.0 percent to 5.5 percent, in line with the
comparable U.S. Federal Reserve rate.
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said the market was jittery ahead of tonight's
offshore session when further selling could emerge.
</P>
<P>
They said demand by local exporters, which had helped support
the Australian dollar over the past week, might not be enough to
support the unit this week.
</P>
<P>
Against the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar ended at 88.17,
down from 88.68 locally last Friday, and the local dollar was at
1.3000 German marks, up from 1.2948.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An ambitious drinking water
project for Kathmandu is on the top of the new municipal
government's agenda, the capital's major-elect said today.
</P>
<P>
Kashav Sthapit told Xinhua that the city government will try
its best to persuade the central government to invite local and
foreign private investment in the Melamchi water diversion
project.
</P>
<P>
The project would be the only solution to the problem of water
supply shortage in Kathmandu, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sthapit, 38, a youth leader of the ruling Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), won a landslide victory
to the mayorship in last week's local elections and is expected to
assume office this week.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government proposed the Melamchi project nearly two
years ago, but so far no investors or foreign donors have shown
keen interest in the 185 million US dollar project, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
But the newly-elected mayor insisted that the project has its
commercial grounds as there is a huge water supply deficit in the
capital and its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's plans, the Melamchi project,
after its completion, could provide 170 million liters of water
every day to Kathmandu, where daily water demand is around 130
million. At present, only 110 million and 60 million liters are
available in rainy and dry seasons respectively.
</P>
<P>
"What we need now is the government and people's determination
to implement the project," Sthapit said, adding that some local
financial institutions are seriously considering investing in the
project.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, dams, tunnels and a water processing factory
will be built to bring water to the capital from a river about 30
km away.
</P>
<P>
Sthapit, a two-time loser as a candidate for deputy mayor of
Kathmandu in previous elections, said he will reform the city's
administrative structure with a view to carrying out the whole
city planning in an integrated and systematic manner.
</P>
<P>
New measures will also be introduced to mobilize the local
people and the private sector's participation in addressing the
city's headaches of air pollution and bad management of garbage
disposal.
</P>
<P>
Sthapit, one of the youngest mayors in the country, is expected
to face more challenges than he could anticipate now in this
politically sensitive capital city during his term in the next
five years, observers said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sees More Drug Addicts in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 9,888 new cases of
drug addiction and former addicts reverting to the old habit has
been reported in the first three months this year, according to
Malaysia's National Narcotics Agency (NNA).
</P>
<P>
Of the total cases reported, new addicts accounted for 44.7
percent while the rest were those who returned to addiction, NNA
Preventive, Planning and Research Director Abd Rashid Mat Adam was
quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the training for skilled parenting
for drug prevention in Ipoh, some 205 kilometers north of here,
the official described the situation as "serious" and said
preventive efforts should be further intensified to rid the nation
of the menace.
</P>
<P>
He said influence by colleagues was a major contributory factor
in drug addiction, responsible for 28.3 percent of the addicts
while those yearning to know the drug formed 17.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The broken family and the "loose relations" within a family
were also the basic factors behind the driving force to drug
addiction, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
During the three-month period under review, the largest number
of addicts were those below 30 years of age, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 200,000 drug addicts in Malaysia, according
to official figures available.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Face Stiff Resistance After Fall of Parwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia face
stiff resistance for the first time since their control of Kabul
after losing Parwan, a strategic province, to the opposition
forces.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today from Kabul, the
Taliban have lost control of northern Parwan province after the
forces loyal to commander Ahmad Shah Masood made a flying start
from Baghlan to Charikar, capital of Parwan province, some 65
kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted anti-Taliban sources as claiming that
Charikar fell to anti-Taliban forces on May 31 followed by their
advance towards Sheegal and Rabat only 50 kilometers from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The sources denied that the Taliban claim of recapturing Jabul
Siraj, a strategic town 77 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban were ousted from Jabul Siraj and other nearby towns
last Friday. The Taliban's return to Jabul Siraj is impossible
because they themselves had blown up the bridges linking Jabul
Siraj to Charikar while retreating towards Kabul, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are reported to try to capture a large number of
Shiites from the western parts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
They launched a massive operation in Kabul to arrest as many
Shiites as possible which, they believed, would help secure
release of hundreds of Taliban fighters and leaders captured by
the forces of General Abdul Malik in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A couple of clashes also took place between the Taliban and the
Shiites in Dasht-e-Barchi and Pul-e-Sokhta localities, when the
Taliban arrested more than 100 Shiites from west of Kabul, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Julius Chan Resumes Prime Ministership Of PNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Julius Chan today resumed the
prime ministership of Papua New Guinea, a south Pacific nation,
after a two-month-long political crisis.
</P>
<P>
While releasing a 125-page final report in Port Moresby today,
Julius said he had been cleared by a judicial inquiry into a 36
million U.S. dollars mercenaries contract, said the Australian
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Julius, Deputy Prime Minister Chris Haiveta and Defense
Minister Mathias Ijape had been forced to stand down from their
posts in late March following allegations by sacked military
leader Brigadier General Jerry Singirok that the contract to hire
foreign mercenaries was corrupt.
</P>
<P>
Julius told reporters that evidence already given to the
inquiry showed that he had been cleared of any allegations of
corruption surrounding the contract.
</P>
<P>
"It's been completed and all of us have been exonerated, the
deputy prime minister and defense minister would also resume
office," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singirok's allegations sparked military and civil protests in
Port Moresby, eventually forcing the three high officials to stand
aside.
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement by Julius that he would resume the prime
ministership, came barely two weeks before the country's national
elections, due to begin on June 14.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 Gold Asia Exhibition
will be held in Malaysia from November 7 to 9, according to a
statement by the World Gold Council released here today.
</P>
<P>
The council said that Malaysia has been chosen as the venue for
the event because it has been sustaining an economic growth rate
of over eight percent over the last nine years and has emerged as
a regional distribution center and also because of its tax
liberalization, which supports the gold business, Malaysia is
currently one of the largest gold jewelry fabrication centers,
fabricating 100 tons annually, most of which is exported.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to position Gold Asia '97 as a platform to usher in the
gold market for the next millennium. By introducing innovative
gold merchandise into the region and increasing consumer awareness
and knowledge of high caratage products, we believe that this
major event would contribute to the business development of the
gold market in the next millennium," the council said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will feature unique gold merchandise by 100
leading manufacturers from Asia, Europe and the Middle East, it
said, adding highlights include an exclusive Gold Jewelry Fashion
Gala featuring the widest range of elegant jewelry from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
A seminar will be held concurrently with the exhibition to
discuss topics like technology, product development, retailing,
market analysis and deregulation, it said.
</P>
<P>
Asia remains the largest consumer of gold with 1,728 tons,
accounting for 66 percent of the world's total consumption.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Putonghua Becoming Popular Among Macao Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- For 48-year-old Carlos Roldao Lopes,
director of the Macao Posts and Telecommunications Department, it
is now something most urgent to learn Putonghua, or standard
Chinese, in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
The director, who has been in Macao for 23 years, spends one
and half hours in the morning in Putonghua classroom, and then more
than two hours in the evening after he finishes his official
business.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to remain in Macao after 1999," Lopes told
Xinhua in Putonghua, although not so smoothly, in a recent
interview at the Languages and Translation School under the Macao
Institute of Science and Technology. "Although Putonghua is more
difficult to learn than English, I am confident that I can learn
it well."
</P>
<P>
Like Lopes, thousands of civil servants in Macao are learning
Putonghua eagerly every day. As a matter of fact, the number of
Putonghua learners among civil service has doubled annually in the
school over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"We now have 155 Chinese classes with 2,325 students," said
Lei Heong Iok, deputy headmaster of the Language and Translation
School, which performs the duty of civil service language
training in the territory. "More than 80 percent of them are
learning Putonghua. They are all very diligent."
</P>
<P>
Students at the school include not only Chinese civil
servants, but also those of Macao-born Portuguese, those coming
from Portugal and even top officials like Lopes and members of the
Legislative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Many of them, Lei said, spend part of their working time in
the morning classroom (from eight o'clock to 9:30) with government
permission. They also study in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
"By overcoming unfavorable factors in time and age (many above
the age of 40), many of them are now able to communicate in
simple Putonghua after learning for 70 hours," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government started Chinese training among civil servants
in 1987, in an effort to implement the policy of using Chinese as
an official language. Established in 1991, the Language and
Translation School is the largest Chinese training center for
civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1993, there were about 20 to 30 Chinese
classes in each school year, with students numbering 300 to
500. After 1993, the number doubled each year to more than 1,000
people during the 1995-1996 period, and to 2,325 during the
1996-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
So far, an estimated 10,000 out of the 17,000 or so civil
servants have received Chinese language training.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 factor plays a most significant role in the civil
servants' enthusiasm in learning Putonghua, although some said
they are interested in the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
"I need to speak Putonghua in my work," said Leng Wun Teng, a
clerk with the Government Tourism Office. "But I think I should be
able to speak Putonghua as China is to resume the exercise of
its sovereignty (over Macao) in two and half years."
</P>
<P>
Maria Gomes Costa, headmaster of the Languages and Translation
School, said that her school has compiled different textbooks and
opened different classes for different students.
</P>
<P>
"The government has made great efforts in training bilingual
professionals," she said, "The training program includes both
Chinese and Portuguese, in accordance with the basic law of
Macao."

<HEADLINE> Australian MPs Optimistic About Future of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An Australian parliamentary
committee expressed here today their optimism about the future of
Hong Kong after its handover to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the parliament, the Joint Standing Committee on
Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade said its "optimism is
encouraged by the robust state of Hong Kong's economy, the
autonomous representation of Hong Kong on a number of
international economic bodies," such as the World Trade
Organization (WTO), and its maintenance of a separate currency,
its own stock exchange and its status as a separate customs
territory.
</P>
<P>
In a tabling statement today to the House of Representatives,
Ian Sinclair, chairman of the committee, said, "Hong Kong has a
sophisticated common law system, an independent judiciary, a
vigorous Chinese and English language media and an impartial and
apparently honest public service and police force."
</P>
<P>
"Optimism about the future of Hong Kong rests, we were told, on
the rational and pragmatic nature of the Chinese government and
its recognition of the value of Hong Kong to China," the chairman
said.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair, who went to Hong Kong with his colleagues on a
fact-finding trip earlier this year, said optimism about Hong
Kong's future also rests on the agreement of the Chinese to "a
novel treaty that guarantees 'one country, two systems' and 'Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong'."
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji reiterated those
promises last week during a visit to Australia.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said: "China would unswervingly implement the
principle of 'one country, two systems' and we have the ability
and the confidence to ensure long-term stability and prosperity of
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"We think business will flourish rather than reverse," Sinclair
said later at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the "fairly late" changes made by Hong Kong
Governor Christopher Patten, MP C Hollis told journalists that he
thinks Britain showed "a certain amount of hypocrisy" in making
the changes only four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"And of course that was after the Sino-British agreement," said
Hollis, who also visited Hong Kong in January.
</P>
<P>
"I sensed in Hong Kong a very strong feeling in a lot of
sections of the community toward China ... a feeling in Chinese
that 'we are going back to China'," Hollis said.
</P>
<P>
The 217-page report is a product of an inquiry by the
committee, whose six members visited Hong Kong between January 19
and 25, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The six MPs were able to hold "extensive" discussions with
senior government officials, politicians from all political
parties, the legal fraternity, religious leaders, business people
and representatives from a variety of non-governmental
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Sewage Treatment Works Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Stonecutters Island sewage
treatment works, one of the largest of its kind in the world,
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The 2.1 billion-HK-dollar plant is capable of treating 1.7
million cubic meters of sewage a day to serve a population of
about 3.5 million by the year 2021.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, John Collier, director of
Drainage Services, said the treatment works is a key component of
the strategic sewage disposal scheme, a long-term solution to the
treatment and disposal of the sewage which presently flows into
the Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
"The plant provides treatment for domestic and industrial waste
from across the main urban area of Kowloon and Northeast Hong Kong
Island," he added.
</P>
<P>
The treatment works adopts a chemically enhanced primary
sedimentation process where ferric chloride and polymer chemicals
are added to increase the treatment efficiency of the
sedimentation tanks.
</P>
<P>
That will remove at least 70 percent of the suspended solid
pollution and 35 percent of the biological oxygen demand of the
waste water.
</P>
<P>
According to Collier, the operational control of the entire
system is by a sophisticated computerized Distributed Control and
Data Acquisition System.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian President S.D. Sharma said
today that it needed to have conventions to deal with hung
parliament phenomenon in the country.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a two-day conference of governors here, the
president said that there was need to build healthy conventions
that facilitate the task of the constitutional head and the
working of the constitution in different situations.
</P>
<P>
In the past couple of years, India has seen hung parliament or
assemblies both in the center and states with no single party
getting a simple majority in the legislatures.
</P>
<P>
Sharma posed several questions to the participants that might
crop up if no political party secures a clear majority in the
parliamentary or assembly polls and expressed the hope that the
conference would serve as reference material of permanent value
for future state heads.
</P>
<P>
Apart from governors, the conference is being attended by
leaders of several political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sharma stressed the importance to safeguard and ensure smooth
working of the constitution with the help of institutions and
systems which can "efficiently and confidently deal with the
phenomenon of hung legislatures".

<HEADLINE> W. African Troops Attack S. Leone Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Ground fighting occurred around
the military headquarters in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone
today after warships of the west African peacekeeping forces, led
by Nigeria, started bombing the coup makers at dawn.
</P>
<P>
Coup soldiers exchanged fire with Nigerian troops protecting a
hotel near the military headquarters in which about 1,000 west
African foreigners are holed up.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners took refuge in the basement of the hotel which
was shattered by the gunfire. Some Nigerian soldiers were wounded
outside the hotel.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the coup leaders speaking on state radio urged
people to come out and protest against the Nigerian intervention.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for ECOMOG, the west African peacekeeping
forces, said the ECOMOG attack against the coup leaders had started.
</P>
<P>
The coup leaders are currently based in the camps of the
military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after last night's failure of striking a peace
agreement between British and Nigerian diplomats, and Major Jonny
Koroma, who led his coup soldiers to topple civilian President
Ahmed Kabbah on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Major Koroma last night announced a new cabinet of Sierra
Leone in a radio broadcast in Freetown, defying the growing
international pressure which called on him to step down and
hand back power to elected President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Corporal Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) which has been fighting a civil
war in the tiny west African country for the last five years, has
been appointed vice-chairman of the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who is now in Nigeria's capital Abuja under a house
arrest by the Nigerian government, reportedly ordered his rebels
to join the new regime. Three other RUF rebels are also in the
20-member cabinet list.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that an estimated 3,000 ECOMOG soldiers
in Freetown surrounded the 1,800 rebel troops, including RUF
fighters. With the troops build up, ECOMOG has brought several
tanks, artillieries and personnel carriers into Freetown, to make
preparations for a possible attack pending any failure of the
talks.

<HEADLINE> Oman, Iran to Jointly Develop Oilfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Oman and Iran have agreed to
draw up a joint development plan for Buka-Hengam oilfield which
is jointly owned by the two countries, local newspaper Khaleej
Time reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced Sunday following a meeting in
Muscatt, the capital of Oman, between Oman's undersecretary for
Oil Salem Shaaban and his Iranian counterpart Mohammed Hadi
Najad Hussainian, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Shaaban told the newspaper that the two sides agreed to set up
basis for developing the oilfield, which stretches over the
territorial waters of the two countries near the strategic Hormuz
Strait at the entrance of the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
A joint team will discuss the financial and legal aspects of
the development plan within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a tangible progress has been made in
the plan to develop the oilfield, the Omani official said.
</P>
<P>
The field is economically viable and Oman has tested two wells
in its side of the field, while Iran also drilled a well, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Iran said earlier that the field would be put to international
tender. Some European and Australian companies have already shown
interest.
</P>
<P>
Iran said it owns about 80 percent of the field, with the rest
owned by Oman.
</P>
<P>
Iran estimates that the field's reserves include 523 cubic
meters of natural gas and 120 million barrels of crude
oil.

<HEADLINE> Inadequate Laws Threaten Indian Medicinal Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Inadequate conservation laws are
threatening the centuries-old knowledge and immense wealth of
medicinal plants in India, today's "The Statesman" quoted a
recently released study paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a paper on medicinal plants and the law in India, Ms.
Sarbani Sarkar from the Center for Environmental Law, has
expressed her concern over the creation of "genetic" and
"cultural" universals which would undermine the relationship that
existed between men, animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
India is floristically one of the richest countries in the
world. A survey spread over 100 years, covering only 40 percent of
the total geographic area, shows that India has at least 45,000
species of plants, both agricultural and medicinal.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the country's population meets its primary health
care from such plants. Between 5,000 and 7,000 species of flora in
India are known to be used for medicinal purposes, she said in the
paper.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the world's plant genetic wealth is in the
tropics and 50 percent of it is in India, China and Malaysia, but
this arboreal wealth is fast depleting. Some scientists have said
that the earth is losing 50 species a day and at the end of the
century, half a million of the planet's known species would become
extinct.
</P>
<P>
To save the country from this situation, what is needed is an
exclusive act for the protection of medicinal plants as also
stringent conservation laws to combat the intellectual property
rights regime and the mechanism of international trade, she
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Proliferation-Proof Nuclear Reactor Designed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli scientist has
invented a technology to build a new kind of nuclear reactor
which will greatly reduce the global threat of nuclear terrorism
and cost of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported today that Alvin Radkowsky, a
nuclear scientist in the Hebrew University, invented the
technology that uses thorium instead of uranium for much of the
fuel in the core of nuclear reactors,
</P>
<P>
This technology does not produce any by-products that could
possibly be used for making weapons, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
At present, all the approximately 400 commercial light-water
reactors in the world discharge over 70 tonnes of plutonium
annually. And only four kilograms of plutonium is enough to make a
nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
The new invention is known as the non-proliferative
light-water thorium reactor, or the Radkowsky Thorium Reactor
(RTR). Thorium is much more plentiful and cheaper than uranium,
but until now no practical method was found to exploit its
potential in nuclear energy production.
</P>
<P>
Radkowsky, a former chief scientist of the United States Naval
Nuclear Propulsion Program for 24 years who immigrated to Israel
in 1972, noted that another advantage of the RTR is a major
reduction in nuclear waste, not only in quantity and toxicity, but
also in radioactivity and heat emission. Nuclear-power countries
are facing serious problems in storing nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
The RTR could reduce nuclear power costs by 20 percent to 30
percent, partly due to the savings in uranium, Radkowsky
said. It is exactly the same size as existing standard uranium
cores, so it can easily be substituted.
</P>
<P>
The United States Patent Office has granted a patent to
Radkowsky, and the Japanese and Russian governments have already
approved his invention.
</P>
<P>
A cooperation agreement was recently signed with the Nuclear
Fuel Industries of Japan, and a full-scale prototype RTR is now
being built at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow with
U.S. government funding and is expected to be ready by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Radkowsky presented information about the reactor
to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, which is
now considering it for approval.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Change 2-day Weekly Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is to
change its just-announced two-day weekly holiday because of
pressure from the opposition party, government employees and the
business community.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the government declared Friday and Saturday as
weekly holidays, instead of only Friday, to "increase efficiency
and productivity, save expenditure on account of fuel, energy and
check environment pollution" in work places.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has
accused the government of making the nation handicapped by
announcing a two-day weekly holiday as "part of evil designs by
local and foreign powers".
</P>
<P>
"It has announced two days holiday instead of one day's merely
to make a just-awakened nation somnolent in the present
competitive world," she alleged.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's two leading trade bodies also urged the government
to review its decision of two-day holiday and declare Sunday as
the weekly holiday.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) in a
statement on Sunday said Sunday should be weekly holiday and
Saturday as half day.
</P>
<P>
President of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry ASM
Quasem also shared the similar view, "the government's abrupt
decision on weekly holiday without any discussion with the
business community has come as a disappointment to us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of government employees Sunday staged a
demonstration inside the Bangladesh Secretariat, demanding the
rescinding of two-day weekly holiday.
</P>
<P>
The employees and junior officials, ignoring official ban on
holding rally inside this compound of different ministries, took
out a series of group processions and organized a big rally.
</P>
<P>
They demanded an immediate withdrawal of the newly-introduced
restriction on rallies and immediate reversion to the previous
office time-table. According to the new time-table, they are to
work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., instead of from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Friday was made the weekly holiday from Sunday in early 1980s
in this predominately Moslem country by the then president Hussain
Muhammad Ershad.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Speaker Denies Rumors to Oust Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Jose de
Venecia today laughed off rumors on an impending plan to unseat
him, labeling the rumors as only "black propaganda and intrigue".
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, reports from an unnamed source from the ruling
Lakas party said a coup in the lower Chamber has been brewing and
would push through when the Congress is on recess beginning this
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the plot has got the backing of key officials
in the Presidential Palace and that House Majority Leader Rodolfo
Albano had been groomed by the Palace to replace de Venecia.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia said the rumors were meant to destabilize the House.
In the meantime, he expressed confidence that he still has the
support of at least 169 congressmen out of the 250 lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said some people fabricated these rumors maybe
because his "performance and achievement ratings were quite
improving. But he did not explain this matter further.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia is among the few people wanting to be anointed by
President Fidel Ramos in the 1998 elections. He faces challenges
from main rivals including Defense Secretary Renato de Villa.

<HEADLINE> Small Towns Booming in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Small towns in east China's
Zhejiang Province have developed rapidly in recent years, with
distinctive features of their own.
</P>
<P>
During the 1993-1996 period, 78 billion yuan (about nine
billion US dollars) of capital were put into the construction of
small towns, with a total floor space of 200 million square meters
of newly constructed buildings, public facilities, and production
bases.
</P>
<P>
These small townships were built to develop the local economy,
and the small township's distinctive styles and characteristics
were formed during the building process.
</P>
<P>
Kejiao, a small town in Shaoxing County in east China's
Zhejiang Province, has been developed into the biggest trading
center for textile products in China since late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The large number of merchants and commodities coming into or
out of the town has contributed a lot to the rapid development of
its tertiary industry including restaurants, hotels,
transportation, financial, and recreational sectors.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to the first half of 1996, the town has invested more
than 4.5 billion yuan (about 500 million US dollars) to complete
177 construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The population of the city has increased to more than 100,000,
and the town has become a market-oriented city, which has all the
facilities for convenient life and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Similar types of towns can also be found in other parts of
Zhejiang, such as the woolen sweater market in Puyuan in Tongxiang
County, the button market in Qiaotou in Yongjia County.
</P>
<P>
"Besides market-oriented towns, there are industrial towns in
Zhejiang, such as the Liushi in Leqing County for electrical
appliances, the Hengdian in Dongyang City for magnetic materials;
tourism towns such as Xikou in Fenghua City, Yaolin in Donglu
City, and Zhujiajian in Zhoushan City," said Zhang Qimei,
vice-governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
There are also towns in the province, whose development has
been attributed to their convenient communications access.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of small townships indicates the booming
of independent and separate regional economies in the province,
according to official analyses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics have shown that those booming townships have
attracted nearby township enterprises to develop around it, due to
its good investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The number of township enterprises in Zhejiang reached 902,000
in 1995, an increase of 82.6 percent over 1990. Most of those new
enterprises gathered around small towns, providing employment
opportunities for surplus rural labourers.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Zhili township in Huzhou has drawn most of
the villagers around it to set up enterprises, leaving a number of
 farmers to cultivate the farmland under contract.
</P>
<P>
Those booming townships have built a group of cultural,
scientific, educational, health, and sports facilities.

<HEADLINE> West African Peacekeepers Attack Freetown Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
forces, led by Nigerian troops, this morning started their
attacks at Sierra Leone's military coup leaders.
</P>
<P>
Heavy bombards and gunfire shook Sierra Leone's capital
Freetown at 6 a.m. (0600 gmt) as Nigerian naval vessels opened
fire from the sea.
</P>
<P>
"The attack has started," said an officer of the ECOMOG, the
forces of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),
in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not make clear what were the targets and no
explosions were found near the coup leaders' headquarters.
Neither is there any sign of fighting on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The attack came a day after diplomats made a desperate attempt
to strike a peace agreement to end the crisis caused by the May
25 coup by junior officers to topple Sierra Leone's civilian
government led by President Ahmed Kabbah who is currently in
Canakry, capital of neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
African states and the world community have been calling on
the coup soldiers to immediately hand back power over to
President Kabbah and go back to the barracks.
</P>
<P>
Pending failure of coup makers to accept the peace agreement,
the Nigeria-led ECOMOG forces threatened to intervene and force
the coup leaders out of power.

before, threatened to break what the ministers described as the "
unjust economic sanctions against Libya". The economic sanctions
had caused a lot of economic and social sufferings not only to
Libya but also to its neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government will debate the question of
Palestine and the Middle East. The position taken by the Council
of Ministers meeting is that there can be no lasting and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless Israel withdraw
from all occupied Palestinian and Arab lands, including east
Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At least 27 heads of state and three prime ministers had
arrived by last night for the summit. Others were expected to
arrive here early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the leaders at the Harare International Airport,
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said, ''This is an honour and
challenge particularly at a time when the organisation is making
commendable progress in resolving conflicts and developing
strategies to improve the economies' integration.''
</P>
<P>
He hoped the summit would yield positive results in order to
further strengthen African cooperation and solidarity.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 2 (Xinhua) --The Uganda Investment Authority
(UIA) decided to set up industrial estates near capital Kampala
in the next financial year, the local daily ''The Monitor''
reported today.
</P>
<P>
UIA is expected to release part of the 15 million U.S. Dollar
budget soon for the servicing of a vast piece of land of the
estates at Namanve.
</P>
<P>
According to UIA, the government is to spend 15 million dollars
on developing infrastructure on the land and initial plans on the
project will commence this financial year (1996/97).
</P>
<P>
UIA officials were quoted as saying that lack of serviced
industrial estates has over the years put the country at
disadvantage in wooing foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Neighbouring Kenya, said to be Uganda's main competitor as an
investment destination, commenced the provision of services
industrial land to investors a couple of years ago.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish President to Visit Egypt in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Ambassador to Egypt Yacar
Yakic said here Sunday evening that Turkey's President Suleyman
Demirel will visit Egypt in December.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a news conference after the last-minute
cancellation of Demirel's visit to Egypt in May sparked
speculation about growing grudge between the two countries due to
closer Turkish-Israeli strategic dialog.
</P>
<P>
"There is no misunderstanding between Cairo and Turkey and
consultations are at the highest level between the two sides,"
Yakic said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been demanding a Turkish explanation for planned
massive joint military drilling with Israel in the Mediterranean
this summer, which is reportedly targeted on Iran and Syria,
Israel's biggest foes.
</P>
<P>
Yakic defended the Turkish-Israeli military pact as "a
training agreement" that is not aimed at launching an alliance in
the region, noting that Turkey has similar agreements with some
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he stressed that no date has been set yet for the
three-way military games.
</P>
<P>
"The drills are for humanitarian considerations and are not
targeted against any country in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Turkish military operations in northern Iraq, the
ambassador said the incursions are not targeted against Iraq's
sovereignty but rather against the "terrorist" acts carried out by
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
With the support of air bombing and artillery fire, about
25,000 to 50,000 Turkish troops have pushed across the border
into northern Iraq assaulting the PKK rebels since May 14.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League and other countries have asked Turkey to pull
its troops out of northern Iraq, a region that is still very
fragile.

backgrounds," said Rukingama.

LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Many buildings in Lusaka, the capital of
Zambia, are sub-standard and built without certification from
quolified architects, one Lusaka official has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted Lusaka Province Deputy Minister

structures in the capital city are illegal in contravention of the law
which requires qualified architects to certify any building design
exceeding 120 square metres.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem is compounded by the shortage of building
inspectors at Lusaka City Council to make sure all buildings conformed
to this requirement.
</P>

"Many buildings of low standards have mushroomed in Lusaka in
breach of the law," said Mulenga.

Mulenga also condemned people who have built several night clubs in
residential areas, saying the residents could not have "peace" because

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Cultivated land in north China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which has a high concentration of
Moslems, has increased by 22,346 hectares over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Though cultivated land area per capita in Ningxia is slightly
higher than the country's average, the imbalance between
overpopulation and scarce land still exists in the region: each
person there has 0.06 hectares of irrigated cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
To ensure grain output and economic development, the regional
government has provided favorable treatment for the development of
alkaline, barren or idle land over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
It has also encouraged people to plant fruit trees in
mountainous areas and dig fish ponds on beaches in order to
economize on the use of cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region has reformed land-use policies, imposing
more taxes on land developers. Since 1992, the region has
collected nearly 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars)
from land deals.
</P>
<P>
The region has also intensified law enforcement in the land
sector. Over the past decade, land management departments have
dealt with 6,102 cases, recovering 8.91 million square meters of
land.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ningxia has set up basic farmland reserves in seven
cities and counties, putting more than 176,000 hectares of
farmland under top protection.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Indonesia's Ruling Party Sure of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- With the provisional results of
Indonesia's sixth general election announced, the ruling party
Golkar is sure to score a landslide victory, most probably the
biggest win in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
In all the electorates nationwide, Golkar has won over 74
percent of the votes, enjoying clear advantages over its two
rivals, the United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI).
</P>
<P>
At the moment, PPP, a Muslim-oriented group, has obtained
nearly 22.66 percent of the votes, about six percentages higher
than in 1992 election, while the PDI only gained 3.07 percent. In
1992, the PDI obtained 15 percent, up from 11 percent in the 1987
election.
</P>
<P>
The three parties contest for 425 seats of the 500-member House
of Representatives. The remaining 75 are reserved for the armed
forces whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
The final results are expected to be announced in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
During the May 29 election, the turnout was estimated at 90
percent or more of the 124.7 million eligible voters, according to
the General Election Institute.
</P>
<P>
Election Committee officials said the election was generally a
peaceful one despite some hitches which occurred in central and
eastern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said it was not surprising for the
Golkar, with a membership of 35 million including the civil
servants, the armed forces, farmers and fishermen as well as
professional groups, to win the election this time as it had done
in the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
They said the economic growth averaging 7 percent a year for
the last two decades and the relatively low inflation in the
country under the leadership of Golkar gave the party a powerful
campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders promised another similar growth in the second
long-term (25 years) development plan to propel Indonesia into the
ranks of the industrialized world in the middle of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable achievements of the poverty eradication program
launched by the Golkar government in recent years have also won
credibility for the party, said the analysts.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important achievements for the government was
made in the field of education. Widjojo Nitisastro, an outstanding
economist, said the success can be measured in terms of sharp
improvement in the literacy rate and the primary and secondary
school enrollment rate. All this added to a promising smooth start
of Indonesia's efforts to industrialize the economy by relying
more on quality human resources than to natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Presently there are 52 public universities and 1,284 private
ones in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said Golkar and PPP had both benefited from the
collapse of the PDI.
</P>
<P>
The PDI was bogged down in a leadership struggle after party
chief Megawati Soekarnoputri, eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding president Soekarno, was ousted by a rival faction last
year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, political analysts said, her opponent, deputy
speaker of parliament Soerjadi, lacked credibility and the party
lost heavily.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating the Golkar victory, President Soeharto said,
"This earns us a credit to implement our long-term development
programs."
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that Golkar, emerging with a stronger
mandate in this election, now faces the challenge of delivering
the many promises it made during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
One of its biggest challenges will be to eradicate corruption,
collusion and monopolies, Dean of the Socio-political Sciences
Faculty of the University of Indonesia Budiyatna said.
</P>
<P>
"The most interesting issue the poll contestants raised in
their platforms during the campaign was the fight against
corruption, collusion, manipulation and monopolies," he said.
Golkar has convinced voters that it would address these issues if
it won the election.
</P>
<P>
Oka Mahendra, a Golkar legislator, echoed this call. "Whoever
wins the election shouldn't be so intoxicated by victory that it
forgets its promises," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's election system, the 500 members of
the House of Representatives elected will form the People's
Consultative Assembly along with 500 appointed functional and
regional representatives. The People's Consultative Assembly next
year will elect the president and vice president and also
determine the guidelines of state policy for the term 1998-2003.
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally see the presidential poll in March next year
as the key election for the country, with keen interest in who the
76-year-old President Soeharto will select as a running mate and
potential successor.

Committee (NAOC) said.
</P>
<P>
Other tickets have been reserved for package tours or for sale
at the door.
</P>
<P>
The organising committee said the brisk sales in Japan, which
has been allotted about 80 percent of the total of 1.2 million
tickets for the Games, would not affect overseas sales which are
handled through agents.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippine Market to See Slow Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market
rebounded for the eighth consecutive trading day today, indicating
that the market is recovering gradually but slowly after weeks of
tumbles.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index rose 11.27 points
to 2,820.72 on renewed confidence in the country's macro-economic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
The market began to see a reversal a week ago amid rumors of
strong economic performance for the first quarter of this year.
But the tendency was strengthened after the government announced
last Thursday a 6.1 GNP increase for the period.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that although the growth rate was lower than the
government target of 6.4 percent for the first quarter due to a
manufacturing slowdown, it was deemed acceptable by investors in
general and reinstated that the country's fast growth pace is
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said they remain confident that gross
national product (GNP) could grow by 7 percent to 8 percent in the
full year.
</P>
<P>
"The economy continued to grow at a comfortable healthy pace
contrary to initial negative market expectations," said Cielito
Habito, socio-economic planning secretary.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the stock market suffered sharp declines a few weeks
ago on fears that the economy was on a serious downturn and would
soon follow the fate of Thailand, where a property crash, a
battered currency and a general economic slowdown led to a
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Such fears prompted investors, mostly foreigners, to flee the
market, hitting property and banking issues. In May, the main
index sank to a 17 month low before rising anew in a seven-day
up-swing towards the close of the month.
</P>
<P>
Closing the month strong, the composite index rebounded 161.28
points, or 6.09 percent to 2,809.45 after a four-week absence from
the 2,800 mark.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, the property index
tumbled 17 percent while the overall market was down 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a property-related financial crisis, the Central
Bank of the Philippines imposed a 20 percent limit on banks'
exposure to the property sector after the market plunged 4.5
percent on April 28, its biggest one-day drop in two years.
</P>
<P>
Now, analysts said, the first quarter economic growth figure
may have allayed the fears that the Philippines would become
another Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"The Thailand comparison was a big factor in the recent slump
of the market. The economic comparison growth figures showed that
we are not like Thailand and this improved the market's fragile
sentiment," said Allan Araullo, vice president at Regional Capital
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
"There is still optimism on the whole because there is nothing
really fundamentally wrong with the economy, said James Lago,
analyst at Westin Securities Corp.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts are not convinced that the market is already
out of the woods after its recovery last month.
</P>
<P>
They said that the stock market is expected to rally this week
but trading will likely remain thin as foreign investors will
continue to stay away even after the release of relatively good
macro-economic numbers.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, foreign fund managers continued to stay
out of the bourse because of the attractive potential gains in
other markets such as the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Many foreign institutions which underrated the country will
not immediately return. If the second-quarter corporate earnings
show market improvement, they might come back," said Joel Mendoza,
research head of Santander Investment Securities (Phils), Inc..
</P>
<P>
But some analysts predicted that foreign players will buy into
the market soon as it is just a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that the market's movement this month
will be mainly choppy, as investors will likely secure their gains
only after a short waiting period.
</P>
<P>
This is because the market is not waiting for any incentives
unraveling in the month, except for indications of second-quarter
earnings results, they said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, some analysts said, there might be some profit-taking
as investors may be tempted to adopt a sell-on-news strategy, but
after the temporary profit-taking the market will be on a solid,
sustainable rise.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Begin Gas Export Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will next month start
exporting gas following the completion of the Escravos gas
project in Delta State, the Business Times newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The project, which costs 569 million U.S. Dollars, recently
completed and put into a test run. It is now ready for commercial
production, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Escravos is a project of the Chevron Nigeria Limited, a joint
venture between the U.S. oil company Chevron and the state-run
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, when fully on stream, the project
will be able to gather 165 million cubic feet of gas daily for
processing from the company's Okan and Mefa oil fields.
</P>
<P>
The Escravos project was started six years ago and was
encouraged by the Nigerian government as the country's rich
natural gas resources are being daily flared into the air in
tremendous quantities in its many oil fields.

<HEADLINE> Booming Pillar Industries Prop up Shanghai Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Six new pillar industries will
steer Shanghai's economic growth, turbocharging the motor of its
traditional industrial framework.
</P>
<P>
The booming pillars include automobile, electronics,
petrochemicals, iron and steel, and electrical appliances, whose
industrial output now accounts for more than half of the city's
total, said Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi today in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Each day, 213 fax machines, 548 automobiles, 1,200 motorbikes,
2,230 air-conditioners, 15,400 program-controlled telephones,
10,000-plus-kilowatt power units, and 30,000 tons of iron and
steel products are churned out by the pillar industries, which
have become a major pole of growth for the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the new pillars, resulting from new structural
optimizations, is a key factor behind the fast and steady
industrial growth in Shanghai, Mayor Xu said. Statistics indicates
that Shanghai industry grew at an annual average of 17 percent
during the 1992-1996 period, as opposed to only five percent in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's traditional pillar industries were textiles and
light industry. The city started pumping up technology-intensive
pillars with high added value, good economic efficiency, and
promising market potential in the early 1990. And the sector,
which received both policy support and cash input, witnessed a
rapid year-on-year growth rate of 20 percent in gross output
during the past five years, according to Xu Zhiyi, director of the
Municipal Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Every two seconds, a Santana sedan comes off the production
line. However, in the 1980s it took an hour to turn out one
automobile of the phased-out Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The new pillars now contribute 54.4 percent to
annually-increased industrial output value in Shanghai, while its
profits and taxes account for over 60 percent of the city's total,
said Xiong Lisheng, an expert with the Shanghai Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
While the six pillar industries are still at the height of
growth, Shanghai is already looking for new pillars to take hold
of advanced technology and sustain economic development. A new
generation of pillars, which include multi-media, bio-pharmacy,
new materials, micro-electronics, intelligent machine-building,
shipbuilding, and marine engineering, have been picked out as
choices, said an official with the Municipal Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The new generation of pillar industries will lay a solid
foundation for Shanghai leap into the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Hanbo Scandal Defendants Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court sentenced Hanbo
Group owner Chung Tae-soo to 15 years in prison in today's trial and
gave three to seven year jail terms to a former cabinet minister, four
politicians and three former bank officials implicated in the Hanbo
bribes-for-loans scandal.
</P>
<P>
In a penalty measurement trial for the 11 defendants related
two weeks ago, prosecutors had demanded 20-year imprisonment for
Chung and five to eight years to the others.
</P>
<P>
Chung has embezzled huge company fund and offered bribes to
government officials, legislators and the bank officials. In
return, Chung has been able to get 5.6 billion U.S. dollar loans
from the banks and other preferences from the administration as
well as the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In today's ruling, Chung was found guilty of fraud, embezzlement of
215 million U.S. dollars and bribes of 3.65 million.
</P>
<P>
His son, Hanbo Group chairman Chung Po-keun and company's financial
chief Kim Jong-kook were also pronounced guilty of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Ruling New Korea party (NKP) lawmaker Hong In-kil was sentenced to
seven years in jail and fined 11.2 million U.S. dollars for receiving
the same amount in bribes from Chung.
</P>
<P>
Those on trial also include two other NKP lawmakers Hwang Byung-tai
and Chung Jae-chull and opposition lawmaker Kwon Roh-kap of the major
National Congress for New politics (NCNP). They were sentenced three
to five-year imprisonment and fined in the amount they took bribes
from Hanbo Group.
</P>
<P>
Former Home Minister Kim Woo-suk and three former bank heads were
given four to five-year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the sentences, the presiding judge lamented that
irregularities surrounding the Hanbo scandal such as embezzlement,
bribing, taking bribe and credit without responsibility had caused
crisis in society and the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The persons implicated in the scandal should be sternly punished so
as to prevent further politic-business collusion as well as
irregularities and corruption, he added.
</P>
<P>
Eight other politicians indicted for taking bribes from the Hanbo
owner, including Pusan Mayor Moon Jung-soo and two incumbent lawmakers
and five ex-lawmakers, will also go on trial this month.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Coupists Name Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) --Heavy bombardment eurpted in Sierra
Leone's capital of Freetown this morning as Nigerian-led west
African forces launched an attack on the coup leaders in S. Leone
</P>
<P>
The attack follows the failure of diplomats to desperately
strike a peace agreement to end the crisis caused by the May 25
coup and the announcement of the cabinet members by the coup
leader Major Jonny Paul Koroma, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Major Johnny Paul Koroma made public the cabinet list in
Freetown, capital of S. Leone on Sunday, defying the growing
international pressure on him to step down to give place to the
elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
According to reports today, Corporal Foday Sankoh, leader of
the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) which has been
fighting a civil war in the tiny west African country for the
last five years, has been appointed the deputy of Koroma.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who is now in Nigeria alleged to be guest of the
Nigerian government, reportedly ordered his rebels to join the
new regime following the May 25 coup that toppled the elected
government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Three other RUF rebels are also in the 20-member cabinet list.
</P>
<P>
Top level diplomatic efforts have been intensified in Freetown
to persuade the coup leaders to step down even as the United
States warned against any military action by the Nigeria-led west
African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between west African countries and the coup
leaders have been underway in Freetown since last Wednesday for a
peaceful settlement of the current crisis, aiming at restoring
Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that an estimated 3,000 ECOMOG soldiers
in Freetown surrounded the 1,800 rebel troops, including RUF
fighters. With the troop build up, ECOMOG has brought several
tanks, artillieries and personnel carriers into Freetown, to make
preparations for a possible attack, if talks fail.
</P>
<P>
Major Koroma has announced that his military regime firmly
opposed any intervention from outside.

<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara arrived here this
morning on a mission believed related with the deadlocked peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian officials are carrying a message from President
HafezAl-Assad to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents have been in close contacts with each other
in order to coordinate stances in restarting the Israeli-Syrian
peace track that has been frozen for over one year.
</P>
<P>
Syria, an important partner in the Mideast peace process, began
negotiations with Israel in 1991. But the sporadic talks broke
off last February after a spate of suicide bomb attacks in Israel
blamed on Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Syria said it will not return to the negotiating table with
the Israeli government unless it first agrees to pull out of the
Golan Heights, captured by the Jewish state in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejects the demand,
saying that the strategic plateau is vital to Israel. But his
predecessors, Labor Party leaders reportedly verbally accepted an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for normalized ties
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria favors a pan-Arab summit to make resolute decisions to
confront the Israeli settlement practice, which has led to the
stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace track since two months
ago, but Egypt said such a move is premature.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first country to make peace with the Jewish state,
has been one of the key mediators in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Farmers Use Computers in Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Well-to-do farmers in northeast
China's Liaoning Province have turned to computers to manage rice
production.
</P>
<P>
Wang Quanfu, a farmer in the suburbs of the province's capital
city Shenyang, said that he uses a computer program to help
calculate the irrigation costs for his 0.83 hectares of
rice. Another 40 hectares of rice in his village are under
computer supervision.
</P>
<P>
With the use of computers in farming, villagers have cut their
water charges for irrigation for every hectare of rice by 75 yuan
(about nine US dollars). And they've reduced their electric costs
by 300 yuan each hectare.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thanks to computer planning, 750 kg. of rice has
been added to the per hectare yield, or adding 1,200 yuan more to
the profit.
</P>
<P>
The local government has spent nearly 200,000 yuan (about
24,000 US dollars) to spread the use of computers in farmland
irrigation, and the scale is expected to expand to 340 hectares of
rice this year.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Shanghai to Shine in Each Other's Company (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and Shanghai are
expected to shine together as international financial centers
after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will complement each other rather than make each
other redundant, say experts today in interviews with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I disagree with views that Shanghai would shake Hong Kong's
status as a major international financial center after July 1,"
says Dennis K W Wong, Vice President of the Shanghai Branch with
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. "What's
fundamental in their relationship is that they are mutually
complementary and their differences are clear-cut."
</P>
<P>
An international financial center, Hong Kong, where 85 of the
world's top 100 banking institutions have a residence, has
convertible currency. Hong Kong ranks the world's fifth in daily
trading of foreign exchange and seventh in foreign exchange
reserves and stock market.
</P>
<P>
Besides 16 Chinese banks, Shanghai, has branches of only 47
overseas banks, nine of which have just got approval for
conditionally doing business in Renminbi currency in the Pudong
New Area, says Wong.

Kong's status. On the contrary, it will boost growth of Hong Kong
as an international financial center."
</P>
<P>
According to Mao, Shanghai will facilitate Hong Kong's status
as an international financial center in at least three aspects: an
increasing number of national financial markets such as inter-bank
lending, stock, foreign exchange, and insurance in Shanghai will
spur the influx of Hong Kong capital into Shanghai and inland
areas; the huge pool of capital in Shanghai provides for auxiliary
funds for overseas investment in China and Hong Kong may improve
its status if its financial institutions join hands with those in
Shanghai; with its expertise and a accurate reading of the market
pulse, Shanghai will be able to help Hong Kong's move into inland
markets.
</P>
<P>
International practices, effective management styles, and
managerial expertise, which are the keys to Hong Kong's success as
a world financial center, are guideposts for Shanghai's efforts to
build an international financial center and in these respects
Shanghai has much to learn from Hong Kong, says Jin Yun, President
of the Pudong Development Bank of Shanghai. "We hope to cooperate
with Hong Kong in training senior administrative personnel."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hong Kong and Shanghai have had fruitful cooperation
in the financial area since the 1980s. While Hong Kong bankers
have opened businesses in Shanghai and helped bring Shanghai
closer to the international financial circles, those from Shanghai
have also set up offices in Hong Kong and many firms in Shanghai
have been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
It's our firm belief that Hong Kong and Shanghai will join
hands to break new grounds in the financial sector and that the
two jewels will shine brilliantly with each other's light,
comments Anthony Neoh, Chairman of the Securities and Futures
Commission of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Further cooperation between Hong Kong and Shanghai after the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1 will contribute to
the uplifting of the financial status of both Hong Kong and
Shanghai, notes Zhao Qizheng, Vice Mayor of Shanghai. "With the
two lamps lit and shining together, the financial corridor on the
west bank of the Pacific Ocean will be more bright and brilliant,"
Zhao says.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A jump shot from Michael Jordan
in the final seconds lifted the defending champion Chicago Bulls
to an 84-82 victory over Utah Jazz in game one of the National
Basketball Association championship finals in Chicago on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's parting shot over a helpless Bryon Russell broke an
82-82 tie that he had established with a free throw 30 seconds
earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the interim, Chicago's Dennis Rodman fouled Karl Malone in a
scramble for a rebound to send the NBA's most valuable player to
the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
Malone, whose overall consistency has earned him the nickname
The Mailman, missed both of them with nine seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 19 of his 31 points in the second half. Scottie
Pippen, who appeared unhindered by his sore left foot, added 27
for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, who are gunning for their fifth NBA title in seven
years, host the Jazz in game two on Wednesday. Then the
best-of-seven series moves to Salt Lake City.

NEW DELHI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister I. K. Gujral is
reported to have written to state chief ministers to set up
special courts to try graft and bribery cases.

Gujral in a letter to the chief ministers has said corruption

In his letter, the prime minister also wants the states to
strengthen the people's concern and awareness against corruption
through suitable campaigns and educative ventures. He felt that
urgent steps are needed to restore the people's faith and

SHENYANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a major grain
producer in northeast China, has artificially stimulated rainfall
to ease tension on drought-hit farmland.
</P>
<P>
With the help of two planes leased by the provincial government
and 85 high-angle guns which launched catalytic agents into cloud
layers on May 28, rain fell over about 70,000 square kilometers of
land space.
</P>
<P>
The meterological department estimated that at least 280
million tons of rain water fell, equal to the amount of two
large-sized reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Since spring this year, Liaoning met with drought not seen
since the early 1950s. The rainfall was reduced by 20 to 80
percent in various parts of the province. The drought-hit farmland
reached 1.06 million hectares, and 150,000 farmers and 80,000
heads of cattle suffered from shortages of drinking water.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Party Set to Win Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's major ruling party is on
its way to win a landslide victory in the local elections held
across the country last month, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Latest results of the local polls, held in two phases on May 17
and 26 respectively, showed that the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) is far ahead of other major
parties, according to the Election Commission here.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML candidates have won in more than half of the country's
all local administration bodies as the polling results in most
local areas have been declared, a commission official said.
</P>
<P>
Final results of the local elections will come out in one or
two weeks as the polls in some villages and municipal wards have
been rescheduled due to election-related violence, the official
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier CPN-UML President Man Mohan Adhikari said his party,
the biggest in Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand's three-party
coalition, would consider a mid-term parliamentary election if it
wins the local polls.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML would easily win a simple majority in the 205-seat
lower house in the next legislative election, a senior party
official said.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML's arch rival in the hung parliament, the main
opposition Nepali Congress (NC), has been suffering a popularity
debacle in recent years mainly due to frequent intra-party
infighting and the rampant corruption during its rule, political
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The NC, after having ruled the country for most of the time
since 1990 when Nepal adopted the multi-party parliamentary system
and controlled some two-thirds of the country's local bodies in
the past five years, is likely to be reduced to a second-front
player on the country's political arena, they said.
</P>
<P>
An NC-led three-party government collapsed last March after
losing a confidence vote, paying the way for the CPN-UML to join
the government led by Chand, a leader of the NC's former ruling
partner the National Democratic Party (RPP).
</P>
<P>
A mass procession and rally with the participation of some
senior CPN-UML leaders was organized here Sunday to celebrate its
candidates' victory in this capital city.
</P>
<P>
The party's candidates have won the seats of mayor and deputy
major in Kathmandu, which were taken by the NC in the last local
elections in 1992.

<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Though the country experienced a
panic purchasing wave in the booming late 1980s, there will not be
such a nightmare this year when the national economy enters a new
round of rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
According to today's overseas version of the People's Daily,
the domestic market for consumption goods will maintain a stable
level in 1997, because the consumption trends of people show a
much higher diversity than ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
In order to prepare for housing and automobile purchases, most
urban residents will hardly put their savings into the market this
year. But, the domestic market for consumer goods will remain
active, as the demand for household electronic appliance rises in
cities and farmers' incomes increase steadily.
</P>
<P>
The supply of most industrial products will slightly exceed the
market demand. Agricultural produce, except for soy beans, will
also be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The country's retail sales will increase by 18.6 percent, or
10.8 percent if adjusted for inflation, the paper said.

index rebounding over the next few months, though the price hike
for consumer goods for residents kept a comparatively higher
increase margin.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial operation is on a smooth track, with a
balance basically achieved between the financial revenues and
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the second quarter, investment in
state-owned fixed assets will go up by 17 percent, thanks to the
increase in input in technical upgrading and real estate.
</P>
<P>
The export volume is expected to increase by 22.5 percent, a
slower growth rate than the previous quarters, while the increase
of imports stands at 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The industrial growth is estimated to be 15.8 percent for the
second quarter, however, that of the state-owned sector will be
7.8 percent, lagging far behind the country's average.
</P>
<P>
This year, the acreage under crops expanded by 1.6 million ha
on the basis of last year, but grain output could fluctuate this
fall because of the decline in maize planting, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Government Acts to Curb Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- After the baht suffered a second
major speculation attack earlier this year, the Thai government
has stepped in to curb foreign speculation, demonstrating its
determination to safeguard the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand called 36 commercial bank's treasurers for
a secret meeting in Bangkok on May 20, ordering them not to
provide any baht to foreign speculators.
</P>
<P>
The measure, called 'moral persuasion', seemed to help raise
the rate of the baht against the U.S. dollar after it was in
place, as many Thai financial institutions cut their credit lines
with their correspondent foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Yet, some foreign bank branches in Thailand did not follow the
Thai central bank's order, saying it was not clear enough.
</P>
<P>
To clarify its position, the Thai central bank sent a letter on
May 28 to every financial institution to identify what
transactions that it did not want them to undertake with
non-resident financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The letter urged to stop lending baht in foreign exchange swaps
to non-residents, stop buying foreign currencies and selling baht
to non-residents, stop backing premature baht-dominated promissory
notes, bills of exchange, certificates of deposits and debt
instruments from foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also required financial institutions to report
every transaction conducted by non-residents to it every day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it stressed that normal transactions involving
imports, exports and equity investment would be allowed, but the
documents of these transactions must be kept for the central
bank's examination.
</P>
<P>
The bank indicated that the measures would be temporary and
limited to transactions which may lead to speculation on baht.
</P>
<P>
The baht was traded at around 25.80 against the dollar over the
past week after the measures were introduced, slightly up from the
rate of about 25.90 earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In response to Thai central bank's move, foreign banks have
chosen to cut their credit lines with their Thai counterparts in
retaliation. Dealers said that Thailand may face a liquidity
shortage this week if the central bank does nothing.
</P>
<P>
Yet Thai officials assured foreign investors that the measures
would not affect normal foreign inflows of common international
trading and investment as they were introduced specifically
against speculators.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom has provided
320,000 U.S. dollars to Sri Lanka through the Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) to support the cultivation of food
and other field crops in the war-ravaged Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna Peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil rebels,
who have waged a guerrilla war for a separate state since 1983.
The government troops recaptured the peninsula in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, Jaffna farmers will be supplied with water
pumps and sprayers as well as vegetable, pulse and sesame seeds to
resume these crops' production this year, according to local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 farmer families in the 12 Agrarian Service Center
divisions in the peninsula will be selected as beneficiaries under
this project.

<HEADLINE> Measles Outbreak in Singapore with 700 Cases in 1st </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Cases of measles increased
sharply in Singapore with more than 700 reported in the first five
months of this year, representing a seven-fold rise from more than
100 cases over the same period last year, the Straits Times said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry reportedly said that this was the first
time in the last ten years or so that there has been such a steep
rise. About 45 percent of the reported cases were aged 15 and
above, and no deaths have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the jump was due to an accumulation of
adolescents and young adults who did not have measles before and
were not covered by the national childhood immunization program.
They are advised by the ministry to go to their family doctors or
polyclinics to be vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
Measles is an extremely contagious viral disease which spreads
through the air by droplets expelled by the infected person when
he sneezes or coughs.
</P>
<P>
Since the measles vaccine was first introduced here in 1976 and
immunization of all children aged between one and two was made
compulsory in 1985, cases of measles had dropped from 2,417 in
1984 to 146 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
This rate has since remained more or less constant, with only a
slight rise in 1992 and 1993. The ministry said its immunization
committee may consider introducing a second dose of measles
vaccine for children, which is the practice in Britain, the United
States and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Riots Continue on Madura Island, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Riots in Madura island, Indonesia's
east Java province, continued Sunday morning while the election
institute agreed to repeat balloting in the island's two towns on
June 3, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
A mob set ablaze a number of the local administrative offices
and houses. The house of a ruling party Golkar campaigner in
Pamekasan was set ablaze by unidentified persons Sunday morning,
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
They also burned and vandalized two sub-district offices and a
local education office.
</P>
<P>
The riots began soon after Thursday's (May 29) balloting in
which the United Development Party (PPP) supporters were
reportedly dissatisfied with the vote count. Police said that a
mob damaged the local administrative office, the house of a local
administrator and several shops and vehicles. 24 people were
detained, according to police.
</P>
<P>
However, PPP secretary general Tosary Widjaya said last Friday
the riots were provoked by the local election committee who did
not count the votes at the balloting booths. He added that the
party has filed a protest with the election committee proposing
that the Madurese towns be allowed to vote again.
</P>
<P>
The island of Madura is a Muslim stronghold and has thousands
of staunch supporters of the Muslim-led PPP.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed to hold a repeat election at 121
polling stations on June 3 in Sampang and Pamekasan.
</P>
<P>
However, Suryatna Soebrata, secretary general of the General
Election Institute said, "The decision to repeat the voting is
purely the decision of the local election committee and has
nothing to do with the PPP protest."
</P>
<P>
Soebrata denied rumors that the riots were provoked by
officials who did not count the votes at the voting booths. They
took the ballot boxes to the local administrative office.
</P>
<P>
"The ballot boxes were taken away to secure them from public
attack. The election workers were simply trying to avoid
ballot-box stuffing," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to provisional results, Golkar has headed for another
landslide victory with more than 74 percent of the votes in its
favor.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Per Capita GDP Projected to Exceed 30,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's per capita gross
domestic product (GDP) could surpass the 30,000-US-dollar mark
this year, overtaking the GDP figures in leading world economies
such as the United States and Germany, the Straits Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This means the average Singaporean will be more productive this
year and contribute more to the economy than his American and
German counterparts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the World Competitiveness Yearbook 1997, just released
by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management
Development, it said that Singapore's per capita GDP stood at
28,472 US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This placed Singapore in the eighth position, just behind
Germany and the United States, among the 46 economies studied by
the leading business institute.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times projected that Singapore's per capita GDP
will surpass 30,000 US dollars this year, thus reaching a
significant milestone in the national economic development.
</P>
<P>
Assuming a seven percent growth for the economy, and accounting
for the natural increase in populations, the 30,000-US-dollar
figure would in fact be exceeded by a comfortable margin, it said.
</P>
<P>
Per capita GDP is the total of all goods and services produced
per person in an economy over a year. It is calculated in US
dollars at current prices and exchange rates to enable an
international comparison.

FUZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The province of Fujian on China's
southeast coast plans to further tap the ocean's riches in the

plants. Preferential treatment policies are designed for foreign
companies who wish to invest in the projects.
</P>
<P>
For foreign-funded aquatic enterprises with at least a ten-year
contract, income tax exemptions will be given for two years,
according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises with a 15-year contract or longer will be exempt
from income tax for five years, beginning the year they start to

Bologna, Italy, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi tonight welcomed the victory of the French left in
Sunday's parliamentary election, saying Europe has been
strengthened by the election result.
</P>
<P>
"We were the first to change, then Great Britain and now
France," Prodi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"These latest events are very positive and important and they
put Italian politics back in the central mainstream," he said.
</P>
<P>
The European political scene has completely changed in one year
and one month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vote for French Socialist leader Lionel Jospin is "a vote
for reflection, given above all out of fear of going too far, the
fear of finding oneself alone in the face of the continent," added
the center-left government head.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he is anticipating a Europe that returns to the
roots of the great tradition of continental Europe, in which the
social system is transformed, not thrown out.
</P>
<P>
Italy was also strengthened, he said. "For a few months we were
described as the anomaly of Europe; now we find that another 120
million Europeans have voted like us and that seems to me to be
important."

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Helps With Ecological Balance (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people have expressed concern that building a huge
reservoir on the river will aggravate the existing pollution
problems, as the speed of the water flow will be reduced. In
response, Huang said, "The Three Gorges Project itself is not a
pollutive project. Pollution existed throughout history."
</P>
<P>
Actually, he pointed out, the state put pollution control on
top agenda as when the project started, and control efforts will
be redoubled in five cities along the river, namely Luzhou, Yibin,
Chongqing, Fuling and Wanxian. The government has also shut down a
number of paper mills on the banks.
</P>
<P>
As for soil erosion that might be brought on alongside with
resettlement of residents, Huang said that it can be controlled as
long as the relocation program is well-planned and
implemented. And China has been successful in restoring vegetation
in dam areas.
</P>
<P>
The country is also building a shelter-forest and carrying out
a soil conservation project along the river, he said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent relocated farmers from rampant land reclaiming and
lumbering, the government will set up an agricultural system
friendly to the environment, which includes helping farmers
interplant crops and plant cash trees, and develop a diversified
economy in the local courtyards.
</P>
<P>
As for the protection of biological diversity, Huang said that
China has set up a nature reserve in the Dalaoling Mountain near
Yichang to protect ancestral plants unique to the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
The country also plans to build landscape nature reserves in
Xingshan and Wushan. It will also set up a reserve on the upper
reaches to protect special fish species, a reserve on the middle
reaches to protect rare fish species, and one at the mouth of the
river to protect the Chinese sturgeon, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has set up an ecological and environmental
monitoring center to keep watch on unexpected effects the project
might have on the environment in the future.

<HEADLINE> Hingis, Graf on Course for Final Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- World top two women's players Martina
Hingis and Steffi Graf are well on course for their final showdown
with respective victories at the French Open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Five times champion Graf and the teenager who ousted her from
the top spot in the world rankings last March must still clear
some tricky hurdles if they want to face each other next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But they have both used their early matches to boost their
confidence, reaching the quarter-finals more smoothly than
expected after battling recent injuries.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Hingis, who beat Austria's Barbara Paulus 6-3,
0-6, 6-0 in a strange match to advance to the last eight on
Sunday, now faces a tough test against Spain's Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario.
</P>
<P>
Graf, still wearing a bandage on the injured left knee which
sidelined her for three months earlier in the season, looked as
fit as ever on her way to her 6-7, 6-2, 6-2 win over Romania's
Irina Spirlea.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Graf, who will appear in the quarter-finals at
Roland Garros for the 12th consecutive year, next meets an
opponent she knows well in Amanda Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive South African, who impressed by overcoming
Spain's Conchita Martinez for the first time on Sunday, has beaten
Graf twice this season, including an embarrassing 6-0, 6-1 victory
at the German Open.
</P>
<P>
American Monica Seles, who has attracted little attention,
nevertheless made it to the quarter-finals of an event she won
three times in a row from 1990 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav-born Seles, seeded third this year, shrugged off a
brave challenge from local favourite Mary Pierce of France to win
an exciting match 6-4, 7-5 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Seles next meets 12th seed Mary Joe Fernandez, who struggled
before moving past fellow American Lisa Raymond 6-7, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Croat Iva Majoli, the ninth seed, upset fifth seed American
Lindsay Davenport in three sets to set up an intriguing showdown
with Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir, the only non-seeded player left
in the women's draw.

<HEADLINE> Offshore Fishing Ban Conserving Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture will
tighten and continue to enforce a stay on offshore fishing this
year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of offshore fishing will serve as an effort to
conserve marine resources, especially the threat to the immature
"hairtail" species of fish.
</P>
<P>
The moratorium is entering its third continuous year. This year
the moratorium will enter its second phase, beginning from
September 1 to October 31.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Jian, deputy director of the ministry's
Bureau of Fisheries, fishing activities will be curtailed within
30 nautical miles of shore in an area located between 27 and 35
degrees north latitude.
</P>
<P>
"The move to suspend offshore fishing from July 1 to August 31,
in the northern part of the East China Sea and the South Yellow
Sea has been successful," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
No fishing boats were seen in the areas during the July-August
period in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
But during the September-October period, he noted, control is
expected to be tightened when fishing is allowed outside the
30-nautical-mile line.
</P>
<P>
Yang warned that uncontroled fishing in September and October
is likely to ruin the achievements made in July and August.
</P>
<P>
Partly because of the moratorium, output in fishing declined
last year, compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
The second phase stipulates that immature fish should account
for no more than a quarter of all catches.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will cooperate with the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce to control the conditional fishing.
</P>
<P>
Catches during the period will be checked in ports, markets,
storehouses and customs to ensure the percentage is observed.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, after the first ban in 1995,
"hairtail" output increased 30 percent from that in 1994 and
stocks of "yellow croakers" also began to recover.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Fisheries may extend the annual moratorium in
terms of duration and area in 1998, following three years of
enforcement of the present ban, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Neither the domestic nor the international market for aquatic
animals have been or will be influenced by the moratorium on
Chinese offshore fishing, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
China has a high output of fish from inland areas and deep
seas. Over half output of aquatic products come from
aquaculture. Moreover, dealers have stored up enough for the
market demand during the moratorium.

<P>
JINAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A large number of college graduates
are helming the marketing departments of Shandong Province's
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Yantai Zhangyu Group, a 100-year-old firm, has employed 120
college graduates for its marketing department just in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
The company's major economic indexes have for several years led
the trade.
</P>
<P>
The graduates, fixing their eyes on the market, have increased
the profiting capacity of the province's state-owned firms. A
small medicine plant that used to be on the verge of bankruptcy
has become the backbone of the province's state-owned companies,
whose sales income reached 450 million yuan (about 56 million US
dollars) last year, and pre-tax profit reached 32.9 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> China Revives as Susanti Signs Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, June 1 (Xinhua) -- With its success at the
World Championships, China revived to dominate the world badminton
again after a slump in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Almost repeating their All England victories, the Oriental
power took three out of five golds available at the individual
championships after retaining the Sudirman Cup, which brings the
total number of their world titles to 21.
</P>
<P>
An awesome squad of Chinese women's singles players occupied
six berths in the last eight before teenager Gong Zhichao forced
Indonesia's Susi Susanti to sign off her last championships in a
losing note.
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhaoying ousted Susanti's heir-apparent Mia Audina in
another quarterfinal on her way to successful defence of her crown
taken at Lausanne, Switzerland, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The supremacy could mean that in the years leading to the 2000
Olympic Games, there would probably be no challenger capable to
break the Chinese stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Susanti, an all-time legend who had won all major badminton
events in her career, said she could still play one more year but
that was still in question because she would need the consent from
her husband Allan Budi Kusuma.
</P>
<P>
Possibly the best all-round doubles player in the world, the
silent 21-year-old Ge Fei proved to be key to half of the Chinese
triumph.
</P>
<P>
Ge teammed up with Gu Jun to set the standard for any shuttler
when they completed a "Grand Slam" of the Olympic, World
Championships, All England, World Grand Prix Finals and the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
After the retirement of reigning champion Gil Young Ah, their
position at the badminton worlds was so strong that no other pair
could even draw from them more than eight points in a whole match.
</P>
<P>
Ge's six-month parternership with Liu Yong also produced
stunning fruit in the mixed doubles, snatching every event they
competed this year. Even Denmark's 1995 champion-runnerup
combination could not stop them in the three-game final.
</P>
<P>
What could be the most noticeable fact here is the European, or
Danish to be more exact, encroachment on the Asians in the men's
singles.
</P>
<P>
Instead of only two quarter-final slots two years ago, the
Danish camp claimed four this time.
</P>
<P>
And most remarkably, the student doctor Peter Rasmussen
defeated a cramp-haunted Sun Jun for the first Danish title in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
The biggest regret here could be world number one Dong Jiong,
who was denied another grand show by influenza after injuries
forced him out two years ago.
</P>
<P>
With three more years to go for the Sydney Olympic Games, the
Chinese victories is no doubt a boost of morale.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Li Yongbo said, "I am elated to see our
contingent for Sydney became so matured here. I would say two
golds should not be very difficult."
</P>
<P>
The men's doubles is still the Indonesian teritory. Although
Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky failed to repeat their Olympic
final victory over Malaysians Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock in a
close semifinal, Candra Wijaya and Budiarto Sigit, considered out
of mould of Ricky and Rexy, carried on their torch to win the
final.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Untired of his self-proclaimed role
as the Philippines' foremost salesman, President Fidel Ramos will
visit at least seven more countries this year.
</P>
<P>
Ramos will journey to Britain, Greece and Oman by the third
week of this month, although the Presidential Palace has not yet
officially announced his trip to the three countries, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to fly to Canada toward the latter part of
the year to reciprocate Prime Minister Jean Chretien's state visit
to the Philippines last year, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
While in Canada, the President would also attend the fifth
informal leaders' meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) in Vancouver, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Palace sources said that before flying to Canada,
the President may make a stopover in New Work to address the
United Nations on population and demographic issues.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon disclosed earlier that a trip
to Peru, Argentina and Chile was also being "tentatively
considered".
</P>
<P>
President Ramos has traveled to at least 30 countries and
regions after he came to power in 1998. He described himself the
No.1 salesman of the Philippines, saying his trips abroad had
drawn 20 billion U.S. dollars in investments into the country.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Helps With Ecological Balance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Three Gorges Project, the
world's largest water-control endeavor, will create a new
ecological balance in the valley of the Yangtze River, according
to a Chinese environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
"The valley is in fact not ecologically balanced at present,
and the largest environmental problem is flooding," Dr. Huang
Zhenli told a seminar of the Young Scientists Forum held recently
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Other environmental problems which endanger the ecological
balance of the middle reaches of the river include soil erosion
and water pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout history, the mighty river has frequently brought
disaster to its surrounding areas, said Huang, an official with
the Three Gorges Project Construction Commission of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
In this century, three major floods have struck the "Mother
River," Huang said. Floods in 1931 and 1935 killed 145,000 and
142,000 people respectively. In 1954, another flood left more than
30,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
"The floods have not only caused heavy death tolls, but also
wreaked havoc on the ecological system in the valley," he said.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Three Gorges Project will prevent similar
catastrophic floods, and slow the shrinkage of the country's
largest freshwater lake Dongting because of sand silting. At the
same time, the hydroelectric project will provide a clean energy
source.
</P>
<P>
It will also reduce infiltration of salty water into the river
mouth during the dry-water season, thereby improving water quality
in China's largest industrial and commercial center of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"In a word, the project will help set up an ecological balance
in the river valley, especially in the middle and upper reaches of
the river," he said.

<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's Claudia Poll beat
Russian Denis Pankratov on Sunday at the Canet international
swimming meeting in Canet, France.
</P>
<P>
Poll, winner of Olympic 200 meters freestyle, clocked two world
bests of the season over the weekend, 1:58.18 in her favourite
event of the 200 meters and 4:10.56 in the 400 meter, reports said.
</P>
<P>
After badly missing an attempt at his own 200 meters butterfly
world mark on Saturday, Pankratov decided not to take part in
Sunday's 100 meters in order to return to Russia to prepare for
the European championships in Seville in August.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was hampered as most European swimmers seemed to be
concentrating on the big event.

<HEADLINE> Malfeasance Investigation Bureau Set up in Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A bureau to look into reports of
malfeasance has been established by the Hunan Provincial People's
Procuratorate in the central Chinese province as the first in
China dealing specifically with officials who are accused of
dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
It will act in parallel to the procuratorate's anti-corruption
bureau, to enhance fight against official misconduct, local
law-enforcement sources say.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, procuratorate departments in Hunan have had
some success in dealing with malfeasance cases, and investigated
1,065 last year.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that the anti-corruption bureau has helped
penalize those who committed economic crimes, but that crimes
involving dereliction of duty have not been contained.
</P>
<P>
With the revision of China's Criminal Law by the top
legislature in March this year, the definition of dereliction of
duty has broadened to apply to 32 actions instead of 15, local
officials say.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Name-Brand Products Are Mainstay of Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A survey headed by the State
Statistics Bureau has revealed that 33 domestic name-brand
products among the 44 sampled have a marketshare of more than 70
percent, and such products as refrigerators and washing machines
have a market share of more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestic name-brand products for daily use such as
water-heating machines, instant noodles, alcohol, and clothing
have a solid foundation, with production capabilities and product
quality reaching high levels.
</P>
<P>
Competition is fierce in the market of color TVs, micro-wave
ovens, and motor-cycles, but domestic name-brand products have
gained a firm foothold.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 72 percent of the air-conditioning market was made up
of domestic name-brand products. The ratio is expected to rise to
79 percent in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-brand products, however, still hold the lead in some
areas. For example, 68 percent of the consumers surveyed would
like to buy foreign-brand component stereo equipment.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Deadline for Rural Firms to Meet Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China has set a deadline for rural
firms to meet high standards in production and quality control,
according to a report.
</P>
<P>
The state has urged more than half of the major industrial
products from rural enterprises in eastern areas and 30 percent of
the major products from western regions to reach international
standards or advanced foreign standards within five years, China
Daily said today.
</P>
<P>
But officials acknowleged that governments at all levels,
especially those of the country's 2,143 counties and county-level
cities, have to make "tremendous efforts" to reach the goal, the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
County economies are becoming an important part of the national
economy, with the total output value of rural industries reaching
44 percent of the country's total in 1995, statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
But before 1995, about one-third of the products from
industrial enterprises in rural areas were made without definite
technical standards, said Li Chuanqing, director of the State
Bureau of Technical Supervision (SBTS), China's watchdog of
standardization, metrology and quality control.
</P>
<P>
This has seriously affected the quality of products and the
growth of economic efficiency of rural enterprises, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the bureau launched an experiment to raise the
standard and quality of production in 103 counties in early 1995
and has made initial success.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Province Tough on Gold Panning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- For years, farmers living by the
Lushuijiang River could not irrigate their land with the
poor-quality water, which worsened by the day as the result of
ambitious gold-diggers and their diesel-driven panning boats.
</P>
<P>
"The river was on the verge of ruination," says one indignant
villager from the poverty-stricken Longan County.
</P>
<P>
Now, after strict government action to control illegal panning
practices, the river water runs clear and local farmers are
delighted with their harvests.
</P>
<P>
Most heavily affected was the Xinguang section of the river,
near the Longhushan Natural Reserve in southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, about one hundred km. away from the
region's capital city of Nanning.
</P>
<P>
Villagers say it's hard to imagine the time when there were
more than 120 boats panning for gold floating on a section within 3.7
km. of the river with 70-plus diesel engines and over 3,000
gold-diggers on board.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the content of gold in every cubic meter
of sand in this section of the river reaches 0.3 to 0.5 grams, and
the purity of the gold is especially high.
</P>
<P>
But haphazard panning wreaked havoc on the river water and
surrounding land.
</P>
<P>
"Sand piles had emerged above the water surface, blocking up
the river," said Huang Huisong, secretary of the Longan County
Committee of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The riverbank was nearly destroyed, as was about 83 mu (about
5.5 hectares) of farmland. Meanwhile, the irrigation of more than
25,000 mu (about 1,667 hectares) of land was seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
"The water quality deteriorated greatly, and the natural
landscape of the nearby natural reserve also received some
damage," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, in compliance with state law, the regional and
county governments put a stop to all damaging panning
activities. Government officials confiscated and dismantled all
equipment of law-breakers who continued to pan.
</P>
<P>
And to further aid the financially-troubled county, the local
government has spent 120,000 yuan (about 15,000 US dollars) to
dredge the river and help resume the cultivation of the devastated
farmland.
</P>
<P>
"We have planted spring corn on 27 mu of the recovered land,"
Huang said, adding that most of the environmental reclamation work
is finished, and the government is now focusing on improving the
local ecology.
</P>
<P>
Action has been taken to stop illegal panning in several other
cities in the county, he said.

<HEADLINE> Unleaded Petrol Now Available in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- About 292 gas stations in Beijing
started selling unleaded petrol yesterday.
</P>
<P>
By January 1, 1998, the city's 700 gas stations, including
those in rural areas, will have no alternative but to sell
unleaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
Ye Junlong, assistant at a gas station in Xicheng District,
gave each of his customers information about the pollution that
leaded fuel causes and where they can change their old fuel
tickets into new ones.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the customers have known about this, and they don't
care that much about the price increase," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The price for unleaded petrol 90 and 93 is 2.23 yuan (0.27 US
dollars) and 2.4 yuan (0.29 US dollars) per litre, 0.11 yuan
(0.013 US dollars) and 0.16 yuan (0.019 US dollars) more expensive
than leaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
"We have been selling unleaded petrol for more than a
fortnight," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
One customer said it is more convenient for him since his car
can only use unleaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Guohua, a taxi driver, said it will cost him 120 yuan
(14.5 US dollars) more on fuel each month.
</P>
<P>
"Cleaner air is worth the price since my studio is right in the
open," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
The move is necessary to reduce lead content in the air. It is
also important to install catalytic converters in motor vehicles
to clean exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
Unleaded petrol producers must get ready to supply 1.17 million
cars in China.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Chief Urged to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa has been urged to resign from his post after he announced
his plan to run for the Presidency in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, leaders of Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino
(Laban), the biggest opposition party in the country, demanded on
Sunday the quit of de Villa, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
De Villa, one of the possible nominees of President Fidel
Ramos, declared over the weekend that he would run under the
ruling Lakas party banner in 1998 and would not seek nomination
outside Lakas.
</P>
<P>
"Since he has formally declared his plan to join Lakas and run
for President next year, Secretary de Villa should resign form the
Ramos Cabinet", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
De Villa should heed the call of Lakas Senator Leticia Shahani
who urged Lakas leaders holding key party positions to relinquish
their posts to level the playing field in the selection of Lakas'
candidate in 1998, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the early resignation of de Villa would also
prevent the military chief from using government sources to
advance his 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Besides the defense portfolio, de Villa also chairs the
National Peace and Order Council and the National Disaster
Coordinating Center, which oversees the government's relief and
rehabilitation efforts in calamity-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
De Villa has to join Lakas first before he gets the support of
the president. Ramos' apointment was reportedly a guarantee of
success in the 1998 elections.

<HEADLINE> Albania Determined to Seek NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha said
today that it is one of his country's unchangeable strategic
targets to enter NATO although the nation is faced with great
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Berisha hailed the appeal by U.S. State Secretary Madeleine
Albright that NATO helps Albania rebuild its troops, a
presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At the NATO foreign ministers meeting last Thursday, Albright
said that the alliance should send a mission to Albania to assess
the conditions of the Albanian troops so as to facilitate the
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Albania remains volatile despite the
deployment of a multinational military force there. Rioting and
looting caused by the collapse of shady government investment
schemes in March turned into armed violence against President
Berisha in the south of Albania, killing more than 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Wins Match Race As Johnson Stops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Donovan Bailey, the Olympic
gold medalist at 100 meters, beat American Michael Johnson to win
their 150-meter match race in 14.99 seconds in Toronto Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The unofficial 150-meter world mark of 14.93 seconds was set in
1993 by Britain's John Regis.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the 200- and 400-meter champion in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, stopped running midway through due to a leg cramp,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"I had a problem with cramping in the curve," Johnson was
quoted as saying. "I ignored the importance of the injury."
</P>
<P>
Bailey, running in front of a raucous home crowd at SkyDome,
won 1 million U.S. dollars in the One on One Challenge of
Champions.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian never looked like anything but a winner as he
burst out of the blocks and was well ahead halfway around the 75
meter curve.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that, Johnson gave up, dropping into a jog, then
a walk, then stopping, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Despite Johnson's triumph, the lack of a full-speed finish was
a disappointment to a crowd of about 40,000 people at SkyDome
indoor stadium.

<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China's Ye Zhaoying
retained her world women's singles title after beating fellow
countrywomen Gong Zhichao 12-11, 11-8 in the world badminton
championships final here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gong Zhichao took the silver medal. Another two Chinese Wang
Chen and Han Jingna were both placed third.
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy today. It was hard to beat any of my teammates
because they knew my style so well," Ye told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
After they tied the first game 9-9 to go into the setting, Gong
reached the game point at 11-9 but Ye staged a comeback to take
the game.
</P>
<P>
Ye, who beat Gong in 12 minutes to win the All England Open
this March, met few trouble in the second game and scrolled to her
second consecutive world title.
</P>
<P>
"It was harder to play a national championships than an
international event," said Ye after the 45-minute match. "I
thought I would have a 50-50 chance in today's match."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the role of her teammates here, Ye said, "They
hold their post well."
</P>
<P>
Two Indonesians were knocked out the quarter-finals by the
Chinese, with Wang beating Mia Audina and Gong disposing of Susi
Susanti.
</P>
<P>
Ye, 23, said she is now preparing for the badminton competition
at National Games in October.

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard and Leader of the Opposition Kim
Beazley are expected to meet this week in an effort to reduce the
risk of a divisive double dissolution election on federal race
powers.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- An audacious 616 million US dollar plan has emerged to renew
hope that Sydney's most hated building, the apartment complex at
East Circular Quay, can be torn down, in an attempt to reopen the
panoramic views to the Opera House and Royal Botanical Gardens.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard yesterday accused the Opposition
of hypocrisy over its calls for compensation for aboriginal stolen
children, saying the Labor Party had opposed making payments while
in government. About 100,000 aboriginal children were forcibly
removed from their families under the nation's infamous
assimilation policies during 1910-1970.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government has decided to cap payments of the
616 million US dollar diesel fuel rebate to mining companies,
sparking strong protests from the industry.

<HEADLINE> Daughter of Le Pen Loses in Legislative Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Marie-Caroline Le Pen, the daughter
of the leader of the extreme-right National Front (FN) Jean Marie
Le Pen, today lost the legislative election, winning 24.09 percent
of votes in her constituency in Mantes-la-Jolie near Paris.
</P>
<P>
Socialist candidate Annette Peulvast-Bergeal, whom Le Pen
personally harassed and hit with fists during a campaign clash
last week, won the election with 40.29 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FN mayor of Toulon, Jean-Marie Le Chevallier,
today became the only parliament deputy to represent the extreme
right party in the National Assembly by winning the election in
his constituency of the southern department of Var.
</P>
<P>
After the outcome of the legislative election was published, Le
Pen again called on President Jacques Chirac to resign.
</P>
<P>
"Jacques Chirac played quit or double. He lost. He was beaten
twice in majority of suffrage for the first and in the seats for
the second," said Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the former center-right majority is now
eating the bitter fruit of "diabolizing the FN."
</P>
<P>
The FN, which won a record high of 15 percent of votes in the
first round of the election, could from now on take advantage of
the failure of the center-right coalition by luring support from
the partisans of the right.

<HEADLINE> New Majority Does Not Promise Moon to French People: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- French Socialist chief Lionel Jospin,
coming victorious from the legislative election, said this evening
that the new leftwing parliament majority does not promise a moon
to the French people, but will meet their reasonable and realistic
demands.
</P>
<P>
Calling all the leftwing forces "forces of change" which have
"crowned" the legislative election, he congratulated the partisans
of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Movement of
Citizens, the Greens and radical socialists on their victory.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the happiness felt by me and many others this evening,
the strong feeling that this very important election inspired in
me is that of a profound demand which comes from our people," said
Jospin in his declaration after primary projections declared a
clear victory by the leftist parties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the demand is not for a miracle that no one
believes, but one which is "reasonable and pressing for the real
progress in a period of time for the Frenchwomen and Frenchmen,
particularly for the least favored among them."
</P>
<P>
He said that the French people are demanding "justice, a
profound renovation of public life and our democracy, an economic
and social policy to be implanted for the service of man, a
reorientation of the European construction to which we will hold
on, and a scrupulous attention to the problems met by the French
people in their daily life."
</P>
<P>
He said that the leftist majority will meet the demands by
listening to the citizens, holding dialogue with them and
proposing new and realistic measures to realize their wishes.
</P>
<P>
"We would have the obligation to mobilize all our energy, all
our heart, all our competence, to put into work this different
policy for which the new majority has just been elected," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Bailey Beats Johnson in One-to-One Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Olympic gold medal sprinter
Donovan Bailey beat his U.S. rival Michael Johnson in a one-to-one
race in Toronto today.
</P>
<P>
Bailey was the first to finish the 150-meter track in 14.99
seconds, while U.S. sprinter Michael Johnson failed to reach the
end.
</P>
<P>
The pullout by Johnson proved that "he was a chicken," an
excited Bailey told the CBC Television, which broadcast live the
race.
</P>
<P>
It also exposed Johnson's "weakness" and he was afraid to lose,
Canada's Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
The winner stressed that he had "never any doubt" that he
himself is the fastest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
Bailey got the title of the world's fastest man, and 1.5
million U.S. dollars. The loser got a paltry 500,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Today's race was supposedly to settle the debate over who is
the fastest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
Bailey set the world record and won the gold medal in the 100
meters at last year's Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, while
Johnson became the first male Olympian to win both the 200- and
400-meter races.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the games, there has been a controversy as to who is
really "the world's fastest man."
</P>
<P>
The Canadians say the title should go to Bailey, since
traditionally the title has always belonged to the current world
or Olympic champion in the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the U.S. insists that Johnson has every reason to have
access to that title.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Bailey and Johnson announced that they
would participate in the race which was over 150 meters on a
curved track, midway between Bailey's 100-meter event and
Johnson's 200.

<HEADLINE> Mitterrand's Prophecy on Quick Socialist Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- When former French President Francois
Mitterrand was lying in his deathbed, he left this prophecy: "You
will see that the left will return more quickly than one can think
of."
</P>
<P>
Today, the former Socialist president's prophecy has come true,
as the Socialist Party scored a clear majority in the National
Assembly today after living only four years as a minority.
</P>
<P>
Another thing Mitterrand did for his party was that he
handpicked Lionel Jospin, today's Socialist chief of France, as
the first secretary of the party in 1981.
</P>
<P>
"He is capable of fulfilling the highest functions," Mitterrand
once said of Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, the 59-year-old Socialist chief, who will be the next
French prime minister with the back-up of a left parliament
majority, strikes one first of all as a strict college professor
who can win the confidence of his students with his sincerity,
patience and steadfastness.
</P>
<P>
Born in Meudon near Paris, Jospin was from a family worshipping
the Protestant Church. His father, a school teacher, devoted his
life to teaching handicapped children, and his mother was a
mid-wife.
</P>
<P>
"I was a good child, but I lost much of my time playing and
running after girls, doing sports and organizing student unions.
What interests me is not competition, but life itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holder of a doctorate degree of political science from the
prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, Jospin formally
entered the political stage of France in June 1981 by winning the
parliamentary election in Paris.
</P>
<P>
While holding parliament deputy's posts for Paris and the
southwestern department of Haute-Garonne in the 1980s, he also
served as minister of state and minister of education, scientific
research and sport under two Socialist prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
In February 1995, Jospin presented himself as the candidate for
the presidential election after Jacques Delors quit the race. He
proved his capability by raising the support rate of his party
from 23 percent to 47.3 percent within three months.
</P>
<P>
He reorganized the Socialist Party after the defeat in the 1995
presidential election, and presented a whole set of policies on
European construction, employment, social and economic strategies,
democracy and institutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Tirelessly running this legislative campaign over the past one
month by meeting people everywhere and appearing on television
frequently, Jospin won support from the voters with his warm
humane sincerity, a character strikingly different from his rival,
Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Jospin publicly opposes the American style market force
economic theory, and calls for a reorientation of European
construction, promotion of social justice, renovation of public
life and a socio-economic policy which serves the interests of the
people.
