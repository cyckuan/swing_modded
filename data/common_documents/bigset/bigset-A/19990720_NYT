METS BEAT ORIOLES, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (w) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Octavio Dotel's performance on Mondy night
suggested he could be attractive enough, all by himself, for the
New York Mets to trade him for a top starter before the July 31
trading deadline. But now the Mets must decide if they want to keep
him instead.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth major league start, Dotel, a 23-year-old
right-hander, stymied the Baltimore Orioles on one run and three
hits over seven innings in the Mets' 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Mets' fourth in five games since the
All-Star Game break and second in a row here at Camden Yards. Since
June 6, the day they ended an eight-game losing streak, the Mets
(54-40) have a 27-12 record, best in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel (2-1) struck out 5 on just 91 pitches as the Mets pulled
to 14 games over .500, their best of the season, and moved within
three games of the first-place Atlanta Braves, who lost to Toronto,
in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Dotel could help down the stretch, Manager Bobby
Valentine said: ``Absolutely. I think he will only get better with
confidence and knowing that he can throw other pitches than his
fastball. He's a wild card, and unknown to other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips would not commit himself on
Dotel, saying: ``You have to ask yourself that question, whether he
can be the solution to our needs. It's a matter of whether he can
fill that void down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel said, ``I don't want to say that I'm the answer, but I'm
going to be here and they're going to see if I can do what they're
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   With about a dozen scouts watching, Dotel's fastball was
consistently clocked from 92 to 96 miles an hour through the first
six innings. And the Orioles were having a hard time catching up.
Only Will Clark, who blasted a 94-mile-an-hour pitch on an 0-2
count into the right-center-field bleachers, had the rookie figured
out.
</P>
<P>
   The other two hits Dotel had allowed through six innings were a
single to B.J. Surhoff in the fourth inning, which had followed a
one-out walk to Mike Bordick, and a leadoff single to Bordick in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Dotel got Albert Belle to line a slider hard to
center field for the second out. Then, after Dotel threw an
attempted pickoff into center field to allow the runners to advance
to second and third, he induced Harold Baines to fly out to right.
</P>
<P>
   And in the sixth, after Bordick's single, it took Dotel six
pitches to retire the side. And so the Mets took a 2-1 lead into
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets left the bases loaded in both the first (with one out)
and in the third (with two outs). And even when they scored a pair
of runs in the fifth off the rookie right-hander Jason Johnson to
drive him from the game, the Mets left another two runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson scored the first run to pull within one of
Willie Mays' 2,062 career runs, fifth on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was the designated hitter on Monday night for the
first time since Sept. 18, 1997, when he was with the Angels. It
was Manager Bobby Valentine's way of giving the 40-year-old left
fielder's legs a little rest.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson walked to lead off the game before eventually being
stranded on third.
</P>
<P>
   To open the fifth, he beat out an infield single to shortstop.
He moved to second on Edgardo Alfonzo's grounder to short and went
to third on a deep fly ball to right-center off John Olerud's bat.
When Mike Piazza lined a 1-0 pitch to left, Henderson scored the
game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza scored after Robin Ventura and Benny Agbayani singled.
But Clark's homer in the fifth cut the deficit in half. Dotel
finally got a comfortable margin in the seventh inning when Alfonzo
and Ventura homered off Arthur Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel tossed a scoreless seventh but was tiring. He hit one
batter, and his fastball dropped to the range of 89 to 92 miles an
hour. Only when he struck out pinch-hitter Jeff Conine to end the
inning did Dotel's fastball hit 95 again.
</P>
<P>
   The thin right-hander pumped his fist as he walked off the
mound, knowing that he had turned in a job well done. &QL;

EDITORIAL: GAINS AND LOSSES ON HIV 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, July 20:
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of gay and bisexual men in New York City showed
encouraging evidence that many members of the gay community are
acting responsibly to reduce the risk of HIV infection. The survey,
an unusual collaboration between the Department of Health and the
Gay Men's Health Crisis, a nonprofit AIDS organization in New York,
supports a growing consensus that perhaps only half as many gay men
in the city are infected with HIV as in 1985. But the survey also
points to breakdowns in education about HIV, especially in black
and Latino communities.
</P>
<P>
   The survey reached more than 7,000 participants in all boroughs
of New York City, more than any previous effort. It showed that HIV
prevention efforts there have clearly made an impact among gay men.
But it offered no grounds for complacency. For example, the rate of
new HIV infections in black and Latino populations, heterosexual
and homosexual, is disproportionately higher than it is among
Caucasians. This is partly due to the persistent but false
perception that HIV is a disease affecting white gay men and drug
users. Moreover, education programs have tended to focus on white
gay men, while prevention efforts among heterosexuals and
minorities have languished. Thus many potential victims _ including
heterosexual women involved with drug users _ are not getting the
attention they need.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 Americans are unaware that they are
infected with HIV &UR; . &LR;  One antidote to such ignorance is more free
testing, along the lines of the annual National HIV Testing Day,
sponsored a few weeks ago by the National Association for People
with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Public-private cooperation is also essential. The joint survey
undertaken by New York City's Health Department and the Gay Men's
Health Crisis is a case in point. Chicago has gone even further,
involving political leaders, city agencies and an array of
community groups in a broad-based network designed to provide both
treatment and prevention. The program receives strong support from
the mayor and the governor of Illinois. New York politicians and
local groups should strive toward such a model.

10 YEAR AFTER NAVAJO CHAIRMAN'S DOWN FALL, TURMOIL REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL DONOVAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK - When about 50 supporters of embattled Navajo
Tribal Chairman Peter MacDonald stormed tribal offices 10 years ago
today, they were seeking only to force release of payroll checks
for MacDonald appointees.
</P>
<P>
   But the riot, which lasted less than 10 minutes, would have a
profound affect on the political life of the Navajos and on the man
they were trying to restore to power.
</P>
<P>
   In its wake, bitter feelings remain among tribal members,
MacDonald remains in a federal prison, the tribe remains without a
charismatic leader and the tribal chairmanship has been replaced
with a less-powerful office of president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still seeing the effects of that time today,'' said
Tazbah McCullah, MacDonald's press officer in early 1989 _ which
tribal members still call ``the days of turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, 68, is now in federal prison, along with three of his
supporters who participated in the disturbance. Seven others were
imprisoned and released for their roles in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   McCullah now runs the tribal radio station, but for years she
and others who served under MacDonald were unable to get jobs in
tribal government. In fact, she and several others were under
tribal court order for a year prohibiting them from entering
government buildings or participating in tribal government in any
way.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials cite the turmoil and the feelings it stirred up
as one of the primary reasons why voter turnout today for tribal
elections is down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MacDonald supporters, who still number in the
thousands, say they are searching _ without success _ for a leader
as charismatic and visionary as MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, who in 1983 was labeled by ``Mother Jones''``''
magazine as the ``most powerful Indian leader in America,''
dominated tribal politics for much of the 1970s and 80s. He
controlled the tribal council and single-handedly decided which
communities got federally funded projects and which did not.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1988, MacDonald's opponents seized upon the tribe's
purchase of the Boquillas Ranch just west of the reservation line.
U.S. Senate subcommittee hearings revealed that friends of
MacDonald made $7 million from the purchase, with MacDonald slated
to get part of it.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the door to a number of other tribal and federal
charges, resulting in the tribal council's suspending MacDonald
from office in February 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, his supporters held a number of
demonstrations, took over the chairman's office twice and generally
refused to accept any government that did not have MacDonald at the
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still feel that the council made a mistake by taking the
government away from the people,'' said Vern Lee, who now heads a
MacDonald support group in Shiprock, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Many MacDonald supporters still feel most bitter towards tribal
politicians of that time who went after MacDonald. By 1991, the
tribe had spent more than a million dollars hiring a special
prosecutor to investigate MacDonald, leading to convictions in
tribal court on charges including taking bribes and misusing his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Then MacDonald was convicted in federal court and sentenced to
14 years imprisonment for taking bribes and conspiracy-related
charges connected to the riot. He's not up for parole until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But Wanda MacDonald, his wife, is still talking to federal and
state officials, trying to get support for a commutation or
compassionate release for her husband. She's also seeking to get
him transferred from a Texas prison to one in Arizona so family and
supporters could visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``His condition continues to get worse and worse. We need to
have him transferred as soon as possible to some place where he had
get adequate medical treatment,'' she said. Earlier this year, both
houses of the Arizona Legislature passed memorials supporting a
transfer to a state prison.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald is currently being treated for several medical
problems, the most serious of which stem from a minor heart attack
he suffered two years ago and hip problems that have confined him
to a wheelchair. Visitors say that his morale remains good but that
he seems to be losing hope of seeing his homelands again.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said that his supporters are also losing hope, even though
the tribal government has pardoned MacDonald and tribal leaders say
they have been pushing President Clinton for an early release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many have given up on current tribal leaders,'' said Lee, who
added that many Navajos just don't bother to vote anymore because
there are no leaders with the charisma of MacDonald or MacDonald's
long-time political foe, Peterson Zah.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for the first time since 1970, there was no MacDonald
or Zah running for the tribe's top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Although a lot of Navajos were urging him to run, Zah, now a
special adviser to the president of Arizona State University,
declined. He said that ``it wasn't fun anymore'' to lead the tribe
because of the changes following MacDonald's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure no one would ever wield the power MacDonald did,
tribal council members did away with the chairmanship and replaced
it with a presidency with far less power.
</P>
<P>
   It also hasn't helped that three of the leaders after MacDonald
have either been indicted by a federal grand jury or forced from
office for violating tribal ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who would be good leaders no longer want to get
involved in the tribal government,'' McCullah said. ``There's just
too much of a wild-dog pack mentality in the government where you
see tribal leaders being targeted for little things.'' &QL;

INTERNET COMES TO LIFE: C-SECTION DELIVERS TRIPLETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The miracle of life for the Diaz family began Monday
with some squeamish moments.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty family members, ages 1 through 86, gasped in unison at
the TV monitor as they watched surgeons cut into the belly of
Estrella Diaz. Meanwhile, thousands of strangers probably gasped
along with them.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz made history at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center as
the first woman to deliver triplets by Caesarian section live on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Health resources on the Internet are expanding rapidly,
including transmission of surgical procedures. Critics call it
``edutainment,'' a blend between education and entertainment, but
others say the goal is to demystify the health-care process.
</P>
<P>
   In a hospital viewing room, Diaz family grandmothers and great
grandmothers shook their heads and placed hands over their mouths.
Some covered the eyes of their grandchildren and
great-grandchildren _ who seemed less disturbed by the graphic
surgery than their elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I was ready for that _ it was more than I wanted
to see,'' said Vivian Fisher, Diaz's mother.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of very long minutes later, quiet discomfort turned
to clapping when Desirae, Deanna and Christopher were born in less
than two minutes _ healthy and weighing from 4 pounds, 4 ounces to
5 pounds, 7 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gracias a Dios'' _ ``Thanks to God'' _ said the triplets'
fraternal grandmother, Lupe Urbano, raising her hands toward the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   The tears she and others held back in the early uncomfortable
moments were joyfully released.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, the image was more muted than what the family
saw. In cyberspace, the image was small and blurry compared with
the hospital's large, sharp monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of Internet users jammed the Health Network Web
site _ thehealthnetwork.com _ preventing others from logging on;
the exact number won't be known until today. Those who missed it
can see the event in the Health Network's archives at the same
site.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said it was comforting to see the 23-year-old mom
remain calm throughout the surgery, as her 25-year-old husband,
George, crouched at her side talking to her.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time the cameras were tightly focused on the
surgical action, as the Health Network had promised the family;
Estrella's modesty was preserved as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   George made sure she could see each baby as soon as the infant
emerged. Dr. Michael Foley of Phoenix Perinatal Associates, which
handled the delivery, hopes this helped make the point that
C-section births can be a good bonding experience for parents and
newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Estrella and George, remembering how scared they were about
facing the C-sections required for their other three children, said
they hope Monday's broadcast will alleviate other parents' fears.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walt Larimore of the Health Network said its goal in showing
the 30 surgeries it's transmitted to date is to educate the public,
medical staffs and medical students.
</P>
<P>
   That point wasn't missed by 14-year-old Samantha Acosta-Garcia,
George Diaz's cousin. Her eyes never left the television screen
during the surgery, even in the bloodiest parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was educational, interesting and informational,'' she said,
adding that she is enthralled with medical shows and hopes to be a
doctor someday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jordan Perlow, who delivered the triplets, said that _
beyond delivering three healthy babies _ he believes the surgery
was a success because it allowed the public to see into a real
operating room, which is a different world than that portrayed on
``ER`` or ``Chicago Hope.``
</P>
<P>
   Many triplet pregnancies these days are the result of fertility
drugs, but Estrella's fertilization was natural _ about a 1 in
7,000 chance. The chance of having twins naturally is 1 in 85
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not such a rare event in this extended family. Angelita
Hernandez, 86, the aunt of the triplets' great-grandmother, noted
that multiple births run in the mother's side of the family, with
five sets of twins over five generations, including Estrella's
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Having six children will be a financial stretch for the family,
said George Diaz, who builds playgrounds for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will come to that when we come to that,'' he said. ``It
will be a big juggling act.'' They have a three-bedroom house now,
but will need a bigger one someday, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The babies, who were transferred to Phoenix Children's Hospital,
may be home in a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Family members are now holding their breath, wondering who will
be the honored godparents for the three newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   After the event, Estrella's mother, Vivian Fisher, was the
official spokeswoman for the family. ``These are memories for a
lifetime,'' she said, adding that the family was glad to welcome
the rest of the world into their extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already knew that these babies were special. Now the whole
world knows they are special, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Health Network, a spokesman said their next baby
broadcast may feature surgery in utero.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't feature Estrella and George; the day she found out
she was pregnant was _ coincidentally _ the same day he went
through with a planned vasectomy. &QL;

BABY BOTTLE BRUSH PATENT HOLDER SUES COMPETITOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Baby products maker Munchkin Inc. has filed a
patent infringement suit against rival Luv N' Care Inc., claiming
the Monroe, La.-based company illegally copied Munchkin's combined
nipple cleaning and bottle cleaning brush design.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed June 25 in United States District Court in Los
Angeles, charges that Luv N' Care's brush infringes on the patent
for the brush that Munchkin first filed Nov. 4, 1994, and that was
granted Feb. 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Munchkin seeks up to three times the damage that it hopes to
prove at trial, plus interest and court costs as determined by the
court.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the nipple brush fits snugly into the handle of
the larger bottle brush and has a hook at the end, according to
Munchkin president and chief executive officer Steven Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Munchkin sold about 2 million of the brushes in 1998, he said.
The company files an average of five patents a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of our top-selling units in our line,'' Dunn said.
``With the number of patents we file, we felt we had no choice but
to aggressively pursue (the suit), or we're wasting our money on
our patents. If we're not defending our patents, we should get out
of the patent business.''
</P>
<P>
   Luv N' Care attorney James Zellinger said the company had not
been formally served with the suit and would not comment in detail
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is, my clients don't infringe other
people's patents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what he did know of the suit, however, he said it
involved an ``insignificant'' volume of the product sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once my client is served _ if they're ever served _ it's not
something that will grab too much of my attention,'' Zellinger
said. ``It's a very minor amount of product.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dunn, Munchkin's vice president of sales first
spotted the Luv N' Care product June 7 at a Wal-Mart in Carrolton,
Texas. Two days later, company officials found it at the Wal-Mart
in Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   He said that court costs could range between $250,000 and
$500,000.

SAMPRAS' ROLE CITED IN DAVIS CUP DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regrets, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Had they stuck to sport and saved the spite and suspicion for a
less momentous occasion, last weekend's elaborately planned Davis
Cup centennial quarterfinal between the United States and Australia
could have raised tennis' profile. It might also have recaptured
the essence of the first-ever Davis Cup match in 1900 at the
Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Although Longwood still came through as an admirable host 100
years later, nothing else rang quite true: for starters, if this
centenary was all about tradition, it should have been played on
grass as was the original.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the least of the discrepancies in a round where the
backbiting began two months ago with Australia protesting the
arrangement the U.S. Tennis Association struck with the
International Tennis Federation to hold the matches at Longwood (by
home-and-away rights, it was Australia's turn to be the host), and
then protesting the USTA's attempt to stage the event on clay.
(Australia prevailed in that quibble and a hardcourt got the nod.)
</P>
<P>
   It seemed fitting that the actual competition, a 4-1 victory for
the visitors, concluded with a bizarre Sunday morning medical
squabble over the state of Todd Martin's health. The U.S. team
doctor proclaimed him too woozy to face Patrick Rafter in what
turned out to be the eliminator, but an ITF-appointed physician
disagreed and Martin was forced to play or forfeit the match.
Fortified by a pre-match intravenous, Martin made a remarkable
recovery and pushed Rafter, the defending U.S. Open champion, to a
fifth set before fizzling out.
</P>
<P>
   In between the furor over the site and surface choice and the
confusion over the first and second opinions Martin got when
doctors joined the fray, the biggest question mark hanging over the
competition was the limited role assigned to Pete Sampras, who
received a frantic telephone call from Tom Gullikson, the U.S.
captain, 90 minutes before Martin was due to meet Rafter. Gullikson
was irate about the speculation that Martin's medical woes were
calculated in order to bring Sampras off the singles sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have been trying to cheat, he would have already
hit and had eight racquets strung and been ready to play,''
Gullikson said. ``But he had no idea what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the best team won, and won with a vengeance that
included a triumphant 2-0 singles debut by 18-year-old Lleyton
Hewitt, there was a hollowness to the spectacle because it was
obvious to everyone, including Gullikson, that the United States
failed to mount the best possible team. Out of loyalty to his
first-round workhorses, Martin and Jim Courier, Gullikson brought
Sampras aboard in a doubles-only capacity. But after conceding the
round on Sunday night, Gullikson admitted he might do it all
differently ``in hindsight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the best player in the world but a late addition to the
1999 team, sat on the bench for all four singles losses because he
didn't want to upstage Martin and Courier, the players who laid the
groundwork for the quarterfinal by beating Britain in the first
round. So Sampras played cheerleader and, in an appearance that
only partially mitigated the disappointment of 5,300 fans who felt
they deserved better, secured the only American victory of this 4-1
debacle in Saturday's doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Martin nor Courier was 100 percent fit for dueling in
triple-digit temperatures. But they seemed convinced that
preserving a deserving first-round team, namely themselves, for the
test against Australia was more important than mobilizing the
personnel, namely Sampras, to beat the Australians.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Courier, the good soldiers, deserved to fight the
battle. But in order to give itself a chance to win the war, the
U.S. team clearly needed Sampras for more than a doubles cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's attempt to excuse himself from the third singles match
and let Sampras step in against Rafter was too little, too late.
Sampras should have been playing singles from the start, and would
have been had he received a green light from his teammates and,
more to the point, from his captain.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gullikson's responsibility to remove the cautionary
yellow light Sampras encountered when he rejoined the team. In
wanting to reward Martin and Courier for services rendered,
Gullikson made it impossible to secure the services he needed to
fulfill his bottom-line commitment as the team captain: send out
the players most capable of winning a Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' conditional return to the Davis Cup squad included the
agreement that he would stick around and play singles for the rest
of the year, starting with the semifinals Australia earned to play
against Russia. Now there won't be any rest of the year for the
United States, which hasn't won the cup since Sampras factored into
all three victories against Russia in Moscow in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said repeatedly that a little dose of Sampras was
better than no Sampras, but now that the U.S. team has failed to
advance, that 1999 strategy is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you can put Sampras on the tennis court,
preferably singles but even doubles, it is a plus,'' Gullikson
said. ``It's not only important for the American Davis Cup team,
but obviously for tennis worldwide, to have the best player on the
planet playing Davis Cup is great for Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would have been greater, for the integrity of the sport
and for Davis Cup, if the best player on the planet had been
allotted a bigger role than half of a doubles team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a blur,'' Sampras said of his white-knuckle doubles
five-setter that staved off elimination, if only for a day. And now
that the United States is out of the competition, Davis Cup will be
back to a blur in this country.  &QL;

CROMER'S RETURN WILL MEAN BASES OVERLOADED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Tripp Cromer, on the disabled list with an
irregular heartbeat since July 6, will begin a rehab stint for
Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the rehab depends on how Cromer plays, how the Los
Angeles Dodgers play, and the Dodgers infielders with whom teams
are interested. One thing is certain, there's not enough room for
all the Dodgers infielders.
</P>
<P>
   The only infielder with options remaining is Adrian Beltre, and
he's not going anywhere. Mark Grudzielanek, an obvious trade
candidate, is playing well. Jose Vizcaino is a versatile backup,
and manager Davey Johnson pleaded with general manager Kevin Malone
to keep him during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also Eric Young and Craig Counsell. Young, who's
drawn interest from other teams in need of speed, is the Dodgers'
only leadoff hitter. Counsell, recently acquired in a trade, is a
valuable defensive specialist who possesses moxie and an attitude
of playing baseball the right way. He's also a lefty bat off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not say at this time we're actually looking to make
changes,'' Malone said. ``I'm not looking to make any trades for
the sake of making trades. We're playing well right now. This teams
seems to be more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers beat the Pirates 12-7 Monday for their seventh win
in nine games, and they're playing their best baseball since the
first week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Tripp. I like him as a player,'' Malone said. ``They
all have different things they can do. You have everything pretty
much all covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone acknowledged that at some point a move would have to be
made. But they have a 20-day window, perhaps more, with Cromer. A
rehab stint can last 20 days, longer if the club petitions for more
time.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to start?: Before the game, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said that either lefty Onan Masaoka or right-hander Jamie Arnold
would start one of the doubleheader games Thursday against Colorado
depending on whether either pitched Monday against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Masaoka relieved Dreifort in the seventh inning. Then
Arnold relieved Masaoka in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson said he was leaning toward Arnold starting
Thursday's second game. Arnold's only other major league start came
May 5 when he allowed one hit in 62/3 innings in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   No negotiating for you: Reliever Antonio Osuna's agent, Albert
Rosario, called Malone and wanted to negotiate a contract for the
ailing Osuna since the Dodgers aren't going to pick up his option
next season. But talks will have to wait until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an inappropriate time,'' Malone said. ``We'll discuss
that at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who's had bone spurs removed on his right elbow twice in
the past 10 months, is deciding if he'll have the Tommy John
surgery on a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right
elbow. The recovery time is about a year.
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Second baseman Young sat out with a sore right hamstring.
Counsell went 2 for 5 in his place, but Young's injury isn't
considered series. ``(Young) feels pretty good,'' Johnson said.
``He wanted to play. My feeling is with leg injuries ... I don't
want to run him out there. He's feeling it, so if it's sore, nine
innings here (on turf) is the worst thing for him.'' ... Todd
Hundley's third-inning grand slam was the second by the Dodgers
this season. Devon White hit one against the Angels on June 6. ...
Eric Karros' homer in the fourth was his 20th. He's the seventh
Dodger to hit at least 20 homers in five consecutive years. Raul
Mondesi was the sixth to accomplish the feat when he homered
Saturday in Anaheim.... Karros and Todd Hollandsworth hit
back-to-back homers, the third time the Dodgers have done it this
season.

FUGITIVE FROM GENITAL CUTTING IS RELEASED FROM U.S. JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 29-year-old woman from Ghana who fled her country,
fearing genital cutting, and ended up in an immigration jail in the
United States was released on Monday night after more than two
years in custody, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After months of public protest and private pressure from members
of Congress, the woman, Adelaide Abankwah, walked out of a
detention center in Queens around 6 p.m. and went to the home of a
Ghanaian minister in the Bronx who had offered her shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge is the one who let me out,'' she told reporters
shortly after her release, ``and God will do the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 9, a federal appeals court issued a decision supporting
the asylum petition of Ms. Abankwah, who arrived at Kennedy
International Airport in March 1997 with a false passport and a
story about tribal leaders who had wanted to cut her genitals.
Sobbing and speaking in broken English, she asked immigration
officials for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she was arrested, her legs were shackled and she was
taken to the Wackenhut Detention Center in Queens. During two years
of hearings, immigration judges repeatedly turned down her asylum
petitions, saying she had failed to prove that she would be subject
to ritual genital cutting if she returned to Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah still faces a final determination on her asylum
request by immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Atkinson, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the head of the New York office,
Edward J. McElroy, signed Ms. Abankwah's parole order on Monday
night after speaking with Sen. Charles Schumer, and several hours
after Rep. Carolyn Maloney, Gloria Steinem and a dozen other
protesters had gathered in front of the agency's New York office to
demand Ms. Abankwah's release.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday night, Schumer, a Democrat, said
members of his staff had been relentlessly pressing the agency to
grant Ms. Abankwah's release. ``We just kept calling and calling,''
he said. ``After sitting in jail for two years, they realized that
it was the humanitarian thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This month's decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Manhattan was the first time that a federal court had recognized
the fear of genital cutting as a legitimate claim in requests for
asylum. In 1996, the United States outlawed genital cutting, and
that same year, the INS recognized it as a valid form of
persecution for immigrants seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
   While that recognition became part of the agency's guidelines on
sex-based oppression, judges were not required to grant asylum
based on such claims, and most refused to do so, inflaming many
feminists and advocates for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's Board of Immigration Appeals will now take up Ms.
Abankwah's case and a decision could be issued in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As she left Wackenhut on Monday night looking thin but
exuberant, Ms. Abankwah told reporters that she was grateful for
her release. Members of a feminist group, Equality Now, said they
would help her get back on her feet. ``I thank everyone who helped
me,'' she said. ``And I thank God for making me strong for this
long.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PHOENIX _ When the Comets put a bookmark on the 1999 season to
break for the WNBA All-Star Game eight days ago, they assumed they
could pick up where they left off after a 13-2 start.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, the Comets come home feeling the pain of their first
back-to-back losses since their inaugural 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   If one word describes the Comets' 60-48 loss to the Phoenix
Mercury at America West Arena on Monday night, it's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets established franchise lows for points, field goals
made (16) and shooting percentage (.281).
</P>
<P>
   Paving the way for those dubious distinctions was Tina Thompson.
One night after going 0-for-8 in a 13-point setback at Los Angeles,
Thompson went an even worse 0-for-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're in a moment where we're not at our best,''
said Cynthia Cooper, who led the Comets with 19 points. ``But it's
best that it happens now, rather than at the end of the season or
at playoff time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adjustments that we need to make, we have time to make
them. Anything that we need to fix, we have time to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the world. It was a loss to a good
Phoenix team. And at the end of the day, we still have to go out
and win the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets (14-4) had been waylaid 78-65 by the Sparks on Sunday
night. But as anemic as the Comets' offense was at the Forum, a
massive infusion of red blood cells might have made little
difference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (6-10), which fell to the Comets in last year's WNBA
Finals, has won three games in a row for the first time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury had received an emotional boost from beating the
Sparks 84-76 on Saturday, but it was not at full strength for the
Comets. Starting point guard Michele Timms was out with the flu,
and her replacement, Kristi Harrower, turned her right ankle just
before the end of the first half and was taken to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrower returned in the second half and contributed to the
most monumental back-to-back wins in the history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat the best team in the WNBA the last two years is
awesome,'' said Mercury forward Lisa Harrison. ``We needed this
big-time. I think we're more focused. We've been through so much
negative, and we're starting to get positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite experiencing a letdown on offense for most of the night
_ including a scoreless span of 7:26 in the second half _ the
Comets weren't completely out of contention until the final three
minutes. That's when Jennifer Gillom ``tore my heart out,'' said
Comets coach Van Chancellor, who coached Gillom in college at
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom, the Mercury's top scorer with 18 points, nailed a jumper
from the top of the key with two seconds left on the shot clock as
Phoenix took a 49-44 lead with 4:52 to play. She then got a
difficult fallaway 15-footer to bounce in with 2:37 to play, giving
her team a 51-46 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The next time down, after Harrower stole a pass from Polina
Tzekova, Gillom bombed in a 3-pointers to make it 54-48.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Campbell sealed the outcome with a pair of free throws with
44.2 seconds left that put the Comets in arrears 58-48.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't have it tonight,'' said Chancellor. ``We had it
defensively. We didn't have it offensively. We couldn't make a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sheryl Swoopes, who was 3-for-14 from the floor and had
just eight points, matching her season low: ``It is a loss, and any
time you lose, you try to learn from that. We're going to try to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who has been in an extended shooting slump that began
right before the All-Star break, said that before Sunday's game at
LA, she had never experienced an ``oh-fer'' at any level of her
basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were her usually reliable 3-point shots missing the
mark (0-for-6), but she even missed two layups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I let myself get the better of me, confidence-wise,''
Thompson said. ``But we have a couple of days off, then we go to
Charlotte. I'll work on that these next couple of days in the gym,
whether it takes me all day and all night.''
</P>
<P>
   She shouldn't want for company.

SPIN OR FALL SUGGESTS PILOT DISORIENTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The disclosure Monday that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
plane plunged into the ocean far faster than previously believed
triggered speculation among area general aviation pilots that
Kennedy might have become disoriented and lost control of the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data released Monday showed the plane dropped 1,100 feet
in 14 seconds or the equivalent of 4,700 feet per minute, which is
more than three times the rate reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he got it into a spin or stall, the plane could fall
straight down like that,'' said Brent Silva, 36, a 15-year pilot
and aircraft mechanic at Van Nuys Airport, the nation's busiest
general aviation hub.
</P>
<P>
   Like many pilots, Silva said Kennedy, who was presumed killed
along with his wife and her sister in the crash off Martha's
Vineyard, might have suffered vertigo under the difficult
conditions of flying at night over the ocean in haze while trying
to navigate by sight alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that rate of speed I'd have to assume the plane either
flipped over and nose-dived in, or he just went into a gradual bank
and without realizing had a fast descent and next thing he knew he
was right on top of the water and there was nothing he could do,''
Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarren DeJong, 22, a flight instructor, said the
4,700-feet-per-minute rate of descent was too fast to indicate just
engine failure.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, this new data indicates Kennedy's Piper Saratoga
either fell into what aviators call a ``graveyard spiral'' or spun
down like a falling leaf.
</P>
<P>
   The spiral can happen if a pilot, during a bank, becomes
disoriented and pulls back on the controls, thus leveling out the
plane but in turn steepening the bank, DeJong said.
</P>
<P>
   A small plane also can descend rapidly if it stalls to the point
that its speed can no longer keep the plane aloft, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down like a maple leaf at a high rate of rotation _
spinning rapidly and falling fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McMann, publisher of Plane &AMP; Pilot magazine, said the
rate of descent, by itself, is not enough to draw a definitive
conclusion about the cause or circumstances of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one piece of the puzzle,'' said McMann, a pilot for
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among possible scenarios, McMann said, was that Kennedy might
have encountered some clouds or fog and tried to dip under them but
miscalculated his distance from the water.
</P>
<P>
   That rate of descent is not beyond the capability of Kennedy's
plane, but it was unusually fast, McMann said. And since he was
fewer than 2,000 feet from the ocean's surface, it would have been
very difficult for even an experienced pilot to pull up in time.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts said the normal rate of descent to ensure
passenger comfort is 500-700 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The plane piloted by Kennedy, 38, was 17 miles from the airport
on Martha's Vineyard when it was last detected on radar about
9:40p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a massive search, investigators said it is
unlikely Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her
sister, Lauren Bessette, survived the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Several experienced private pilots at Van Nuys Airport,
including those trained to fly by instruments alone, said they
would not have attempted the flight taken by Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the day, when you're flying over the water and it's
hazy, you can't see the horizon,'' said Bob Roley, a 55-year-old
Glendale resident with 31 years of flight experience. ``At night
it's even worse. If you're not instrument rated, it'll freak you
out. You won't know if you're going up or down.''

JOCKEY RAMSAMMY HAPPY WITH RESULTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ As he sat by his dressing cubicle between
races Monday at Hollywood Park, jockey Emile Ramsammy could take
pride in his best meeting on the Southern California circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsammy finished fifth in the jockey standings with 31
victories, compiling the second-best winning percentage behind only
veteran Chris McCarron as the spring/summer session came to a
close.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ramsammy knew how much better it might have been if he
hadn't suffered a fractured collarbone in a riding accident last
month at Woodbine Park in Toronto, a mishap that cost the
36-year-old rider 13 days of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very upset with the situation,'' Ramsammy said. `But
it's an occupational hazard, it could have been worse. It was
definitely a time you didn't want to get hurt, not that there's any
particular time you want to get hurt, but my business had just
started picking back up. It was a bad time. It definitely cost me a
lot of business.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ramsammy continues to ride like he did at Hollywood Park, the
business figures to return big time. He's looking forward to
Thursday's start of the Del Mar meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good meeting there last summer (10th in the jockey
standings),'' Ramsammy said. ``I like the atmosphere, the six days
of racing. It seems to bring back the sport in the game for some
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the thing about Del Mar is, you have some of the best
races there, and you also have the best 2-year-olds come out.
That's what everybody looks forward to, the young horses, and
looking forward to the next Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsammy, born in Trinidad, came to California during Santa
Anita's 1996-97 winter/spring meeting after six years in Canada. He
was dubbed the ``Sandy Hawley of the Caribbean'' for his exploits
at Woodbine Park, capturing the Sovereign Award as Canada's top
jockey in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   After he returned to Woodbine in March 1997 and finished the
year in Canada, he was back at Santa Anita for the 1997-98 meeting.
It seems the weather in California is more to Ramsammy's liking
than Canada's icy winters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Toronto we have a saying _ it's six months of cold and six
months of winter,'' Ramsammy said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsammy says he's here to stay. He would like to someday ride
in Europe, but California is his home for now. He figures riding
the local circuit will enhance his chances of finding that elusive
first Kentucky Derby mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of your aspirations when you become a jockey is to ride a
Kentucky Derby winner,'' he said. ``But I'm not just looking to
ride in the Derby, I'm looking forward to winning it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsammy, whose idol is fellow jockey Laffit Pincay Jr., hired a
new agent (Brian Beach) midway through the Santa Anita meeting.
He's been on the rise since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be back,'' he said. ``I'm as good as ever, and
I'm looking forward to Del Mar. It looks very promising.''
</P>
<P>
   Lexicon rolls: Lexicon, ridden by Kent Desormeaux and trained by
Richard Mandella, scored a one-length victory in the $100,000
Robert K. Kerlan Memorial Handicap for 3-year-olds and up.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux, who along with Corey Nakatani enjoyed a riding
double Monday, took Lexicon wire-to-wire for the 4-year-old colt's
second consecutive victory on the Hollywood Park turf course.

2/5 and, as the 2-1 betting favorite, returned $6, $4.20 and $3.20.
Fearless Pirate finished second and Cuvee Brut ran third.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner is: Ronald McAnally won his fourth Hollywood Park
spring/summer training title of the decade with 25 victories. Alex
Solis won the jockey title with 57 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice, but it doesn't mean as much to me as having good
horses and winning big races,'' the 67-year-old McAnally said. ``To
me, winning a big race is still the greatest thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert was second in the trainer standings, followed by
Julio Canani.
</P>
<P>
   David Flores finished second to Solis. Garrett Gomez, who won
the Hollywood Park autumn meeting jockey title, was third in the
rider standings.

ONLY IN A FANTASY WOULD A TEAM WIN A TITLE AND NOT RAISE PRICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Strictly a fantasy, nothing more:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Local team wins world championship, and in doing so captures the
hearts and heads of a thrilled populace.
</P>
<P>
   We've had global champeens around here before (well, one to be
exact), but this was different. This was a feel-feel-feel good
story for one and all. This involved class, character and likable
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody won with this win. The team owner was hailed as
benevolent and much-beloved. The general manager as a mastermind.
The coach as part intellect and part Lombardi. The players as
courageous knights. (Luv that Little Ball of Hate).
</P>
<P>
   Even a 3-foot high piece of easily dented silver became the
local version of the Holy Grail. Long lines of humanity formed all
over North Texas, hoping for nothing more than a quick touch.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the fantasy:
</P>
<P>
   While everyone is still basking in the glow of positive vibes,
the Dallas Stars surprise everyone by piling more icing on their
big fat cake.
</P>
<P>
   As a thank-you to the fans for 50 consecutive Reunion Arena
sellouts last season, the club announcement comes down this week
that _ like I said, this is strictly fantasy _ there will ``no
ticket price hike'' for the coming season. And by the way, Stars'
training camp opens in 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   What a fine gesture. What a ton of good P.R. to be had. Win the
Stanley Cup and still hold the line on prices. Unheard of in
American sports.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there was a down-the-road benefit for the Stars. Every
game will sell out anyway for '99-2000, and in October of 2001 the
new arena opens in downtown Dallas, providing mass revenue bumps in
all areas, including ticket prices. That's what new arenas do, and
the bottom line is doubled if a championship team is involved.
</P>
<P>
   End of fantasy, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Stars' president Jim Lites said, ``that would make
a real nice story, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars notified renewing season-ticket holders last week of a
10 percent on the average ticket increase, and coming next will
probably be something close to a 20-percent bump for all other
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in professional sports, but maybe more so in the
National Hockey League. With a weak TV contract, financial survival
comes at the gate, which drives ticket prices to a staggering
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come up with a balance on what's fair for our fans
and what's fair for our owner,'' Lites said. ``But the very last
thing we want is any perception we are gouging our fans because we
won the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, supply and demand figures in prominently. That's
just good bottom-line business. Demand will be strong for next
season and supply short. The Stars benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Lites wouldn't give a definite amount, but the club's claim is
it lost $5 million last season. ``Beyond the regular season, we
played 12 of a possible 16 home playoff dates,'' Lites said, ``so
it's not like we can make up the deficit next season even if we are
fortunate enough to be back \Rin the Stanley Cup Finals\S. But in
the new arena? Yes, we can. No question.''
</P>
<P>
   NHL figures for last season showed the Stars with the
ninth-highest average ticket prices. ``And since we had the best
team, we thought that was fair for our fans,'' Lites said.
</P>
<P>
   But luxury-suite prices in other arenas were factored into the
league average. Reunion has no luxury suites. Minus the suites, the
Stars may have the most expensive ticket in all of pro sports. Next
season, however, here comes that supply-and-demand bonus. Winning
the Stanley Cup created that, along with the trust factor owner Tom
Hicks established with the ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Following the hockey expertise of GM Bob Gainey, Hicks invested
heavily _ some even said foolishly _ into the building of a
championship team. Over the past three years, he may be as much as
$20 million in the hole on hockey. In North Texas, what bank makes
that kind of sports loan on even the Cowboys, much less a so-called
``foreign'' game? But Hicks' long range financial plan was to
recover the loss with a new arena and a new regional TV sports
network.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, only in a fantasy would the line be held on ticket
prices for next season. Then again, go back to the early '90s, and
only in a fantasy would the Stanley Cup be joining us here in the
Chicken-fried Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Cowboys of 1995 demonstrated, just win and all else
is forgiven, the least of which is higher ticket prices. nn

MOUND OF PROBLEMS FOR RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-MARLINS-REDSOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tomokazu Ohka's major league debut didn't last much
longer than the 32-minute rain delay Monday night that preceded the
Red Sox' 10-7 loss to the Florida Marlins in the soggy Fens.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka faced just 10 batters, including five who hit safely, one
who walked, and five who scored. The 23-year-old Japanese import
recorded just three outs before losing for the first time since
arriving on US soil, hardly enough time to form any lasting
impressions.
</P>
<P>
   But he left one after the game anyway, while surrounded by a
pack of Japanese TV cameras and tape recorders that expanded the
usual media contingent who follow the Sox from ``a rock pile to a
quarry,'' in the parlance of Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka was given the chance to choose from a smorgasbord of
excuses. The rain delay. The shoddy fielding behind him, which
began on the first pitch of the game when shortstop Lou Merloni,
filling in for Nomar Garciaparra, booted Luis Castillo's ground
ball. That was one of three Sox errors on a night that Trot Nixon
also lost Mark Kotsay's bloop single in the sodden twilight,
breaking back on a ball that dropped yards in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The last excuse was offered by both Sox manager Jimy Williams
and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, who said Ohka had pitched just
three innings in the last 18 days, and the rust was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably not a fair way to evaluate the young man,''
Williams said. ``He just got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   To each of those possible alibis, Ohka shook his head with a
smile tinged with disdain.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, did he assess his own performance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Saiaku,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The worst.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes Ohka a standup guy on a night the Sox stumbled yet
again in interleague play, this time against a team that has
pummeled Sox pitching for 30 hits in two games, the last a
ninth-inning home run to dead center field by Preston Wilson,
a.k.a. the Son of Mookie.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are now 7-12 in their last 19 games and 5-12 vs. teams
with a National League East pedigree, including the lowliest of the
bunch, the last-place Marlins, who ran up a 7-0 lead in their first
three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox haven't won back-to-back games since Fourth of July
weekend in Chicago, one reason their lead over third-place Toronto
has shrunk to two games in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Despite closing to within 9-7 in the eighth inning, when John
Valentin's bid for a go-ahead three-run home run strayed just foul,
the Sox didn't inspire much confidence Monday night that pattern
will change anytime soon. Not on a night in which they announced
ace Pedro Martinez will miss his next start and the bullpen was
overtaxed yet again.
</P>
<P>
   In six games since the All-Star break, no Sox starter has lasted
more than five innings. Ohka's early departure Monday night fit
right in with the pattern set over the weekend by Mark Portugal and
Martinez, both of whom were gone before the grounds crew made their
first sweep of the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four games, Sox starters have worked 12 1/3 innings.
Sox relievers, meanwhile, have had nearly double the workload over
the same span, 23 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen has been used an awful lot,'' Williams said.
``From the second inning today. That's asking an awful lot of those
kids, to keep running them out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it'll take just one good game from our starter to get it
corrected. We have a good guy (Brian Rose) going tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope, of course, was that Ohka would be that guy, having
gone 11-0 while working his way up from Double A Trenton, where he
was 8-0, to Pawtucket (3-0) before arriving in Boston in his first
year of pro ball on this side of the international time line.
</P>
<P>
   That ascent was as rapid as the one made by Jin Ho Cho, the
Korean pitcher whose turn Ohka took Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the kid,'' Kerrigan said. ``I like the way he warms up.
He's got an idea about pitching, the way he goes about his
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins probably had no business scoring in the first
inning, when Castillo reached on Merloni's error, his ninth in 25
starts, stole second on the next pitch, and scored on Alex
Gonzalez's single. Bruce Aven followed with another base hit under
Merloni's glove, a ball the American League's starting All-Star
shortstop might have converted into a double play if the manager
hadn't ordered him to rest his strained left groin.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millar's sacrifice fly brought home a second run, Kotsay
dropped his bloop hit in front of a befuddled Nixon, and Wilson
doubled home a run with the first of his four hits. When Tim Hyers
ricocheted a ball off Ohka, the fourth run of the inning scored.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka was gone two batters into the second, after Mike Redmond
singled and he walked Castillo on four pitches. Pat Rapp replaced
Ohka, and after getting one out, watched the Sox make two more
errors. Center fielder Darren Lewis sprinted through puddles to
catch Aven's shallow fly, then threw wildly to second in an attempt
to double up Redmond, who took third. The error was the first in
519 chances in center field for Lewis, a streak that dates back to
Aug. 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the error trying to be aggressive,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   When Castillo stole second, Jason Varitek threw the ball into
center field, allowing another run to score. The Marlins would add
two more runs off Rapp, an original draftee of the expansion team
who came here as a starter but can't escape the bullpen, even as
the Sox audition one newcomer after another.

ROBIN YOUNT'S NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Robin Yount never was a ``stats guy,'' as he put it, not even late
in the 1992 season when he was closing in on his 3,000th hit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I guess if you play long enough and go to the plate enough
times, you're going to get a certain amount of hits,'' he said at
the time[ then]. ``It's really not that big a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong, of course. It was a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame voters are stats guys. Yount is going in[ along]
with contemporaries Nolan Ryan and George Brett because of his
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his 20-year career, all spent with the Milwaukee
Brewers, with 3,142 hits, 15th all-time. He had 583 doubles, 12th
all-time, and 4,730 total bases, 22nd all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Yount earned two American League Most Valuable Player awards, at
two different positions. He won in 1982 as a shortstop and in 1989
as a center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Those stats stamp you as one of the best ever to play the game,
and stamp your ticket to the Hall the first year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   But after being selected to take his place among baseball's
elite early this year, Yount still wouldn't tout his
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: I was good enough to stay in the
lineup,'' Yount said.
</P>
<P>
   He's right, of course. Statistics really are not that big a
deal. It's how you compile them that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the attitude I wanted to play like it was the last time
I would play the game,'' Yount said. ``I gave it everything I got
every time I went out there. That's what I'm most proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount clearly had talent; there's no way to reach 3,000 hits or
play 20 seasons without it. Mostly, he had grit and determination,
hard work and hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a triumph of good,'' said baseball commissioner
and former Brewers owner Bud Selig. ``This is just a kid who was a
ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A ballplayer'' might be the ultimate compliment. It conjures
up an image of someone who plays for the love of the game, not for
the next contract; of someone who plays hard because that's the way
the game is supposed to be played, not for the sake of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   After being traded to Milwaukee in 1984, former Rangers catcher
Jim Sundberg got a closeup, everyday look at Yount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin went out there as hard as anybody,'' Sundberg said.
``Even when he was a little bit hurt you could always count on him
to do well. He was there, he was consistent, he was dependable.''
The natural When he started, way back in 1974, they called Yount a
phenom.
</P>
<P>
   He was drafted third overall in the '73 draft, behind David
Clyde and John Stearns. Yount hit .285 for Newark in the New
York-Penn League, and reported to Brewers' spring training camp in
'74 for his first taste of the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Yount surprised everyone by winning a job. At the tender age of
18, Yount was a big-league shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, home-run king Hank Aaron went home to
Milwaukee for his last couple seasons. Aaron had played with and
against a lot of great players in his career, and he saw another
one in his young teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him first put on a major-league uniform, I thought
this kid could go a long way,'' Aaron said. ``He learned quickly,
and each year he got better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount was a skinny, decent-field, decent-hit shortstop his first
three years. Then, after filling out because of weight training and
maturity, he became the best hitter at his position since Ernie
Banks and the precursor of later middle-infield sluggers like Cal
Ripken and Alan Trammell, and the current crop of Alex Rodriguez,
Derek Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Yount hit .288 in 1977, and topped .290 in nine of the next 12
seasons. He led the league with 49 doubles in 1980, when he also
hit .293 with 23 home runs, 87 runs batted in and 20 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Yount had his best season in 1982. He batted .331 with 29 home
runs and 114 RBI, all career highs. He led the league in hits with
210, tied for the lead with 46 doubles and led shortstops with 489
assists.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first shortstop to lead the league in slugging and
total bases.
</P>
<P>
   Yount was rewarded with both the AL MVP award and a Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   Although he led the AL with a .985 fielding percentage in 1981,
it was his bat that made Yount special.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good defensive shortstop,'' Sundberg said. ``The big
thing for Robin was he hit so well. There were not that many good
hitting shortstops in the '70s who could actually hit home runs,
drive runs in and hit for a high average. You were coming from the
\RMark\S Belanger years where shortstops were good field and no
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Yount a great hitting shortstop, he was a great
clutch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers clinched the division title on the final day of the
1982 season when Yount hit two homers off Baltimore Orioles ace Jim
Palmer. Yount hit .414 in the World Series with a record-setting
two four-hit games, although the Brewers lost to the Cardinals in
seven games. He batted .344 in 17 career postseason games. Center
of the action After the 1984 season, Yount no longer was a
shortstop. He had shoulder surgery to repair frayed tendons, and
moved to the outfield so he wouldn't have to make as many hard
throws.
</P>
<P>
   It's only a few feet in physical distance from shortstop to
center field, but it's miles away in terms of the mental
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Robin about that, and the hardest aspect was
you're so much farther from home plate and you struggle more to
keep your head in the game,'' Sundberg said. ``I've looked up at
times as a catcher and seen guys in the outfield adjusting their
hands because of what happened in the previous at-bat. You don't
ever see that in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer to home plate you get the faster the action. The
farther away, you've got more time to goof off. He said it was at
times kind of boring out there, there wasn't enough activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount batted just .277 his first season as a center fielder, but
then took to his new position both defensively _ he led the league
in fielding percentage in 1986, when he made just one error _ and
offensively. Yount batted better than .300 for the next four
seasons, culminating in his second MVP season when he hit .318 with
21 home runs and 103 RBI to edge the Rangers' Ruben Sierra (.306,
29 homers, 119 RBI).
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the position, Yount played the same way: like a
ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the guys that I played against, probably Robin is the guy I
enjoyed playing against the most,'' Brett said. ``He didn't get too
high when things were going well, and didn't get too down when
things were going bad. Milwaukee was never one of my favorite
places to go to, but I always looked forward to it, because of
Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He was the third-youngest player in history to reach 3,000 hits,
with only Ty Cobb and Aaron reaching the milestone at an earlier
age. Yount, Brett and Willie Mays are the only players with more
than 3,000 hits, 250 homers, 200 stolen bases, and 100 triples.
</P>
<P>
   For Robin Yount, though, it never was about the stats.

 '' Brett said. ``Obviously it's something, when you start playing,
it's a dream that someday you'll make it, but you really don't
think that dream will come true.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 21 years, American League pitchers tried in vain to find a
weakness in Brett. Finally, six seasons after his retirement, one
is revealed. Brett is too modest.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it can give a modern-day player pause to [
release]realize that he is about to join the likes of Babe Ruth,
Lou Gehrig, Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that Brett deserves a place in the Hall,
if not a separate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, who spent his entire career playing[ third base] for the
Kansas City Royals, finished with 3,154 hits, 13th all-time. He had
665 doubles, fifth in the history of the game. He hit .305 for his
career, and had 11 seasons of better than .300. He hit 20 or more
homers in eight seasons, including 30 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He flirted with .400 for most of the 1980 season before
finishing at .390. It[ still] was the highest since Ted Williams
batted .406 in 1941 and has been topped just once since, by Tony
Gwynn's .394 average in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was the best hitter I ever played with,'' said former
Rangers catcher Jim Sundberg, who spent two of his 16 seasons as
Brett's teammate in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think there was a lot of natural ability. He worked
pretty hard. But he didn't see himself as clear as it really was.
He had a great swing.''
No one-hit wonder Ah, yes, the swing that launched a thousand
accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could roll out of bed on Christmas morning and
hit a line drive,'' said John Schuerholz, former Royals and current
Braves general manager.[ John Schuerholz said].
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could get good wood on an aspirin,'' former
Royals manager Jim Frey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said that about Brett during his three seasons in the
minors after the Royals drafted him _ as a shortstop _ in the
second round in 1971. He wasn't a slouch, hitting .291, .274 and
then .284 at Triple-A.[ , but never topped .300.]
</P>
<P>
   But when he made it to the majors, he adopted the distinctive
style of[ hitting] batting guru Charlie Lau, hitting[ . He hit] off
his front foot with[ , and had ]the high, one-handed follow
through.
</P>
<P>
   Brett said he expects to tear up when talking about Lau during
his induction speech, and with good reason. The two men were close,
and Brett credits Lau for turning him into a great hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lau's tutelage, Brett hit over .300 for the first time as
a pro in 1975. He then proceeded to do it as regularly as Nolan
Ryan won[ winning] strikeout crowns. Brett[ He] batted over .300 in
nine of the next 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Brett won batting crowns in 1976, with a .333 average, and with
the .390 average in 1980. He ``slumped'' in the last half of the
1980s, although most players would take his averages of .290, .290,
.306 and .282.
</P>
<P>
   He rebounded with a league-leading .329 in 1990, becoming the
first player to win batting titles in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the best player right there,'' Yount said. ``To me, he
was the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a knack for driving in runs. Juan Gonzalez has made
knocking in more runs than games played almost routine, but no one
had done it since Joe DiMaggio in 1948 when Brett drove in 118 in
117 games in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Brett finished with 1,595 runs batted in, tied for 22nd with
Mike Schmidt, but Brett didn't have the raw power of his fellow
Hall of Fame third baseman. Brett hit his share of balls over the
fence, but his strength was line drives that found gaps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Brett's 212 hits included 42 doubles, 20 triples and 23
homers. Only four other players had put together 20-20-20 seasons
before that.
</P>
<P>
   The individual numbers _ which include three seasons of leading
the league in hits and triples, something only Ty Cobb accomplished
before or since _ are remarkable. They are why Brett was elected
with 98.19 percent of the vote, the fourth highest percentage ever
behind Tom Seaver (98.84), fellow '99 inductee Ryan (98.79) and
Cobb (98.23).
Mr. Postseason However, Brett was first and foremost a team player.
His grandest memory isn't of the .390 season, or the 1980 American
League Most Valuable Player award. It's of winning the World Series
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing on the mound and hugging Bret Saberhagen after an
11-0 defeat of the St. Louis Cardinals to win our first world
championship ... I can wear this ring proudly and say I was a world
champion,'' he said. ``It's the one thing I shared with 24 guys,
from April to October, in the grind of the season every day. That
was an extraordinary bunch of guys. It wasn't one of the better
teams I played on, but it was one of the closest-knit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett was the hero of the '85 postseason, batting .348 with
three homers in the American League Championship Series against the
Toronto Blue Jays and .373 in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing new, though. The Royals won the AL West six
times during Brett's career, and he excelled in the playoffs almost
every time. He holds ALCS records for highest slugging percentage
(.728), triples (4), home runs (9), extra-base hits (18), and total
bases (75).
</P>
<P>
   ``He had this knack of focusing when the pressure was on,''
former teammate Jamie Quirk told the ``Kansas City Star''. ``He had
this amazing concentration. The rest of us, we have a thousand
things going on in our mind. We think about the situation or the
pressure, we think about our swing or we guess what pitch is coming
or whatever. George just saw the ball. That was it. Everything else
was gone. That's what made him great, I think. The rest of us saw
shadows. George saw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest postseason hit came in 1980, in the ALCS against the
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had beaten the Royals the previous three years,
despite averages of .400, .300 and .389 by Brett. He hit just .273
with three hits in '80, but the final hit was a three-run homer off
closer Goose Gossage that put Kansas City into the World Series for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1980, finally winning, for us it was like winning the World
Series,'' Brett said.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't come until five years later; the Royals lost to
the Philadelphia Phillies in '80.
</P>
<P>
   In between World Series appearances, Brett had his most infamous
moment, the ``Pine Tar'' game.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run in a regular-season game against the Yankees,
but New York manager Billy Martin protested that the pine tar on
the bat extended too far up the barrel. The umpires agreed, and the
homer was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting image is of Brett charging toward the ump, a crazed
look on his face, seemingly intent on doing bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time it wasn't funny,'' said Brett, who later had the
home run restored when the league office ruled that Martin should
have protested before Brett used the bat. ``But now my oldest son,
Jackson, says, `Dad, let's put in that tape where you go berserk.'
So we fast-forward to that point in the tape and I have to explain
to him that's not the type of behavior I expect from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Brett and his son watch the tape, perhaps they
should fast-forward to the spot where Brett hits the home run and
stop there.
</P>
<P>
   It was that swing, that churned out line drive after line drive,
that got Brett into the Hall of Fame. nn

<P>
   For Ming Cheung of Houston and Erik Millsap of Columbiaville,
Mich., their adoration for Nolan Ryan started with baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   They showed them to friends, baseball fans, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Then something happened that made Cheung and Millsap dangerous.
They learned HTML, hypertext markup language _ Internet coding.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they joined the legions of amateur Webmasters who have set
up tribute pages of their sports heroes. Cheung and Millsap, who
worked on their efforts for more than two years, have the best
homemade pages dedicated to Ryan, the pitching great who is to be
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came from a longtime admiration for Nolan,'' said Millsap
of starting his 2-year-old Ryan Express page
(www.eliteentertainment.net/ryanexpress). Also, Millsap, 21, had
``magazines, pictures, articles, cards and other memorabilia'' he
needed to put to good use.
</P>
<P>
   ``After learning how to create Web pages, I decided to showcase
this information in the form of a Web site,'' Millsap said.
</P>
<P>
   The same went for Cheung, who created original graphics and
culled information from media guides for his site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I have one of the biggest collections of Nolan Ryan, I
wanted to be the first to publish a Web page as a tribute to him,''
said Cheung, a fan since 1982. ``When mine hit the 'Net (on May 1,
1996), there was no other one out there at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ryan is listed on several sites, mainly for collectibles
and memorabilia. He even has a bigger presence than fellow
inductees George Brett and Robin Yount, who have one known fan site
between them. Star-Telegram.Com, the Star-Telegram's site, has
produced a section on Ryan (www.star-telegram.com/specials/99nolan)
with such features as screensavers and electronic postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also has three other known tribute pages created by Ryan
fans Greg Speth (www.reliable-net.net/~speth/indexnolan.html), Mark
McCormick (www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/3445) and Adam Shapiro
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Field/5578).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Ryan tribute sites have a lot of the same
information _ statistics and career highlights.

DODGERS BEAT PIRATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ During those optimistic days in Dodgertown, the Los
Angeles Dodgers talked of power and pitching and an ability to end
games early by overwhelming opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely mentioned was teamwork, nor the fact one player would
have to sacrifice for the good of the group.
</P>
<P>
   That takes time. Lots of time. Three months time, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers feel good these days, mainly because the offense is
coming around. For the second time in three days, the Dodgers hit a
season-high four homers as they bashed the Pittsburgh Pirates 12-7
Monday at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley had the biggest blow, a third-inning grand
slam that gave Darren Dreifort a 7-2 lead and plenty of breathing
room. Eric Karros added a three-run homer and Todd Hollandsworth
and Raul Mondesi chipped in solo shots as the Dodgers (42-49) won
for the seventh time in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love offense,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``Offense makes everything better. If we swing the bats, we field
better, pitch better. I think in this day and age they talk about
pitching, but you've got to swing that lumber.''
</P>
<P>
   The win instantly lifted the Dodgers out of the basement, a
half-game ahead of Colorado in the NL West. Whether the Dodgers
ended the day as cellar-dwelling roomies with the Rockies depended
on Colorado's game in Oakland. A loss by Colorado would move the
Dodgers out of last place for the first time since June 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing like we should be playing, getting guys on and
getting guys in,'' said Dodgers left fielder and leader Gary
Sheffield, who had three hits and reached base five times. ``We're
taking our walks and pitchers are doing their jobs. We're playing
relaxed right now. We're starting to believe in each other. We're
playing as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, riddled with controversy before his L.A. days, has
become a stabilizing force in the Dodgers' clubhouse. The All-Star
has been the Dodgers' best player _ he leads in batting (.304),
walks (56) and on-base percentage (.411) _ and has shown an ability
to dissect and understand what is happening. And why it's
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of selfish things going on,'' Sheffield said.
``Chan Ho Park's (fight with the Angels' Tim Belcher) was a selfish
incident. Carlos Perez (beating a water cooler with a bat) on ESPN
was a selfish incident. The fight with Seattle, that was us, being
together, as a team. Time will tell everything. You can't judge it
on a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also an understanding that not every hit has to be a home
run. Sheffield hasn't homered since June 27, but his willingness to
walk has provided run-producing opportunities for others.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Pirates, Sheffield's first-inning single gave the
Dodgers a 1-0 lead off Pirates loser Jose Silva (2-8). Karros and
Todd Hollandsworth followed with RBI singles as the first five
Dodgers had hits.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, which had beaten the Dodgers six of seven times,
pulled within 3-2 in the bottom of the first but Hundley's fifth
career grand slam in the third gave Dreifort (8-8) a comfortable
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to hit a sacrifice fly to get the guy in,''
Hundley said. ``When I hit it, I knew it was gone. That's a
bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of offense sorely lacking from the Dodgers until
two weeks ago. They've scored in double digits in four of the past
nine games after reaching that number twice in the first 82 games.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was the Dodgers offense for June and the first week of
July? The seven runs the Dodgers scored in the first three innings
against the Pirates were more than they scored in 26 of the 33
games they played from June 1 through July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, pitchers that were pitching against us, by the sixth
or seventh inning, they probably had 60 or 70 pitches,'' Hundley
said. ``It think, as a group, we've become more patient.''

SHUTTLE MISSION IS HALTED 6 SECONDS BEFORE LAUNCHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BETH DICKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ A last-minute engine shutdown aborted the
flight of space shuttle Columbia early on Tuesday and temporarily
thwarted the dreams of an Air Force colonel to become the first
woman to command a space shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Eileen M. Collins and her crew of four did not appear to be
in immediate danger, and controllers quickly went to work trying to
determine what had caused the three engines, among the oldest in
NASA's stock, to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia was to have lifted off its seaside launching pad at
12:36 a.m. on a five-day mission to deploy a powerful, $1.5 billion
X-ray telescope. The launching, which was aborted six seconds
before liftoff, would have come 30 years to the day after the
historic Moon landing by the American astronauts Neil A. Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin in the Apollo 11 lunar module Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and several celebrities
and influential woman were gathered at the Kennedy Space Center to
witness the launching.
</P>
<P>
   The launching commentator, Bruce Buckingham, said engineers saw
readings that indicated a high concentration of hydrogen propellant
in the shuttle's aft engine compartment. There was no appearance of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The three engines shut down while the shuttle was still on the
launching pad. This is an indication that at least one of the
engines, or its associated equipment _ valves, control computers or
related systems, did not perform properly during the start
sequence, which is 6.6 seconds long.
</P>
<P>
   There have been five previous shutdowns of this type in the
shuttle program. Three of those occurred in the post-Challenger
era. There were two in 1993 and one in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called redundant set launching sequencer shutdown does
not necessarily threaten the safety of the shuttle crew, but
hydrogen gas can be released through the engine nozzle during
shutdown. Hydrogen burns without a visible sign of flame, and it is
possible that a brief fire on the launching pad can follow the
abort. But Buckingham said controllers had seen no indications of
fire. The launching pad is equipped with a sophisticated fire
extinguishing system that automatically starts spraying the orbiter
with water. Fire detection sensors are located all over the pad.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a launching pad engine shutdown can delay another
shuttle launching attempt for at least three weeks, possibly four,
because of time needed to remove and replace the engines. NASA
officials had not said this would be necessary.
</P>

GWYNN ACTIVATED, PUT IN AT CLEANUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ San Diego Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn was
activated from the disabled list and started Monday's game against
the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was out May 22-June 12 with a strained left calf, then
placed on the DL again on June 24 with the same injury.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was penciled into the starting lineup Monday afternoon,
but the Padres didn't announce the move until after batting
practice and pregame drills to be sure he was ready. It was a
routine Gwynn has been through before, only this time it wasn't a
false alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the fifth time I've been in the lineup,'' Gwynn
said before the game. ``I still feel productive, I can be
productive if I'm healthy. The team is playing well and I'm anxious
to get back. Not for the team's psyche but for my own psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect a lot right away. In my mind, I'm going to go
out there and have a chance to do something.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was the DH and batted cleanup. According to a Padres
spokesperson, it was Gwynn's first appearance as a cleanup hitter
``in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn went into the game with 2,982 career hits.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets demoted: In order to make room for Monday's starting
pitcher Ken Hill on the active roster, the Angels optioned utility
infielder Andy Sheets to Triple-A Edmondton.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets was the starting shortstop in 58 of the club's first 68
games, replacing the injured Gary DiSarcina. But since DiSarcina's
return June 22, Sheets appeared in only six games (one start) and
was hitless in nine at-bats. Overall, Sheets is hitting .205 with
three homers and 26 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon back in right: After two starts as the club's DH since
his return from a wrist injury, Tim Salmon was back in right field
for the Angels on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins said he has no concerns with Salmon's
wrist. ``The only thing I'm concerned about with Tim Salmon is late
in the game how tired he'll be,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien making progress:! Catcher Charlie O'Brien, on the
disabled list since June 3 with a partially torn ligament in his
right foot, ran on Monday. He has already begun throwing and
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   The time is now: With August less than two weeks away and the
Angels 8{ games out (going into Monday's game), Collins said the
time is now for his team. ``We need to get it together totally,''
he said. ``We can't point to any one guy or one area. If we're
going to try to make a run with 80 games to go, it had better be a
team thing.''

RIVERA RUINS HILL'S RETURN FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins talked as
though he knew something nobody else knew Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how I feel about him,'' Collins said of Monday's
starter Ken Hill. ``He can dominate. Hopefully the warm weather
will help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Hill and the Angels, San Diego's Ruben Rivera
hit a three-run homer in the top of the 10th off reliever
Shigetoshi Hasegawa to carry the San Diego Padres to a 4-1 victory
before 25,217 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Angels could be cheered by Hill's performance. In
his first start since coming off the disabled list, Hill threw six
scoreless innings. He hadn't pitched since June 30 because on an
inflamed right elbow, the same elbow he had surgery on in June last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was on a pitch count of 90 to 100 pitches, but made only 84
before handing the ball to the bullpen with a 1-0 lead to start the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres tied it with a run off Mark Petkovsek in the eighth,
spoiling Hill's bid for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hill looked good from the start, retiring the first five batters
he faced before a two-out walk to John Vander Wal in the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't allow a hit until Damian Jackson's groundball double
down the left-field line with one out in the third. Jackson stole
third with two outs, but was stranded.
</P>
<P>
   Hill walked Tony Gwynn with one out in the fourth, but got Wally
Joyner to hit into an inning-ending double play. He retired the
side in order in the fifth, and got the first two outs in the sixth
before running into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens lined a single to center and Reggie Sanders followed
with a line-drive single to left. Hill then fell 2-0 behind Gwynn,
which got pitching coach Dick Pole off the bench for a visit to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Hill threw a called strike past Gwynn, then got him to ground
into a fielder's choice, ending the inning and his outing for the
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' only run came in the fourth off Padres starter Matt
Clement. Randy Velarde led off with a double and scored on Garret
Anderson's two-out, ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   Clement got help from his defense, which turned three double
plays, including two that Darin Erstad hit into. Erstad's second
came in the fifth after the Angels had runners on first and third
with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad hit into a double play with runners in scoring position
only once in 1998, but he has done it twice in the past two nights.

NORTHRIDGE SCANDAL WAS FORESEEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ Even though he was a thousand miles away as
the Cal State Northridge football program was being investigated,
Eastern Washington head football coach Mike Kramer said Monday he
had an idea of what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew stuff was happening in late March,'' Kramer said,
adding this caveat, ``when (CSUN defensive coordinator) Craig Wall
and (running backs coach) Keith Borges weren't going into the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   One conclusion among the Big Sky football coaches is clear. CSUN
football is on rocky ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus is this will be (CSUN's) last year of
football,'' Kramer said. ``The conference is moving itself farther
and farther away from Northridge. It would be a huge loss. You
could just see the level of the program improving year after
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the investigation _ which began after an anonymous
letter _ has yet to be released, but two coaches have been. Head
coach Ron Ponciano was fired Friday, two days before the Big Sky
Conference football meetings, and offensive coordinator Rob
Phenicie left the school the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said he was shocked by the timing of the firings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a difficult a thing as can happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Big Sky commissioner Doug Fullerton said he supports the
university's decision. Ellen Farris, the Big Sky assistant
commissioner in charge of compliance services, said she hasn't been
forwarded any information from the CSUN investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only assume the university had enough to go on,'' Ferris
said.
</P>
<P>
   Portland State head coach Tim Walsh, while prefacing his
comments by saying he's not aware violations did or did not occur,
said the school might have acted prematurely in asking for the
resignations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give (Ponciano) the benefit of the doubt,'' Walsh
said, ``because I know Ron.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh and Montana head coach Mick Dennehy agreed it was unusual
for a university to fire the head coach of a football program
before revealing its findings, as was the case with CSUN. Interim
university President Louanne Kennedy said the report, which will
detail Ponciano's specific misdeeds, won't be released for another
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the investigation is completed is kind of jumping the
gun a little bit,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris, who worked at Southern Methodist for 13 years, was asked
about a school firing a coach before finishing an investigation.
``I've never seen anything like that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN athletic director Dick Dull said he supports Kennedy's
decision to fire Ponciano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically knew where the inquiry was going,'' Dull said. ``I
was involved. I had a role in (the firing). People really need to
wait until the report is released and draw the conclusion from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano directed the Matadors to a 7-4 record last year,
including 5-3 and second place in the Big Sky. With the returning
talent _ Walsh said hardly anyone in the league matches CSUN's
athleticism _ CSUN could have been a top pick in the preseason
coaches' poll. The poll will be released today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they did a great job of recruiting,'' Walsh said.
``Athletically, there's no doubt they are a top-four team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy said CSUN is a wild card in the league race.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The players) are not going to roll over,'' he said.

PEST FROM DOWN UNDER OVERWHELMS L.A. TREES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two stately eucalyptus trees that shade Joyce
Gorstein's apartment building bear the markings of infestation by a
tiny Australian insect sucking the life from eucalyptus trees in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Leaves are covered with tiny plant lice called psyllids and
their nymphs that are coated with cones of sticky white lerp. As
leaves wither and drop, trees under stress become more vulnerable
to the lethal pests.
</P>
<P>
   The lerp, excreted as protective covering, coats the ground and
gets tracked indoors by people and pets. It stinks when mixed with
water.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban Woodland Hills neighborhoods cherished for their
eucalyptus stands are the latest battleground in the war against
the psyllids that have spread across Southern California and the
San Francisco Bay Area in the year since they were detected as tiny
U.S. invaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a science-fiction movie. Every time I turn
around, the leaves are more and more covered. It looks like snow,''
Gorstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sticks to everything. It's gotten to the point where it is
so bad that if I just take my dog out for five seconds, I come in
loaded with the white dots in my hair. I have to leave my shoes
outside. It gets on his paws, and it's like glue. I clean his feet
all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street at Woodland Hills Auto Body, cars must be
repeatedly washed and buffed to prevent damage from the dripping
honeydew mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pain. It does wash off with a little work,'' said
Steve Hull, a shop worker. Looking at a nearly barren eucalyptus
across the street, he said the insects are weakening once-beautiful
trees. ``That one looks about done.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems have plagued the communities of Valley Village
Park, Griffith Park and other pockets of Los Angeles and the
surrounding county.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles city parks and public works officials are deploying
ladybugs and lacewing larvae to feed on the pests. They also are
injecting insecticide into trees in some areas of thick psyllid
infestation. Recognizing the struggle ahead, city officials will
host a public meeting July 28 to discuss strategies and long-term
funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Department of Agriculture has published a
pamphlet so residents can do their part to help the trees. Watering
is particularly critical.
</P>
<P>
   The aphidlike pest is expected to remain a nuisance until its
numbers dwindle with cooler fall and winter temperatures. The
reprieve should give entomologists time to find and breed wasps
that prey on the pest, said David Atkins, chief deputy for the
county Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the war by the time we discovered we were invaded,''
Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too widespread to consider eradication. Once a pest gets
that widespread a foothold, particularly this type, it's beyond any
economic means of eradication,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, agriculture officials hope for some unpeaceful
coexistence of the pest and a natural enemy.
</P>
<P>
   County agriculture officials were surprised when the Australian
pest infested three trees across Interstate 10 from their suburban
El Monte office in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The pest showed up in the Bay Area about the same time, and it
has since turned up in Southern California's Orange County.
Infestations have been reported in Sacramento and Phoenix, as well
as across Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   While entomologists said psyllids alone probably can't kill the
trees, they can put them under stress and leave them susceptible to
attack by the eucalyptus longhorn borer and other insects lethal to
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of losing eucalyptus trees has many Woodland Hills
residents worried. The west San Fernando Valley is noted for its
stands of numerous eucalyptus varieties. Woodland Hills is packed
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of calls. For the people in Woodland
Hills, it's an identity crisis,'' said Carole Fetner, a Valley
field deputy for Los Angeles City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski.
``A lot of people have moved there for the eucalyptus trees.
They're stately, and the people are very attached to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Infestations have forced Los Angeles Zoo keepers to make a wider
search across the city for eucalyptus branches and leaves to feed
to the koala bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of trees were really infested and lost all their leaves,
but now some of those trees are getting their leaves back,'' said
Michael Dee, the zoo's general curator.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials consulted Berkeley, Calif., entomologist Don
Dahlsten, who is leading the wasp project. Dahlsten said ladybugs
and lacewings would not be enough to control the psyllids.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it would be like using a tennis ball to knock down
bowling pins. It will only make a dent,'' said Judy Shay, a zoo
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins explained that ladybugs and lacewings are indiscriminate
predators that eat more than just psyllids. ``They eat too many
different things. It's not focused enough really to have a
significant impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope a tiny wasp from Australia, where it is a natural
psyllid parasite, will be more effective. But it will take as long
as a year for the wasps to be bred and introduced into the control
effort.
</P>
<P>
   While ladybugs eat psyllids, the wasp lays its eggs in the white
cone that the psyllid nymphs create. When the baby wasp hatches, it
feeds on the nymph.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlsten is leading the process of locating the right wasp,
separating it from its own parasites, obtaining permission from
federal officials to bring it to the United States and growing a
large enough population to release into the wild.

JOHNSON TACKLES AWKWARD POSITION

<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ He didn't choke.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Johnson made his first public comments since being
named the ``administrator-in-charge'' of the Cal State Northridge
football program, and he was put in the unenviable position of
making them in front of the Big Sky Conference head coaches and
media.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a part-time defensive-line coach for the Matadors last
season who was put in charge Friday when head coach Ron Ponciano
was fired, was uncomfortable _ at first _ during Monday's press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like the way Terrance is handling himself up here,''
said Montana head coach Mick Dennehy. ``He's doing and saying the
right things.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spoke in a professional manner, reading a list of the
Matadors' top players, including their height and weight each time.
He closed his seven-minute speech with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on representing our conference well this year,''
Johnson said after thanking CSUN athletic director Dick Dull for
giving him the chance to speak in Ponciano's place on the breakfast
program. ``We plan on making our presence felt in the Big Sky.
Nothing has changed, nothing will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This football team is one you need to watch out for,'' Johnson
said. ``You'll see an extraordinary effort. We're on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Interim only: Dull said Sunday night he plans to hire an interim
head coach for the season before seeking a full-time head coach for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the California State system (the position) needs to be
advertised and you have to go through an interview process ... to
get a permanent coach,'' Dull said. ``We don't have time to do
that, so we're going to look on an interim basis to find somebody
with some stability that can provide stability for this program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the process of evaluating the interest that has been
provided to me by several people.''
</P>
<P>
   On the radio: The school reached an agreement Friday with
Antelope Valley-based radio station KUTY (1470-AM) to broadcast all
11 CSUN games this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Finney, CSUN's sports information director, said
negotiations are continuing with campus-based KCSN in becoming the
flagship station for Matadors football. The university's agreement
with KUTY and its sister station KRJJ is simple: Those stations
sell advertising, while non-profit KCSN does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``(With KCSN), we can't have bells and whistles,'' Finney said.
``We have to tweak our format a little to stay within their
(non-commercial) guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the air: The news wasn't so good for CSUN when FOX Sports
Net announced its 1999 Big Sky football schedule, which didn't
include the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Affeld, programming manager for FOX Sports Northwest, said
CSUN didn't fit into an attractive spot in the network's five-game
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The windows we had were really restrictive,'' Affeld said,
adding CSUN's in-house football investigation and Ponciano's firing
had nothing to do with CSUN being left off the air.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It's getting to the point where coming to the Astrodome warrants a
permission slip from a physician. This is no place for the faint of
heart.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros won another nail-biter Monday night, scoring the
winning run on a wild pitch in a 3-2, 11-inning victory over the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballer Tom Candiotti uncorked a wild pitch with the bases
loaded and Craig Biggio at the plate with no outs, allowing Bill
Spiers to hustle home with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had my `A' knuckler going tonight,'' Candiotti
said. ``That one just got away.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Astros' last four victories have come in their
final at-bat, and each of the five games since manager Larry
Dierker returned to the dugout have been decided by one or two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What little hair I have coming back is all coming out gray,''
said Dierker, who is undefeated since rejoining the team following
brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros extended their season-best winning streak to eight
games and pushed their National League Central Division lead to
three games over Cincinnati, which lost to Detroit for the second
day in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is finding a way to win, and some of it is the
other team helping us,'' Dierker said. ``But most of it has been
really good pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Mike Hampton's lead from the previous day, Chris Holt
shut out the Indians for seven innings in his most impressive
outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who matched a season high by throwing 112 pitches, seemed
headed for his second victory until Indians All-Star Roberto Alomar
smacked a two-out, two-run homer off reliever Jay Powell to tie the
score at 2 in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   When the homer went out, Holt was denied a well-deserved
victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the third home run Powell has allowed in 43 innings
this season, and the first since San Francisco's Barry Bonds took
him deep April 13. The Indians had gone 16 consecutive scoreless
innings against Hampton, Holt and Powell before Alomar's homer,
which ended a string of 13 shutout innings for the Astros' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been getting Alomar all night with fastballs away and
down,'' Astros catcher Tony Eusebio said. ``That one was supposed
to be a sinker away, but it stayed right down the middle. I didn't
think he could hit it that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who held the Indians to four hits, retired 14 of the final
20 batters he faced and tallied six strikeouts before leaving.
Powell got pinch hitter Jacob Cruz to fly out to left field and
struck out Kenny Lofton to start the eighth before Omar Vizquel
singled up the middle, setting the table for Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for his pitch count, I probably would have let
Chris pitch the eighth inning,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he turned it over to the usually reliable Powell, who
had not allowed a run at the Astrodome since June 14.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar, known more for his glove than his power, homered to one
of the deepest parts of the building _ just to the left of
straightaway center field.
</P>
<P>
   Astros center fielder Glen Barker, who made two nifty plays
earlier in the game, climbed the wall Ken Griffey Jr.-style in an
attempt to rob Alomar and came within inches of making the
highlight reels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to catch it up until the time I missed
it,'' said Barker, making just his fourth start of the season and
second in as many days. ``He hit it right on the nose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros continue to set the standard in interleague play,
upping their record to 12-2. They are 22-6 against their
counterparts from the American League Central over the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo's two-run double in the third gave the Astros an
early lead, and _ perhaps more important _ it gave the struggling
outfielder hope that he still knows what to do with a pitch left up
in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, who has struggled with pitch selection, had only four
hits and three RBIs in his previous 32 at-bats. Hidalgo is 4-for-8
in his career against Indians starter Mark Langston, who walked six
batters in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had Langston on the ropes in four of his six innings,
leaving the bases loaded twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get a lot of clutch hits,'' Astros shortstop Tim
Bogar said. ``If we were rolling on all cylinders, we would have
come through in those situations. But we battled through that, and
that's why we've been winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest play of the Astros' winning rally may have been a
pinch-hit bunt by rookie Carlos Hernandez, who rejoined the club
from Class AAA New Orleans before Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' Biggio said. ``Do you know how hard it is to
bunt a knuckleball?''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's bunt loaded the bases after Candiotti tried
unsuccessfully to throw out Spiers at third. Spiers walked to start
the inning, and Bogar was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to put it on the ground,'' Hernandez said.
``I wasn't trying to do anything special. It's hard not to bunt it
in the air when the ball is moving 100 times like that. It just
felt great to contribute to the win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bullpen delivered 3 scoreless innings after Alomar's
home run, including a perfect 11th inning by Jose Cabrera, who
struck out Manny Ramirez, Richie Sexson and Jim Thome to earn the
win.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT began badly, as it often does for Chris Holt. He walked Kenny
Lofton, the first man he faced. You sat there thinking, ``Oh, dear,
oh, my, here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Except this Chris-crinkling figured to be worse than usual
because these Clevelanders are no pikers in the run-producing
department. They have apparently mistaken the American League for a
Sunday-afternoon beer-league slow-pitch softball circuit. And
although Mike Hampton had bageled the Indians a day earlier with a
sublime four-hitter, that offered minimal comfort at best.
</P>
<P>
   Hampy's heroics _ arguably a more impressive artistic showing
than David Cone's same-day perfect game against the lowly Expos, if
we take into consideration the vast difference in the caliber of
the competition _ only figured to put the Indians in a crabby,
vindictive mood.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps Holt was just one bloop single shy of being routed
Monday night. Suppose the second little Indian, Omar Vizquel, had
snuck a bloop single into short center instead of being victimized
by Glen Barker's knees-first sliding bucket catch. The Indians
might still be batting as we speak. They are a team, remember, that
has scored at least 10 runs 16 times this year and 13 or more on
six occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland owns the majors' best record in no small part because
the Indians are averaging almost 6{ plate crossings per game,
baseball's most prodigious pace in nearly seven decades. They were
batting right at .300 as a team not long before the All-Star Game,
and five of their bats went to Boston for same.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros, who have themselves led the majors in ERA for
most of the season, dispatched three pitchers to Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, as it happened, the speedy Barker doubled up the
inexplicably streaking-for-home Lofton at second, and Roberto
Alomar's lazy fly to left ended the threat before it turned into
one. Six innings later, somewhat amazingly, Holt left with a nifty
four-hit shutout of his own intact, and the Astros ultimately,
albeit circuitously, wound up winning their eighth consecutive game
3-2. Two more W's, and they tie the franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   The winning run in the bottom of the 11th, most fittingly,
scored on a bases-loaded wild pitch by Tom Candiotti.
</P>
<P>
   The message in the aforementioned is clear and somewhat
axiomatic. Great pitching and defense will trump great hitting far
more often than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you get a wee bit of hitting to go with it. The
Astros, as thin as they can possibly afford to be at the plate
these days, somehow made three singles and a two-run Richard
Hidalgo double stand up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we stress from the first day of spring training on
_ pitching and defense,'' said Larry Dierker, who remains unbeaten
(5-0) in his second incarnation as the Astros' manager after
undergoing brain surgery in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, this isn't brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always feel like we can score enough runs to beat
anybody,'' Dierker said. ``For us, it's going to come down to how
well we pitch and how many plays we make. For us to have the kind
of streak we've got going without having hit anywhere near as well
as we can because of all the people we're missing that says a lot
about how well we are doing the other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've played tighter baseball than they (the Indians)
have. That's been the difference in the series. But no, I never
thought we would be holding their hitters down as effectively as we
have. I assumed we'd have to outscore them _ really outscore
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it stands Houston 5, Cleveland 2.
</P>
<P>
   Conceded Indians manager Mike Hargrove: ``This is the worst
(offensive) stretch we've had all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt may not be a ``great'' pitcher _ his 1-9 record sort of
gives him away on this count _ but he had it going perhaps like
never before against a Cleveland lineup that's being called a
latter-day Murderers Row. Not that Houston had seen a whit of
evidence of same until Alomar's eighth-inning home run off Jay
Powell landed in the center-field flowers barely beyond Barker's
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Until that unfortunate game-of-inches, game-tying moment, which
saddled the unlucky Holt with another no-decision, the Indians had
been as active as the cigar-store variety. Their linear linescore
for the pairing of the two leagues' respective Central Division
leaders now reads:
</P>
<P>
   000 000 000 000 000 020 00.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, back in front of their NL Central rivals by three
games, can go places with that kind of pitching. Places like the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Where they're liable, of course, to see the Indians again.
</P>
<P>
   In the AL, you see, there is no such thing as great pitching.

SHUTTLE MISSION IS ABORTED 6 SECONDS BEFORE LAUNCHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating and rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By BETH DICKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ A last-second engine shutdown early
Tuesday dealt Air Force Col. Eileen Collins a temporary setback in
her drive to become the first woman to command a space shuttle
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Onboard computers halted the ignition sequence at 12:36 a.m.,
only 6.6 seconds before the shuttle Columbia was to have lifted off
its seaside Kennedy Space Center launch pad carrying Ms. Collins,
four other astronauts and a powerful $1.5 billion X-ray telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts were in no immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said they were optimistic about the possibility
of a second launch attempt on Wednesday, but said Thursday was more
likely.
</P>
<P>
   The computers aborted the launching because sensors indicated an
abnormally high concentration of volatile hydrogen propellant in
the shuttle's aft engine compartment _ a potentially explosive
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA launching commentator, Bruce Buckingham, said a
preliminary analysis indicated that one or more sensors might have
provided faulty readings to controllers in a firing room four miles
from the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at that situation right now to verify that,''
Buckingham said about 30 minutes after the abrupt shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers convened at 1:30 a.m. to study the problem. The
repairs, if the problem turned out to be so simple, would include
removing and replacing igniters that lit in the shuttle's three
main engines just prior to the cutoff. It is a two-day job.
</P>
<P>
   While ground crews drained the shuttle's 528,000-gallon external
fuel tank as a safety precaution, the five astronauts calmly went
about securing Columbia's cockpit before climbing out about an hour
after the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Three liquid-fueled engines manufactured by Boeing's Rocketdyne
Propulsion and Power division in Canoga Park, Calif., power the
shuttle's nine-minute climb to orbit. They are designed to start at
120-millisecond intervals, 6.6 seconds prior to the ignition of the
shuttle's two solid-fueled booster rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The engines are controlled by computers that monitor their
performance 50 times a second during the startup sequence. If a
problem is detected, the computers can order an engine shutdown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There have been five previous shutdowns of this type in the
shuttle program. Three of those occurred in the post-Challenger
era. There were two in 1993 and one in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This shutdown does not necessarily threaten the safety of the
shuttle crew, but hydrogen gas can be released through the engine
nozzle. Hydrogen burns without a visible sign of flame, and it is
possible that a brief fire on the launching pad can follow the
abort.
</P>
<P>
   But Buckingham said controllers had seen no indications of fire.
The launching pad is equipped with a sophisticated fire
extinguishing system that automatically starts spraying the orbiter
with water. Fire detection sensors are located all over the pad.

ANGELS OFFENSE LETS DOWN HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ken Hill's elbow held up just fine in his
first start in nearly three weeks, but where he lacked support was
from his Anaheim Angels teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Hill pitched six scoreless innings, allowing only three hits.
But the offense scored only one run and the bullpen blew the lead
and eventually the game to the San Diego Padres 4-1 Monday in 10
innings before 25,217 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Rivera's two-out, three-run home run off Shigetoshi
Hasegawa in the 10th spoiled Hill's return and sent the Angels to
their fourth consecutive loss and sixth in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim trails first-place Texas by 9{ games in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his thoughts after the game, Angels manager Terry
Collins responded, ``they aren't good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a well-pitched game,'' Collins added. ``We just didn't
give Hill any help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels held a 1-0 lead through seven innings, but Mark
Petkovsek gave up a run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, the Padres had runners on first and second with one
out when Eric Owens hit a chopper to Randy Velarde at second.
Instead of flipping to shortstop Gary DiSarcina at second to start
what might have been an inning-ending double play, Velarde tried to
tag Quilvio Veras coming from first.
</P>
<P>
   Veras backpedaled and avoided the tag before Velarde threw out
Owens at first. That gave Rivera a chance, and he delivered a
line-drive homer to left on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quilvio Veras did a hell of a job,'' Padres manager Bruce
Bochy said. ``That was the game right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was only in the game because Reggie Sanders was thrown
out after taking a called third strike in the eighth inning. He
threw sunflower seeds and candy on the field from the dugout and
was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miceli (4-2) got the win over Hasegawa (1-4) and Trevor
Hoffman pitched the 10th to earn his 24th save.
</P>
<P>
   Hill looked good from the start, retiring the first five batters
he faced before a two-out walk to John Vander Wal in the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the side in order in the fifth and got the first two
outs in the sixth before running into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Owens lined a single to center and Sanders followed with a
line-drive single to left. Hill then fell behind 2-0 Gwynn. But
Hill threw a called strike past Gwynn, then got him to ground into
a fielder's choice, ending the inning and his outing for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' only run came in the fourth inning after Randy
Velarde led off with a double. He scored when Garret Anderson
ripped a ground-rule double into the right-field corner.

HOW MUCH IS BUCK TO BLAME?  
 UNEASINESS GROWS WITH PICHING MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Second-guessing the manager is a guarded privilege of
all baseball fans, but in Arizona, it is fast becoming a cause.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt that the honeymoon is over. And while Buck
Showalter claims ignorance to the rising tide of negative energy,
growing numbers of Diamondbacks fans are questioning his logic, his
style, his manner of handling a flammable bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, blaming a manager for a move that doesn't
work is an unexamined, knee-jerk response. After all, no one
remembers the subtle decisions that pay off. And no one can assume
that ``their'' alternative would bring a different result.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is true: With very few exceptions, Showalter's
recent bullpen maneuvering has resulted in disaster. And that has
only fueled the debate, spawning a faction of fans who actually
want Showalter fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has kind of happened all throughout baseball right now,''
Showalter said. ``The seventh, eighth and ninth innings have become
such a roll of the dice. Everybody is looking for normalcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Showalter earned his nickname because of his
tremendous work ethic. His first manager, Ed Napoleon, claimed that
when he arrived at the park, Showalter was already there, buck
naked. When Napoleon headed for home, Showalter was still there,
buck naked, the last to leave. Hence, Buck.
</P>
<P>
   Which gives way to the critical question: Can a man so immersed
in detail, statistics and hours on the job lose his feel for the
game? Can he get so wrapped up in match-ups and pitch counts that
it shields him from the pulse of the sport?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Showalter didn't like the question and
adamantly denied the scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to use (statistics) to verify gut feelings,'' Showalter
said. ``You can't become prisoner to those things. I kind of
chuckle when I hear that (perception). I don't know how to work a
computer. I don't even know how to turn on one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that Showalter doesn't govern by numbers
or manage by the book, but that is his pledge. Whether you believe
him is your decision.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a recent night in Texas when Showalter yanked Randy
Johnson after eight scoreless innings, a move that precipitated a
bitter defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter was criticized because Johnson and the D-Backs are
starving for wins. Johnson's motto is to finish what you start. And
he claims Lou Piniella was the best manager he ever played for, in
part because he allowed Johnson to ``call my own game, whether I
want to come out or stay in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy has pitched more innings than anyone in baseball, and a
manager's top priority has to be the health of his people,''
Showalter said. ``I wish sometimes I was a little more callous to
the health of my players. Sure would make things a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter was criticized for anointing Gregg Olson as closer to
start the season, a reliever who had worked only a handful of
innings in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we tried to stick Vladimir Nunez in the fire from Day 1, he
probably wouldn't have been able to bring us (Matt) Mantei in a
trade,'' Showalter said. ``Because (Nunez) would've been horse
(expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter was criticized for allowing Byung-Hyun Kim to enter
his third inning of relief in Sunday's loss to the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I use Olson or (Greg) Swindell, I would've had no one left
for (Monday's) game,'' Showalter said. ``You have to look at the
big picture. That's the thing people can't identify with these jobs
the players, coaches and managers have. The everyday part of it.
When the players get frustrated, I tell them they've got to get
over thinking that you're going to get someone to understand what
you go through.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Showalter has a talent for rationalization. But in his
defense, he doesn't have a lot to work with. It is not his fault
that Darren Holmes can't pitch on successive days or that Dan
Plesac no longer can retire right-handed hitters or that Kim once
balked away a game.
</P>
<P>
   It is a players game, and managers get too much credit when a
team wins, too much blame when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   But the really good managers _ the ones who really feel the
pulse of the game _ know how to shake a team out of a swoon, know
the right buttons to push. While Showalter isn't the problem, he
hasn't been the solution, either. And in Arizona, the critics only
get louder. &QL;

 PROMISE AND PERIL IN GROWTH OF TRADE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA
AND  MEXICOBy ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (ed. note: photos and a graphic available; 415/777-7074) &LR;
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ California's economic future can be glimpsed
throughout the huge San Diego research building of Sony, Inc.,
where teams of blue-jeaned, 20-something inventors design the next
generation of television technology.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be found just a few miles south, across the Mexican
border in Tijuana, where thousands of Sony factory workers assemble
parts brought from San Diego and Asia, turning them into the glitzy
new TVs coveted by consumers throughout America.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's most recent local inventions _ the flat-screen and
digital TVs, which retail for about $2,300 and $8,000, respectively
_ are part of a multibillion-dollar circular trading route linking
Southern California's high-tech industries with Baja California's
assembly plants, or maquiladoras.
</P>
<P>
   They are the kind of success story that Calif. Gov. Gray Davis
and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo say will be replicated more
and more often because of their new diplomatic alliance.
</P>
<P>
   During Davis' trip to Mexico in February and Zedillo's
reciprocal visit in May, both leaders confidently declared that
Mexico is poised to overtake Japan as California's biggest trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, the state's economic relationship with Mexico
is more complex _ and simpler _ than it appears. California is, to
a great extent, trading with itself.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated three-quarters of California's $13.3 billion in
reported annual exports to Mexico are sent only as far as the
maquiladoras, where they are assembled by low-wage labor and
immediately sent back to the United States. Critics say this
circular process falsely counts products both as exports and
imports when the real exports are California jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a sleight of hand, but it adds up to big savings for
California corporations. By shifting their production work to
Tijuana and other maquiladora zones, they save on wage costs, thus
gaining a competitive edge in the U.S. marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the San Diego-Tijuana region _ what many
people now call San Dijuana _ has been the fastest-growing major
metropolitan economy on the continent. It now is the world's
largest center for television manufacturing, and it produces many
of the cellular telephones and VCRs sold in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maquiladoras are a tremendous opportunity for California
firms,'' said Lon Hatamiya, secretary of the California Trade and
Commerce Agency, the state government's main economic-affairs arm.
``There is an increased partnership, a natural synergy between
companies here and the maquiladoras.''
</P>
<P>
   Such confident rhetoric will be put to a key test come Jan. 1,
2001, when the maquiladoras will lose their 35-year-old tariff
exemption for materials imported from Asia. Hatamiya and leading
California lawmakers predict that the state's factories will win
lucrative new contracts selling components to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But maquiladora executives say California shouldn't get its
hopes up. ``People are dreaming if they think California's going to
take over Asia's role as supplier,'' said Douglas Allday, president
of the Western Maquiladora Trade Association in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say the real success or failure of the Davis
administration's new strategy of seeking trade and friendship with
Mexico will depend on whether it can foster real, job-creating
exports to Mexico's domestic consumers rather than simply selling
to maquiladoras.
</P>
<P>
   Other big challenges to the cross-border relationship include a
wide range of social problems that in past years rarely received
government attention:
</P>
<P>
   -- Pollution: Toxic wastes discharged illegally from some
Tijuana maquiladoras pollute both nations' waterways. Although new
sewage treatment plants have been built on each side of the border,
Mexico's enforcement of its own environmental laws is poor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Education: Tens of thousands of children of migrant families
who crisscross the border in search of work are hindered from
advancing in school because Mexican and Californian school
districts cannot properly assess their grade levels. During Davis'
trip to Mexico in February, Mexican officials offered a plan for
``school cards,'' which would transfer class credits across the
border. The proposal is still being considered in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jobs and wages: San Diego County's economy is growing by 4.5
percent a year, one of the fastest rates in the state, but there's
a dark side: 19 percent of the population lives below the poverty
level, and the gap between high-income and low-income earners has
widened alarmingly. Experts say the trend's causes include the
weakness of labor unions and the oversupply of Mexican immigrants
willing to work for low wages.
</P>
<P>
   Baja California's economy depends on maquiladoras, which employ
44 percent of the salaried workforce. Wages in this sector average
less than $10 per day, despite consumer prices nearly as high as
California's.
</P>
<P>
   -- Labor rights: The maquiladora companies and Mexican city,
state and federal governments have an unofficial policy of banning
the formation of independent labor unions, saying they would damage
the investment climate. Californian and Mexican unions say this
violates Mexico's obligations under the North American Free Trade
Agreement and lowers wages on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   -- Highways, railroads, ports and airports: Moving merchandise
in the border area is slowed by poor infrastructure. Even on the
U.S. side of Otay Mesa, the main border cargo crossing, trucks must
navigate miles of city streets with frequent stoplights before they
reach interstate highways. A plan to upgrade the route to a freeway
has been delayed for years because of a lack of funds. The Davis
administration is planning to spend $1 billion in state and federal
funds on this and other border projects.
</P>
<P>
   -- Regional planning. For many years, there has been little
cross-border coordination between local governments. Analysts say
the lack of contact has been severe since 1995, when then-Governor
Pete Wilson eliminated funding for the Commission of the
Californias, a panel of officials from California, Baja California
and Baja California Sur that promoted economic, educational and
cultural relations. Davis has revived funding for the commission
and has made it a priority of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about cross-border communication, but
it's very difficult, and we are still very different cultures,''
said Carlos Graizbord, director of Tijuana's city planning office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, when I want to solve some border-related problem, I have
to make dozens of calls,'' he said, motioning to the two telephones
on his desk. ``I have to talk with each of the 20 city governments
in the San Diego area, and this wastes lots of time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where municipal officials are limited to three-year
terms with no re-election, economic planning usually consists of
mere political one-upmanship. For example, Tijuana planner
Graizbord took office in January and proceeded to discard a
development plan made by his predecessor _ who had done the same
when entering office, as had his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The region's promise will fizzle if Tijuana fails to change its
ways, said Enrique Mier y Teran, a Tijuana industrial park owner
who has long been the border region's chief booster and strategist.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Dijuana has it all for the 21st century _ the fiber
optics, satellites, transport, the convergence, the location. But
soon, ghosts will appear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tijuana has way outstripped our infrastructure. We need water,
public transportation, an expanded airport, better highways, a
railroad. We'll need research and development, and
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we haven't done any of that yet. We're still
mostly just cheap labor.''
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California _ which accounts for 85 percent of the
state's Mexico trade _ many analysts say the steady shifting of
jobs to Mexico's maquiladoras has worsened the divide between rich
and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing employment in San Diego has shown slight growth in
recent years, buoyed by the economic boom, after a dramatic
downturn in the early 1990s. But in the Bay Area, which has been
hit hard by the Asian crisis as well as by job loss to the
maquiladoras, the number of manufacturing jobs fell last year by
1.8 percent, a decrease of 9,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, many firms are moving their plants to Mexico.
On June 25, IBM and Matsushita Electric Works announced that they
were laying off 1,300 manufacturing workers in Silicon Valley and
moving much of the work to maquiladoras in Mexicali and
Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term projections show that California's white-collar
sectors such as entertainment, communications technology and
biotech will continue growing rapidly. Meanwhile, more factory jobs
will be shifted to Mexico's maquiladoras _ a process that some
politicians will tout as ``trade'' and others will call low-wage
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot hope to keep low-value-added production in the
United States,'' said Raul Hinojosa, a trade policy expert at the
University of California at Los Angeles and a member of the state
World Trade Commission, an advisory panel to the Trade and Commerce
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, there's a major crisis looming on the horizon.
What are we going to do with this huge Latino labor force that has
been brought to the state over the past 25 years or so to work in
low-wage manufacturing in Southern California, but which now finds
that because of the incredible competition from Mexico and Asia,
that kind of manufacturing is inviable here?''
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa said the federal, state and local governments cannot
expect market forces to provide a solution by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must adopt a conscious strategy to upgrade, to recognize
the inevitability of job loss and make sure jobs are created for
those people,'' he said.

 PROMISE AND PERIL IN GROWTH OF TRADE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA
AND  MEXICOBy ROBERT COLLIER

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ California's economic future can be glimpsed
throughout the huge San Diego research building of Sony, Inc.,
where teams of blue-jeaned, 20-something inventors design the next
generation of television technology.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be found just a few miles south, across the Mexican
border in Tijuana, where thousands of Sony factory workers assemble
parts brought from San Diego and Asia, turning them into the glitzy
new TVs coveted by consumers throughout America.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's most recent local inventions _ the flat-screen and
digital TVs, which retail for about $2,300 and $8,000, respectively
_ are part of a multibillion-dollar circular trading route linking
Southern California's high-tech industries with Baja California's
assembly plants, or maquiladoras.
</P>
<P>
   They are the kind of success story that Calif. Gov. Gray Davis
and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo say will be replicated more
and more often because of their new diplomatic alliance.
</P>
<P>
   During Davis' trip to Mexico in February and Zedillo's
reciprocal visit in May, both leaders confidently declared that
Mexico is poised to overtake Japan as California's biggest trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, the state's economic relationship with Mexico
is more complex _ and simpler _ than it appears. California is, to
a great extent, trading with itself.

NAFTA'S PROVISIONS IMPROVE ENVIRONMENT BUT POLLUTION PERSISTS  &HT;     BY ROBERT COLLIER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Tijuana River empties into the Pacific Ocean
here, and most of the liquid flowing between its banks is water.
</P>
<P>
   That is news.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is the river simply a toxic mix of raw sewage and
industrial wastes, polluting ocean waters and beaches for many
miles to the north and south.
</P>
<P>
   Large new sewage treatment facilities have been built on both
sides of the border, in a path-breaking attempt by the U.S. and
Mexican governments to join forces to clean up the border area's
chronic environmental mess.
</P>
<P>
   Their work has a long way to go, however. The river, which
crosses the border from Mexico about six miles from the ocean,
still is foul-smelling and carries plenty of sewage dumped
illegally from Tijuana's shantytowns and maquiladoras.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed record shows both the success and failure of the North
American Free Trade Agreement's environmental side accord, which
was billed as the solution for the border's pollution problem.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say progress has been blocked by Mexico's erratic _ and
in some cases nonexistent _ enforcement of environmental laws. They
say that although large firms like Sony usually are law-abiding,
many smaller maquiladoras are big polluters.
</P>
<P>
   In Tijuana, for example, huge piles of an estimated 6,000 tons
of lead slag and sulfuric acid are exposed to the elements at
Metales y Derivados, an abandoned battery recycling plant owned by
San Diego-based New Frontier Trading Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The poisonous mess gives the air at the plant a bitter,
breath-shortening tang. Nearby neighborhoods' water supplies may be
contaminated, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plant closed in 1994, the government has done nothing
to clean up the site, and it has done no studies of possible lead
poisoning of the local population.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, residents took the case to the Commission for
Environmental Cooperation, a tribunal in Montreal created by the
NAFTA side accord, but the proceedings are moving at a glacial
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the dark side of NAFTA,'' said Cesar Luna, an attorney
with the San Diego-based Environmental Health Coalition, which has
helped local residents file their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of danger to the public shouldn't be allowed in
Mexico or the United States or anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The bright side is the North American Development Bank
(NADBank), an environmental fund created through NAFTA. NADBank's
funds have helped leverage financing for major sewage-treatment and
water-supply projects along the border from the Pacific to the Gulf
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of progress include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Tijuana's sewage. The $400 million South Bay International
Treatment Plant in San Diego, completed in 1997, treats an average
of 25 million gallons per day of Tijuana's sewage and discharges it
into the Pacific. However, the plant's effluent has failed to meet
U.S. federal standards, thus requiring the construction of more
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mexico started work on a $20 million upgrading of
Tijuana's only sewage facility, at San Antonio de los Buenos. Most
of the funds were grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and from NADBank.
</P>
<P>
   -- San Diego's sewage. The South Bay Water Reclamation Plant
will rescue San Diego's severely overburdened sewage treatment
system. It is scheduled for completion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   -- Brawley and Calexico water treatment plants. NADBank has
given $7.5 million in grants and loans to build badly needed
facilities to purify the severely polluted water supplies in these
Imperial Valley towns.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the border area's pollution occurs on the
Mexico side, the United States shares a big part of the blame, some
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just Mexico's problem, but a problem of the whole
binational maquiladora system, in which the environment is
deliberately sacrificed to create a favorable investment climate,''
Luna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to pollute without having to worry about real
enforcement of the laws saves these companies money, and neither
government has really tried to put a stop to that.''
</P>
<P>
   In total, NADBank has given $24.8 million in grants and $1
million in loans to California projects, and $16 million in grants
and $2.5 million in loans to Baja California projects. However,
these amounts are far below expectations _ and far below the $3
billion that the U.S. government estimates is needed for new
wastewater and treatment plants along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Luna and other critics say NADBank's work has been slowed by its
insistence on rigorous, top-level credit standards _ an unrealistic
requirement for Mexico's revenue-poor border cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis administration says it is working with the Mexican
federal, state and local governments to develop a plan to clean up
the border.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the California Environmental Protection Agency
recently announced a program to train hazardous-waste inspectors
from the Baja California and Tijuana governments to help them
identify and deal with pollution problems.

 W/BORDER)  
 HWHAT ARE MAQUILADORAS?  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Under a program started in 1966, Mexico's maquiladoras are assembly
plants that import their materials duty-free, then export the
finished products. Most maquiladoras are near the U.S. border, but
some have opened recently in the Mexican interior. The maquiladora
program was largely overridden by the 1994 North American Free
Trade Agreement and is scheduled to expire in 2001 _ but the term
is expected to remain widely used for export-only assembly plants.
Other aspects of maquiladoras include:
<P>
   -- Fast growth: Maquiladoras were scarce until the mid-1980s,
when Mexico's economic policies shifted from protectionism and
support for domestic industry to free trade and support for foreign
investors. Now, Mexico has more than 3,200 maquiladoras and 1.1
million maquiladora workers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Low pay: Although the wages in maquiladoras are higher than
average Mexican wages, they are generally only $8 to $10 per day.
U.S. and Asian companies say they save big money by locating
production facilities in Mexico rather than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   -- Criticism: U.S. opponents say that maquiladoras cause the
loss of U.S. jobs, routinely violate Mexican workers' democratic
labor rights and pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Praise: Industry supporters say the maquiladoras create jobs
in U.S. plants that supply the maquiladoras, thereby increasing the
cost-effectiveness of American production and helping U.S. firms
remain competitive worldwide. Backers also say any U.S. jobs that
may have been lost to Mexican workers would otherwise have been
lost to even lower-wage workers in Asia or Central America.
</P>
<P>
   -- Role in Mexico's economy: Supporters have long said the
maquiladoras would help Mexico industrialize by introducing new
technology and buying components from local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mexican government's low spending on technological
research and its focus on pleasing foreign investors may have
prevented that from happening. Only about 2 percent of all parts
used by maquiladoras are Mexican-made, and although Mexico's
manufacturing base has stagnated in recent years, maquiladora
production has soared to 81 percent of the nation's exports to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico hasn't used the maquiladoras in the same way as Asia
did after World War II,'' said Charles Nathanson, executive
director of San Diego Dialogue, a binational think tank on border
issues.
</P>

   Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and others were known for cheap,
low-wage, labor-intensive assembly work then, he said. But unlike
Mexico, ``they also had comprehensive policies linking government,
the private sector and academia to help industrialize. And look at
them now.''

<P>
   &UR; MEXICAN NIGHTMARES &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By M. Delal Baer &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) As Mexico City sinks beneath a wave of crime, the
provinces smolder and drug lords send corruption creeping through
the establishment, Mexico's rulers seem more interested in fighting
one another than their common enemies. For the country to survive
as a democracy, this will have to change _ and soon.

   &UR; COLOMBIAN CRISES &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL SHIFTER &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,200 words) Colombia is worse off in many ways than it was a
decade ago. The country's violent forces _ left-wing insurgents and
right-wing militias _ have never been better armed and financed or
held more territory. Colombia's drug economy, with its pernicious
effects, is as pervasive as ever. And the government is running out
of options.

<P>
   (1,200 words) The violence and fury with which Slobodan
Milosevic and his thugs carried on an ethnic cleansing campaign in

globalization and glittering technological triumphs, how _ and why
_ could people harbor such primitive hate and manifest it in such

 &UR; By Joseph S. Nye Jr. &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,100 words) Nonvital, ``C-list'' crises _ such as Somalia,
Bosnia, Haiti and Kosovo _ continue to force their way to the top
of the U.S. agenda because they can command massive media
attention. Such crises raise moral issues that the American people
consistently list among their foreign-policy concerns. Policy
experts may deplore such sympathies, but they are a democratic
reality. Yet if the ``A-list,'' abstract, strategic issues are
ignored and turn out badly, they will have a far greater impact on
the lives of most Americans.

<P>
   (1,500 words) The most striking feature of this year's defense
budget debate was that there was none. Hawks should find President
Clinton's proposed $112 billion increase in military spending over
the next six years cause for celebration. With combat readiness
near a 20-year low, morale suffering and weapons acquisition sorely
underfunded, the military could use the cash. Yet even hawks are
finding reason to be troubled.

<P>
   (1,300 words) Since adopting a controversial 1976 plan to
liberalize legal access to drugs, Holland _ in the words of senior
customs and police officers in the United Kingdom, France and
Belgium _ has become ``the drugs capital of Western Europe.'' Not
just of the soft drugs depenalized by the Dutch Parliament, but
also of hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine and now ecstasy. Yet the
Dutch drug policy is frequently held up as a model for other
nations to follow.

<P>
   (1,000 words) The world is becoming increasingly polarized
between the rich and the poor. Poverty amid abundance is a growing
problem that poses grave dangers to the West and to the world. Yet
the United States has been particularly stingy with its aid budget
of late. In 1960, 4 percent of the U.S. budget went to development
and international affairs. Today these areas are allocated less
than 1 percent. Forty U.S. embassies, consulates and branch offices
have closed in the past six years. The United States now accounts
for just 13 percent of the industrial world's development
assistance.

   History has been stingy up to now with Fani Uveda, the woman who
was the faithful shadow of Jorge Luis Borges for 35 years. Few have
remembered Fani in the celebration of the centenary of Borges'
birthday, which ends on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it to know anything about her? Unlike many literary
assistants, Fani was excluded from Borges' writing endeavors. Her
realm was to worry about Borges' physical health and his dreams. In
itself, that is probably more than is usually allowed a domestic
employee. Fani has not been mentioned in the encyclopedias of
literature. Today her poverty is distressing; she has known only
degradation and oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   By way of contrast, Percy Adlon, the Bavarian director of
``Bagdad Cafe,'' in 1981, dedicated the first and maybe the best of
his films, ``Celeste,'' to Proust's maid. In 1973, Celeste Albaret
dictated her memoirs to journalist Georges Belmont, which later
were published in a book under her name, titled ``Monsieur
Proust.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, she was the official guide at the Proust Museum, in the
old house of Maurice Ravel, and whatever money she received from
the book gave her a comfortable and peaceful old age.
</P>
<P>
   I visited Fani earlier this month (July), in the two-story house
lent to her by Alejandro Baccaro, one of Borges' biographers. Every
photograph on the first floor was part of a tribute to the Boca
Juniors, Argentina's wildly popular championship soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from Borges' taste than Baccaro's loud
gold-and-blue wastebaskets _ Boca's team colors _ and the photos of
top soccer players in past championships. So too, it was strange to
think of Borges amid the many bound volumes of the sports daily El
Clarin, which covered the floor, were piled up as a base for the TV
set and decorated a conference room.
</P>
<P>
   When she received me, Fani sat, with a severe expression, at an
old desk. She is a strong country woman, resolute, and never
willing to complain of her bad fortune. She speaks about herself in
a monotonous voice, frequently confusing genders. She tells, for
example, of the night Borges married Elsa Astete Millan, in 1967,
and he decided to sleep alone in his bed. She accompanied ``him''
(Elsa) to the subway. That night, Borges dreamed of two
dark-skinned women, as ethereal as smoke, who took him by the neck
and tried to suffocate him.
</P>
<P>
   Fani kept on talking, imperturbable, and more than once it was
necessary to stop and ask her to explain what she meant.
</P>
<P>
   Her story is well known in Buenos Aires: she arrived at Leonor
Acevedo de Borges' flat, on Maipu Street, soon after Evita Peron's
death and, as in the case of Celeste, she thought she would be
staying only for a few weeks. The cook's sickness put her, almost
at once, at the helm. She handled everything, from buying food to
reading aloud to Borges the contracts sent by editors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Proud's maid, she never took dictation for poems or short
stories, and she acted surprised when I asked if she did. She had
different tasks, she said: ``What I handled there was life
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Borges woke her up to tell her his more
distressing dreams. Sometimes he envisioned midgets under his bed;
other times he imagined himself endlessly traveling on very crowded
trains, holding the handrails. Almost always, though, it was the
``smoke women'' who entered his dreams and carried him away.
</P>
<P>
   With ernest concern, Fani suggested that he should count sheep.
Borges followed her simple advice, but the lambs rebelled and
turned into monsters whose names Fani could never decipher:
basilisks, hippogryphs, dragons.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to move Fani's tale from the moment she was thrown
out of Borges' house, at a time when the writer had been sick for
some time in Geneva and two months before he died. She kept
returning obsessively to that moment. Evidently, for a while, she
worked as a maid in an apartment upstairs in the same building.
This allowed her to water Borges' flowers _ or hers _ leaning from
the balcony. But then, after a while, she had to leave.
Empty-handed, Fani found shelter in a hut in Burzaco. It was there
she learned of Borges' death.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again she has asked herself how his death had been,
how it was when he walked into the darkness of the other side, that
darkness of which he had so often spoken to her.
</P>
<P>
   Celeste Albaret, instead, never stopped being Proust's
confident. In her memoirs she tells of a night of dreadful sickness
when, taking her by the hands, the writer told her: ``And to think
it will be these fingers that will close my eyes!'' At 2 a.m., Nov.
18, 1922, hours before his death, Proust called Celeste so they
could work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can survive the night,'' he said, ``I'll show the doctors
I'm stronger than they are. But to do that, I have to last till
morning. Do you think I will make it, Celeste?'' Close to 3:30
a.m., seeing the maid's hand was almost rigid because of the cold,
Proust said: ``Let's leave it, Celeste. I'm very tired. I can't do
anything more. But stay by my side, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Fani didn't seem to understand this story. She could only return
to her own past.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would have happened if you had stayed in the house, Fani?
What would you have done?'' All she said was that she'd have taken
Borges to the bathtub, as always, and left him in silence for an
hour, or maybe more, and returned to warm the water once in a while
for him because ``while he was in the bathtub, he always found the
best words.''
</P>
<P>
   Maids have been lethal in the world of politics, but more than
once they have saved writers from the loneliness of literature.

 By D.T. MAX  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When he was in his mid-20s and searching quite deliberately for
the style that would transform American fiction, Ernest Hemingway
got this reminder from Gertrude Stein: ``Hemingway, remarks aren't
literature.''
 &HT;    That remark came back to me while reading ``True at First
Light,'' the writer's unfinished fictional memoir, published with a
great deal of hype this month (July).
 &HT;    The Hemingway sound is still there _ that unmistakable rhythm _
but there is something off-putting about the story of the 1953
safari the writer went on with his fourth wife, Mary Welsh.
 &HT;    It's as if Hemingway felt that anything that caught his
attention in the bush was worth writing down. You feel as if every
time Hemingway turns his back, Mary and the local hunters can't
wait to escape from his camp and get out of his sight.
 &HT;    What happened to the writer of the austere ``The Sun Also
Rises,'' the beautiful and sardonic ``A Farewell to Arms''? When
did being Hemingway get in the way of Hemingway the writer?
 &HT;    Creativity is ultimately a mystery, dissolving into the
metaphysics of personality and talent. Still, you can narrow
Fitzgerald's collapse to the '30s, when he was overwhelmed by
Zelda's mental illness, or Faulkner's decline to the '40s, when he
dissipated himself while writing screenplays for Hollywood.
Hemingway himself followed their slides with hardnosed interest.
Perhaps you could do the same, in gentler fashion, with him.
 &HT;    Scholars conventionally ascribe Hemingway's creative dissolution
to drinking and depression, but to me that has always seemed too
simple.
 &HT;    Since World War I, when Hemingway volunteered as an ambulance
driver on the Italian front, he was always drinking and frequently
depressed. In this era, he wrote his best books. He thrived on rest
and then battle. While his tolerance for this up-down lifestyle
lessened over the years, it wasn't what made him fall apart.
 &HT;    He fell apart in the early '40s, on 15 lush acres in Cuba.
Having triumphed with ``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1940), Hemingway
left the literary world and moved to the tropics.
 &HT;    As newly released documents from the period _ private letters,
declassified FBI files and other sources _ reveal, he isolated
himself from anyone who knew him as he really was. He confused his
fantasy self (a man of action) with his real self (a man who wrote
about action).
 &HT;    As World War II heated up, he embarked on a parody of his
previous wartime adventures. He formed a ``spy ring,'' which
uncovered little, and chased U-boats with a fishing boat. For
months at a stretch, Hemingway piloted through empty Cuban coastal
waters in search of a whale he would never catch.
 &HT;    Playing these war games, Hemingway stopped writing for the first
time in his career. A short-story collection he promised his
editor, Max Perkins, fell away. Various ideas failed to turn into
actual novels. For 10 years, he published no new fiction.
 &HT;    Finca Vigia, Hemingway's Cuban home, is in the small hill town
of San Francisco de Paula, 10 miles from Havana. Now called the
Museo Hemingway and run by the Cuban government, it is a shrine to
Papa. Each magazine and gin bottle remains where he left it when he
left Cuba in 1960 to sit out the revolution that brought Fidel
Castro to power.
 &HT;    He committed suicide at his second home, in Ketchum, Idaho, in
July 1961, but the Finca waits. The Schweppes inside the tonic
bottles has mostly evaporated, but the caps are still on.
 &HT;    There was an intense thunderstorm under way on the day I arrived
in June, the reverberations knocking the mangoes from the trees.
Tourists can look into the house only from outside, but as a
foreign journalist, I was given a full tour once the rain let up.
 &HT;    Inside the graceful Spanish-colonial building, I saw the study
where Gary Cooper slept on the couch because the beds were too
short for him and the pool where Ava Gardner swam naked. Next to it
were the gravestones of Hemingway's four dogs _ Negrita, Linda,
Black and Neron.
 &HT;    The Cuban government presents the house as Hemingway's private
paradise, but I didn't see it that way. Nothing hurts a writer more
than not being able to write as well as he once did, especially
when the writer is as competitive as Hemingway.
 &HT;    The eight-room house had four separate places to write: a study,
a library, his bedroom equipped with his Royal typewriter and an
office in an adjoining tower (built by Mary in 1947). It was set up
for writing. Hemingway's failure to do so must have been difficult
for him to endure.
 &HT;    Just outside the house lay his escape: the Pilar, Hemingway's
beloved 40-foot fishing boat. In 1973, the Cuban government pulled
the Pilar out of the harbor at Cojimar and placed it on blocks at
the Finca. It is now shielded by a plastic roof.
 &HT;    I knew that Hemingway essentially retreated to the Pilar during
the first three years of World War II, first to fish and get away
from his third wife, the journalist and author Martha Gellhorn,
then to conduct his clandestine military operations.
 &HT;    The Pilar's black oak was still polished to his standards. The
fighting chair, which he never sat in _ he caught his fish standing
up, the same way he wrote _ was waiting for the next fisherman. Up
on the flying bridge, you could see a copy of the drinks rack where
Hemingway lodged his hand grenades.
 &HT;    Gregory Hemingway, 67, the youngest son of the writer, lives in
southern Florida. In an interview, he said that his father had an
irrevocable crisis during the war years.
 &HT;    ``There was a real sea change in him,'' he recalled. ``There was
so much defensive stuff about how great the next book was going to
be that I got the feeling that he definitely thought he'd lost
it.''
 &HT;    Gregory remembered him taking it out on Gellhorn, whom Hemingway
married in 1940. She was a convenient target. She was his peer, his
competitor, in some ways his double. In his letters to her, which
were unsealed last year after her death, Hemingway sometimes calls
her ``brother.''
 &HT;    She was also the wrong wife for a man in turmoil. Gellhorn, like
Hemingway, was substantial. She was solidly built and smoked 40
cigarettes a day. Human frailty did not fit into her worldview. She
once wrote Hemingway that she could never respect the kind of men
``that must have women lick their wounds and flatter them.''
 &HT;    Soon after their wedding, as he struggled on with his story
collection, she accepted an assignment to cover the submarine war
in the Caribbean for Collier's. (She was also working on a novel
set in the Caribbean called ``Liana'' and wanted local details.) He
was furious at the news. Abandonment was upsetting enough, but wars
were his business.
 &HT;    With Martha gone, Hemingway grew anxious at the Finca. The newly
unsealed letters show him writing her often, badgering her to write
back and keeping her up to date on the household, often in
unintentionally comic ways. (``The thing about servants like Luis
is that they've been at it so long they lose their aficion.'')
 &HT;    He complained that an introduction to a war anthology he was
working on was the ``most awful no good piece of writing I've ever
done.'' He had wanted to make a clean statement about the stupidity
of the politicians who had caused the current war, but the
intensity of his convictions made the article hard to finish.
 &HT;    He soon came to feel that writing about the war was beside the
point. He had to do something. A solution presented itself in the
form of the new American ambassador to Cuba, Spruille Braden. He
was a round-faced man with a winning smile and a nice word for
everyone. Braden was status-conscious, Hemingway was famous and the
two men became friends.
 &HT;    Soon the idea came up that Hemingway's wide contacts on the
island might make him useful in regard to Cuba's Falangist problem.
Falangists were Spanish fascists. The American government was
worried that some were in Cuba, signaling the location of American
ships to U-boats and helping German agents infiltrate the island.
 &HT;    Approaching Hemingway was not as odd as it might seem. In those
years, and later, during the Cold War, the U.S. government
frequently asked prominent citizens traveling abroad to report back
on what they saw. Journalists, celebrities and the well-connected
had an excellent cover for going everywhere and looking at
everything. (The O.S.S. was jokingly said to stand for ``Oh So
Social.'')
 &HT;    Indeed, Hemingway had been pressed into service once before. A
declassified O.S.S. document gives a new explanation for a putative
vacation Hemingway and Gellhorn took to Mexico City in 1942.
Hemingway was asked to look into raising a private army of Spanish
Republican exiles to ship to the North African front. He evaluated
the situation and reported back, but the project went no further.
 &HT;    Hemingway liked Braden's offer. He thought of himself as a
natural spy. Intelligence work was like researching a novel you
didn't have to write.
 &HT;    What's more, it would give Hemingway a chance to be a patriot _
and trump Martha in the process. She had researched an article
about the Falangists for Collier's, and the editors had rejected
it. He would show her how it was done.
 &HT;    Braden's code name for the group was the Crime Shop. Hemingway
nicknamed it the Crook Factory. Quickly, Agent 08 _ as Hemingway
rechristened himself _ got to work.
 &HT;    His ``spy ring'' was a cross section of his social circle: a
bartender from his favorite bar, the Floridita; various wharf rats,
and several Basques who fled Spain when Franco won. The unruly
crowd showed up at all hours at the Finca, which they used as their
headquarters.
 &HT;    In one newly unsealed letter to Martha, then on assignment for
Collier's, he captures the atmosphere of a Crook Factory meeting:
``We were just twenty-one ... and twenty-four bottles of wine were
drunk. ... Tommy Shevlin sang some wonderful songs and everybody
threw bottles at Fernando as a form of applause. Chairs were thrown
to express disapproval. ... Thorwald had taken the pistol of the
soldado, who had fallen asleep, and was firing it. ... Juan was hit
on the ear by a loaf of bread and rendered hors du combat. ... It
was an all time high in Basque celebrations.''
 &HT;    Little of use came out of the Crook Factory, which at one point
consisted of six full-time operatives and 20 part-timers. The FBI,
as allergic to competition as Papa was, used its staff to discredit
Hemingway's.
 &HT;    Hemingway announced that Gen. Manuel Benitez, the chief of
police, was training his officers to seize power while Braden and
President Fulgencio Batista were in Washington. The FBI pointed out
that it had agents at Police Headquarters who had seen nothing
unusual.
 &HT;    A Hemingway operative brought in a suspicious box from the Bar
Basque in Havana; the FBI had the box opened and found only a copy
of ``The Life of Saint Teresa.'' A declassified June 1943 memo
reflects the agents' exasperation: Hemingway was just bringing in
his operatives' dispatches with a cover note, not even trying to
investigate their validity or place them in context. He would do
anything, it seems, but write.
 &HT;    J. Edgar Hoover followed Hemingway's operations with bemusement.
He sardonically noted in a memo to two staff members that
Hemingway's ``judgment is not of the best'' and that if he was
drinking as much as he had been ``some years ago,'' Braden was
foolish to use him.
 &HT;    Hoover grew worried, however, when Hemingway told an informant
that he was going to write a book about Braden, his intelligence
work and the FBI.
 &HT;    Consequently, FBI radiograms flew back and forth following
Hemingway's moves, as agents tried to determine if he was putting
pen to paper about his spying adventures. Hoover was probably
relieved when an agent reported that Hemingway had acknowledged
that he was ``doing no writing whatsoever at the present time.''
 &HT;    In April 1943, with FBI prodding, the embassy closed down the
Crook Factory. Hemingway didn't care. He had already found himself
a newer, better assignment: submarine chasing under the sponsorship
of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Although the threat of
German U-boats off Cuban waters was already subsiding, Hemingway
still saw a chance to make his mark on the war.
 &HT;    An aristocratic-looking cabin cruiser, the Pilar was hardly a
boat to take on a 1,000-ton U-boat. Because real, mounted
antiaircraft guns were too heavy for the Pilar's stern, the crew
had to limit itself to Thompson submachine guns, antitank weapons
and those hand grenades in the drinks holder.
 &HT;    For his crew, Hemingway surrounded himself with friends,
including Winston Guest, a millionaire polo player; two Basque
jai-alai players nicknamed Paxtchi and Sinsky, and a dour Catalan
sergeant named Fernando Mesa. The only professional among them was
a Marine communications expert named Don Saxon, who carried around
a submarine listening device known to Hemingway only as ``the
gadget.''
 &HT;    Hemingway obtained a letter from the U.S. Embassy to explain his
activity. Still in the archives of the Finca, it states that he was
conducting scientific experiments with ``a radio apparatus.'' This
didn't quite accord with the American Museum of Natural History
sign he had hung as cover on deck.
 &HT;    Hemingway's sub-hunting strategy recalled the adventure books he
read as a teen-ager. He imagined that German U-boats would spot the
Pilar, surface and come aboard to commandeer its fresh fruit and
fish. Once the U-boat opened its hatch, one of the jai-alai players
would toss a jury-rigged bomb down the narrow opening.
 &HT;    Martha quite rightly warned Hemingway that if they ever did lob
a bomb down a sub hatch, they would all be killed in the explosion.
She berated his ``shaming and silly life,'' which she saw as an
excuse to go fishing with government gasoline and avoid his
typewriter.
 &HT;    But he had found his war. His squad practiced shooting and
throwing grenades at wooden targets with faces painted on them,
which they called ``Hitlers,'' and practiced boarding procedures
and tossing incendiary devices down an imaginary hatch.
 &HT;    Military readiness was slow in coming, as an unpublished passage
from Hemingway's log shows: ``Left Cabanas at 8:30. Out 6 miles for
practice _ Win(ston) erratic _ Paxtchi same _ Fernando N.G. (no
good) Win bothered by gas in stomach _ Fernando stood ground swell
OK. Into Bahia Honda 1 pm.''
 &HT;    Patrick Hemingway, 71, the writer's middle son, sometimes
accompanied his father on the Pilar, much to Gellhorn's
consternation. When I reached him in Montana to ask about this
period, he compared his father to Don Quixote. ``He was losing the
ability to deal with reality,'' he remembered. ``He was just going
crazy trying to make the world better and more pattern-satisfying
than it was.''
 &HT;    On Dec. 9, 1942, with the crew still learning to hit targets,
the Pilar's moment came. Hemingway watched through his ``ten-power
Zeiss glasses'' as a Spanish steamer, the Marques de Comillas,
slowed down in the waters off the north coast, as if for a
rendezvous. Shortly after, he spotted a low gray craft approaching
with a tow.
 &HT;    In a report to the embassy's ONI attache, proudly entitled
``Submarine Sighted on December 9th,'' Hemingway reported that the
Pilar had closed for the kill ``at a trawling speed of seven knots
with lines out from both outriggers to simulate big game fishing.''
At this moment, as they prepared the ``anti-submarine
installations'' (explosives inserted in a fire-extinguisher
canister), something unlucky happened.
 &HT;    ``While we were headed directly toward her a large baracuda
(sic) of 48 pounds hit one of the outrigger baits,'' Hemingway
wrote. While the crew tried to land the fish, the vessel steamed
away.
 &HT;    That was it. Despite not being certain he had seen a submarine,
Hemingway sent the ONI a theory worthy of Simenon, his favorite
mystery writer: ``It would have been possible, due to the ships
encountering each other at the hour of the noon-day meal, for Axis
agents to have been put overboard during the time that passengers
were in the dining saloon without such an operation being any more
noticed, if the men were lowered from a hatch close to the
waterline than would be the picking up or dropping of a pilot under
the same circumstances.''
 &HT;    The FBI later interviewed all the passengers and discredited the
scenario, much to Hemingway's frustration.
 &HT;    In two-month stints over the next year, Hemingway and his crew
kept on patrolling, often 18 hours a day. Occasionally, a trawler
or fishing boat would pass, and Hemingway would note it in his log
alongside the crew's poker scores.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Martha finished ``Liana.'' This sandbagged Hemingway.
During a visit to the Finca, he told Gregory that he was going to
quit writing. ``Let's give Marty a chance _ she deserves one,'' he
said.
 &HT;    In a letter to Gellhorn, Hemingway rationalized things: ``It is
enough of a job to keep everybody's morale up and get the work done
without having to write about it.''
 &HT;    The Pilar's orders ran out in July 1943. Despite Hemingway's
efforts, the Navy wouldn't renew them. Papa closed down the
operation and settled back down at the Finca, only to find Gellhorn
moving ahead on her next project: covering the war in England for
Collier's.
 &HT;    Eventually, Hemingway followed Martha to England, becoming
Collier's front-line war correspondent and her boss. He put himself
through extraordinary, foolhardy risks in France, refusing to duck
when snipers fired or when a shell struck near him. He told his
military friends that fighting Germans was the best job he had ever
had. He seemed a man determined to find death.
 &HT;    Yet when the war ended, he returned to the Finca to write _
though not before blaming Gellhorn, who left him in 1944, for his
difficulty writing.
 &HT;    In the guest bedroom at the Finca, I came upon a copy of
Gellhorn's 1948 war novel, ``The Wine of Astonishment,'' untouched
for 40 years. It was inscribed from Gellhorn: ``For the greatest of
critics ... with the best wishes of his knowing admirer.'' Behind
it was Hemingway's angry response: ``Dear author, Why don't you be
a nice good character and ... ship me my papers, so I can write
another fine book and autograph it for you? The Other Author.''
 &HT;    With great effort he began new work. In 1950, he published
``Across the River and Into the Trees'' _ his first novel written
in Cuba. The critics were savage. He would not easily be brought
down, however. A book, he liked to remind himself, was a battle,
not a war.
 &HT;    He succeeded in finding his voice again briefly with ``The Old
Man and the Sea'' (1952). But ``Across the River'' and ``Old Man''
were sections of a trilogy that never came together; the rest was
published posthumously in 1970 as ``Islands in the Stream,'' in
which his fruitless naval patrols were given a nobler fictional
aspect as a battle against a U-boat crew in which his alter ego,
Thomas Hudson, dies.
 &HT;    Moreover, he was beaten, as he might have put it, by two
unfinished books _ ``The Garden of Eden,'' published in 1986, and
then by ``True at First Light.'' Something had changed in his
relation to his material. What had for so long fed his art _ his
outsize will _ now deformed it.
 &HT;    Shortly after his block began, Hemingway wrote to Martha, ``I
suppose if you are a writer you're a writer till you die or it
dies.'' He knew what had happened, and he knew there was nothing he
could do.
 &HT;    One of the first stories he began upon his return to Cuba was
called ``The Faker.'' It was the story of a man returning from the
war pretending to be a hero. He never finished it.

 By D.T. MAX  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When he was in his mid-20s and searching quite deliberately for
the style that would transform American fiction, Ernest Hemingway
got this reminder from Gertrude Stein: ``Hemingway, remarks aren't
literature.''
 &HT;    That remark came back to me while reading ``True at First
Light,'' the writer's unfinished fictional memoir, published with a
great deal of hype this month (July).
 &HT;    The Hemingway sound is still there _ that unmistakable rhythm _
but there is something off-putting about the story of the 1953
safari the writer went on with his fourth wife, Mary Welsh.
 &HT;    It's as if Hemingway felt that anything that caught his
attention in the bush was worth writing down. You feel as if every
time Hemingway turns his back, Mary and the local hunters can't
wait to escape from his camp and get out of his sight.
 &HT;    What happened to the writer of the austere ``The Sun Also
Rises,'' the beautiful and sardonic ``A Farewell to Arms''? When
did being Hemingway get in the way of Hemingway the writer?
 &HT;    Creativity is ultimately a mystery, dissolving into the
metaphysics of personality and talent. Still, you can narrow
Fitzgerald's collapse to the '30s, when he was overwhelmed by
Zelda's mental illness, or Faulkner's decline to the '40s, when he
dissipated himself while writing screenplays for Hollywood.
Hemingway himself followed their slides with hardnosed interest.
Perhaps you could do the same, in gentler fashion, with him.
 &HT;    Scholars conventionally ascribe Hemingway's creative dissolution
to drinking and depression, but to me that has always seemed too
simple.
 &HT;    Since World War I, when Hemingway volunteered as an ambulance
driver on the Italian front, he was always drinking and frequently
depressed. In this era, he wrote his best books. He thrived on rest
and then battle. While his tolerance for this up-down lifestyle
lessened over the years, it wasn't what made him fall apart.
 &HT;    He fell apart in the early '40s, on 15 lush acres in Cuba.
Having triumphed with ``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1940), Hemingway
left the literary world and moved to the tropics.
 &HT;    As newly released documents from the period _ private letters,
declassified FBI files and other sources _ reveal, he isolated
himself from anyone who knew him as he really was. He confused his
fantasy self (a man of action) with his real self (a man who wrote
about action).
 &HT;    As World War II heated up, he embarked on a parody of his
previous wartime adventures. He formed a ``spy ring,'' which
uncovered little, and chased U-boats with a fishing boat. For
months at a stretch, Hemingway piloted through empty Cuban coastal
waters in search of a whale he would never catch.
 &HT;    Playing these war games, Hemingway stopped writing for the first
time in his career. A short-story collection he promised his
editor, Max Perkins, fell away. Various ideas failed to turn into
actual novels. For 10 years, he published no new fiction.
 &HT;    Finca Vigia, Hemingway's Cuban home, is in the small hill town
of San Francisco de Paula, 10 miles from Havana. Now called the
Museo Hemingway and run by the Cuban government, it is a shrine to
Papa. Each magazine and gin bottle remains where he left it when he
left Cuba in 1960 to sit out the revolution that brought Fidel
Castro to power.
 &HT;    He committed suicide at his second home, in Ketchum, Idaho, in
July 1961, but the Finca waits. The Schweppes inside the tonic
bottles has mostly evaporated, but the caps are still on.
 &HT;    There was an intense thunderstorm under way on the day I arrived
in June, the reverberations knocking the mangoes from the trees.
Tourists can look into the house only from outside, but as a
foreign journalist, I was given a full tour once the rain let up.
 &HT;    Inside the graceful Spanish-colonial building, I saw the study
where Gary Cooper slept on the couch because the beds were too
short for him and the pool where Ava Gardner swam naked. Next to it
were the gravestones of Hemingway's four dogs _ Negrita, Linda,
Black and Neron.
 &HT;    The Cuban government presents the house as Hemingway's private
paradise, but I didn't see it that way. Nothing hurts a writer more
than not being able to write as well as he once did, especially
when the writer is as competitive as Hemingway.
 &HT;    The eight-room house had four separate places to write: a study,
a library, his bedroom equipped with his Royal typewriter and an
office in an adjoining tower (built by Mary in 1947). It was set up
for writing. Hemingway's failure to do so must have been difficult
for him to endure.
 &HT;    Just outside the house lay his escape: the Pilar, Hemingway's
beloved 40-foot fishing boat. In 1973, the Cuban government pulled
the Pilar out of the harbor at Cojimar and placed it on blocks at
the Finca. It is now shielded by a plastic roof.
 &HT;    I knew that Hemingway essentially retreated to the Pilar during
the first three years of World War II, first to fish and get away
from his third wife, the journalist and author Martha Gellhorn,
then to conduct his clandestine military operations.
 &HT;    The Pilar's black oak was still polished to his standards. The
fighting chair, which he never sat in _ he caught his fish standing
up, the same way he wrote _ was waiting for the next fisherman. Up
on the flying bridge, you could see a copy of the drinks rack where
Hemingway lodged his hand grenades.
 &HT;    Gregory Hemingway, 67, the youngest son of the writer, lives in
southern Florida. In an interview, he said that his father had an
irrevocable crisis during the war years.
 &HT;    ``There was a real sea change in him,'' he recalled. ``There was
so much defensive stuff about how great the next book was going to
be that I got the feeling that he definitely thought he'd lost
it.''
 &HT;    Gregory remembered him taking it out on Gellhorn, whom Hemingway
married in 1940. She was a convenient target. She was his peer, his
competitor, in some ways his double. In his letters to her, which
were unsealed last year after her death, Hemingway sometimes calls
her ``brother.''
 &HT;    She was also the wrong wife for a man in turmoil. Gellhorn, like
Hemingway, was substantial. She was solidly built and smoked 40
cigarettes a day. Human frailty did not fit into her worldview. She
once wrote Hemingway that she could never respect the kind of men
``that must have women lick their wounds and flatter them.''
 &HT;    Soon after their wedding, as he struggled on with his story
collection, she accepted an assignment to cover the submarine war
in the Caribbean for Collier's. (She was also working on a novel
set in the Caribbean called ``Liana'' and wanted local details.) He
was furious at the news. Abandonment was upsetting enough, but wars
were his business.
 &HT;    With Martha gone, Hemingway grew anxious at the Finca. The newly
unsealed letters show him writing her often, badgering her to write
back and keeping her up to date on the household, often in
unintentionally comic ways. (``The thing about servants like Luis
is that they've been at it so long they lose their aficion.'')
 &HT;    He complained that an introduction to a war anthology he was
working on was the ``most awful no good piece of writing I've ever
done.'' He had wanted to make a clean statement about the stupidity
of the politicians who had caused the current war, but the
intensity of his convictions made the article hard to finish.
 &HT;    He soon came to feel that writing about the war was beside the
point. He had to do something. A solution presented itself in the
form of the new American ambassador to Cuba, Spruille Braden. He
was a round-faced man with a winning smile and a nice word for
everyone. Braden was status-conscious, Hemingway was famous and the
two men became friends.
 &HT;    Soon the idea came up that Hemingway's wide contacts on the
island might make him useful in regard to Cuba's Falangist problem.
Falangists were Spanish fascists. The American government was
worried that some were in Cuba, signaling the location of American
ships to U-boats and helping German agents infiltrate the island.
 &HT;    Approaching Hemingway was not as odd as it might seem. In those
years, and later, during the Cold War, the U.S. government
frequently asked prominent citizens traveling abroad to report back
on what they saw. Journalists, celebrities and the well-connected
had an excellent cover for going everywhere and looking at
everything. (The O.S.S. was jokingly said to stand for ``Oh So
Social.'')
 &HT;    Indeed, Hemingway had been pressed into service once before. A
declassified O.S.S. document gives a new explanation for a putative
vacation Hemingway and Gellhorn took to Mexico City in 1942.
Hemingway was asked to look into raising a private army of Spanish
Republican exiles to ship to the North African front. He evaluated
the situation and reported back, but the project went no further.
 &HT;    Hemingway liked Braden's offer. He thought of himself as a
natural spy. Intelligence work was like researching a novel you
didn't have to write.
 &HT;    What's more, it would give Hemingway a chance to be a patriot _
and trump Martha in the process. She had researched an article
about the Falangists for Collier's, and the editors had rejected
it. He would show her how it was done.
 &HT;    Braden's code name for the group was the Crime Shop. Hemingway
nicknamed it the Crook Factory. Quickly, Agent 08 _ as Hemingway
rechristened himself _ got to work.
 &HT;    His ``spy ring'' was a cross section of his social circle: a
bartender from his favorite bar, the Floridita; various wharf rats,
and several Basques who fled Spain when Franco won. The unruly
crowd showed up at all hours at the Finca, which they used as their
headquarters.
 &HT;    In one newly unsealed letter to Martha, then on assignment for
Collier's, he captures the atmosphere of a Crook Factory meeting:
``We were just twenty-one ... and twenty-four bottles of wine were
drunk. ... Tommy Shevlin sang some wonderful songs and everybody
threw bottles at Fernando as a form of applause. Chairs were thrown
to express disapproval. ... Thorwald had taken the pistol of the
soldado, who had fallen asleep, and was firing it. ... Juan was hit
on the ear by a loaf of bread and rendered hors du combat. ... It
was an all time high in Basque celebrations.''
 &HT;    Little of use came out of the Crook Factory, which at one point
consisted of six full-time operatives and 20 part-timers. The FBI,
as allergic to competition as Papa was, used its staff to discredit
Hemingway's.
 &HT;    Hemingway announced that Gen. Manuel Benitez, the chief of
police, was training his officers to seize power while Braden and
President Fulgencio Batista were in Washington. The FBI pointed out
that it had agents at Police Headquarters who had seen nothing
unusual.
 &HT;    A Hemingway operative brought in a suspicious box from the Bar
Basque in Havana; the FBI had the box opened and found only a copy
of ``The Life of Saint Teresa.'' A declassified June 1943 memo
reflects the agents' exasperation: Hemingway was just bringing in
his operatives' dispatches with a cover note, not even trying to
investigate their validity or place them in context. He would do
anything, it seems, but write.

``Across the River and Into the Trees'' _ his first novel written
in Cuba. The critics were savage. He would not easily be brought
down, however. A book, he liked to remind himself, was a battle,
not a war.
 &HT;    He succeeded in finding his voice again briefly with ``The Old
Man and the Sea'' (1952). But ``Across the River'' and ``Old Man''
were sections of a trilogy that never came together; the rest was
published posthumously in 1970 as ``Islands in the Stream,'' in
which his fruitless naval patrols were given a nobler fictional
aspect as a battle against a U-boat crew in which his alter ego,
Thomas Hudson, dies.
 &HT;    Moreover, he was beaten, as he might have put it, by two
unfinished books _ ``The Garden of Eden,'' published in 1986, and
then by ``True at First Light.'' Something had changed in his
relation to his material. What had for so long fed his art _ his
outsize will _ now deformed it.
 &HT;    Shortly after his block began, Hemingway wrote to Martha, ``I
suppose if you are a writer you're a writer till you die or it
dies.'' He knew what had happened, and he knew there was nothing he
could do.
 &HT;    One of the first stories he began upon his return to Cuba was
called ``The Faker.'' It was the story of a man returning from the
war pretending to be a hero. He never finished it.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     I should be riding on the float in the hit parade/instead of
sitting on the curb behind the barricade/another verse in the
doormat serenade.  _ ``Put Me on Top,'' Aimee Mann
 &HT;    
 &HT;    July 1999: Aimee Mann can't sit around these days waiting to
hear what the record-label executives think of her new album. She
is far too busy doing things for herself _ choosing press photos,
writing her own bio, running to Fed Ex and, literally, licking
stamps. But things weren't always this way.
 &HT;    July 1998: Aimee Mann is holed up for the fourth day in a row in
the windowless, hyper-air-conditioned bunker that is Mad Dog
Studios in Burbank, Calif., recording two new songs for her third
solo album, trying her best to create some magic.
 &HT;    Outside, the sun is ridiculously bright, the heat stifling, the
whir of traffic numbing. Adding to the unreal out-of-time feeling
that 10-hour days in a dimly lighted, soundproof room can produce
is the fact that the singers Sheena Easton and Jeffrey Osborne are
in the next studio shooting a Christmas video.
 &HT;    Mann is here today because shortly after she delivered seven new
songs to Geffen Records, she was told by her manager, Michael
Hausman, that the A&AMP;R executives ``didn't hear a single.''
 &HT;    A few days after she got the bad news, she said, more resigned
than angry: ``There's never a single unless you're earmarked for
greatness in the first place. I wish it would be called for what it
is. Like, 'These are good songs, but they're just not grabbing me
for some reason.' Or, 'Production-wise, this doesn't fit into the
format of radio right now.' Or some sort of practical thing. But it
never is. 'Well, it's just not a single.' How can I correct that?
'Oh, well then I'll write some magical thing that will put you into
a trance.' But having said that, sometimes I think it is magic.
Sometimes I think they think it's magic. So they're waiting for
magic.''
 &HT;    She heaved a big sigh _ and then gathered steam. ``But don't
tell me it's not a single. A single is a record company's job: to
pick out a song that they think is good and make sure people hear
it. It's also incidentally, their job to come up with a way of
selling records if, say, I don't have a single at all. What I still
have is a great record with great songs.''
 &HT;    I asked Mann if she is ever tempted simply to give them what
they want.
 &HT;    ``I've sort of tried to do it,'' she said. ``I'll keep it in
mind. I'll think, 'Well, this is pretty catchy' or 'I've kept this
simple enough lyrically so that any moron can understand it.' But
anytime I do that I get bored, and then I don't know how to finish
the song. I really have to force myself to write and get into the
studio, because this is the only career I have.''
 &HT;    So, having resigned herself to the necessity of incanting some
magic and delivering a single, one of the two songs that she is
recording at Mad Dog today is called ``Nothing Is Good Enough.''
 &HT;    Mann is known for writing clever, disappointed love songs that
can also be read as damnations of the music industry. Lyrically and
musically, they are sharp and subtle, angry and vulnerable. Her
last solo record's title _ ``I'm With Stupid'' _ was a sardonic
reference to her choice in both lovers and labels. ``Nothing Is
Good Enough,'' however, is a bit more direct. It's a song about
defeat and the misery of delivering new material to an indifferent
record executive.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't really help that you can never say what you're
looking for,'' she sings with aching sadness over a beautiful piano
arrangement that brings to mind the classic pop of Burt Bacharach
and Carole King. ``But you'll know it when you hear it/know it when
you see it/walk through the door/so you say, so you've said/many
times before.''
 &HT;    It's a testament to her melodic gift and emotional phrasing that
such a subject could sound so lovely, so memorable. It sounds _
could it be? _ like a single.
 &HT;    The next day, Mann, the session musicians and a producer, Buddy
Judge, are back in the studio, and Judge, who worked on the song
after Mann left the night before, plays a polished version of it.
 &HT;    Mann is unhappy. She fears that the piano is too pretty, too
``ballady,'' and sounds too much like another song on the album.
``It's not the Moody Blues '70s flavor I was looking for,'' she
says, slumped in a chair. ``It's one thing to have a song be played
as a gentle, sad ballad and another to be played as an 'Expletive
you,' which is what it's supposed to be. That anger can certainly
be shown and be played. It's very hard for me to show it in the
vocal, which never translates.''
 &HT;    A decision is made to bring in a different drummer, and Mann
tells the piano player to play his part as if he were ``a drunken
clown.'' Hausman suggests a ''John Lennon, immature piano player''
approach.
 &HT;    While waiting for a new drummer, Dan MacCarroll, to arrive (he
is also an A&AMP;R man at a small, independent label), Mann sits down
with Hausman for a talk. ``If this record doesn't sell,'' he says
grimly, ``Geffen's going to drop you.''
 &HT;    Mann sinks farther into her chair and says nothing.
 &HT;    ``I just want you to know the worst-case scenario and to begin
to think about what you're going to do.'' Hausman _ ever the
optimist _ throws out a few suggestions: Go on a small acoustic
tour! Start a new band! Play bass for someone else!
 &HT;    Soon MacCarroll arrives. As Mann strums out the song for him on
her bass guitar, he says, ``What beat do you want me to play it
in?''
 &HT;    She stares at him for a few seconds through her poker-straight,
bleached white hair. ``How about the hit-single beat?'' she says,
and they both snicker. ``You're an A&AMP;R guy now. You know the
hit-single beat.''
 &HT;    As she steps into the booth and puts on her headphones to record
the song once more, she says into the microphone _ her dry, reedy
voice now amplified through every speaker in the studio: ``Whatever
you do, don't ruin it for me. This is my last chance.''
 &HT;    If this truly is Aimee Mann's last chance, it will be a small
tragedy. At 38, she is widely considered by her peers and music
critics alike to be one of the finer songwriters of her generation.
She has collaborated with Elvis Costello, Jules Shear and Chris
Difford and Glenn Tilbrook of Squeeze _ all purveyors of the same
kind of sophisticated pop music that gets little airplay these
days.
 &HT;    When alternative rock's perennial sweetheart, the
singer-songwriter Liz Phair, met Mann backstage at a concert a few
years ago, she knelt before her.
 &HT;    Writing in Time magazine in 1996, David Thigpen called ``I'm
With Stupid'' one of the ''catchiest pop albums of the year,
brimming with poised three-minute mini-masterpieces,'' and said
that ``Mann has the same skill that great tunesmiths like McCartney
and Neil Young have: the knack for writing simple, beautiful,
instantly engaging songs.''
 &HT;    And yet she remains largely unrecognized by radio and the
music-buying public. Bad timing, dumb luck and a rebellious
attitude are partly to blame, but Mann's history of being
mishandled by three different labels over a full decade reads like
a cautionary tale about the struggle to be a serious recording
artist in the contemporary music market.
 &HT;    Mann is not a complete stranger to fame and commercial success.
One of the first songs she ever wrote by herself, ``Voices Carry,''
went to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985, and the album went
on to sell more than a million copies, and made her band, 'Til
Tuesday, early MTV favorites at the height of New Wave.
 &HT;    By the second and third 'Til Tuesday albums, Mann was flowering
as a serious songwriter, and the synthesized dance-pop of the first
album gave way to a more mature acoustic sound (''Strummy songs in
D,'' Mann says), which did not go over well with either her label
or her bandmates _ even as the acoustic sound of Suzanne Vega and
Tracy Chapman was becoming popular.
 &HT;    Mann recorded three 'Til Tuesday albums for Epic Records in the
'80s and then left the label after a rancorous battle over creative
differences. It took her three years to get out of her contract,
and all the while Epic wouldn't let her record elsewhere or release
any new material.
 &HT;    ``That was the beginning of the funk,'' Hausman says, ``the
record-company roulette with contracts and lawyers. That really
changed Aimee.''
 &HT;    Dick Wingate, who originally signed 'Til Tuesday to Epic and was
the executive producer on ``Voices Carry,'' quit the label after
the first album, leaving Mann with no champion.
 &HT;    ``She's the model of an artist who has been chewed up and spit
out by the music business,'' Wingate says. ``But Aimee herself is a
pain. She's not a good people person. She's never really allowed
herself to be close to anyone at any record label, including me.
And the more bad luck and disappointment she had, the more
distanced she became from the process.''
 &HT;    In 1991, Mann released the material she had been working on for
Epic as her first solo album, ``Whatever,'' on Imago, a new
independent label owned by Terry Ellis. Just as her second solo
record was about to be released, Imago lost its distribution deal
and financing and went into a tailspin. Ellis would neither release
her album nor let her out of her contract for almost two years.
Ellis finally sold the album to Geffen, which then signed Mann in
1994 and nearly a full year later released ``I'm With Stupid.''
 &HT;    In 1997, Mann married the singer-songwriter Michael Penn (Sean's
older brother), another critics' darling who, like Mann, had a hit
single, ``No Myth,'' early in his career in 1990 and has since
suffered through two labels botching his next two releases. (Penn
has a new album due out in September from 57 Records, a division of
Epic.)
 &HT;    The couple have been keeping busy, though, cobbling together a
new kind of middle-class rock career making music for films and
performing Tuesday-night shows together at Largo, a sort of mellow
rock supper club in West Hollywood.
 &HT;    Since Largo opened two and a half years ago it has become the
home for a group of wayward singer-songwriters, including Elliott
Smith, Fiona Apple, Rufus Wainwright, Jon Brion, Grant Lee Phillips
(of the band Grant Lee Buffalo) and the godmother of the
underappreciated, Rickie Lee Jones.
 &HT;    Their music can best be described as adult alternative pop. Put
more simply, it's mature music. Brion shot a pilot for VH1 that
tries to transport the Largo vibe to TV, and some have suggested
that Largo is the perfect model for the kind of smaller, focused
record label that could lovingly and successfully break what the
industry deems ``difficult'' artists like Mann.
 &HT;    Another comfort zone for both Mann and Penn has been the film
industry. He has found work as a composer for the director Paul
Thomas Anderson's movies, including ``Boogie Nights'' and ``Hard
Eight,'' while she has had songs on a dozen soundtracks in the past
few years.
 &HT;    Anderson, a Largo habitue and Fiona Apple's live-in boyfriend,
has practically written his new film, ``Magnolia,'' starring Tom
Cruise, around eight Aimee Mann songs. ``Simon and Garfunkel is to
'The Graduate,''' Anderson says, ``as Aimee Mann is to
'Magnolia.'''
 &HT;    Music artists stand to gain from the independent movement in the
film industry. Elliott Smith's song ``Miss Misery'' appeared in Gus
Van Zandt's ``Good Will Hunting'' and was nominated for an Academy
Award. His performance on the Oscars in 1998 surely provided him
with the largest audience he'll ever reach.
 &HT;    Says Brion of Mann's work on ``Magnolia,'' due out later this
year, ``That might be an alternative way of letting the world see
that this is really a good batch of material.''
 &HT;    Indeed, with the example of artists like Ani DiFranco, who
successfully started her own label, Righteous Babe, and the hotly
contested MP3 technology, which allows listeners to download music
from the Internet, artists suddenly have more motivation than ever
to circumvent commercial taste and traditional _ some say
soon-to-be-moribund _ means of distribution. Many artists believe
that the industry's blindered focus on youth and singles will force
their hands.
 &HT;    ``People in my demographic aren't considered the juicy part of
the record-buying public,'' says Gail Marowitz, 40, vice president
of creative services at Sony Music (and Mann's personal art
director and best girlfriend). ``They think we're already old _
even though we buy plenty of records.''
 &HT;    By January, there's good news. Mann has been picked up by
Interscope, and has presented a dozen songs for an album,
``Bachelor No. 2.'' On March 22, at a big meeting with the three
principals at Interscope _ Jimmy Iovine, Ted Fields and Tom Whalley
_ she finds out Iovine hasn't yet listened to the record. He tells
Mann he'll listen to it and call her in two days. He never calls.
 &HT;    Finally, the truth _ the bad news _ comes. ``They don't like the
record,'' she tells me.
 &HT;    By the following week, Mann is finally taking steps toward doing
something she probably should have done long ago: becoming
sovereign. Her lawyers are negotiating a price to buy back her
master recordings from Interscope. Hausman has hired someone to
build a Web site. And he and Mann are exploring the possibilities
of starting their own label. Mann would like to call it Superego
Records.
 &HT;    ``If Aimee sold 70,000 records independently,'' Marowitz says,
``she would be making more money than if she sold 300,000 on a
major label. And Aimee's good for 70,000, and she'll get major
distribution. Ultimately, it's a very good thing.''
 &HT;    In June, Mann gets booked on four Lilith Fair dates in early
August: Buffalo, Boston, Hartford and Jones Beach _ and says that
there may even be a record for sale by then.
 &HT;    ``I'm feeling good,'' she says of her newfound independence,
``because I'm tapped into something that I'm more suited to.'' The
decadelong major-label nightmare is finally ending.

 By PETER LANDESMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: World rights, except for the UK, until further notice  
 &HT;    Before John Myatt was sentenced to prison in February for his
part as a forger in perhaps the most ingenious and damaging art con
of the 20th century, he lived in a huble cottage on a narrow lane
in the idyllic Staffordshire village of Sugnall, a three-hour drive
northwest of London.
 &HT;    To his neighbors, he appeared to be an unremarkable painter who
had never established a style with which to spawn a career.
 &HT;    He also wrote catchy pop tunes. If Myatt was known for anything,
it was for a hit single, ``Silly Games,'' which made the British
Top 40 in 1979.
 &HT;    But beginning in 1986, Myatt discovered that he could paint like
the masters, and for the next nine years he led a secret and
stunningly successful professional life as a painter.
 &HT;    Braque, Matisse, Giacometti, Le Corbusier, all became part of
his repertoire. He faked their styles with such virtuosity that his
paintings passed for the real thing.
 &HT;    Then, one morning in September 1995, Myatt opened his front door
to walk his young son to the school bus and found policemen in his
yard. A plainclothes officer introduced himself as Jonathan Searle,
a one-time painter, restorer and art historian, and now detective
sergeant at Scotland Yard.
 &HT;    Myatt, 50, sturdily built with the toughened hands of a laborer,
nodded with resigned expectancy and invited the policemen inside
for tea. Then he asked if could walk his son to the bus.
 &HT;    While he did, the officers ransacked the house. Upon returning,
Myatt stood in the studio with Searle, surveying the chaos.
 &HT;    ``Do you like this one?'' Myatt asked, pointing to a competent
if undistinguished drawing of his son.
 &HT;    Searle nodded sympathetically, but was amazed by what looked to
be paintings by Giacometti, Chagall, Braque and Dubuffet hanging
about the room. Drawing pads lying around showed sketched studies
for works by Giacometti, Le Corbusier and Ben Nicholson.
 &HT;    Myatt confessed on the spot to having drawn and painted what the
police later said were about 200 forgeries in the styles of nine
modern masters and personally delivering them to London, one
roughly every six weeks, to a man by the name of John Drewe.
 &HT;    Scotland Yard already suspected Drewe of masterminding the sale
of Myatt's forgeries (and perhaps those of at least one other
painter, still unidentified) through the auction houses Christie's,
Sotheby's and Phillips, as well as reputable dealers in London,
Paris and New York.
 &HT;    Then Myatt told Searle something the police didn't know: that
he'd made most of the pictures out of an easily detectable
household emulsion paint developed in the mid-'60s, decades after
most of the paintings were supposed to have been executed. In some
cases, he used K-Y Jelly as a medium to add body and fluidity to
his brushstrokes.
 &HT;    Myatt had no idea how many millions had changed hands on account
of his paintings, but estimated that he had earned as much as
$165,000 over the years, some of which was deposited into a Swiss
bank account in his name. The painter immediately offered to return
the $30,000 he still had and to help snare Drewe.
 &HT;    Seven months later, on April 6, 1996, after recording
conversations between the partners, detectives raided Drewe's home
in the tony London suburb of Reigate, where they found hundreds of
documents from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Gallery and
the Institute of Contemporary Art.
 &HT;    Sitting on Drewe's kitchen table were two catalogues missing
from the V. and A.'s National Art Library, still in the museum bag
that Drewe had used to smuggle them out. There were rubber stamps
bearing the authenticating seals of the Tate and of an order of
monastic priests; receipts for the sale of paintings across
continents going back decades; certificates of authenticity from
the estates of Dubuffet and Giacometti; also the more mundane
instruments of document forgery: scissors, razors, correction
fluid, glue, tape.
 &HT;    As police and art experts soon discovered, forging masterpieces,
as Myatt had done, was the least of it. Drewe's real genius lay in
his ability to authenticate Myatt's works through bogus provenances
_ the history of a work of art, from its creation through its
purchasings and exhibitions to its current ownership, crucial
elements in the sale of any picture.
 &HT;    It would turn out that over the previous 10 years, Drewe had
systematically infiltrated some of the most security-conscious art
archives in the world, altering the provenances of genuine
paintings to establish a lineage making way for Myatt's mostly
unexceptional forgeries, and then seeding the collections with
false records that provided the pictures with instant heritage. The
scale of the corruption is unprecedented. The method is too.
 &HT;    Archivists may never know how much of their libraries have been
compromised. Of the approximately 200 ``masterworks'' Myatt painted
and Drewe sold, the police have located only 73. Drewe did more
than slip phony pictures into a market hungry for important
contemporary art _ he altered art history.
 &HT;    The police call the con ``the biggest contemporary art fraud the
20th century has seen.'' The British prosecution office declared
Drewe a menace to Britain's cultural patrimony.
 &HT;    The scandal has not only upset the market for the artists Myatt
forged, but it has also exposed the art industry as its own worst
enemy _ too reliant on sources of authenticity that are vulnerable
to manipulation and riddled with conflicts of interest that invite
corruption.
 &HT;    Drewe's story says less about his own brilliance than about the
readiness _ if not the willingness _ of the art world to be
deceived.
 &HT;    ``It's one of the most extensive frauds in the visual arts,''
says Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art. ``What
distinguishes this case is how methodical Drewe was, and how well
he understood the process of validation. His manipulation of the
system is as interesting and troubling as the forgeries
themselves.''
 &HT;    When Drewe found him, Myatt's life was in wretched shape,
emotionally and financially. His wife had recently abandoned him
and their two young children, and he was left to scratch out a
meager living teaching art in the local schools.
 &HT;    ``I spent all day teaching other people's children and had no
time for my own,'' he told me this spring in Brixton Prison, in
southwest London, where he was serving a one-year sentence for
conspiracy to defraud. (He was released in June.) ``I wasn't doing
my own painting. I needed to find a way to work at home.''
 &HT;    A few years before, a friend had offered to pay him $400 to copy
a painting by the French Post-Impressionist Raoul Dufy. He copied
the picture and Dufy's signature so masterfully that his friend
told him his painting was fooling art experts.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was funny,'' Myatt says with a shrug, insisting
he didn't give it another thought until he became desperate to stay
at home with his children. In 1986, he placed a classified ad in
Private Eye, a satirical London biweekly: ``19th- and 20th-century
fakes for $240.''
 &HT;    He received a call from a ``Professor Drewe,'' who said he was a
nuclear physicist in need of paintings to decorate his home. Drewe
asked first for a Matisse, then a Klee, then two marine paintings
in the style of 17th-century Dutch masters.
 &HT;    Myatt would meet Drewe at London's Euston Station to deliver the
rolled canvases. They'd have a pint together. Myatt began to
confide in Drewe about the turmoil of his divorce. Drewe offered
advice and comfort and eventually invited him to his home. ``I saw
the size of his house,'' Myatt says, ``his Mercedes, his clothes,
his manner.''
 &HT;    Drewe told Myatt that in addition to his work for the Ministry
of Defense, he was associated with British Intelligence. He pulled
back his jacket to reveal two pistols in shoulder holsters.
 &HT;    ``I was very much your creature,'' Myatt would later say to
Drewe in court. ``I found you hypnotizing and challenging and a
very exciting person to be around.'' One day Drewe asked Myatt what
style he wanted to paint in. Myatt told Drewe he'd always relished
the idea of painting in the Cubist style. Myatt soon painted Drewe
a Braque.
 &HT;    One evening in 1986, Drewe called Myatt with news. ``'I took one
of your paintings to Christie's, and they said it was worth
$38,000,''' Myatt recalls Drewe as saying. ``That was the moment
that the legitimate business stopped and the crime began. He said
to come down to London and we'll talk it over. I said: 'I can't
believe it. Are you aware it's painted in emulsion paint?''' He
pauses. ``My vanity was quite ghastly,'' he says. ``The mistake
occurred here. My reaction was to express an interest.''
 &HT;    Drewe's timing, in many ways, couldn't have been better. By the
mid-'80s, the art market was generating unprecedented profits and
front-page headlines.
 &HT;    Jasper Johns' ``False Start,'' which cost $3,150 in 1960, sold
for $17 million in 1988. Picasso's ``Yo Picasso'' sold for $47.9
million in 1989, more than twice the preauction estimate. In 1990,
Van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' a painting whose
authenticity is still controversial, was bought by a Japanese
collector for a record $82.5 million. The prices of pictures even
by obscure artists skyrocketed. Myatt's ``masterpieces'' were
suddenly hot commodities.
 &HT;    The painter took trips to Coventry Cathedral to copy Graham
Sutherland's studies for his huge tapestry of Christ in His glory.
He meditated on Giacometti reproductions, then took five hours to
paint a picture that eventually sold for $175,000.
 &HT;    Myatt moved on to Ben Nicholson, Nicolas de Stael, Le Corbusier,
Matisse, Roger Bissiere, glorying in painting his way through
20th-century art history. His unorthodox formula of emulsion and
K-Y Jelly was fast-drying, allowing him to paint quickly, if
obsessively. ``I took no trouble technically,'' he says. ``There
was a negligence to everything I did.''
 &HT;    Even so, his pictures were passing as genuine and selling for
tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was enjoying a
financial success he could never have approached by painting
Myatts. Perhaps no other forger of his or any other time has worked
so prodigiously and in so many styles.
 &HT;    ``It was a kind of addiction,'' he says, then shakes his head
sadly. ``It was shocking, it quite terrified me. The moment they
started to restore them they would know what they were faced
with.''
 &HT;    But Drewe calmed his nerves by telling Myatt, who a year before
had been lovelorn and broke, how brilliant he was, how rich he
would get. ``I was flattered into thinking I was a man of
importance,'' Myatt says, although he concedes he had an ``abiding
sense of unreality, that this wasn't really happening, that this
would all end in tears.''
 &HT;    Before Myatt, the most successful forgers of our time counted on
the brute force of their pictures, imitating one or two giants of
art so that the paintings' discovery would be splashy news, the
reclamation of a ``lost masterpiece.''
 &HT;    Hans van Meegeren aped Vermeer in the 1930s and '40s; the
flamboyant Tom Keating did Rembrandt in the 1950s, and Eric Hebborn
copied Augustus John, Corot and others of their ilk.
 &HT;    Hard information on the quantity of bogus art sold is difficult
to come by, in part because fraud, when discovered by dealers and
auction houses, is usually kept secret to boost public confidence
in the art market.
 &HT;    Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, has said that during his tenure, a full 40 percent of the
artworks considered for purchase by the museum were phony or
overrestored. Geraldine Norman, the British art journalist credited
with exposing Keating and Hebborn, says that at least 10 percent of
the pictures purportedly made by major Impressionists are fake.
 &HT;    Some experts say that as much as 60 percent of the Giacomettis
on the market are fake, at least in part as a result of Drewe's
con. Forty percent of pictures supposedly from the Russian
avant-garde era are almost certainly forgeries. The widows of
Modigliani and Chagall were accused of selling certificates of
authentication.
 &HT;    Salvador Dali, lying on his deathbed in a stupor, is said to
have been fed thousands of sheets of blank paper to sign for fake
lithographs. In a grotesquely sad twist, the Italian painter
Giorgio de Chirico was caught back-dating new pictures to a time,
20 years previously, when his work was popular and in heavy demand,
in effect forging himself.
 &HT;    Modern art, in particular, seems especially vulnerable to fraud.
Its abstractions are sometimes difficult to understand or grasp,
and a modern painting is often loved less because of its intrinsic
quality _ its beauty, as conventionally understood _ than because
of the identity of the painter, its mark of social status.
 &HT;    Says Hoving: ``When the collector gets what he wants and he's
told it isn't real, he says, 'I don't care, to me it's a Renoir.'''
Even though one forged Giacometti, a 1955 ``Nu Debout'' Drewe sold
to two New York dealers, is obviously lacking in the artist's
typical depth of field and manic linearity, one of the dealers
maintains, ``I still think it's one of the best Giacomettis I've
ever seen.''
 &HT;    As Geraldine Norman puts it, many collectors' interests in art
``are reflections of social climbing and romanticism about names, a
thousand things that have nothing to do with the surface of the
work of art you are looking at.''
 &HT;    A forger's chief motivation is typically intellectual
gamesmanship. Embittered by the spurning of his own work, he takes
satisfaction in suckering the entire art world en masse, then
pulling aside the curtain, exposing himself as a renegade genius
and the art experts as the frauds and fools.
 &HT;    Drewe had a different strategy: to deliver low-profile paintings
in high volume, make multiple hits for hundreds of thousands of
dollars _ which would not attract unwanted attention _ rather than
a few jackpots worth millions.
 &HT;    In fact, Drewe changed and fabricated so many records at both
the Victoria and Albert and the Tate, and with so many different
artists, that the directors of both museums admit that they may
never know how much of their collection has been corrupted.
 &HT;    And the scandal has reverberated in the United States. Lowry,
for one, is deeply concerned about MOMA. ``We take our role as a
public institution very seriously,'' he says. ``That means
providing as much access as possible to research documents. The
thought that we have to think about restricting access is
profoundly troubling.''
 &HT;    Once Drewe was discovered, Lowry says, a process of reverse
screenings took place on both sides of the Atlantic. Records were
scoured, paintings were re-examined, all to purge the system. ``It
will take years, probably, before it is fully accomplished,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Drew is now serving a six-year sentence for conspiracy to
defraud and multiple counts of forgery; he is appealing his
conviction.
 &HT;    If his success provides any lesson, it is that the art world's
aura of sophistication creates a false sense of security that makes
it especially vulnerable to what was, in the end, a confederacy of
mediocrity.
 &HT;    Myatt's sloppy pictures and Drewe's litany of far-fetched cons
should have been no match for such sophisticated auction houses,
scholars and dealers. But in the end, the system's multiple lines
of defense _ dealers, galleries, auction houses, museums, archives,
world-class experts _ proved all too permeable.
 &HT;    Yet, one might ask, if a picture brings esthetic pleasure and is
beloved before its fictitious pedigree is exposed, and the only
person who loses money is a collector probably wealthy enough to
absorb the loss, then where exactly is the problem?
 &HT;    As Van Meegeren said at his 1947 trial for forgery about a
Vermeer he had faked: ``Yesterday this picture was worth millions
of guilders, and experts and art lovers would come from all over
the world and pay money to see it. Today, it is worth nothing, and
nobody would cross the street to see it for free. But the picture
has not changed. What has?''

 By PETER LANDESMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: World rights, except for the UK, until further notice  
 &HT;    Before John Myatt was sentenced to prison in February for his
part as a forger in perhaps the most ingenious and damaging art con
of the 20th century, he lived in a humble cottage on a narrow lane
in the idyllic Staffordshire village of Sugnall, a three-hour drive
northwest of London.
 &HT;    To his neighbors, he appeared to be an unremarkable painter who
had never established a style with which to spawn a career.
 &HT;    He also wrote catchy pop tunes. If Myatt was known for anything,
it was for a hit single, ``Silly Games,'' which made the British
Top 40 in 1979.
 &HT;    But beginning in 1986, Myatt discovered that he could paint like
the masters, and for the next nine years he led a secret and
stunningly successful professional life as a painter.
 &HT;    Braque, Matisse, Giacometti, Le Corbusier, all became part of
his repertoire. He faked their styles with such virtuosity that his
paintings passed for the real thing.
 &HT;    Then, one morning in September 1995, Myatt opened his front door
to walk his young son to the school bus and found policemen in his
yard. A plainclothes officer introduced himself as Jonathan Searle,
a one-time painter, restorer and art historian, and now detective
sergeant at Scotland Yard.
 &HT;    Myatt, 50, sturdily built with the toughened hands of a laborer,
nodded with resigned expectancy and invited the policemen inside
for tea. Then he asked if could walk his son to the bus.
 &HT;    While he did, the officers ransacked the house. Upon returning,
Myatt stood in the studio with Searle, surveying the chaos.
 &HT;    ``Do you like this one?'' Myatt asked, pointing to a competent
if undistinguished drawing of his son.
 &HT;    Searle nodded sympathetically, but was amazed by what looked to
be paintings by Giacometti, Chagall, Braque and Dubuffet hanging
about the room. Drawing pads lying around showed sketched studies
for works by Giacometti, Le Corbusier and Ben Nicholson.
 &HT;    Myatt confessed on the spot to having drawn and painted what the
police later said were about 200 forgeries in the styles of nine
modern masters and personally delivering them to London, one
roughly every six weeks, to a man by the name of John Drewe.
 &HT;    Scotland Yard already suspected Drewe of masterminding the sale
of Myatt's forgeries (and perhaps those of at least one other
painter, still unidentified) through the auction houses Christie's,
Sotheby's and Phillips, as well as reputable dealers in London,
Paris and New York.
 &HT;    Then Myatt told Searle something the police didn't know: that
he'd made most of the pictures out of an easily detectable
household emulsion paint developed in the mid-'60s, decades after
most of the paintings were supposed to have been executed. In some
cases, he used K-Y Jelly as a medium to add body and fluidity to
his brushstrokes.
 &HT;    Myatt had no idea how many millions had changed hands on account
of his paintings, but estimated that he had earned as much as
$165,000 over the years, some of which was deposited into a Swiss
bank account in his name. The painter immediately offered to return
the $30,000 he still had and to help snare Drewe.
 &HT;    Seven months later, on April 6, 1996, after recording
conversations between the partners, detectives raided Drewe's home
in the tony London suburb of Reigate, where they found hundreds of
documents from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Gallery and
the Institute of Contemporary Art.
 &HT;    Sitting on Drewe's kitchen table were two catalogues missing
from the V. and A.'s National Art Library, still in the museum bag
that Drewe had used to smuggle them out. There were rubber stamps
bearing the authenticating seals of the Tate and of an order of
monastic priests; receipts for the sale of paintings across
continents going back decades; certificates of authenticity from
the estates of Dubuffet and Giacometti; also the more mundane
instruments of document forgery: scissors, razors, correction
fluid, glue, tape.
 &HT;    As police and art experts soon discovered, forging masterpieces,
as Myatt had done, was the least of it. Drewe's real genius lay in
his ability to authenticate Myatt's works through bogus provenances
_ the history of a work of art, from its creation through its
purchasings and exhibitions to its current ownership, crucial
elements in the sale of any picture.
 &HT;    It would turn out that over the previous 10 years, Drewe had
systematically infiltrated some of the most security-conscious art
archives in the world, altering the provenances of genuine
paintings to establish a lineage making way for Myatt's mostly
unexceptional forgeries, and then seeding the collections with
false records that provided the pictures with instant heritage. The
scale of the corruption is unprecedented. The method is too.
 &HT;    Archivists may never know how much of their libraries have been
compromised. Of the approximately 200 ``masterworks'' Myatt painted
and Drewe sold, the police have located only 73. Drewe did more
than slip phony pictures into a market hungry for important
contemporary art _ he altered art history.
 &HT;    The police call the con ``the biggest contemporary art fraud the
20th century has seen.'' The British prosecution office declared
Drewe a menace to Britain's cultural patrimony.
 &HT;    The scandal has not only upset the market for the artists Myatt
forged, but it has also exposed the art industry as its own worst
enemy _ too reliant on sources of authenticity that are vulnerable
to manipulation and riddled with conflicts of interest that invite
corruption.
 &HT;    Drewe's story says less about his own brilliance than about the
readiness _ if not the willingness _ of the art world to be
deceived.
 &HT;    ``It's one of the most extensive frauds in the visual arts,''
says Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art. ``What
distinguishes this case is how methodical Drewe was, and how well
he understood the process of validation. His manipulation of the
system is as interesting and troubling as the forgeries
themselves.''
 &HT;    When Drewe found him, Myatt's life was in wretched shape,
emotionally and financially. His wife had recently abandoned him
and their two young children, and he was left to scratch out a
meager living teaching art in the local schools.
 &HT;    ``I spent all day teaching other people's children and had no
time for my own,'' he told me this spring in Brixton Prison, in
southwest London, where he was serving a one-year sentence for
conspiracy to defraud. (He was released in June.) ``I wasn't doing
my own painting. I needed to find a way to work at home.''
 &HT;    A few years before, a friend had offered to pay him $400 to copy
a painting by the French Post-Impressionist Raoul Dufy. He copied
the picture and Dufy's signature so masterfully that his friend
told him his painting was fooling art experts.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was funny,'' Myatt says with a shrug, insisting
he didn't give it another thought until he became desperate to stay
at home with his children. In 1986, he placed a classified ad in
Private Eye, a satirical London biweekly: ``19th- and 20th-century
fakes for $240.''
 &HT;    He received a call from a ``Professor Drewe,'' who said he was a
nuclear physicist in need of paintings to decorate his home. Drewe
asked first for a Matisse, then a Klee, then two marine paintings
in the style of 17th-century Dutch masters.
 &HT;    Myatt would meet Drewe at London's Euston Station to deliver the
rolled canvases. They'd have a pint together. Myatt began to
confide in Drewe about the turmoil of his divorce. Drewe offered
advice and comfort and eventually invited him to his home. ``I saw
the size of his house,'' Myatt says, ``his Mercedes, his clothes,
his manner.''
 &HT;    Drewe told Myatt that in addition to his work for the Ministry
of Defense, he was associated with British Intelligence. He pulled
back his jacket to reveal two pistols in shoulder holsters.
 &HT;    ``I was very much your creature,'' Myatt would later say to
Drewe in court. ``I found you hypnotizing and challenging and a
very exciting person to be around.'' One day Drewe asked Myatt what
style he wanted to paint in. Myatt told Drewe he'd always relished
the idea of painting in the Cubist style. Myatt soon painted Drewe
a Braque.
 &HT;    One evening in 1986, Drewe called Myatt with news. ``'I took one
of your paintings to Christie's, and they said it was worth
$38,000,''' Myatt recalls Drewe as saying. ``That was the moment
that the legitimate business stopped and the crime began. He said
to come down to London and we'll talk it over. I said: 'I can't
believe it. Are you aware it's painted in emulsion paint?''' He
pauses. ``My vanity was quite ghastly,'' he says. ``The mistake
occurred here. My reaction was to express an interest.''
 &HT;    Drewe's timing, in many ways, couldn't have been better. By the
mid-'80s, the art market was generating unprecedented profits and
front-page headlines.
 &HT;    Jasper Johns' ``False Start,'' which cost $3,150 in 1960, sold
for $17 million in 1988. Picasso's ``Yo Picasso'' sold for $47.9
million in 1989, more than twice the preauction estimate. In 1990,
Van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' a painting whose
authenticity is still controversial, was bought by a Japanese
collector for a record $82.5 million. The prices of pictures even
by obscure artists skyrocketed. Myatt's ``masterpieces'' were
suddenly hot commodities.
 &HT;    The painter took trips to Coventry Cathedral to copy Graham
Sutherland's studies for his huge tapestry of Christ in His glory.
He meditated on Giacometti reproductions, then took five hours to
paint a picture that eventually sold for $175,000.
 &HT;    Myatt moved on to Ben Nicholson, Nicolas de Stael, Le Corbusier,
Matisse, Roger Bissiere, glorying in painting his way through
20th-century art history. His unorthodox formula of emulsion and
K-Y Jelly was fast-drying, allowing him to paint quickly, if
obsessively. ``I took no trouble technically,'' he says. ``There
was a negligence to everything I did.''
 &HT;    Even so, his pictures were passing as genuine and selling for
tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was enjoying a
financial success he could never have approached by painting
Myatts. Perhaps no other forger of his or any other time has worked
so prodigiously and in so many styles.
 &HT;    ``It was a kind of addiction,'' he says, then shakes his head
sadly. ``It was shocking, it quite terrified me. The moment they
started to restore them they would know what they were faced
with.''
 &HT;    But Drewe calmed his nerves by telling Myatt, who a year before
had been lovelorn and broke, how brilliant he was, how rich he
would get. ``I was flattered into thinking I was a man of
importance,'' Myatt says, although he concedes he had an ``abiding
sense of unreality, that this wasn't really happening, that this
would all end in tears.''
 &HT;    Before Myatt, the most successful forgers of our time counted on
the brute force of their pictures, imitating one or two giants of

reclamation of a ``lost masterpiece.''
 &HT;    Hans van Meegeren aped Vermeer in the 1930s and '40s; the
flamboyant Tom Keating did Rembrandt in the 1950s, and Eric Hebborn

 &HT;    Hard information on the quantity of bogus art sold is difficult
to come by, in part because fraud, when discovered by dealers and

 &HT;    Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of

artworks considered for purchase by the museum were phony or
overrestored. Geraldine Norman, the British art journalist credited
with exposing Keating and Hebborn, says that at least 10 percent of
the pictures purportedly made by major Impressionists are fake.
 &HT;    Some experts say that as much as 60 percent of the Giacomettis
on the market are fake, at least in part as a result of Drewe's
con. Forty percent of pictures supposedly from the Russian
avant-garde era are almost certainly forgeries. The widows of
Modigliani and Chagall were accused of selling certificates of
authentication.
 &HT;    Salvador Dali, lying on his deathbed in a stupor, is said to

 &HT;    Says Hoving: ``When the collector gets what he wants and he's
told it isn't real, he says, 'I don't care, to me it's a Renoir.'''
Even though one forged Giacometti, a 1955 ``Nu Debout'' Drewe sold
to two New York dealers, is obviously lacking in the artist's
typical depth of field and manic linearity, one of the dealers
maintains, ``I still think it's one of the best Giacomettis I've
ever seen.''
 &HT;    As Geraldine Norman puts it, many collectors' interests in art
``are reflections of social climbing and romanticism about names, a

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''

   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette Kennedy has been a designer's dream: a striking
woman of easy, unstudied style who, along with her husband,
commanded a room the minute she walked in.
</P>
<P>
   A true clotheshorse, she was sighted regularly at Prada and
Barneys and gained recognition as diverse as a ``VH-1 Fashion
Awards'' nomination and an appearance on the ever-stodgy Best
Dressed list.
</P>
<P>
   ``She chooses simple, severe looks that not everyone would
wear,'' said Gucci's Tom Ford, reached over the weekend at his
apartment in Paris. ``She knows how to set off her beauty with
clothes. That's a rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, like all the designers contacted Sunday, was insistent on
not talking about Bessette Kennedy in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the look of the '90s,'' said Karl Lagerfeld from the
Chanel atelier. ``She is not a label girl. Everything that she wore
looked fabulous on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Oscar de la Renta, who designed the dress Ethel Kennedy
was to wear for her daughter Rory's wedding: ``She is the
incarnation of modern style.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Bessette Kennedy, with her piercing blue eyes and
silken blond mane, possessed an arresting beauty that many
characterized as uniquely American _ and uniquely contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette first appeared on fashion's radar screen when
she worked at a Boston-area Calvin Klein boutique after graduating
from Boston University. It wasn't long before sharp-eyed executives
transferred her to the New York headquarters to be closer to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There, her influence was disproportionate to her experience. She
was not only moving quickly in the office _ she had Calvin's ear
and his wife Kelly's friendship _ but out on the town as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has real street smarts,'' one observer remarked. ``She
knew what was going to be a trend long before anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Charming, intelligent and funny, Bessette could also be
mercurial and tough. Most importantly, she seemed indifferent to
celebrity _ making her ideal for her first assignment: assisting
VIPs in the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be one of the things that attracted (Kennedy) to
her _ she had such repartee and such wit,'' said New York publicist
Paul Wilmot, who also worked at Calvin Klein back then. ``She had
just enough sense of sarcasm. All these things that seemed so
serious in the fashion world _ she would cut right through them.
From day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein, reached late Sunday afternoon, continued to
express hope about Bessette Kennedy, even as the news trickling out
of Martha's Vineyard remained relentlessly pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hopes and prayers are that they still will all be found
alive, and my thoughts are with Carolyn's family and the whole
Kennedy family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 feature on up-and-coming New Yorkers, W magazine
described Bessette, then 25, with her ``mannequin proportions and
sultry blue-eyed beauty,'' as ``merely a physically blessed real
person. Sort of.'' Just recently promoted to the Collection
position at the time, she revealed how she decided against pursuing
a career in teaching despite majoring in elementary education in
college: ``At the time, I felt a little underdeveloped myself to be
completely responsible for 25 other people's children,'' she
explained. ``And to a large extent, I felt it wouldn't be
provocative enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Carolyn met not long after her arrival in New York,
though accounts differ as to the circumstances. One has them
meeting by chance during a Central Park jog. In others, Kelly Klein
plays matchmaker, introducing them either at a party or during a
showroom visit at Calvin Klein by the young Kennedy scion.
</P>
<P>
   The match wasn't immediate, however. Kennedy was dating Daryl
Hannah, and Carolyn was seeing Calvin Klein model Michael Bergin.
Besides, Bessette was a veteran party girl, while Kennedy, known to
ride to black-tie events on his bicycle, was more of an athletic
outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1994 the couple was an item. And while wildcat videos of
arguments between John and Carolyn replay continually on taboid TV
shows, the pair often seemed the very image of a loving couple when
together. He could appear protective of her in public settings, and
when they were seated at separate tables at a large benefit dinner,
he would frequently check that all was well.
</P>
<P>
   They could even be a little sappy. ``How're you doing,
honey-bunny?'' John asked her at a star-studded party at New York's
Asia de Cuba restaurant to celebrate the second anniversary of
George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a long, black Yohji dress and ebony polished calf
Manolos, Bessette Kennedy stood with her husband at the party's
entrance for nearly two hours meeting and greeting guests ranging
from Lee Radziwill to Anne Heche to Ian Schrager. She had a word
for everyone _ even '70s rocker Ted Nugent who walked in wearing a
Ducks Unlimited cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be too hard on those ducks,'' she teased.
</P>
<P>
   While their public appearances together were rare _ any party
they went to automatically assumed the proportions of a major event
_ they were not entirely reclusive. They occasionally could be
spotted among the chic crowd at such eateries at TriBeCa's trendy
Independent, Greenwich Village's Il Cantinori or at the cozy NoLIta
bistro La Cigale.
</P>
<P>
   And when out of the public eye, they definitely knew how to do
casual. The week after Easter this spring, the couple stayed near
Vero Beach, Fla., at a house borrowed from financier Pete Peterson
while John took additional flying lessons at nearby Flight Safety,
where he had earned his pilot's license and was training for an
instrument-rating license.
</P>
<P>
   During the long weekend, the couple would head out to the local
cafe in shorts and sports sandals for an al fresco Breakfast. Her
famous blond hair was hidden beneath a bandanna, but otherwise they
blended in _ as much as America's most famous couple could be
inconspicuous. Bodyguards and large retinues were not their style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were teachers of how to live with grace and style
and with being celebrities,'' Donna Karan said.
</P>
<P>
   That, particularly, did not come easily for Carolyn. Although
she handled her role as Kennedy wife extremely well, Bessette
Kennedy was clearly ambivalent about the hysteria that greeted her
engagement and then marriage to America's favorite bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Bessette's wedding to Kennedy in 1996 was perhaps her first
major brush with the care she'd have to use to protect her private
life. A 50-member security team, hired at a cost of $250,000, began
coordinating with state troopers, the police and the National Park
Service five days in advance to provide safety and secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches and marinas within a 15-mile radius of Cumberland
Island, Ga., were watched, and all boats (or hikers) bound for the
island were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the couple honeymooned in Turkey and Greece, the rumor
mill kicked into high gear. The big question on the minds of the
publishing world was who would get her for their cover. The answer:
no one. Nor would she choose to add her name to a vanity list of
contributing editors or even grant interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Next, of course, came talk that she was pregnant, a rumor she
handled with typical skill and aplomb. At the 1997 premiere of
``Air Force One'' in Washington, Tommy Hilfiger and John were
passing around snacks. She declined an offer of Goobers, she told
Hilfiger, because if she indulged, the press would think she's
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you pregnant?'' Hilfiger asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Bessette Kennedy slipped away from the
crowd at another party to a secluded table and ordered a drink from
the waiter. When she took a cigarette from a guest at the party,
she glanced up with a wry smile and said, ``I guess you know this
means I'm not pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her marriage, Bessette Kennedy had tried to avoid the
incessant media attention _ and not always successfully. Yet she
managed to find humor in the strangest of situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into my grandmother's house one day and she was on
the phone talking to someone called Bambi,'' she once said in an
interview with WWD. ``I couldn't figure out who this Bambi was. `Oh
Bambi, I don't think that's true,' she was saying, and `Sure,
anytime you want, Bambi.' Finally she got off the phone and I said,
`Who's Bambi?' And she said, `Oh, Bambi's my friend from ``Hard
Copy.''' And, of course, she had no idea what `Hard Copy' was.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the same grandmother who was a trifle disappointed at
Carolyn and John's living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks after we moved into the loft, she came to visit,''
Carolyn remembered. ``She was unimpressed. `So you married this
famous man and you're in every newspaper and this is where you
live?''' she quoted her grandmother as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Carolyn prided herself on not being an uptown girl.
When she first came to New York, she moved to the East Village,
long before it was the yuppie haven it has now become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to step over drunks and crack dealers to get to my
apartment,'' she remembered. ``Everybody at Calvin thought I was
crazy, but I couldn't imagine coming to New York and living
anywhere else. Even with all the weirdness, I felt comfortable and
I had fun.''

   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette Kennedy has been a designer's dream: a striking
woman of easy, unstudied style who, along with her husband,
commanded a room the minute she walked in.
</P>
<P>
   A true clotheshorse, she was sighted regularly at Prada and
Barneys and gained recognition as diverse as a ``VH-1 Fashion
Awards'' nomination and an appearance on the ever-stodgy Best
Dressed list.
</P>
<P>
   ``She chooses simple, severe looks that not everyone would
wear,'' said Gucci's Tom Ford, reached over the weekend at his
apartment in Paris. ``She knows how to set off her beauty with
clothes. That's a rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, like all the designers contacted Sunday, was insistent on
not talking about Bessette Kennedy in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the look of the '90s,'' said Karl Lagerfeld from the
Chanel atelier. ``She is not a label girl. Everything that she wore
looked fabulous on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Oscar de la Renta, who designed the dress Ethel Kennedy
was to wear for her daughter Rory's wedding: ``She is the
incarnation of modern style.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Bessette Kennedy, with her piercing blue eyes and
silken blond mane, possessed an arresting beauty that many
characterized as uniquely American _ and uniquely contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette first appeared on fashion's radar screen when
she worked at a Boston-area Calvin Klein boutique after graduating
from Boston University. It wasn't long before sharp-eyed executives
transferred her to the New York headquarters to be closer to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There, her influence was disproportionate to her experience. She
was not only moving quickly in the office _ she had Calvin's ear
and his wife Kelly's friendship _ but out on the town as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has real street smarts,'' one observer remarked. ``She
knew what was going to be a trend long before anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Charming, intelligent and funny, Bessette could also be
mercurial and tough. Most importantly, she seemed indifferent to
celebrity _ making her ideal for her first assignment: assisting
VIPs in the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be one of the things that attracted (Kennedy) to
her _ she had such repartee and such wit,'' said New York publicist
Paul Wilmot, who also worked at Calvin Klein back then. ``She had
just enough sense of sarcasm. All these things that seemed so
serious in the fashion world _ she would cut right through them.
From day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein, reached late Sunday afternoon, continued to
express hope about Bessette Kennedy, even as the news trickling out
of Martha's Vineyard remained relentlessly pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hopes and prayers are that they still will all be found
alive, and my thoughts are with Carolyn's family and the whole
Kennedy family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 feature on up-and-coming New Yorkers, W magazine
described Bessette, then 25, with her ``mannequin proportions and
sultry blue-eyed beauty,'' as ``merely a physically blessed real
person. Sort of.'' Just recently promoted to the Collection
position at the time, she revealed how she decided against pursuing
a career in teaching despite majoring in elementary education in
college: ``At the time, I felt a little underdeveloped myself to be
completely responsible for 25 other people's children,'' she
explained. ``And to a large extent, I felt it wouldn't be
provocative enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Carolyn met not long after her arrival in New York,
though accounts differ as to the circumstances. One has them
meeting by chance during a Central Park jog. In others, Kelly Klein
plays matchmaker, introducing them either at a party or during a
showroom visit at Calvin Klein by the young Kennedy scion.
</P>
<P>
   The match wasn't immediate, however. Kennedy was dating Daryl
Hannah, and Carolyn was seeing Calvin Klein model Michael Bergin.
Besides, Bessette was a veteran party girl, while Kennedy, known to
ride to black-tie events on his bicycle, was more of an athletic
outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1994 the couple was an item. And while wildcat videos of
arguments between John and Carolyn replay continually on taboid TV
shows, the pair often seemed the very image of a loving couple when
together. He could appear protective of her in public settings, and
when they were seated at separate tables at a large benefit dinner,
he would frequently check that all was well.
</P>
<P>
   They could even be a little sappy. ``How're you doing,
honey-bunny?'' John asked her at a star-studded party at New York's
Asia de Cuba restaurant to celebrate the second anniversary of

   Beaches and marinas within a 15-mile radius of Cumberland
Island, Ga., were watched, and all boats (or hikers) bound for the
island were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the couple honeymooned in Turkey and Greece, the rumor
mill kicked into high gear. The big question on the minds of the
publishing world was who would get her for their cover. The answer:
no one. Nor would she choose to add her name to a vanity list of
contributing editors or even grant interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Next, of course, came talk that she was pregnant, a rumor she
handled with typical skill and aplomb. At the 1997 premiere of
``Air Force One'' in Washington, Tommy Hilfiger and John were
passing around snacks. She declined an offer of Goobers, she told
Hilfiger, because if she indulged, the press would think she's
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you pregnant?'' Hilfiger asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Bessette Kennedy slipped away from the
crowd at another party to a secluded table and ordered a drink from
the waiter. When she took a cigarette from a guest at the party,
she glanced up with a wry smile and said, ``I guess you know this
means I'm not pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her marriage, Bessette Kennedy had tried to avoid the
incessant media attention _ and not always successfully. Yet she
managed to find humor in the strangest of situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into my grandmother's house one day and she was on
the phone talking to someone called Bambi,'' she once said in an
interview with WWD. ``I couldn't figure out who this Bambi was. `Oh
Bambi, I don't think that's true,' she was saying, and `Sure,
anytime you want, Bambi.' Finally she got off the phone and I said,
`Who's Bambi?' And she said, `Oh, Bambi's my friend from ``Hard
Copy.''' And, of course, she had no idea what `Hard Copy' was.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the same grandmother who was a trifle disappointed at
Carolyn and John's living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks after we moved into the loft, she came to visit,''
Carolyn remembered. ``She was unimpressed. `So you married this
famous man and you're in every newspaper and this is where you
live?''' she quoted her grandmother as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Carolyn prided herself on not being an uptown girl.
When she first came to New York, she moved to the East Village,
long before it was the yuppie haven it has now become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to step over drunks and crack dealers to get to my
apartment,'' she remembered. ``Everybody at Calvin thought I was
crazy, but I couldn't imagine coming to New York and living
anywhere else. Even with all the weirdness, I felt comfortable and
I had fun.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion appears to have lost its newest and brightest
fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette Kennedy has been a designer's dream: a striking
woman of easy, unstudied style who, along with her husband,
commanded a room the minute she walked in.
</P>
<P>
   A true clotheshorse, she was sighted regularly at Prada and
Barneys and gained recognition as diverse as a ``VH-1 Fashion
Awards'' nomination and an appearance on the ever-stodgy Best
Dressed list.
</P>
<P>
   ``She chooses simple, severe looks that not everyone would
wear,'' said Gucci's Tom Ford, reached over the weekend at his
apartment in Paris. ``She knows how to set off her beauty with
clothes. That's a rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, like all the designers contacted Sunday, was insistent on
not talking about Bessette Kennedy in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the look of the '90s,'' said Karl Lagerfeld from the
Chanel atelier. ``She is not a label girl. Everything that she wore
looked fabulous on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Oscar de la Renta, who designed the dress Ethel Kennedy
was to wear for her daughter Rory's wedding: ``She is the
incarnation of modern style.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Bessette Kennedy, with her piercing blue eyes and
silken blond mane, possessed an arresting beauty that many
characterized as uniquely American _ and uniquely contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette first appeared on fashion's radar screen when
she worked at a Boston-area Calvin Klein boutique after graduating
from Boston University. It wasn't long before sharp-eyed executives
transferred her to the New York headquarters to be closer to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There, her influence was disproportionate to her experience. She
was not only moving quickly in the office _ she had Calvin's ear
and his wife Kelly's friendship _ but out on the town as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has real street smarts,'' one observer remarked. ``She
knew what was going to be a trend long before anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Charming, intelligent and funny, Bessette could also be
mercurial and tough. Most importantly, she seemed indifferent to
celebrity _ making her ideal for her first assignment: assisting
VIPs in the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be one of the things that attracted (Kennedy) to
her _ she had such repartee and such wit,'' said New York publicist
Paul Wilmot, who also worked at Calvin Klein back then. ``She had
just enough sense of sarcasm. All these things that seemed so
serious in the fashion world _ she would cut right through them.
From day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein, reached late Sunday afternoon, continued to
express hope about Bessette Kennedy, even as the news trickling out
of Martha's Vineyard remained relentlessly pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hopes and prayers are that they still will all be found
alive, and my thoughts are with Carolyn's family and the whole
Kennedy family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 feature on up-and-coming New Yorkers, W magazine
described Bessette, then 25, with her ``mannequin proportions and
sultry blue-eyed beauty,'' as ``merely a physically blessed real
person. Sort of.'' Just recently promoted to the Collection
position at the time, she revealed how she decided against pursuing
a career in teaching despite majoring in elementary education in
college: ``At the time, I felt a little underdeveloped myself to be
completely responsible for 25 other people's children,'' she
explained. ``And to a large extent, I felt it wouldn't be
provocative enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Carolyn met not long after her arrival in New York,
though accounts differ as to the circumstances. One has them
meeting by chance during a Central Park jog. In others, Kelly Klein
plays matchmaker, introducing them either at a party or during a
showroom visit at Calvin Klein by the young Kennedy scion.
</P>
<P>
   The match wasn't immediate, however. Kennedy was dating Daryl
Hannah, and Carolyn was seeing Calvin Klein model Michael Bergin.
Besides, Bessette was a veteran party girl, while Kennedy, known to
ride to black-tie events on his bicycle, was more of an athletic
outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1994 the couple was an item. And while wildcat videos of
arguments between John and Carolyn replay continually on taboid TV
shows, the pair often seemed the very image of a loving couple when
together. He could appear protective of her in public settings, and
when they were seated at separate tables at a large benefit dinner,
he would frequently check that all was well.
</P>
<P>
   They could even be a little sappy. ``How're you doing,
honey-bunny?'' John asked her at a star-studded party at New York's
Asia de Cuba restaurant to celebrate the second anniversary of
George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a long, black Yohji dress and ebony polished calf
Manolos, Bessette Kennedy stood with her husband at the party's
entrance for nearly two hours meeting and greeting guests ranging
from Lee Radziwill to Anne Heche to Ian Schrager. She had a word
for everyone _ even '70s rocker Ted Nugent who walked in wearing a
Ducks Unlimited cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be too hard on those ducks,'' she teased.
</P>
<P>
   While their public appearances together were rare _ any party
they went to automatically assumed the proportions of a major event
_ they were not entirely reclusive. They occasionally could be
spotted among the chic crowd at such eateries at TriBeCa's trendy
Independent, Greenwich Village's Il Cantinori or at the cozy NoLIta
bistro La Cigale.
</P>
<P>
   And when out of the public eye, they definitely knew how to do
casual. The week after Easter this spring, the couple stayed near
Vero Beach, Fla., at a house borrowed from financier Pete Peterson
while John took additional flying lessons at nearby Flight Safety,
where he had earned his pilot's license and was training for an
instrument-rating license.
</P>
<P>
   During the long weekend, the couple would head out to the local
cafe in shorts and sports sandals for an al fresco Breakfast. Her
famous blond hair was hidden beneath a bandanna, but otherwise they
blended in _ as much as America's most famous couple could be
inconspicuous. Bodyguards and large retinues were not their style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were teachers of how to live with grace and style
and with being celebrities,'' Donna Karan said.
</P>
<P>
   That, particularly, did not come easily for Carolyn. Although
she handled her role as Kennedy wife extremely well, Bessette
Kennedy was clearly ambivalent about the hysteria that greeted her
engagement and then marriage to America's favorite bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Bessette's wedding to Kennedy in 1996 was perhaps her first
major brush with the care she'd have to use to protect her private
life. A 50-member security team, hired at a cost of $250,000, began
coordinating with state troopers, the police and the National Park
Service five days in advance to provide safety and secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches and marinas within a 15-mile radius of Cumberland
Island, Ga., were watched, and all boats (or hikers) bound for the
island were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the couple honeymooned in Turkey and Greece, the rumor
mill kicked into high gear. The big question on the minds of the
publishing world was who would get her for their cover. The answer:
no one. Nor would she choose to add her name to a vanity list of
contributing editors or even grant interviews.

</P>

 &HT;    Behind bars, mother-child reunions
 &HT;    (EDS: TAKE 1 OF 2 TAKES. ATTN: TEXAS EDITORS. ART AVAILABLE.)
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A wall phone rings shrilly, and seven women in
blue state jail uniforms spread out along vast windows. Their noses
nearly touch the panes of ceiling-to-rail glass, their eyes riveted
on an electronically locked door in the next building.
</P>
<P>
   A staccato buzz fills the room, and the women lean in. The heavy
door clicks open, and their daughters walk out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I didn't know she was coming. Look at her,'' says one
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my baby,'' says another.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's pretty,'' comments a third.
</P>
<P>
   The second door swings open, and mothers and nine daughters rush
to be together. They share tight hugs, soft kisses and rapid-fire
talk: Hi Mama. Hey baby. Look at that hair! Let me see those nails.
What are you wearing? What's for dinner? Mom, did I tell you that
... Mothers slowly stroke their daughters' hair and faces.
Daughters rub their mothers' arms and shoulders; they smile as they
talk, and their mothers smile back.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday meeting of Girl Scout Troop 1500 has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Missed moments
</P>
<P>
   Marisa was 31 when she was arrested the last time. She'd been
tangling with the law for years; this time she pulled a 15-month
sentence for drug-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   She lives in a dormitory jail cell, her days regimented by
life-skills classes, jail chores, strict meal times and counseling
sessions. Beyond the bars and living with family are her children:
Clarisa, 8, and a married teen-age daughter. (The last names of the
mothers and daughters are not used to protect the children's
identities.)
</P>
<P>
   Marisa has missed chunks of her daughters' lives. She wasn't at
the hospital when her older daughter gave birth. She was left out
of the summertime ritual of walking her daughters to the
neighborhood swimming pool. And she had to witness her baby girl
grow into a confident third-grader from the confines of the Travis
County Community Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me she's still a little girl, but she's growing up,'' says
Marisa, with a sad but proud smile.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Mom is behind bars until August, Marisa and
Clarisa are together every other week because of an innovative Girl
Scout program that is new to Central Texas. The troop is aimed at
building a bond between girls and their mothers in jail.
Nationally, there are about 18 troops like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Jail officials recommend inmates for the program, and once the
mothers agree to participate, the Lone Star Girl Scout Council
approaches school-age daughters' guardians. If the guardians, and
the daughters, agree _ and some don't _ parent and child join the
troop. The first mother-daughter meeting was in October. Since
then, 11 mothers and their 13 daughters have participated in the
biweekly meetings at the state jail.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings of Troop 1500 have brought Clarisa back into her
mother's arms. ``There are things the Girl Scouts is really
bringing out that I never knew,'' says Marisa.
</P>
<P>
   The mother says she gets the most surprising things in the mail
from Clarisa. She sends her homework, complete with the teacher's
grades and comments; short letters and drawings with just mother
and daughter in the scene. But it is the first letter that still
makes her mother cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this white piece of paper; it was folded. I opened it
and saw the cursive writing. Clarisa loves to write in cursive. It
was a letter, only a few lines. It was signed, 'I loved you with
all my brain' Clarisa.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clarisa's schoolteacher, Virginia Lewis, says she has seen a
marked difference since her student joined the troop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her self-confidence is up, she's relaxed and is able to
concentrate,'' said Lewis. ``She's not nearly as anxious or as
needy for attention and approval as she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mom is the most important influence in her life. She has a
hunger for her mother's love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm finally being a mother,'' said Marisa. She
says she has learned how to handle Clarisa's extreme moods,
especially her temper tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to beg her to behave, but I've learned that she'll come
around sooner if I ease off, let her be. She sees it's not getting
her any attention, she stops. I had to learn that in here. I didn't
know about patience; I didn't have much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, mother and daughter set patience goals together. The
latest: growing fingernails. Clarisa is a heavy nail biter, but she
wants nails, and her mother decided to lead by example.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I let my nails grow, she would do the same,'' says Marisa.
``And she's doing it. I tell her how pretty her nails are now, and
she says mine look good, too; she always looks at them. I have to
tell you that letting my nails grow has been very hard. But I'm
determined to do it; it's a goal. If I can do something so small,
then I can go after something a little bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   At each meeting's beginning, Clarisa is always the first girl
through the door with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   At meeting's end, she is the most visibly upset, tears streaking
down her round face.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding bonds
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, an estimated 1.5 million children have a jailed
parent, and more than 200,000 children have imprisoned mothers,
according to the Child Welfare League of America. Nearly 11,000
women were incarcerated in Texas prisons in April, including the
Girl Scout mothers at the privately operated state jail.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal justice experts say parent-child contact is essential
to preserving emotional bonds while a parent is serving time. The
relationship will, hopefully, help the imprisoned parent to change
and the child to cope.
</P>
<P>
   But maintaining the relationship often requires structured
programs, such as Beyond Bars, which gets the mothers and daughters
out of the crowded, assigned-seat environment of routine weekend
jail visits. Without the programs, there is mounting evidence that
jailed parents' children will continue the cycle: Criminal justice
experts told The New York Times earlier this year that the largest
factor in the creation of juvenile delinquents and adult criminals
was having a parent behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Etta Moore, the Lone Star Girl Scout Council's executive
director, says the troop is part of the council's commitment to
bring scouting to underserved girls, particularly in poor and
isolated communities in rural and urban areas. The council has
nearly 13,000 Scouts, with more than 1,100 of them in customized
programs _ like Troop 1500 _ at community centers, public housing
projects, a homeless shelter, public schools and a home for unwed
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Troop 1500 mothers say the program is helping them. The women's
minimum-security residence is designed to be rehabilitative, and
improving their relationships with their girls is part of the
course. Two of the mothers _ Marisa and Felicia D. _ have been in
Beyond Bars since its start last year. Felicia W. joined in March.
Since they've been in Girl Scouts, though, the mothers say their
daughters are opening up _ sometimes slowly, but it's happening.
They hear their sadness about not having their mothers with them.
'We have gotten closer'
</P>
<P>
   Felicia D. only has a few weeks left. She's nearly finished with
her eight-month sentence for a theft-related offense. This will be
the last time that she will meet with daughter Crystal, 17, behind
bars. The pair hold hands in the troop dinner line for Papa John's
Pizza and red Hawaiian Punch. Crystal _ like most of the girls _ is
reluctant to talk to a stranger about herself or her mother, but
Felicia D., with a quiet reserve, explains their reasons for
joining the troop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to bond more with my daughter,'' she says. ``Since
we've been doing this, we have gotten closer to each other. She's a
bit more open (during their conversations) than she had been when
she just came to (weekend) visitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she reports her daughter has offered a gift: ``She said
'When you get out, I'll pay for you to get your hair and nails
done.''' And Felicia D., who usually looks guarded, smiles and
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   At meetings, there is movement and a sense of freedom, and the
mothers say their daughters are at ease and more willing to share
what's on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to stuff all my feelings inside and then just explode,
lashing out my anger on anyone who was near, often the wrong
person,'' says Felicia W., who joined the troop with daughters
Dwanna, 12, and Shamica, 15. Then she noticed the same behavior in
her girls, particularly Dwanna, who wouldn't talk and would turn
her body away from the group during family visits.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Troop 1500, and Dwanna started talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the middle child. She said she felt like my son and
Shamica got more attention from me than she did, that she would
always have to compete with them for my time. I was shocked and
surprised to hear this. I always thought I gave her more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I understand why an A student would be acting out in
school, picking fights and getting into trouble; she was looking
for my attention and this is how she thought she could get it,''
says Felicia W. ``I used to buy the gifts and things, and all she
wanted was my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Felicia W. was arrested on her birthday. She's been serving time
for nearly a year on a drug-related offense, and she says her most
prized times are when her girls arrive for troop meetings. And the
most beloved part of the meeting is mealtime. It was during one of
these meals that Dwanna asked her mother what it was like to kiss a
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her she didn't have to kiss any boys if she didn't want
to,'' recalls Felicia W. as her eyebrows furrowed in seriousness.
``She said she hadn't, but she wanted to know what it was like.
Then she told me she had a friend who was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward I figured out this is what she really wanted to talk
about. I know she would never have brought it up with her
grandmother sitting here during a weekend visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwanna asked whether her mother would ask her to leave if she
got pregnant and whether her mother would still love her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her friend's family was threatening to kick her out of the
house, and Dwanna wanted to know if I would do the same thing. I
told her no, I wouldn't do that. I would love her just as much as I
do now, but I would be upset, even angry, but I would do everything
in my power to help her. But none of this meant she had permission
to go out and get pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   As the last paper plate and Styrofoam cup are tossed in the big
trash bin, a guard does an early-evening head count. Then, troop
activities begin. This night mothers and daughters learn dance
moves and Girl Scout songs, such as ``Alice the Camel,'' from the
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the two-hour meeting, Felicia D. gets a surprise
gift from the troop. It's a going-away bag filled with personal
items, such as shampoo, a laundry basket and a toothbrush. And, of
course, two boxes of Girl Scout cookies: Peanut Butter Patties and
Thin Mints.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I've never had anybody be this sweet to me,'' said
Felicia D., tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   END TAKE ONE.

   BEYOND BARS: Take 2 of 2
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: TAKE 2 OF 2 TAKES. ATTN: TEXAS EDITORS. ART AVAILABLE.)
</P>
<P>
   Girls need their mothers
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids love their moms,'' said Karon Powell, the troop's
leader and full-time outreach program specialist. ``They are very
forgiving. They don't care what they've done. They just want to be
with their mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell explains that Crystal, an emancipated minor, is so
dedicated to visiting her mother that she rearranged her work hours
to make the troop meetings every Tuesday. (Troop rules require the
girls to attend meetings on the weeks they don't see their mothers
in order to make the biweekly jail visits.)
</P>
<P>
   The Beyond Bars group does everything any Girl Scouts troop
would do. The girls go camping, attend ballets, create craft
projects, learn health and safety procedures and problem-solving
and conflict resolution skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping scouting alive, but it's not like what you're
used to,'' said Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Each troop meeting brings moments of suspense. The mothers never
know whether their daughters will show up until the group walks
into the jail's outdoor walkway. That's why they watch for their
children from the large windows. One Tuesday, Felicia W. sees
neither of her daughters. She knows Shamica is at basketball
practice, a sport that Felicia W. also played in high school. But
where is Dwanna?
</P>
<P>
   As the other mothers embrace their daughters, a Girl Scout
staffer tells Felicia W. that Dwanna missed the troop van because
of a late dental appointment.
</P>
<P>
   As the group finishes dinner, Felicia W. is clearly anxious
about her daughter making the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   She is constantly looking toward the windows, the telephone and
the heavy door.
</P>
<P>
   Then the phone rings; Felicia W.'s face opens into a wide smile.
Dwanna, with a puffy jaw and barely able to speak, walks through
the green door and straight into her mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was determined to get to that meeting,'' said Maxine,
Dwanna's guardian and Felicia W.'s mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so upset that she missed the van and thought she
couldn't go. I told her I would take her, but she was mighty upset
about being late.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, girls need their mothers,'' Maxine said. ``They
really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Promise and problems
</P>
<P>
   Do programs like Beyond Bars really work? Not many studies have
concentrated on children with incarcerated parents. Because the
Central Texas Beyond Bars is so new _ not yet a year old _ it's
still too early to predict long-term success. But so far, there are
promising outcomes as well as problems getting mothers to change.
Felicia W.'s mother, Maxine, wants Felicia to be prepared for her
release: ``I hope this program makes her understand how important
she is to her girls. How much they need her. How much she needs to
be a mother, be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But in late June, Felicia W. was removed from the program for
breaking jail rules, including smuggling fried chicken from the
Girl Scout dinner into the inmate dormitory. Jail officials say she
sold the chicken; Felicia W. says she ate her chicken breast, and
she wasn't the only mother who took troop food back to the
dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   Another jail violation involved a gift from her daughter,
Dwanna. ``She gave me two hair barrettes for Mother's Day. Two
plastic butterflies. When I got the barrettes, I knew I shouldn't
have taken them. But I wanted them so bad because they were from
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The barrettes are considered contraband inside the jail. Felicia
W. says jail guards took the hair jewelry from her the day after
she got them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want Dwanna to blame herself for this. It's not her
fault. It was on me to say 'thank you, but hold them until I get
out.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told I wasn't being a good role model,'' said Felicia
W., still angry days after her removal from the troop. ``I
disagree.'' Her daughters will continue with the troop on non-jail
weeks until they are reassigned to another troop.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia W. is scheduled for release in early August.
</P>
<P>
   Other mothers are finding more success. After getting out of
jail in March, Felicia D. went to work for a hotel. Her daughter,
Crystal, was expected to continue with the troop, but she dropped
out when her mother left.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months later, the teen-ager called Powell and said
she wanted to rejoin the troop. ``We must be doing something right
if we have a 17-year-old calling us,'' says Powell.
</P>
<P>
   In a short conversation one evening recently, Felicia D.,
fighting a cold, said she and her daughter were doing well. As
promised, Crystal paid for her first post-release salon visit.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia D. said she is still working. Her daughter has a new job
and is sharing an apartment with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter see each other regularly, and Felicia D.
credits the Girl Scouts program with some of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't talked to her about it, but I think it drew us
closer. I really do.''

 &HT;    Teachers and students can keep humor _ and respect
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In an heroic effort to bring respect back
into the classroom, the governor of Louisiana, recently signed
legislation making it mandatory for students in his state to
address teachers as ``Ma'am'' or ``Sir'' or by their title _ Mr.,
Mrs., Miss, or Ms. The law goes into effect this year for
kindergarten through fifth grade and will then sort of trickle up
with the kids, one grade at a time, until the entire system is
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The mandate does not carry a punishment with it since it'd be
tough to sentence a 1st-grader to 30 days without recess for an
infraction.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: ``Freddy, can you tell the class the name of Dick and
Jane's dog? The one that followed them to school one day?''
(Naturally, Freddy can't because while the rest of the class was
reading about boys and girls at school, he was surgically removing
the ears from his Mickey Mouse pencil holder.)
</P>
<P>
   Freddy: (guessing) ``Puddles.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: ``Puddles, what?'' She's looking for a ``ma'am'' but
Freddy doesn't catch on so she helps him out. ``Puddles, ma'am.''
Freddy thinks that's an odd last name for a dog.
</P>
<P>
   If kids in the Louisiana schools haven't been taught the polite
(and very Southern) forms of address at home, then this is not
going to be an easy transition. The administration is going to have
to figure out a way to make good manners ``cool'' because everyone
knows, if it ain't cool, kids ain't gonna' do it.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget about the regulation number of parents who will
flop off the top of the imbecile scale and call in the ACLU because
their kids are being deprived of their civil right to incivility.
``My kid's no servant! He's not inferior to anyone,'' they'll bray.
Blah, blah, and more blah. Eventually they'll get over it, later in
the year when focus shifts to the annual witch hunt in school
libraries for ``dirty'' books or 150-year-old volumes suspected of
</P>
<P>
   preaching intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Most teachers worth their salt already have some standards of
address in place in their classrooms. Those who answer to a
``Hey!'' or tolerate a ``Yeh,'' in place of a ``Yes, Ms.
Boopydoop,'' are only doing half a job anyway, because manners are
a part of education. If teachers respect themselves and their
profession, they'll command respect from their students. And humor
helps.
</P>
<P>
   In my classroom, we always had a little fun with initial
breaches of courteous address, and that way no one was really
embarrassed (unless he or she insisted) and my point would be made
early on in the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher (that's me): ``Roger, did you make a noose of the window
shade cord and hang Shana's teddy bear?''
</P>
<P>
   Roger: ``Yeh.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   Roger: ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: ``Roger, you may address me as `Yes, ma'am,' `Yes, Ms.
Schuett,' `Yes, Your Royal Intelligence,' or even `Yes, I did hang
the stupid teddy bear,' but `Yeh' is unacceptable. Get it?'' Roger
looks at his Nikes for a moment, like he's trying to make a choice
that won't diminish his monosyllabic masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   Roger: ``OK.'' I give him the evil eye. He grins and adds,
``Yes, Your Royal Intelligence; I hung the dumb bear.''
</P>
<P>
   I thank him and the episode ends with both of us maintaining our
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Roger has learned a valuable lesson, not so much about me or
hanging teddy bears, but about life. No matter how old he is, where
he goes, or what he does, there will always be someone worthy of
his respect. Polite speech is painless, costs nothing, and reaps
major rewards. There is no heart so stony that it can't be melted
with good manners.
</P>
<P>
   So for all of the Rogers out there, when the teacher asks, ``Are
you sure the dog ate your homework?'' you reply (truthfully of
course) ``Yes, ma'am, he sure did and he's got the bellyache even
worse than last week when he ate my book report.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, it'll work every time.

 &HT;    Large and small investors need asset allocation
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Asset allocation is a core concept for investors, from
the richest ones down to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   It is a method for tuning up your portfolio, in hopes of getting
greater returns, without wandering into a pointlessly risky set of
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The process is simple.
</P>
<P>
   First you decide what percentages of your investments should go
into stocks, bonds and cash. Then you buy the appropriate mutual
funds or individual securities _ putting your money where your good
intentions are.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it so important?
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a difference in how well you eat for the rest of your
life,'' says certified financial planner Harold Evensky. He is
chair of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Governors and is
considered one of the nation's savviest planners.
</P>
<P>
   Evensky has developed a checklist to provide guidance for
beginners. To get it right, he tells clients to avoid these big
mistakes:
</P>
<P>
   1. Assuming your asset allocation is determined by your age.
</P>
<P>
   The long-standing rule of thumb is this: Subtract your age from
100, and the remainder is the percentage you should risk on the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of solution a sociologist would come up
with,'' Evensky said from his office in Coral Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he recommends investing 50 percent to 75 percent in
stocks (and possibly more), keeping 2 percent to 4 percent in cash,
and putting whatever is left into bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The wide range in stocks is where individuals can adjust to
their own circumstances. A 50-year-old with a big portfolio, for
example, can be more conservative than a 50-year-old with few
assets.
</P>
<P>
   2. Not realizing your money needs to be properly allocated
within each category.
</P>
<P>
   ``For asset allocation to work, you must be diversified in each
category, so that your portfolio isn't a sitting duck when the
financial markets become choppy,'' Evensky advises.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning investors will have to keep it simple, he concedes.
``If you have a few thousand dollars, you would probably stay with
the Vanguard Index 500 fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the portfolio grows, the investor should refine his or
her allocations. On the stock side, for example, he recommends
putting 70 percent in U.S. stock mutual funds and the rest in
international stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   When there's even more money, the investor can subdivide the
domestic stock portfolio _ 75 percent to large-capitalization
companies and 25 percent to small-caps.
</P>
<P>
   3. Not regularly reviewing your fund manager's strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't allocate assets properly if you think your fund is
investing your money one way, while in reality the manager is doing
something else,'' says Evensky.
</P>
<P>
   His solution: Ask the fund company every six months how the
assets are allocated. Another alternative is to look for the data
in Morningstar's reports, either at a library or on the Internet at
www.morningstar.net. (At Ticker Lookup, type in the symbol of your
fund. Click on Portfolio, then click on Asset Allocation.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Believing that bonds are conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonds carry a different kind of risk than stocks _ enormous
inflation risk,'' Evensky said. ``Those who have 50 percent of
their money in bonds probably are facing the risk that their
investment won't outpace inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Letting your allocation ride.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to stay on track, you will have to rebalance your
portfolio from time to time. In the current stock market, for
example, what started as 50 percent in stocks may have become 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Evensky recommends a rebalancing whenever your stock, bond or
cash positions rise or fall by more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One last warning: Sometimes it's hard to stick with the program.
I think of asset allocation not just as a technique but as a
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking with it could mean, especially right now, that you must
sell off some stocks while the market is rising. If you value the
system, you need to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asset allocation is not a free lunch,'' Evensky observed.
``You give up the risk of getting killed. But you also have to give
up the opportunity to make a killing.''

 &HT;    '99 Isuzu sport-ute a standout
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Inside and outside, the '99 Isuzu VehiCross is an
eye-catcher that illustrates the diversity and exclusivity that
have come to the sport-utility market.
</P>
<P>
   Although based on the ruggedly luxurious Trooper platform, the
VehiCross is a radical departure for Isuzu and the closest the
Japanese manufacturer has come to marketing a vehicle (it even won
a car of the year award in Japan in '97). Base priced at $28,900,
the VehiCross comes _ quite properly, because of its cost _ with an
array of standard features that virtually eliminate the need to add
options. Air conditioning, leather seating, CD/cassette players,
power equipment and keyless entry are included.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to notice, however, that two of the
striking features of the VehiCross have downsides. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The coupe-style body that has unusually shaped windows front
and rear. Visibility suffers, with the driver having little
rear-quarter view and rear passengers also facing limited views of
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   _ California-stylish red-and-black Recaro seats that are nicely
comfortable, supportable and adjustable. They also take up so much
of the potential entry and exit space that newcomers frequently
bump their heads on the roof getting in, and just about anyone has
to go through some contortion to enter and exit.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing the VehiCross doesn't lack is power. The only
engine choice is the 3.5-liter V-6 found in the Trooper. It needs
to run to 5,400 rpm to make its peak power of 215 horsepower, but
whomps out 230 pounds-feet of torque at a relatively quiet 3,000
rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that engine with a smooth four-speed automatic
transmission and a ``torque on demand'' system that automatically
determines which of its four wheels get how much power, and the
VehiCross becomes another vehicle that's near-foolproof in adverse
conditions.

 &HT;    '99 Isuzu sport-ute a standout
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Inside and outside, the '99 Isuzu VehiCross is an
eye-catcher that illustrates the diversity and exclusivity that
have come to the sport-utility market.
</P>
<P>
   Although based on the ruggedly luxurious Trooper platform, the
VehiCross is a radical departure for Isuzu and the closest the
Japanese manufacturer has come to marketing a vehicle (it even won
a car of the year award in Japan in '97). Base priced at $28,900,
the VehiCross comes _ quite properly, because of its cost _ with an
array of standard features that virtually eliminate the need to add
options. Air conditioning, leather seating, CD/cassette players,
power equipment and keyless entry are included.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to notice, however, that two of the
striking features of the VehiCross have downsides. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The coupe-style body that has unusually shaped windows front
and rear. Visibility suffers, with the driver having little
rear-quarter view and rear passengers also facing limited views of
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   _ California-stylish red-and-black Recaro seats that are nicely
comfortable, supportable and adjustable. They also take up so much
of the potential entry and exit space that newcomers frequently
bump their heads on the roof getting in, and just about anyone has
to go through some contortion to enter and exit.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing the VehiCross doesn't lack is power. The only
engine choice is the 3.5-liter V-6 found in the Trooper. It needs
to run to 5,400 rpm to make its peak power of 215 horsepower, but
whomps out 230 pounds-feet of torque at a relatively quiet 3,000
rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that engine with a smooth four-speed automatic
transmission and a ``torque on demand'' system that automatically
determines which of its four wheels get how much power, and the
VehiCross becomes another vehicle that's near-foolproof in adverse
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   No one, least of all folks who've spent time in luxury
sport-utes, is going to confuse the VehiCross' ride and handling
characteristics with those of a car, though. The ride is stiff, and
its height (66.9 inches) and short wheelbase (91.8 inches) will
make most drivers cautious about quick or sharp turns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the VehiCross' decidedly different styling, the use of
carbon-fiber-look materials, its glare-fighting black hood and
Recaro seats mean it will stand out in the crowd. Isuzu plans to
import about 200 a month. That, along with the price, will make the

don't mind some trade-offs that compromise comfort and utility.

 &HT;    Emissions repair? Ask questions first
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Repair Watch, a ``report card'' for auto shops
performing emissions repairs in metro Atlanta, was developed to
meet requirements of federal clean air legislation to assist
motorists in identifying effective repair facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Every emission test station is required to have at least one
copy of the Repair Watch document available for public review.
While this report is not a recommendation or endorsement by the
Georgia Environmental Protection Division or its management
contractor, it is ``an information source to help vehicle owners
locate repair facilities conducting emission-related repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   What it means is that locating the right shop to fix your
particular vehicle's problem is going to require a little sleuthing
on your part.
</P>
<P>
   Inspection/Maintenance (or emissions) test stations also have
blue-and-white ``When your vehicle fails'' pamphlets that are full
of great information.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heading ``Where do I go for repairs?'' are some
questions that should be asked at a prospective repair shop. One
is: ``Do they have the necessary diagnostic tools to help identify
the emission-related problem(s) including: a four-gas (for newer
vehicles) or five-gas (for vehicles six years or older) exhaust
analyzer to measure the emissions?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the key!
</P>
<P>
   Every shop on the list has a gas analyzer, but which one? A
four-gas analyzer monitors carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, oxygen
and carbon dioxide. This is sufficient for use in diagnosing and
confirming repair of newer vehicles that fail the TSI (two-speed
idle, or standing still) test because they are the only gases
tested.
</P>
<P>
   However, a five-gas analyzer is needed for any older vehicle
that has been ASM (acceleration simulation mode, or dynamometer
driving) tested because, in addition to the other four gases, it
also monitors NOx (oxides of nitrogen). Even if the vehicle didn't
fail the emissions test for NOx, adjustments and/or repairs made to
correct whatever failure it had can affect NOx production.
</P>
<P>
   If the shop doesn't have a five-gas analyzer to confirm the
final repair, the car could fail the next test for a different
reason. In short, a five-gas analyzer can be used to diagnose and
verify repair of all vehicles, but a four-gas analyzer can only be
used on those failing the TSI test.
</P>
<P>
   Another tool needed is a scan tool to read and analyze error
codes held by the emission control computer.
</P>
<P>
   Scan tools come in many flavors and are essential to diagnostic
work. Almost all of them, equipped with the right adapters and
software, work with older vehicles, although the amount of
information that can be accessed from the computers varies greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Newer cars require more-sophisticated scan tools with features
especially for 1996 and newer OBD II (onboard diagnostics)
vehicles. The question you need to ask: Will the shop's scan tool
communicate with your car's computer?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ask the shop if it has an engine analyzer to monitor
the vehicle's ignition and overall engine performance.
</P>
<P>
   These also vary from large console units to small hand-held
ones. Bigger does not necessarily mean better.
</P>
<P>
   If you're shop shopping, ask the questions listed inside the
pamphlet. Be sure to tell them your vehicle's make, year, model and
what test it failed. The shop should be able to determine if it can
meet your needs.

 &HT;    New laser procedure gives heart patients relief
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Along with the dull, aching pain in his chest,
Robert Seaver would break out in a sweat and have trouble
breathing. Whatever he was doing, he had to stop, sit down, take
his nitroglycerine pill and wait for the angina attack to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' he says. ``You don't get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes just walking from the bedroom to the living room would
trigger it. ``I couldn't lift much of anything,'' he says. He
couldn't walk around the block. ``No way. Not even to the corner
and back.'' If he went shopping anywhere, he had to pick a small
store where he wouldn't have to walk much.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors were out of options for him. At 60, Seaver already
had been through three open-heart bypass operations, another
surgery to put in an artificial heart valve, catheterization to
clean out his arteries and all the medications that help relieve
angina. His cardiac arteries were too scarred for creating another
bypass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of patient we were just telling, `I'm sorry you
have pain, but there's nothing else I can do for you,' '' says Dr.
Mohey Saleh.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is something else. Saleh is one of two local heart
surgeons performing a laser procedure that drills small holes
through the heart wall. That minimal damage coaxes the body into
building new blood vessels to the heart, and the additional blood
eases the shortage of oxygen to the heart that causes angina.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver was the first Dayton area patient for transmyocardial
revascularization, or TMR. Four months later, after the time it
takes to grow the new blood vessels, he now says, ``I'm still
alive.'' More than that, he's mowing his lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I've got a riding mower,'' he says, but even
climbing onto the mower would have been unlikely several months
ago. He's not taking nitroglycerin anymore. The TMR hasn't cured
him, but he didn't expect that. ``It's definitely made a
difference,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Good Samaritan in Dayton is one of 30 hospitals in the country
doing TMR surgery, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration last August. About 80,000 Americans a year are
diagnosed with severe coronary artery disease, untreatable with
bypass surgery or angioplasty and often leading to heart attacks.
With TMR, says Saleh's partner, Dr. K.H. Lim, ``Now we can
significantly improve the quality of life for literally thousands
of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't replace the conventional treatments, Saleh emphasizes.
When patients have cardiac arteries blocked, surgeons will still
try first to open the blockages with balloon angioplasties or
stents, or reroute the blood around the blockages in open-heart
surgery. But as Seaver illustrates, there's a limit to how often
that can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``In laymen's terms, the arteries are chewed up all the way from
beginning to end and there's no place to hook up a bypass,'' Saleh
says.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes medications can control the angina. Nitroglycerine and
other drugs dilate the remaining small arteries to increase blood
supply. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers slow down the
heart muscles to decrease the demand for blood and its oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   So TMR is a treatment of last resort. It doesn't require
stopping the heart, and it's done through a 4-inch incision that
doesn't require breaking bones, but it carries the danger of
potentially fatal heart-rhythm irregularities if the computerized
laser bursts aren't properly synchronized with the heart's moments
between beats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complication rate is very high if you do it on patients
who are not stable,'' Saleh says. Clinical trials back him up with
a death rate of 20 percent in unstable patients, compared with only
3 percent otherwise. So Saleh won't do TMR on patients still
recovering from heart attacks, for example.
</P>
<P>
   It generally works well on stable patients. The trials show 70
percent have had significant reductions in their angina, with an 80
percent decrease in hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon typically bores 30 to 40 tiny holes through the
muscular heart wall with a carbon-dioxide laser, although Seaver
had only 28. The drilling is timed to when the heart is full of
blood, so the blood protects other tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of creating channels in the heart wall to increase
circulation came from observing reptiles, whose hearts are
nourished that way instead of through arteries outside the heart,
as in humans.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, Saleh says, the laser-drilled channels
themselves don't deliver more blood to the heart. The body
considers them slight wounds to the heart and responds by creating
new blood vessels as part of the healing process. ``It's the new
vessels that increase the blood flow,'' Saleh says.
</P>
<P>
   An even less invasive TMR procedure is in the experimental
stages. Instead of going through a hole in the patient's chest, the
laser is guided through a catheter the size of a cocktail straw
that is threaded through an artery from the groin. Even newer
research is using gene therapy to stimulate blood-vessel growth
without any type of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the challenge is making TMR available to
everyone who needs it. These are patients who had exhausted their
medical options, remember, so cardiologists aren't in the habit of
sending them to surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say how many we'll do, because we never saw these
patients before,'' Saleh says. Starting with Seaver's TMR surgery
four months ago, Saleh and Lim have done five. ``But I expect it to
be more as people find out about it,'' Saleh says. ``You know. If
you build it, they will come.''

that can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``In laymen's terms, the arteries are chewed up all the way from
beginning to end and there's no place to hook up a bypass,'' Saleh
says.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes medications can control the angina. Nitroglycerine and
other drugs dilate the remaining small arteries to increase blood
supply. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers slow down the
heart muscles to decrease the demand for blood and its oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   So TMR is a treatment of last resort. It doesn't require
stopping the heart, and it's done through a 4-inch incision that
doesn't require breaking bones, but it carries the danger of
potentially fatal heart-rhythm irregularities if the computerized
laser bursts aren't properly synchronized with the heart's moments
between beats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complication rate is very high if you do it on patients
who are not stable,'' Saleh says. Clinical trials back him up with
a death rate of 20 percent in unstable patients, compared with only
3 percent otherwise. So Saleh won't do TMR on patients still
recovering from heart attacks, for example.
</P>
<P>
   It generally works well on stable patients. The trials show 70
percent have had significant reductions in their angina, with an 80
percent decrease in hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon typically bores 30 to 40 tiny holes through the
muscular heart wall with a carbon-dioxide laser, although Seaver
had only 28. The drilling is timed to when the heart is full of
blood, so the blood protects other tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of creating channels in the heart wall to increase
circulation came from observing reptiles, whose hearts are
nourished that way instead of through arteries outside the heart,
as in humans.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, Saleh says, the laser-drilled channels
themselves don't deliver more blood to the heart. The body
considers them slight wounds to the heart and responds by creating
new blood vessels as part of the healing process. ``It's the new
vessels that increase the blood flow,'' Saleh says.
</P>
<P>
   An even less invasive TMR procedure is in the experimental
stages. Instead of going through a hole in the patient's chest, the
laser is guided through a catheter the size of a cocktail straw
that is threaded through an artery from the groin. Even newer
research is using gene therapy to stimulate blood-vessel growth
without any type of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the challenge is making TMR available to
everyone who needs it. These are patients who had exhausted their
medical options, remember, so cardiologists aren't in the habit of
sending them to surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say how many we'll do, because we never saw these
patients before,'' Saleh says. Starting with Seaver's TMR surgery
four months ago, Saleh and Lim have done five. ``But I expect it to
be more as people find out about it,'' Saleh says. ``You know. If
you build it, they will come.''

 &HT;    Emissions repair? Ask questions first
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Repair Watch, a ``report card'' for auto shops
performing emissions repairs in metro Atlanta, was developed to
meet requirements of federal clean air legislation to assist
motorists in identifying effective repair facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Every emission test station is required to have at least one
copy of the Repair Watch document available for public review.
While this report is not a recommendation or endorsement by the
Georgia Environmental Protection Division or its management
contractor, it is ``an information source to help vehicle owners
locate repair facilities conducting emission-related repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   What it means is that locating the right shop to fix your
particular vehicle's problem is going to require a little sleuthing
on your part.
</P>
<P>
   Inspection/Maintenance (or emissions) test stations also have
blue-and-white ``When your vehicle fails'' pamphlets that are full
of great information.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heading ``Where do I go for repairs?'' are some
questions that should be asked at a prospective repair shop. One
is: ``Do they have the necessary diagnostic tools to help identify
the emission-related problem(s) including: a four-gas (for newer
vehicles) or five-gas (for vehicles six years or older) exhaust
analyzer to measure the emissions?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the key!
</P>
<P>
   Every shop on the list has a gas analyzer, but which one? A
four-gas analyzer monitors carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, oxygen
and carbon dioxide. This is sufficient for use in diagnosing and
confirming repair of newer vehicles that fail the TSI (two-speed
idle, or standing still) test because they are the only gases
tested.
</P>
<P>
   However, a five-gas analyzer is needed for any older vehicle
that has been ASM (acceleration simulation mode, or dynamometer
driving) tested because, in addition to the other four gases, it
also monitors NOx (oxides of nitrogen). Even if the vehicle didn't
fail the emissions test for NOx, adjustments and/or repairs made to
correct whatever failure it had can affect NOx production.
</P>
<P>
   If the shop doesn't have a five-gas analyzer to confirm the
final repair, the car could fail the next test for a different
reason. In short, a five-gas analyzer can be used to diagnose and
verify repair of all vehicles, but a four-gas analyzer can only be
used on those failing the TSI test.
</P>
<P>
   Another tool needed is a scan tool to read and analyze error
codes held by the emission control computer.
</P>
<P>
   Scan tools come in many flavors and are essential to diagnostic
work. Almost all of them, equipped with the right adapters and
software, work with older vehicles, although the amount of
information that can be accessed from the computers varies greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Newer cars require more-sophisticated scan tools with features
especially for 1996 and newer OBD II (onboard diagnostics)
vehicles. The question you need to ask: Will the shop's scan tool
communicate with your car's computer?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ask the shop if it has an engine analyzer to monitor
the vehicle's ignition and overall engine performance.
</P>
<P>
   These also vary from large console units to small hand-held
ones. Bigger does not necessarily mean better.
</P>
<P>
   If you're shop shopping, ask the questions listed inside the
pamphlet. Be sure to tell them your vehicle's make, year, model and
what test it failed. The shop should be able to determine if it can
meet your needs.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The NAACP is making big noise about the
blanching of network TV entertainment, and not without reason. But
there's more to this tale than a fit of racial absentmindedness on
the part of programmers. It's an energetic commercial tribalizing
of American life, as economic interests dice us into small bits.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ So for all of the Rogers out

attendant, holding up the current Examiner showing John F. Kennedy
Jr. and his wife, Carolyn, in an apparent argument. The magazine
was in the weekend checkout lines as the nation worried and mourned
for JFK Jr., his wife and sister-in-law. ``Unfortunate timing, that
piece,'' said the tabloid CEO. ``Like you and the steamroller,''
the attendant said. The tabloid CEO felt hot. (Young, Waco

LET'S PURCHASE LAND TO CREATE MAINE WOODS NATIONAL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c.1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a movement afoot to create a 3.2-million-acre national
park in Maine that extends from Umsaskis Lake and Priestly Mountain
in the north to Sebec Lake and Monson Pond in the south. The
western-most boundary is Quebec Province, Canada and Green Mountain
to the east. The proposed national park lies about 40 miles north
of Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   The Baxter State Park will be entirely surrounded by the
proposed national park, but it will remain a state-run park. In
1919, former Maine Rep. and later Gov. Percival Baxter attempted to
secure state protection for the Mt. Katahdin area. He was
unsuccessful. So, he purchased the land with his own money and
donated it to the people of the state of Maine as the ``forever
wild'' state park.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists from around the nation see this as a last
chance to save the famed North Woods. Jym St. Pierre, the Maine
director of RESTORE: The North Woods, the regional conservation
group which has proposed creating the national park, wrote
recently, ``Establishing a Maine Woods National Park would
safeguard a national treasure where the haunting yodel of loons
echoes through the warm, blue summer air. It would give us an
opportunity to restore the legendary forests of Maine, the song of
the wolf, the splash of the Atlantic salmon, the magic of caribou
gliding through wild woods like massive, mysterious shadows. It
would be a magnificent people's park for the Twenty-first Century
and a fitting millennial memorial for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre isn't the first person to wax poetic about this area,
Henry David Thoreau, after his visit in 1853, declared that it
should be saved as a national preserve. Thoreau, in his book ``The
Maine Woods,'' a profound study of woods and camping, wrote: ``From
this elevation, just on the skirts of the clouds, we could overlook
the country, west and south, for a hundred miles. There it was, the
State of Maine ... immeasurable forest for the sun to shine on ...
No clearing, no house.

   ``It did not look as if a solitary traveler had cut so much as a
walking stick there. Countless lakes ... and mountains also, whose
names, for the most part, are known only to the Indians. The forest
looks like a firm grass sward, and the effect of these lakes ... is
that of a mirror broken into a thousand fragments, and wildly
scattered over the grass, reflecting the full blaze of the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, there is a great opportunity to purchase some of the
land necessary to create this national park. Approximately 5
percent of Maine is currently up for sale. Two major paper
companies, Sappi Ltd. and Bowater Inc., are offering to sell nearly
three million acres of forest land, which constitutes 17 percent of
the forested area in Maine. A number of state conservation groups
are attempting to arrange a package to buy Sappi land.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wish to preserve these lands as a national park have
to overcome the reluctance of politicians and local residents who
see the timber industry as the backbone of Maine's economy. And
there are those who fear that if this stretch of land becomes a
national park, they won't be able to hunt or fish or use
snowmobiles in the park. They worry that they will lose access to
the land.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists who are attracted to Maine now will increase
tenfold if this national park is created. And nearby towns will
reap greater economic benefit from the park than they have from the
timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   The people of America hunger for more wilderness and greater
tracks of land that preserve nature: the wildlife, the streams and
rivers, the forests and undergrowth, the deep silence and sense of
connection to the earth we need to escape the pressures of work and
the busyness of life.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas wrote, ``Nature must be left undisturbed in ever-widening
circles, so that she can heal the wounds of civilization and
re-create the wonders of God's wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heal the wounds of civilization.'' Yes. How often we seek the
solace of the wilderness. The wonder of a massive, 750-year-old
Sitka spruce on the Oregon coast that has survived numerous
lightning strikes _ yet bares their scars in deep, jagged cuts
through its bark. The quiet that the deep foliage brings, the red
of rotting tree trunks, the green canopy of leaves, the light
shimmering green to complement the red wood slowly turning to soil.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us has never felt the sanctity of the wilderness? Who
has not felt cleansed by walking through a forest hearing the wind
sing through the branches and leaves, the pines and firs? Or
cleansed by lying down beside a river so the purling waters hush
the din of civilization we carry within ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to secure the great North Woods of Maine. The
Maine Woods National Park would rival the Yellowstone National
Park, which so many of us cherish. The nation's economy has created
a windfall of taxes for the federal government. And here is a
worthy investment for this nation's future _ purchase the land
necessary to make the proposed Maine Woods National Park a reality.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better way to spend a small portion of the nation's
tax dollars. The entire purchase will cost less than we taxpayers
pay for a B-2 bomber. And one never has to worry about a wilderness
area becoming obsolete.

   GLOBAL-WARMING (San Francisco) _ Like an omen from the Book of
Revelation, a wispy, silvery-blue noctilucent cloud hovered over
Colorado late last month. The timing couldn't have been more
appropriate. The cloud _ the ``miner's canary'' of climate change,
some call it _ appears as global warming research is becoming a
major scientific industry in fields ranging from atmospheric
physics to biology. By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GUNS (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Gov. Gray Davis declared
California the state with the strongest gun laws in the nation,
after signing two bills that will help restrict the manufacture and
sale of assault weapons. But critics say the measures will only
lead to confusion and litigation when they take effect Jan. 1, as
gun makers, dealers and buyers try to decode the new laws. By PETER
HARTLAUB.

   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)

<P>
   BABOONS-HEALTH (San Francisco) _ Robert Sapolsky of Stanford
University runs a lab where he does important work on the
neurobiology of stress and disease. He been journeying to Africa
just about every summer for over two decades to study baboons. His
work suggests lessons for humans. By SCOTT WINOKUR.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-HBO (Pasadena, Calif.) _ About five or so years ago my wife
and I ditched HBO. There was nothing really to watch, except for
the same movies over and over and over. We must not have been the
only ones. Not much later HBO set out in a ``definitely conscious''
effort to crank out more original series, Chairman and CEO Jeff
Bewkes told a gathering of television critics last week. By MARK
McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   TV-UPN (Pasadena, Calif.) _ At no other time in its history has
the UPN network been more likable. Yes, that's likable _ not
dislikable. Considered the sixth-place network in a six-way race,
UPN always has been picked on by the critics, often deserving its
status as the butt of some ``Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer''
joke or for imploding almost on cue. What's changed since then? by
TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-PROFILE-HORSES (Salinas, Calif.) _ Monty Roberts,
best-selling author and acclaimed horse trainer, is a hero to horse
lovers around the world, but his name is still mud in Salinas, his
hometown. Two years after ``The Man Who Listens to Horses'' took
the literary world by storm and assured Roberts' celebrity, his
relatives still are boiling mad over its claims that his father was
a child abuser, killer, racist and cruel to horses. By ERIC BRAZIL.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The death of John F. Kennedy, Jr.,
seems to pose a perplexing problem for Kennedy-haters. They can't
criticize JFK, Jr. for romancing mobster molls, like his old man.
They can't fault him for an unseemly thirst for booze and broads,
like his Uncle Teddy. They can't accuse him of laziness or
stupidity or greed. So, they're stuck with assailing him for hubris
_ for letting his courage as a fledgling pilot outweigh his skills.
By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Don't you know that some days
the b.s. is just too thick for the filter of absurdity, and the
whole system has to back up? In Washington, in less time than you
can say, ``minimum wage,'' members of the House of Representatives
gave themselves and their Senate colleagues a 3.4 percent salary
increase. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Institute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,
the breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much of Svanborg's work has prepared her for this
specific research. She and her group had studied the nature and
function of epithelial cells, the gut-lining cells that come into
contact with breast milk in nursing infants. And they had
experimented with mother's milk many times.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown that it does a terrific job of blocking infection
by pneumococcus bacteria, the cause of pneumonia, and that
breast-fed children suffer significantly fewer ear and upper
respiratory tract infections than babies who don't nurse.
</P>
<P>
   And her team had already done much of the homework that would be
needed. They had tracked down studies showing that breast milk also
protects against cancer. She wondered what accounted for that
discrepancy. Now she had at hand the results that might provide an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than two years before her team felt ready to share
its discovery with the rest of the world. In August 1995 they
announced that breast milk kills cancer cells and pinpointed the
killer, which turned out to be the protein alpha-lactalbumin
(alpha-lac for short). It helps produce lactose, the sugar found in
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Svanborg and her colleagues discovered that the protein was
performing the decidedly unprotein-like trick of changing its shape
_ and that it was persuading cancer cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also suggested a possible explanation of how
breast milk protects against cancer. Perhaps, Svanborg reasoned,
the errant cells that give rise to malignancies first show up in
infants. The key is breakneck reproduction, a characteristic of the
cells lining an infant's gut. Some of these cells may proliferate
out of control. That's called cancer. Or they may never fully
mature or stabilize, lurking in the system like time bombs, ever
ready to burst forth into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed alpha-lac ``targets not only cancer cells but all
kinds of immature, rapidly growing cells, and leaves mature, stable
cells alone,'' Svanborg says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-lac, then, may be conducting surveillance missions within
the nursing child, rooting out potentially malignant cells and
encouraging properly growing cells to mature. Because the lining of
the gut, a prime meeting point between the inside of the body and
the hazards of the outside world, is a headquarters of the immune
system, the vigilance may help the child's immune defenses develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, a vice president of grants at the American Cancer
Society, took notice. After reading the Svanborg team's research
paper, he made a journey to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not known of Lund University before, but we found
Catharina and her team to be very talented researchers, very
dedicated, and their work fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 grant made Svanborg's the only non-American lab with
ACS support. So she got back to work with renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grant gave us recognition,'' Svanborg says. ``We came into
this from nowhere, and the cancer society gave us the stamp of
quality. Now the weight was on us to prove that this is real and
reproducible.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort has taken another four years. In January, Svanborg
released the team's most recent findings, bolstered by the work of
new collaborators, including researchers from the renowned
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   The studies explain how transformed alpha-lac snuffs out cancer
and other risky cells, and characterizes the protein down to the
molecular level. And they announced that not only does it kill
cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

<P>
   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Institute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,
the breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much of Svanborg's work has prepared her for this
specific research. She and her group had studied the nature and
function of epithelial cells, the gut-lining cells that come into
contact with breast milk in nursing infants. And they had
experimented with mother's milk many times.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown that it does a terrific job of blocking infection
by pneumococcus bacteria, the cause of pneumonia, and that
breast-fed children suffer significantly fewer ear and upper
respiratory tract infections than babies who don't nurse.
</P>
<P>
   And her team had already done much of the homework that would be
needed. They had tracked down studies showing that breast milk also
protects against cancer. She wondered what accounted for that
discrepancy. Now she had at hand the results that might provide an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than two years before her team felt ready to share
its discovery with the rest of the world. In August 1995 they
announced that breast milk kills cancer cells and pinpointed the
killer, which turned out to be the protein alpha-lactalbumin
(alpha-lac for short). It helps produce lactose, the sugar found in
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Svanborg and her colleagues discovered that the protein was
performing the decidedly unprotein-like trick of changing its shape
_ and that it was persuading cancer cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also suggested a possible explanation of how
breast milk protects against cancer. Perhaps, Svanborg reasoned,
the errant cells that give rise to malignancies first show up in
infants. The key is breakneck reproduction, a characteristic of the
cells lining an infant's gut. Some of these cells may proliferate
out of control. That's called cancer. Or they may never fully
mature or stabilize, lurking in the system like time bombs, ever
ready to burst forth into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed alpha-lac ``targets not only cancer cells but all
kinds of immature, rapidly growing cells, and leaves mature, stable
cells alone,'' Svanborg says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-lac, then, may be conducting surveillance missions within
the nursing child, rooting out potentially malignant cells and
encouraging properly growing cells to mature. Because the lining of
the gut, a prime meeting point between the inside of the body and
the hazards of the outside world, is a headquarters of the immune
system, the vigilance may help the child's immune defenses develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, a vice president of grants at the American Cancer
Society, took notice. After reading the Svanborg team's research
paper, he made a journey to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not known of Lund University before, but we found
Catharina and her team to be very talented researchers, very
dedicated, and their work fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 grant made Svanborg's the only non-American lab with
ACS support. So she got back to work with renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grant gave us recognition,'' Svanborg says. ``We came into
this from nowhere, and the cancer society gave us the stamp of
quality. Now the weight was on us to prove that this is real and
reproducible.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort has taken another four years. In January, Svanborg
released the team's most recent findings, bolstered by the work of
new collaborators, including researchers from the renowned
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   The studies explain how transformed alpha-lac snuffs out cancer
and other risky cells, and characterizes the protein down to the
molecular level. And they announced that not only does it kill
cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

<P>
   Ever wonder how Post-it notes work?
</P>
<P>
   How about Scotch tape?
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of secrets about adhesives. One is the
chemical and industrial recipes for how to make the best ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of secret is the deeper kind: the physical
mechanism that explains how adhesives work. No one really knows
that secret, surprisingly enough _ maybe not even 3M, the
manufacturer Post-it notes.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when everything from space-shuttle engines to
disposable diapers are strewn with adhesives. Yet we still don't
know exactly what makes them stick.
</P>
<P>
   Or do we? A couple of French physicists have recently come up
with a new idea. Their hypothesis applies especially to adhesives
like those used in Scotch tape and Post-its, the kind that stick
immediately when you push them against a surface. (Glues, which
have to dry to become sticky and, in the process, undergo a
physical or chemical transformation, are a whole different kettle
of polymers.)
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressure-sensitive adhesives, say Ludwik Leibler and
Cyprien Gay, are bubbles: microscopic bits of partial vacuum that
act like suction cups to keep the sticky stuff stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The lab Leibler directs and Gay works at resides at Elf Atochem,
another of the world's leading adhesive manufacturers. But the two
physicists are also affiliated with the French National Center for
Scientific Research, which explains why they have the leisure time
to look into the basic physics of adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nothing is known about the subject, Gay says.
Researchers discovered more than a century ago that there was an
electrostatic attraction, called the van der Waals force, between
any two surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Positively charged particles on one surface tend to be attracted
to negatively charged particles on the other, with the result that
the two surfaces as a whole attract each other. Press your finger
flat against the surface of a table and then pull it away: the
slight stick is the van der Waals force.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very slight. The van der Waals force is roughly a ten-
thousandth of the force exerted by an everyday tape. Adhesives have
something else going for them: They are all made of polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Polymers are chain molecules, like spaghetti, except that
relative to their own diameter they are even longer than spaghetti
strands. And, like spaghetti, they get tangled up.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer adhesives are viscoelastic. It takes a lot of work to
pull them apart _ about 100 times, physicists have calculated, what
it would take to unstick something held by van der Waals attraction
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that even the aforementioned hundredfold increase
cannot completely explain the stickiness of real adhesives. This
has been brought home to researchers in the past decade, as they
have now learned how to measure stickiness precisely.
</P>
<P>
   In such experiments, a surface is coated with an adhesive, a
metal probe is pressed against the adhesive, and the probe is then
pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have had no good explanation for this familiar
pattern, Gay says. Nor could they explain why the overall adhesion
energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``With viscoelasticity you get about a hundred times more than
from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, physicists are missing a factor of 100; they
understand only about 1 percent of the reason why Scotch tape
sticks as well as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler and Gay think bubbles may account for the other 99
percent. The bubbles arise because the surface of Scotch or any
other tape is not as smooth as it looks to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under a microscope the adhesive becomes a rugged landscape of
mountains a few ten-thousandths of an inch high, separated by val
leys a few thousandths of an inch across.
</P>
<P>
   When a metal probe presses down onto that landscape, the
mountains and the passes between them come into contact with the
metal _ but not the floors of the valleys. Lens-shaped bubbles of
air get trapped there, like patches of ground fog.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe is pulled away again, those bubbles swell in
volume. At first the passes are still blocked, and no air can
parent than the physics. flow into them from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same amount of air is now filling a bigger volume,
the pressure inside the bubbles falls much lower than it is outside
_ just like in a suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   Picture thousands of tiny suction cups gripping a surface as you
try to rip off a recalcitrant strip of duct or packing tape: This
is the peak of the adhesive's force curve. As you keep pulling,
though, the bubbles widen and start to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the valleys are connected to one another and to the
outside,'' Gay says, ``and the air comes rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The nontechnical term for this moment is ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air-filled valleys continue to grow, the shrinking
mountains of adhesive become islands that soon stretch into long
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers still cling to the surface, in Leibler and Gay's
model, thanks to a second population of bubbles _ the ones that
form in the tiny valleys on the surface of the metal probe, which
isn't smooth either. Only when those bubbles pop, too, or the
viscoelastic fibers snap in the middle, does the adhesive
relinquish its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has reason to be proud of his bubble theory, Ludwik
Leibler can step back from his work and see the big picture:
``People have made very good adhesives without understanding
bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.

&HT;        BREAUX'S SON GIVES MONEY TO BUSH
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark Stricherz   c. 1999 States News Service   WASHINGTON,
<TEXT>
July 19 -- John Breaux has indeed donated money to George W. Bush,
the Republican's leading presidential candidate.
<P>
   It just happens to be John Breaux, Jr., the son of the Louisiana
Democratic Senator.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based
government watchdog, reported Monday that Breaux, in a stunning
display of turn-coat style politics, had given Bush $1,000 for the
latter's presidential bid. Breaux's Washington office received a
bevy of calls about the matter, wondering how could the senior
senator could do such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   It just happened to be wrong, though. The real distributor of
the money was Breaux's son.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Breaux, who lives not far from Washington in
Alexandria, Va., works as a lobbyist for Johnston &AMP; Associates, the
lobbying firm set up by former Louisiana Sen. Bennett Johnston,
according to Breaux spokesman Bette Phelan.

BRIDGET FONDA DIVES INTO `LAKE PLACID'

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In her dozen years as a film actress, Bridget
Fonda's pale, slender beauty has lent itself to roles as a Single
White Female, a bong-smoking beach bunny and a waitress. Now, she's
trying something a little different _ playing a reluctant crocodile
chaser in the quirky/scary creature flick ``Lake Placid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a body-hugging black sweater set and slim skirt (from
which, she discovered, she hadn't yet removed the price tag),
Fonda, at 35, seems to look more like a Fonda every day. The lanky
frame and piercing eyes bear a strong resemblance to those of
father Peter, grandfather Henry and aunt Jane. Though she says she
has to watch her weight a bit more now than in the past, it's hard
to sympathize when she pinches what she imagines is a bit of fat on
her leg. (BEGIN ITAL) Please, (END ITAL) you think, (BEGIN ITAL)
allow me to show you what fat really looks like. (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   It may not be coincidental, then, that Fonda was offered the
lead role in ``Ally McBeal.'' The huge TV hit was created by ``Lake
Placid'' writer David E. Kelley; Fonda says she's just not
interested in doing television right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if something came along that I wanted to
do (on TV),'' Fonda said. ``I love the character and writing on
`Ally McBeal,' but my favorite part of making a movie is the
preparation. I'm not that spontaneous, to work on a series the way
they do, changing things up to the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   It's often said that Kelley is the busiest man in show business:
He has three shows on the air (``Ally,'' ``The Practice'' and
``Chicago Hope'') and finds time to write movies on the side when
he's not busy being a family man with wife Michelle Pfeiffer.
Everyone involved with ``Placid'' says Kelley's smart,
tongue-in-cheek writing was a main attraction in doing the film and
that Kelley was always available to make small tweaks when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never actually seen him on the set of anything, but he's
always there,'' said director Steve Miner. With credits that range
from ``Halloween: H20'' to TV's ``Dawson's Creek,'' Miner seems to
have been a natural choice to bring this mixture of horror and
dark, offbeat humor to the screen. ``We had a little trouble
setting (the movie) up,'' admits Miner, ``because people had a
little trouble understanding what kind of movie it was. But David
and I always knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda plays a paleontologist called in to figure out how a giant
crocodile may have made its way into a Maine lake. As part of her
preparation, Fonda paid a visit to the Museum of Natural History in
New York, where she was debriefed on the fine points of identifying
a crocodile from one of its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda admits she can relate to the insecurities of her
character, who's a bundle of insecurities because she's fresh off a
broken relationship and is out of her element in the wild. ``I
loved this character. She's been having a bad time. She's a bitch
because she's so afraid of being not good enough ... her
self-esteem is so low that she doesn't want to leave her cubicle
and her microscope,'' said Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   As for her own insecurities, Fonda admits she's afraid of
heights _ and doesn't relish looking back at her own work on film.
``I'm not that crazy about my own work ... I'll watch the dailies
and go to the premiere,'' Fonda said, ``but looking back _ I don't
really get into what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she grew up among Hollywood royalty _ or perhaps
because of it _ Fonda says she can relate to the fear that grows
from insecurity. But according to Fonda, who recently ended a long
relationship with actor Eric Stoltz and is currently dating
singer/actor Dwight Yoakam, she doesn't suffer from it when it
comes to feeling like she has to measure up against anyone else's
fame, or the Fonda ``legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sense of competition. That's probably from
being the child of someone famous,'' Fonda says, ``that I don't
look at fame as a register of anything real. Fame just doesn't mean
anything concrete. It's so changeable. You can't count on it. It
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda says that, unlike her father, who released a juicy
autobiography last year (``Don't Tell Dad: A Memoir''), she's
learned to keep a part of her life private. ``The way I grew up was
that there was no privacy. My father is very, very open,'' Fonda
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up thinking that's the way you had to be. But then,''
said Fonda, ``I found out I didn't want to be that way ... I had to
sort of learn how to not feel bad about not answering certain
questions. My natural instinct is to try to give an answer _ that's
the gracious thing to do. I'm a people pleaser, which makes me feel
bad about not giving an answer, but I'm also kind of shy and
private. So sometimes I'm torn.
</P>
<P>
   Workwise, Fonda says she's conscious these days of moving beyond
parts that cast her as merely window dressing: ``corsage parts,''
as she calls them. She says she'd be interested in developing her
own projects if she could ``find a way to do it: It takes time _
and a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Fonda says she's happy and grateful for the parts
she's gotten so far in her career and is just trying to take things
one role at a time. ``Do I think about my legacy? I can't really
think about that,'' Fonda said. ``If I think about that ... it's a
setup for a feeling of failure for me; I'll never measure up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get objective about my own work,'' Fonda admits, ``so
I just have to let go of that and hope other people like what I
do.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) - The Bible is the written witness to God's saving
activity in the history of Israel, the person and ministry of Jesus
and the early church. It bears witness to a loving God who creates
all things and calls all that is good, a God in whose image all
humankind is created, a God who acts to overcome oppression and
death. It tells of a Jesus who embodies God's compassion and
justice and who instructs us to be like God, compassionate and
just, in our life together.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible is a marvelous treasure for instruction and spiritual
growth, but it is not easily understood. The Bible must be
interpreted to be understood, using all available knowledge about
the historical, cultural and literary settings of each passage
being studied. There are six passages in the Bible that contain
references to same-gender sexual activity. Not all Christians will
agree on the exact meaning and significance of these passages.
</P>
<P>
   I find no discussion of homosexuality in the Bible.
Homosexuality is a word that was invented by psychoanalysts in the
late 1800s to describe their discovery of a natural and innate
same-gender sexual orientation. There was no understanding of
sexual orientation in biblical times. There was not even a word for
it in the languages of the Bible: Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, a few references to same-gender sexual
activity in the Bible, and in each case the sexual activity is
condemned. But each reference is found in a context related to
violence, idolatry, promiscuity and exploitation. In each of these,
it is the violence, idolatry, promiscuity or exploitation that are
the reasons why the same-gender sexual activity is condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual activity is first and fore most a good gift from God that
blesses intimate, loving relationships with shared physical
pleasure. The potential for creating new life need not be a
requirement for wholesome sexual activity. Otherwise, sharing
physical intimacy would be denied to persons who are infertile.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is this: There is no biblical reference that
condemns same-gender sexual relations between two people who are in
a mutually loving, nurturing, caring and supportive relationship.
Consequently, there is no condemnation of homosexuality in the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   This was a surprising discovery to me! I did not study the Bible
about this until a gay member of the United Methodist church I was
serving in 1984 told me of the abuse he experienced in the church.
I learned that the teachings and practices of Christian churches
were causing gay and lesbian persons to believe themselves rejected
by and separated from God because of who they are.
</P>
<P>
   I believe this kind of teaching to be spiritual abuse and that
it is contrary to the ministry of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus proclaimed a realm of God where all were welcome,
especially those who were cast out of community because they were
different. God's realm is defined by compassion, freedom from
oppression, justice and peace.
</P>
<P>
   What is important in regard to sexual ethics is not the gender
of the people involved but the quality of the relationship in which
sexuality is expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Genesis 19: 1-29 contains the legendary story of the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah. God is about to destroy these cities because
of their prior sinfulness and sends two angels, who appear to be
men, to save Lot and his family. The men of Sodom threaten to
sexually violate the angels.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story about violent gang rape that in ancient times
was a way men humiliated and showed dominance over other men. The
Sodom story clearly illustrates and condemns the inhospitality of
uncaring arrogance and sexual violence. It is not a story about
loving, caring same-gender sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The passages in Leviticus are in a collection of laws known as
the Holiness Code. The Israelites were to be different from their
neighbors, especially in regard to the religious practices of the
Egyptians and Canaanites.
</P>
<P>
   The religion of Baal, practiced in Canaan, was a fertility
religion. Its temples had prostitutes, male and female. Sexual
intercourse with either by male worshipers was believed to enhance
and ensure the fertility of the land. The men of Israel were
forbidden to ''lie with a male as with a woman,'' because doing so
imitated the worship of Baal, which was idolatrous, was called an
''abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Romans is Paul's letter to a Jewish community living in a
Gentile world. In the first chapter, Paul refers to Gentile pagan
practices used in the worship of ''lies and creatures'' (other
words for idols). Such practices included sexual intercourse with
male and female temple prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   He was familiar with the Holiness Code and its prohibition
against behavior that imitates pagan worship. Paul has no
understanding of sexual orientation and its diversity. He assumes
sexual relations to be natural and acceptable only between men and
women. So, for him, same-gender sexual activity turns the world
upside down and is unnatural, contrary to the created order. What
he describes is idolatrous, lustful and promiscuous sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of this passage is that, when taken seriously, it is
an affirmation, not a condemnation, of loving, caring and committed
same-sex relations for gay and lesbian persons. For them, same-sex
relations are natural and honor the creator.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite-sex relations would be contrary to their nature and a
rejection of the creator's design.
</P>
<P>
   This passage is a saving message for lesbian and gay persons who
act with integrity as the persons God created them to be, just as
much as it is a judgment against those who ''exchange natural
relations for unnatural.''
</P>
<P>
   In I Corinthians 6: 1-10 and I Timothy 1: 8-10, Paul lists vices
that are condemned, using some Greek words whose meanings are
uncertain. Unfortunately, these words have been inaccurately
translated to refer to same-gender sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   The first word is malakoi, which means soft. The second word,
arsenokoitai, has no clear meaning. Paul is the first to use it and
he does not define it. The first part of this word, arseno, means
male. The second part, koitai, means bed. There is no clue what
Paul means by this.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the early Christian church used these words when
talking about same-gender sexual activity. Many of the early church
leaders discuss same-gender sexual activity but never use these
words or refer to these passages. John Chrysostom (fourth-century
theologian) wrote commentaries on both I Corinthians and I Timothy
and did not identify any references to same-gender sexual activity
in these passages.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cantor (12th century) made a list of all passages in the
Bible that he believed referred to same-gender sexual activity and
did not include these two passages. It was not until the 13th
century that Thomas Aquinas associated these words with same-sex
sexual activity. &QL;

   The truth, of course, was much more complex. On the eve of the

   (UNDATED) - Evangelical Christians are people who are on ''the
way'' in following Jesus Christ while rooted firmly in the
authority of God's word - the Scriptures. While we take value from
reason, experience and tradition, all are submitted to the
authority of Scripture wherein we find the absolute God.
</P>
<P>
   When considered in light of the absolute God, whom we worship,
and to whom we submit, there are clear conclusions that are drawn
regarding the issue of persons who practice sexual behavior
contrary to God's law and our responsibility for ministry as with
any other characteristic of fallen humanity. The differing opinions
on this matter ultimately proceed from the differing opinions on
the authority of Scripture, the presence of a God who is absolute,
and the degree to which we must submit to him. We remain firm in
our commitment to submit to God standing firmly on the authority of
his word.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary debates, as most emotionally charged debates, press
the positions to extremes. Within the context of an increasingly
secularized society that abandons basic absolutes rooted in God in
favor of an egalitarian relativism, it becomes difficult to ''hate
sin while loving the sinner.'' The discrimination between activity
and identity is lost in the all-consuming battle to ''win.''
Therefore, when someone says that homosexual behavior is sin, it is
interpreted as hatred of homosexuals. Conversely, if another person
says that their heart breaks for those who practice homosexuality
and they wish to reach out to help, it is easily interpreted as
accommodation or compromise. The church must take care to maintain
a clear distinction between personhood and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Although many are wanting the church to accept homosexual
behavior today, this issue is nothing new. It has been a matter of
discussion for millennia. It is inappropriate for the church to be
drawn into debate on a singular issue while ignoring other sinful
practices that are equally abhorrent to God. For various reasons,
however, these days the matter has achieved a crescendo perhaps
because of its import to the character and foundation of such a
historic influence as the United Methodist Church. Yet, as
throughout creation and time, God is still in heaven and remains
committed to the redemption of fallen humanity through the grace
and sacrifice of his son, Jesus, the Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, homosexual practice represents a complex issue. The
behavior is incompatible with Biblical teaching. Take for example
the account of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19. It becomes evident
that this is a pattern of behavior that has existed since the fall
of humanity by the willful act of disobedience. The attempted
gang-rape of Lot's male visitors reflects the thoroughgoing
wickedness of a people bent on violent abuse. The manifestation of
that wickedness, in this case, took the form of unnatural sexual
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 provide explicit reference to
homosexual activity in the Old Testament. ''You shall not lie with
a male as with a woman.'' ''If a man lies with a male as with a
woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be
put to death; their blood is upon them.'' While in interpreting the
Levitical verses Christians recognize that ''the Holiness Code'' in
chapters 17-26 is not binding in its details today, we accept that
it does represent the principle of holy behavior as important to a
Holy God. Further study reveals that not only is it important to
him, he provides a means whereby it is attainable. The specific
activity of homosexuality is clearly part of that type of behavior
that is not holy and therefore not acceptable to him.
</P>
<P>
   In I Corinthians 6:9, Paul lists a number of wrongdoers who will
not inherit the Kingdom of God (cf. I Timothy 1:10). Among them are
''male prostitutes'' and ''sodomites.'' The point of the list is to
demonstrate the types of behavior that are unacceptable to God even
to the point of disqualification in the Kingdom. While no rationale
is given for condemning homosexual activity and it is unclear
whether Paul was talking about male prostitutes and their male
customers, young men or boys who were being sexually exploited by
older men in a pederastic relationship, or any males acting in
homoerotic ways, it is clearly in a category of behavior that is
looked upon with disdain by God.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest reference to the practice of homosexuality is found
in Romans 1:26-27. Here Paul says, ''For this reason God gave them
up to degrading passions. Their women exchanged natural intercourse
for unnatural, and in the same way also the men, giving up natural
intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another.
Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own
persons the due penalty for their error.'' This passage occurs in
the context of Paul's discussion of God's judgment upon sin.
</P>
<P>
   This passage is significant in that it attempts to describe the
sinful state of humanity, which arose due to the fundamental sin of
people refusing to honor and give thanks to God (Romans 1:21). Thus
homosexual activity does represent the cause of God's judgment so
much as it represents one of the many results of what happens when
God gives people up to their sinful actions (cf. Romans 1:26-31).
</P>
<P>
   In each case, it is important to note that it is the activity
that is condemned by God, who loves everyone. Just as an earthly
father loves his child even in the midst of misbehavior, so also
God loves his creation in the midst of sinful activity, which
includes homosexual behaviors. He so loves us that he has made a
provision for us to be forgiven for sins, cleansed and reconciled
to him in love. For ''He was not willing that any should perish but
that all should come to eternal life.'' (II Peter 3:9)
</P>
<P>
   While we believe that ''His grace is sufficient for all our
needs,'' Christians recognize that the application of that grace
may come in a number of ways. It may be through the deliverance of
someone from the tendencies toward sin. It may also, as in many
cases, be through applied grace that enables the person to
discipline and control the tendencies so as not to lead to sinful
activities. In either case, it truly represents ''Amazing Grace,''
which sets the captive free from sin. Why? Because God loves all of
us, even though not all will respond to his grace.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as Christians, we should do all we can to reach out to
those practicing homosexual behavior as we would anyone, rather
than discourage or exclude them from fellowship. We should give the
same compassion we have received, encouraging people to live in
conformity with Scripture and in submission to God and the grace he
offers freely and without discrimination to all who respond in
faith. &QL;

INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SCRIPTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - For mainline Protestants, the debate over the
acceptance and the roles of gays and lesbians in the church - from
the blessing of same-sex unions to the ordination of non-celibate
gay pastors - is growing increasingly divisive. At the heart of the
debate are six scriptures. The Arizona Republic asked two
nationally known theologians for their interpretations of those
verses. The scriptures are from the New International Version of
the Bible. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the
city of Sodom - both young and old - surrounded the house. They
called to Lot, `Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring
them out to us so that we can have sex with them.' Lot went outside
to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, `No, my
friends. Don't do this wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who
have never slept with a man.' '' - Genesis 19:5-8 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is
detestable.'' - Leviticus 18:22 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them
have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their
blood will be on their own heads.'' - Leviticus 20:13 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same
way, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were
inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts
with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for
their perversion.'' - Romans 1:26-27 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of
God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor
thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers
will inherit the kingdom of God.'' - 1 Corinthians 6:9-10  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``We also know that law is made not for good men but for
lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
murderers, for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars
and perjurers - and for whatever else is contrary to the sound
doctrine that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God,
which he entrusted to me.'' - 1 Timothy 1:9-11 &QL;

A WORLD OF FUN FOR GARNETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ After every game, he tries to be as inconspicuous as
a 7-footer can be. A hat covers his head, which is always looking
down. A discman is in one hand, earphones in the other. He tries to
blend in. It doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The fans in the stands, directly across from the so-called
``free zone'' where players congregate after games, instantly
recognize Kevin Garnett and the cheers and calls soon begin, as if
on cue. Eventually, Garnett acknowledges them and then spends time
chatting with reporters, something he actually seems to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   He is quickly coming to grips with his international celebrity
here in the pre-Olympic Qualifying Tournament of the Americas. As
he put it before Monday's game with the Dominican Republic, ``I'm
looking at this international thing this way: I'm going to have
fun. I've never been here. I'm soaking it all in _ period. End of
story.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's really just the beginning of what could be a very long
story. Gary Payton and Tim Hardaway are the veterans and Tim Duncan
clearly is the local favorite; it's only a 20-minute flight from
his native St. Croix. But if there's one player on the United
States team who is playing well and playing to the crowd, it's the
23-year-old Garnett. As much as any individual on this team, he is
epitomizing what the team is, how it plays, and where it's going.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to pick a word to describe the team, he said, ``predators.
We're a team full of predators, but we also have fun. We're a team
that really comes out and competes. But we're a predator team,
putting a team 6-feet deep, trying to set the tone. But, at the
same time, have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He's having a blast. This tournament, against what can
charitably be called ``competition,'' is giving Garnett a stage for
the show he likes the best: running, dunking, blocking shots,
chatting up opponents who don't understand him, playing to the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too early to call him The Ambassador?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to enjoy this,'' he said. ``I think the crowd
recognizes that I'm playing hard. I play with a lot of passion and
emotion and the crowd feeds off my energy and my attitude toward
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then continued. ``You have to understand, man. We are
sending a message to young kids everywhere who might one day want
to become basketball players. The message is this: it's good to go
out and have fun. It doesn't matter who you dunk on, or who dunks
on you. Or how bad you play or how good you play. The whole object
is to have fun, man. This is for the crowd. The great Charles
Barkley said fans pay a lot of money, so you want to entertain
them. I'm just happy to be here, man . . . Dunks or no dunks.''
</P>
<P>
   He's had mostly dunks. In the first four games of this
tournament, all blowout US wins, Garnett led the Yanks in scoring
at 16.5 points a game and blocked shots at 2.3. He was second in
rebounding (7.0) and minutes played (23.8), he's shooting an
astonishing 69.8 percent (30 for 43) and virtually all of his field
goals have been authoritative dunks or layups.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Garnett sees (and hopes) is the NBA of the future,
one of running, cutting, dunking, and, most of all, smiling. Now
all he has to do is get rid of the coaches and he might be on to
something.
</P>
<P>
   And don't bother him with any Dream Team comparisons. He won't
listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a different breed, man,'' he said. ``We're so far
new school that you can't compare us. It's totally different. I
don't think it's fair to the guys in the Hall of Fame. I don't
think it's fair to the great ones like Michael, Magic, or Larry.
This is more like an up-tempo-type generation. (It's) a lot of guys
having fun. (It's) a lot of competitiveness. That's where our
league is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett is unquestionably one of the people who will carry it
into the next century. US coach Larry Brown, an unabashed,
unapologetic, old-schooler, marvels at Garnett's sheer athleticism
and skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only 23 and he's already one of the elite players in the
league,'' Brown said. ``He's only going to get better. I can't
fathom a better, all-around package.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, too, has noticed that the fans warm to Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they enjoy the way he plays,'' Brown said. ``He makes
the spectacular plays. But he also plays hard. You can make a case
for any of our guys, but I don't think anyone is more popular than
Kevin is. The one thing I've noticed over the years is that there
are a lot of good players, but they don't really enjoy playing.
Kevin loves to play. He is enjoying himself out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett also was involved in, at least in Argentina, probably
the most memorable play of the tournament. A 19-year-old Argentine
named Andres Nocioni drove by him and then did a reverse dunk on
both Garnett and Duncan. Garnett traded trash talk with Nocioni the
rest of the way, although neither could understand the other.
</P>
<P>
   That followed a game against Uruguay in which he was asked
during a stop in play if he'd pose for a picture after the game. He
told the unsuspecting Uruguayan he'd have to clear it with the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   He'd never had that experience before, but a lot of things are
new and different for Garnett. Next year in Sydney should be even
more eye-opening, even though the hoop world already has some idea
of how he can play.
</P>
<P>
   But Garnett has always been more than that. We've seen it the
last four years and now everyone else is getting a chance. It's not
simply that he plays well. It's how much he enjoys it and lives for
it.

GREAT SCOT: LAWRIE THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ From the streets of Aberdeen to the
larger neighborhoods of Edinboro and Glascow, there may have been a
pint or two hoisted Sunday night when native son Paul Lawrie won
the 128th British Open in the moist air of the Carnoustie Golf
Course. Just last Wednesday, Rhode Islander Billy Andrade had said
whoever wins in these grueling conditions will be, in his mind, the
world's best golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lawrie? He was 159th on the world ranking list, and had won
just twice since turning pro in 1986. He won the Catalonian Open in
1996, and the Qatar Masters in February. This didn't strike fear
into anyone's hearts, did it? Wife Marian stayed home in Aberdeen
to put infant son Michael and 4-year-old son Craig to bed as the
rest of the family was on holiday in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   This was a historic sporting moment. Lawrie had been 10 shots
back entering the final round, and nobody had overcome that large a
deficit to win a major championship. Jackie Burke Jr. had trailed
by eight entering the final round of the Masters in 1956 before
winning.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the best way to put the enormous accomplishment into
some perspective. The last Scottish-born player to win a major on
home turf was Tommy Armour, who had emigrated to the United States
and won the first of the five British Opens played at Carnoustie,
in 1931. That was the year Bobby Jones was trying to put the wheels
in motion to create the Augusta National GC where the tournament
known as the Masters would be played.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie, 30, started in the game selling Mars Bars as an
assistant in the shop at Banchory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I got my qualifications and learned my trade,''
he said after the excitement had died out Sunday. He had to make
the journey to Downfield last weekend to qualify, and had to stage
a remarkable comeback on the second nine of the second qualifying
round just to make it to Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   Since qualifying was introduced in 1962, a qualifier had never
won the game's oldest _ and to many, the most prestigious _
tournament. He found himself in the game's only four-hole playoff
format Sunday evening when the sinking Frenchman Jean Van de Velde
triple-bogeyed the 18th to open the doors. Van de Velde and 1997
champion Justin Leonard, who had registered two 6s on the finishing
hole out of the Barrie burn, joined Lawrie in the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   This gets Lawrie into the Masters, the PGA Championship next
month at Medinah, the Dunhill Cup at nearby St. Andrews, and the
World Cup, where he will team with Colin Montgomerie and represent
their country. Montgomerie has been Scotland's best golfer over the
past decade, but Lawrie now has something Montgomerie has failed to
win _ one of golf's four major championships.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Van de Velde let it get away, when he
was on the verge of giving France its most notable golfing triumph
since amateur Catherine Lacoste won the US Women's Open in 1967.
After the triple, Van de Velde took a double bogey on the first
playoff hole and a bogey out of the bunker on the second hole.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie, who vaulted to second on the European Ryder Cup team
standings that will defend against the United States at The Country
Club in Brookline, Mass., in September, closed with a 67. This for
a player known as an underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who say that to me,'' said Lawrie.
``I've been given a hard time for being an underachiever. I
practice hard. I practice my chipping and short game a lot. I'm
trying hard. I'm working hard at my game. Sometimes I don't get as
much out of my game as I maybe should, but I don't really know why
that is. Yeah, a lot of people have told me that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my career is just starting. I think the win in Qatar
was the breakthrough. I feel as though I can compete with these
guys on a regular basis. If you can't get yourself up for playing
in the biggest tournament in the world, then there's something
wrong with you. You know, the best players in the world are here
and you want to beat them. You want to compete with them and you
want to show them that you can play.''

HUMMING ECONOMY, FUNDAMENTALS FIRING UP SMALLER TECH FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who pays even the slightest attention to the stock market
knows that the big technology companies are flying high. Microsoft
last week topped $500 billion in market value; Lucent, Cisco, and
IBM are all worth more than $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the news has also been good at lower altitudes for smaller
technology companies, including a long list of Massachusetts firms.
Netegrity of Waltham has seen its stock price appreciate more than
twentyfold since October. LTX Corp. of Westwood, Mass. is up more
than tenfold. Helix Technology Corp. of Mansfield, Mass. and Cognex
Corp. of Natick, Mass. have both more than tripled in value.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of the little guys raises two obvious questions:
What's driving it and is it too late to still jump in?
</P>
<P>
   A little background is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Last October was an awful time for the stock market. The
collapse of the Russian economy and the near collapse of Long Term
Capital Management, a hedge fund, convinced investors that the sky
was falling. Technology stocks got clobbered; little technology
stocks were obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything got overdone,'' says John Golden, a technology
analyst with John Hancock Funds.
</P>
<P>
   There was some method to the madness. In difficult times, small
companies frequently lose market share to their bigger,
better-financed competitors. Under those circumstances, investors
get nervous. They keep the names they know and dump the ones they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   But as 1999 began investor sentiment started to shift. The sky
didn't actually fall. The news from most Third World countries was
better than expected. The US economy kept chugging along. ``It was
as if someone turned on a switch and said it is okay to buy
small-cap stocks again,'' says Jon Hickman, a money manager with
Jurika &AMP; Voyles in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap stocks have done well this year after several years of
poor performance. Small technology companies have done better
still, in part, because the fundamentals of the business are
improving.
</P>
<P>
   Take semiconductors, an industry that can go from feast to
famine practically overnight. Last year was famine time. This year
the food has returned. Orders have rebounded, driven by a better
economic picture and strong growth in the telecommunications
business.
</P>
<P>
   Big companies, like Boston's Teradyne, which makes test
equipment for the industry, have seen the improvement. But enough
crumbs have spilled from the table for the little guys to eat well
too.
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly large number of Massachusetts companies are
suppliers to the industry. Local beneficiaries of the upturn
include LTX, Applied Science and Technology, IBIS Technology, PRI
Automation, Brooks Automation, Helix, and Cognex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rode the downside in '98 and we are following the pickup in
'99,'' says Richard Morin, chief financial officer at Cognex, a
maker of vision systems. Morin notes that most participants at last
week's big semiconductor trade show in California were quite
bullish, a suggestion that the good times could continue for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   A few local Internet companies have also enjoyed big gains this
year. Netegrity, the big winner, makes products that control user
access to e-commerce on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Project Software of Bedford got the market's attention this
spring when it said it was forming a subsidiary, mro.com, which
will help companies manage inventory over the Internet. The
announcement noted that the subsidiary will ``have increasing
losses over the next several quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Those magic words were enough to double the stock price in a
two-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Where do we go from here? Most analysts say that while the best
gains are behind us there are still opportunities to make money.
Fred Wolf, an analyst with Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill, recommends ADE
Corp., a Westwood semiconductor supplier that has experienced only
a modest run-up in its stock price so far.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the economic fundamentals for the second half of the
year should provide support to the little tech companies. Assuming
the world economy stays on track and the Federal Reserve doesn't
hike interest rates dramatically, these money managers say the
stocks can continue to do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this will last,'' says Hickman of Jurika &AMP; Voyles.
``We've had three years of underperformance by small-cap stocks.
Maybe we're ready for three years of outperformance.''

IT'S THE ORIGINAL BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON, England _ Caroline Wilson says, ``Oh, you're from that
other Boston? We're told it's a nice place. Bigger than ours, and
on a river, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is, but your Boston is very nice as well. Very
nice,'' says my friend, Aurelio, as Caroline sets a late breakfast
on the garden table: bacon, eggs _ and baked beans.
</P>
<P>
   Baked beans in the original Bean? Ah. Perfect. Is this where it
all began. Did the Bostonian tradition commence here?
</P>
<P>
   ``A tradition? I don't think so,'' says Caroline, who operates
the cozy Churches Restaurant with her husband, David, the cook.
``Just since your Mr. Heinz started putting them in cans. But very
popular here.''
</P>
<P>
   Never spoil a good story with the facts. Cardinal journalistic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with or without baked beans, this first Boston is
the root of our town. A pleasant and extremely friendly small city
of about 30,000, riven by the River Witham in Lincolnshire, it goes
back to the first century. An easy 100-mile drive northeast from
London takes you into the neighborhood, agricultural country as
flat as day-old champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Puritans who'd spent time here, and had done some of it in the
Guildhall jail before fleeing the persecution of King Charles I and
landing in America, were responsible for naming the ``other
Boston.'' They liked this place when they weren't in the slammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see the Stump, you'll know you're almost there,'' said
English friend Liz Kahn, who did the driving. ``Oh, there it is.''
The imposing gray tower of St. Botolph's Church loomed clearly
above the countryside even though we were miles away, passing
through broccoli and cauliflower fields and the village of Frampton
Fen.
</P>
<P>
   Botolph, Boston II's roundabout namesake, was a Benedictine
monk, later canonized. He founded a monastery in the area in 654,
and the hamlet would become known as St. Botolph's Town.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while it was just Botolph's Town,'' says Mike Haynes,
verger of the mammoth Gothic church of St. Botolph, a beauty.
``Eventually, with usage, it just slid into Boston, and has been
that for centuries. And will be forever, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Good man, Botolph. I tell Haynes that their saint is honored in
the other Boston by a street and a distinguished private club
bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the other Boston. I'd like to see it sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how I'd felt about Boston I, and I'm enjoying it. Even
the 200 step slog to almost-the-top of the landmark for travelers
and sailors, the 272-foot Stump. It's as far as climbers are
permitted. Thank goodness. But the view is spectacular, even though
it's not quite sunny enough today to see Lincoln Cathedral 30 miles
distant.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive St. B's, with its tower and nave both stretching
nearly as far as a football field, has all the appearances of a
medieval cathedral, right out of the 14th century. But Haynes says,
``It isn't a cathedral strictly speaking. It's designated as a
parish church, the largest in England.''
</P>
<P>
   Constructed of sandstone from nearby Barmack and floored in huge
slabs, well below the nave's wooden ceiling, the church could hold
the citizenry, 2,000 souls, on completion about 1400.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes says, ``It took 90 years to build, but they were in no
hurry and had plenty of money. Gradually the Stump grew. This was a
wealthy community because of shipping and wool. A lamb atop a wool
sack is the town symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston, still prosperous and neat, has a windmill and some
cobblestone streets left over from a few centuries back, and is
solidly structured, mainly in Georgian brick. It slumped as a port
for a time but has made a comeback, dealing with Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   He points to a wall tablet commemorating eminent seafarers from
the parish _ botanist Joseph Banks, explorers George Bass and
Matthew Flinders _ who sailed with Captain James Cook on his voyage
to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come over here and look at our famous misericords _ the seats
in the choir.''
</P>
<P>
   He flips up the fold-down seats, revealing handsome carvings,
many amusing, on the wooden bottoms. One is a housewife pounding
her husband with something like a rolling pin because he has come
home empty-handed. Another, a schoolboy trying to block a flogging
by a schoolmaster with one of his boots.
</P>
<P>
   Much light flows in through tall, clear windows. ``The stained
glass was knocked out during the Reformation,'' Haynes says. But a
more recent one, 1857, is in place showing the United States
ambassador to Britain attending the reopening of Cotton Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rev. Cotton, the pastor from 1612 to 1633, was known for his
three-hour sermons, which,'' Haynes chuckles, ``some say was a
factor in hastening parishioners on their way to America.''
</P>
<P>
   To depart they had to sail up the Witham into The Wash, a bay in
the North Sea. A tidal river, coursing through downtown, the Witham
is banked high in mud at low tide, rising in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who got out of town, glad to go, and make their way
to Southampton to catch the Mayflower were William Bradford and
William Brewster, the Pilgrim Fathers. They had been arrested for
trying to leave the country, and, were incarcerated ``in this
cell,'' says Noel Pulford at the Guildhall. ``Try it. You won't
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Seven-by-5 1/2 feet, cold and not user-friendly.
Even a winter in Plymouth was preferable.
</P>
<P>
   A circular staircase leads from the jail to the courtroom.
Pulford, a guide whose bearded mien is prized as he plays King John
in an annual local pageant, takes us through the small but choice
museum on the same floor devoted to the work of townsfolk.
</P>
<P>
   A thick 16th-century copy of John Coxe's ``History of the
Martyrs'' is in pretty good shape. ``It was a best-seller,'' says
Pulford, ``even though it was in Latin. Here's a book of poetry by
Jean Ingelow that was lauded by Tennyson, but she never got
anywhere, being a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   One sector belongs to William Bartol Thomas, a 19th-century
painter whose miniatures, landscapes, and seascapes are tender and
touching.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming to be tender was the town executioner, William Marwood,
who specialized in ``painless, scientific hanging.'' His calling
card is on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed only one,'' Pulford says. ``Of course it could be
used over and over. They had a sort of riddle in Marwood's day: `If
pa killed ma, who'd kill pa? Mar-would.' ''
</P>
<P>
   You might call him Boston Strangler I, from Boston I.

TO OZ WITH EYES WIDE WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unforeseen disaster whisks a wide-eyed innocent away from the
doldrums of a black-and-white home. Family, and all that is
familiar, are forsaken in search of something grander. Meeting
several loyal compatriots and strange characters along the way, the
naif is plunged into a world of temptation, wonder, and danger,
only to discover, when all is said and done, there's no place like
home.
</P>
<P>
   We spent 2 1/2 years expecting ``Eyes Wide Shut'' to be a
masterpiece. What we got is a silly, sexed-up version of ``The
Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' the last work by acclaimed filmmaker Stanley
Kubrick, may have been ``inspired'' by the 1926 novella
``Traumnovelle,'' by Arthur Schnitzler, but it plays like a
decadent twist on the beloved 1939 classic. It's Tom Cruise as
Dorothy, Manhattan's Upper West Side subbing for Kansas, and Chris
Isaak's ``Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing'' instead of Judy Garland's
``Over the Rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the tornado that snatches Dorothy away, Cruise's Dr.
William Harford is blown asunder by his wife revelation's that she
briefly considered kicking everything to the curb _ her marriage,
her daughter, her tony Manhattan digs _ for a roll in the hay with
a dishy naval officer she spied while she and hubby were on a Cape
Cod vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ripe setup, disturbing all those uncomfortable places
where we silently question our partner's fidelity, how well we know
the person, and by extension, how well we know ourselves. It isn't
enough, however, to send a sane man off in search of sexual
misadventure. Yet, there's Cruise straying from his Central Park
West comforts for a nefarious Oz netherworld in Greenwich Village,
and especially a castlelike mansion where rich people don masks,
and engage in what I guess passes for doin' the nasty among the
financially flush. At this rate ``Eyes Wide Shut'' may replace Pink
Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon'' as the favored trippy companion
piece to ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Kubrick died in March, there's no way of telling whether
this tedious, somnambulistic version of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' in
theaters is what he intended audiences to see. Kubrick was a
notorious tweaker, known to fiddle with his films until the last
possible moment _ and sometimes beyond, as was the case with ``The
Shining,'' on which Kubrick performed a nip-and-tuck after its
opening in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   It's already been reported that, to avoid a kiss-of-death NC-17
rating from the mean ol' Motion Picture Association of America,
some digital characters were added to obscure certain sexual acts
during an orgy scene. Those involved with the film maintain that
Kubrick approved the changes, but whether he did or didn't hardly
matters. Adding a naughty minute of skin wouldn't have made this
film any more interesting. Sold as a thought-provoking erotic
thriller, it is not erotic _ this is cold, sterile antisex _ and
the only thought the film provokes is, ``This is how Kubrick spent
the last years of his life?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' George Lucas will be happy to hear, now
holds the distinction as most disappointing film of the summer.
Don't be fooled by those touting this as Kubrick's final
``masterpiece.'' If Kubrick had stopped making films after 1971's
``A Clockwork Orange,'' that would have been his final masterpiece.
This pretentious piffle most certainly isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Second Coming would have trouble living up to the
tsunami of hype ``Eyes Wide Shut'' has received _ magazine covers,
endless Internet speculation, and toothy Tom Cruise making his
prerecorded rounds on the talk-show circuit are just a teaspoon's
worth. But then, people had a right to expect a lot. Kubrick has
made some of the great films in history, including ``Dr.
Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,''
``Paths of Glory,'' ``A Clockwork Orange'' and ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.'' ``Eyes Wide Shut'' was his first since 1987's ``Full
Metal Jacket,'' and his usual adherence to complete secrecy from
the prying public only made people mull over that much more any
morsel of information, regardless of its veracity. (Turns out most
of what leaked out was dead wrong, although the rumored script
would have made a better movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the titillating possibilities offered by watching
Cruise and his wife, Nicole Kidman, playing a married couple locked
in a psychological, erotic drama. Even if it were just a movie, it
seemed a delicious invitation into the lives of one of Hollywood's
most intensely private couples.
</P>
<P>
   But, to borrow from Gertrude Stein, there's no there there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it seems as if Kubrick may have spent too much time on
his decade-long filmmaking hiatus watching Dorothy and the gang
make their way to Emerald City. And lest you think I've spent too
much time in the poppy field, there are several rainbow references
in the film; one woman, seeking a tryst with Cruise, even invites
him to ``go where the rainbow ends.''
</P>
<P>
   So as he makes his way up the neon-splashed Yellow Brick Road of
London _ a poor stand-in for the film's New York setting _ Kidman
is the left-at-home Auntie Em. And as stagnant as her chemistry is
with Cruise on screen, she might as well play his aunt. The
Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion are transformed into any
number of very attractive, very naked women (all the nudity, of
course, is of the female variety: so tired, so trite) escorting
Cruise through his fanciful journey; Sydney Pollack, as one of
Cruise's patients, is Glinda the Good Witch, (well, sort of,
considering his taste for hookers), who helps Cruise see that
everything he's looking for is right in his own backyard, uh,
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   And at the center of it all, hovering just beyond reach, is
Kubrick as the mysterious Wizard _ all smoke and mirrors, rewrites,
and reshoots _ who, as unveiled with his final film, has very
little worth paying attention to behind the curtain.

DAVIS CUP COMPETITION SERVED WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Toni Baume went home speechless but happy. She had
sacrificed her voice for her country, and what more could Australia
ask of a woman?
</P>
<P>
   For three days Toni, the wife of Australian Consul General
Michael Baume, had given new meaning to the term ``siren song.''
Her sturdy soprano, issuing from the first row of Longwood Cricket
Club's south stand, kept piercing the general din of the weekend
Davis Cup series with encouragement and consolation: ``Good on you,
mate! No worries, Aussie!''
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll recover,'' said her less vocal husband as they headed
back to New York. ``But it was worth it.'' She nodded in agreement,
and may have a future winning hog-calling contests in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Australian win on the tennis court made up for a
defeat in Washington and the angry voices raised at home by
President Clinton's upping the tariff on Aussie lamb?
</P>
<P>
   ``Welll . . . '' Baum smiled, ``about that we say, `Baaa,
humbug!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Their flesh-peddling agents will likely tell you that the price
has gone up, too, on Aussie beef, Patrick Rafter and Lleyton
Hewitt. Nothing sheepish about the way those two go for the
jugular. Wolves in short clothing, although Hewitt's baggies
contain enough cloth to make a Marblehead mainsail.
</P>
<P>
   One of his illustrious Davis Cup predecessors, compatriot Roy
Emerson, is amused. Emmo used to cut the pockets out of his shorts
to diminish even the slightest bit of cloth weighted by sweat.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of sweat on or off court during the
feverish clash that brought out the town's appetite for pro tennis.
The sellouts were antidotes to the sound of doldrumming that some
had interpreted as a death rattle for the game in a neighborhood
that stands forth as the fountainhead of American tennis.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the US Tennis Association was wavering on bringing a
Davis Cup series to Boston, afraid that Longwood might not be able
to handle it. Only months ago, as one of the few private clubs
maintaining a foothold in pro tennis, Longwood considered folding
its US Pro tournament, the Aug. 23-29 date on the ATP World Tour.
To the rescue galloped a Boston promoter, Woolf Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm of the weekend and the first-rate cooperative
presentation by Longwood and the USTA appeared to have a
revitalizing effect. Club president Steve Roiter is savoring ``the
feeling that tennis is making a comeback. Our ticket sales for the
US Pro are very favorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is the to-be-continued Jim Courier story. Courier
sat in the locker room Sunday yearning for a Todd Martin victory
over Rafter that would have set up a decisive winner-take-all
battle for him and Hewitt. His call to duty never came. But Jim
will resurface in the Bean for the US Pro, and Martin and Hewitt
are being lobbied. Dominik Hrbaty and Felix Mantilla, French Open
semifinalists this year and last, respectively, have been signed
up, and James Blake, NCAA runner-up in May, is deserting Harvard to
accept a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   When guys the caliber of the Yanks and Aussies, from Sampras and
Rafter throughout, compete so relentlessly, yet uncomplainingly and
respectfully of their foes, you have the essence of what Dwight
Davis envisioned when he sent the grand old crock into circulation
in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The progenitor's charming 85-year-old daughter, Helen Davis
Hermes of West Reading Conn., sweltered joyfully along with
everyone else for three days in an open grandstand. But Sunday
evening, like numerous hackers, she felt it was high time ``I got
back to my own game. Not moving to my left as well these days, but
I'll never stop playing.'' Why should anyone?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Sampras stopped playing singles after Wimbledon
was, of course, costly to the US. Losing to Australia was no
disgrace. However, it was disappointing that Sampras, captain Tom
Gullikson and other team members lost sight of the large picture:
American tennis as a whole. What a tremendous lift victory would
have given the game over here, putting them in the semis against
Russia, and in position to win the whole thing, what with ordinary
France and Belgium in the opposite half.
</P>
<P>
   By going along with Pete's announced plan to confine himself to
doubles, they crippled themselves at that starting gate. It should
have been settled at Wimbledon, where Martin publicly suggested
that Sampras take his place. But thinking doubles-only, Pete didn't
condition himself to labor three straight days. Learning of the
fiery weather forecast, he may also have feared coming apart
somewhere in three matches blanketed by intense heat. His genetic
dysfunction, thalassemia, that can cause anemia, may have undone
him on other occasions when he's been overextended.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless Pete nearly made it into the third day as a
stand-in when the US team physician, Dr. David Altchek, said that
Martin was unfit to play against Rafter. The decision fell to a
Bostonian, Dr. Rich Paul, the International Tennis
Federation-appointed neutral physician, who had final say in the
matter of substitution because of physical impairment.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow Longwood member suggested that Paul might be,
understandably, a homer. ``How is he going to turn down a US
captain trying to put Sampras into the match in the USA? Now that's
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although you can usually find a doctor to certify anything, Paul
didn't choke. He declared Martin able. So Todd was. At least until
he'd toiled mightily for 3 hours and led, 4-2, in the fifth set,
whereupon his legs wobbled, betraying his heart. Hippocrates would
have faxed Dr. Paul, an orthopedic surgeon: ``Your backhand may be
suspect, but you did nothing backhanded.''
</P>
<P>
   This recalls a similar Cup situation in 1974, Romania at Italy
in Mestre. Italy led, 2-1, when the Romanians requested a
substitute for Ion Tiriac. Tiriac, onetime player-coach of the
since-departed Boston Lobsters, may have been a rugged character,
but he was suffering a painful kidney stone attack. The examining
physician, an Italian, naturally turned down the Romanians.
Hobbling about, Tiriac was beaten by Corrado Barazzutti, 6-3, 6-0,
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, proclaiming himself a specialist, said he had
examined Tiriac thoroughly and was highly qualified in such
matters. He was a gynecologist.

ADDO'S UP FOR MATCH AGAINST AJAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Addo should know better than most of his Revolution
teammates what to expect when they meet Ajax Football Club in an
exhibition Wednesday night at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This will be an evaluation game for Addo, 27, who played in the
Dutch League before moving to Ethnikos in Greece, which confirmed
his release Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Addo, 27, is a central defender who appears to have the class,
skill, and speed to complement Dan Calichman and fortify the
Revolution defense for the second half of the MLS season. Addo
might have broken in with a less difficult test, but he is
welcoming the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ajax is one of the best teams in the world,'' Addo said.
``They are changing a lot of players because they weren't happy
with how last season went, so I don't know how they will be. But
they are always well-organized and they always play the same
system. You have to fit into their system to play for them. So you
might be the best player in the world but you won't play for them
if you don't fit into the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's always great to play against Ajax because they play
the ball. They are not in a hurry to score because they know they
will get their chance. They like to possess the ball, and that is
the style I like to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Addo has had little difficulty acclimating to the Revolution. He
has been playing in Europe _ Stuttgart and Frankfurt (Germany),
Sparta Rotterdam (Holland), Belenenses (Portugal), Ethnikos _ and
before that he attended George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. His
friends and teammates have included US national team members Gregg
Berhalter and Claudio Reyna and his collegiate opponents included
US coach Bruce Arena, formerly at the University of Virginia and
D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Arena attempted to bring Addo to D.C. United after the
1996 Olympics, after Addo had helped Ghana advance to the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to come back here and play,'' Addo said. ``I
always take my vacations here and my girlfriend lives in the US. I
know a lot of guys in the MLS and I want to help raise the level of
the league. It's good now, and I think I can help bring more
professionalism and I would love to be a part of the league's
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have come here in 1996 but the contract terms were not
satisfactory then, and I had some other good offers in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Addo hoped to play in Italy and was negotiating with Cagliari
and Padova, but ended up at Castel Di Sangro, recently promoted to
Serie B. He seemed set for the team, but at the last minute was
sent away by coach Osvaldo Jaconi, and became involved in the
recently-published ``The Miracle of Castel Di Sangro'' by Joe
McGinniss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it there and all the players liked me,'' Addo said.
``They saw the skill and professionalism I brought to the team but
all of a sudden I was gone. I was told not to ask any questions. It
wasn't a big deal for me but I would have liked to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than be turned off by his Italian experience, Addo felt
compelled to pursue the chance to play for the Revolution's Italian
coaches, Walter Zenga and Giuseppe Galderisi. He is also
anticipating returning to action for Ghana's national team, coached
by Italian Giuseppe Dossena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 34 caps for Ghana but it was getting hard to go back
and forth to Africa, so I told the coach I needed to concentrate on
playing for a good club,'' Addo said. ``That's what Ghana's other
defenders are doing _ Sammy Kuffour (Bayern Munich), Mohammed Gargo
(Udinese), Alex Nyarko (Lens). The MLS standard is good enough,
plus the coaches here have European professional experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Ghana is known for the high skill level of its players,
the country has never qualified for the World Cup finals. Addo was
among the first from his country to receive a chance to play in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in the streets, scraping my elbows and knees, and
didn't have a pair of shoes until I was 14,'' Addo said. ``But we
always knew how to play. We only need to stop the corruption, and
an African country will win the World Cup someday.''

VICTORY A THRILL FOR BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boys from Brazil are back. A year after their disappointing
France '98 World Cup final, the Brazilians captured the Copa
America title with a 3-0 victory over Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries went with revamped, young teams as a buildup to
World Cup 2002 qualifying. Uruguay went a step further, fielding a
team of local players under coach Victor Pua, who is scheduled to
cede the job to Argentine Daniel Passarella. But the surprising
finish by the Uruguayans raised the stock of both Pua and the
young, unknown players. Uruguay continues to produce dozens of
top-level professionals despite being the smallest country in the
South American Confederation.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil coach Wanderley Luxemburgo also went in a new direction.
Though the names are familiar _ Rivaldo and Ronaldo, top scorers in
the tournament with five goals; defenders Cafu and Roberto Carlos;
midfielders Emerson, Flavio Conceicao, Ze Roberto _ this is still a
relatively young squad.
</P>
<P>
   Rivaldo, suspended after being red-carded against Mexico early
in the tournament, scored twice in the final in Asuncion and his
performance was compared to Zinedine Zidane's in the World Cup
final. Zidane had been suspended for two games but returned to
score twice in a 3-0 victory for France over Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The result also contributed to Brazil's continuing campaign to
make up for its incredible defeat against Uruguay in the 1950 World
Cup final, the only time the tournament has been held in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the new campaigns start.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil will begin its World Cup 2002 quest with a home match
against Ecuador in March. The qualifying tournament format has been
changed to a one-group, home-and-away round-robin, meaning South
American countries will be playing 18 qualifiers, twice as many as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   And, this week Brazil is sending a group of former World Cup
champion captains to FIFA headquarters in Zurich to bid for the
2006 World Cup finals. The tournament has not been held in South
America since Argentina '78 and will not likely return until a
later date, but this is a political move designed to keep the
continent on the agenda with FIFA's powerful European members.
</P>
<P>
   After Brazil won the USA '94 tournament, it was pointed out to
Julio Grondona, president of the Associacion del Futbol Argentino,
that South America had a disproportionate number of finalists _
five out of 10 members. Grondona replied: ``Our continent has won
eight World Cups, and no continent has won more. That is why we
deserve to have that many places.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bolivia and Brazil are preparing for the
anti-climactic Confederations Cup. Brazil opens the tournament
against Germany Saturday, then meets the US July 28 in Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia's Argentine coach, Hector Veira, called the tournament
``a truly crazy thing'' because his team will play three games in 4
1/2 days. Even the host country, Mexico, threatened to pull out of
the event as its players protested the suspension of Paulo Cesar
Chavez and Raul Rodrigo Lara after they tested positive for an
anabolic steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Only the underdogs _ Egypt, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, the US _
appear to be taking the event seriously.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   College try not enough
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Title IX was good for soccer while it lasted. But the
Educational Amendments Act of 1972 can only take the game so far.
Other countries have nearly caught up to the US women's national
team in less than a decade by bypassing any equivalent of Title IX
and simply promoting the game on the club level.
</P>
<P>
   If Brazil and China continue to improve at this rate, the US
will have to take a harder look at its development system.
</P>
<P>
   Collegiate programs will always struggle to prepare athletes for
high-level professional soccer _ unless the hypocrisy of the system
is acknowledged and modified.
</P>
<P>
   In the US, collegiate sports are virtually professional in
everything but name. If collegiate sports teams were allowed to
compete outside their bailiwick, some interesting results might
occur. For instance, they could enter teams in the US Open Cup
competition. Maybe they could provide an upset, as the Mid Michigan
Bucks nearly did in a 2-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Mutiny, and as the
Staten Island Vipers did in a 3-2 overtime victory over the
MetroStars last week.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no room for 19th-century notions of amateurs being
tainted by professionalism in the next century. FIFA dispensed with
that by establishing the World Cup as a global soccer tournament
outside the Olympics in 1930. Soccer has the capacity to continue
to show the way.

SPEED KING? IT'S `TRUE'
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Yes It's True, a 3-year-old, established himself as the top
sprinter in the country when he captured the $300,000 DeFrancis
Dash at Laurel Saturday, defeating older rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The DeFrancis Dash is one of the few Grade I sprints and marked
the sixth win this year for Yes It's True, a son of Is It True. All
of his tallies have come in graded sprint events. Ridden by Jerry
Bailey, Yes It's True sat third off a speed duel in the DeFrancis,
then rallied four-wide into the stretch to outfinish Good And Tough
and prevail by three-quarters of a length at odds of 7-10 ($3.40 to
win). The time of 1:08 3/5 for 6 furlongs was just three ticks off
the track record.
</P>
<P>
   Good And Tough, a top 4-year-old who won the Suffolk Downs
Breeders' Cup May 29, had to give Yes It's True 9 pounds under the
allowance conditions, 123 to 114, making the task of the 17-10
second choice most dificult. Good And Tough came up the rail under
Shane Sellers, but he wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Yes It's True is trained by D. Wayne Lukas, who will be inducted
into the Hall of Fame at Saratoga Aug. 9, and Lukas is going
straight for the Eclipse Award with the bay colt, who is owned by
the Padua Stables of Satish Sanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go on and win the championship with him,'' said
Lukas. ``He's a great physical specimen, and he truly typifies what
a great sprinter should be. He has the ability to adjust to
different surfaces every time. We've really been enjoying the
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanan bought Yes It's True, who was a $200,000 yearling, for
$800,00 as a 2-year-old in training, and Yes It's True gave Sanan
his first Grade I victory. Yes It's True was an outstanding
2-year-old, as long as the distances were short. He came into the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs with a record of 8-5-2-1,
but the mile and one-16th was too much for him, and he faded to
11th after setting the pace. This year, Yes It's True won the Swale
at Gulfstream, and the Lafyette at Keeneland, but his flirtation
with the Triple Crown events ended when he couldn't even handle the
flat mile of the Kentucky Derby Trial, finishing fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who was in the process of training Charismatic to victory
in the Derby and Preakness, recognized he had a pure sprinter on
his hands, and entered Yes It's True in the Maryland Breeders' Cup
Handicap, on the Preakness undercard at Pimlico. That is the race
made famous when a man walked on the track and interfered with the
stretch run, but the intruder's actions didn't affect Yes It's
True, who was clear on the fence and sailing to an easy victory.
Yes It's True ran right past the man, who then impeded the horses
battling for second.
</P>
<P>
   Yes It's True proceeded from there to take the Riva Ridge at
Belmont June 5, and Jersey Shore at Monmouth June 19. He has a
record of 17-11-2-2, and has earned more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Reraise, the top sprinter in California who won the $1 million
Breeders' Cup Sprint last year, was recently retired to injury, and
Kelly Kip, winner of the 1998 Suffolk Breeders' Cup, generally
regarded as the fastest horse in the East, is also battling
injuries and may be finished, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yes It's True now stands alone atop the division, and Lukas has
already laid out a clear path for him. Next will be the A
Phenomenon at Saratoga Aug. 11, followed by the King's Bishop at
The Spa Aug. 28, and the Vosburgh at Belmont Sept. 25. That will
put Yes It's True within hailing distance of the Breeders' Cup at
Gulfstream Park Nov. 6, which will likely decide the trophy winner.

   Silver Charm and Charismatic, the two horses who just missed
winning the Triple Crown for owners Bob and Beverly Lewis have been
assigned to stud. Silver Charm, age 5, will go to Three Chimneys in
Midway, Ky., and stand for $25,000; while Charismatic, 3, will go
to Lane's End, in Versailles, Ky., and stand for $35,000. ``We're
extremely pleased to have our near Triple Crown winner standing
alongside noted Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew,'' said Bob Lewis
of Silver Charm . . . Buck's Boy, last year's Eclipse Award-winning
turf horse who has not run since winning the $2 million Breeders'
Cup Turf in November, has arrived at trainer Noel Hickey's barn at
Hawthorne after recovering from a stomach ailment. ``He was sent to
me in Florida in mid-January,'' said Hickey. ``A few weeks later,
he developed an abscess in his stomach, and I took him out of
training. (Owner) George Bunn wanted him back at his farm in
Illinois, and he has been there ever since. I understand he has
been in training for the last 65 days.'' Hickey has yet to devise a
game plan for Buck's Boy, but hopes he will be able to defend his
Breeders' Cup championship . . . Val's Prince, a prominent grass
horse last year before fracturing his left front sesamoid while
finishing second in the Sword Dancer in August, returned to the
races with a second-place finish in an allowance at Belmont Friday.
``He underwent surgery, and the doctors also removed an old chip
that he had in his right front ankle,'' said trainer Jimmy Picou.
``He proved that he's a tough racehorse, and we've got big plans
for him.'' Picou hopes to start Val's Prince, age 7, in the Sword
Dancer (Aug. 14) again, then go on to the Turf Classic at Belmont
Oct. 9.

   Tom Durkin, the popular voice of the New York Racing Association
and the Breeders' Cup, has resigned from calling the races at
Gulfstream Park. Durkin's move comes shortly after the volatile
Frank Stronach purchased the Hallendale, Fla., track for $95
million. ``Only about 5 percent of my decision had to do with
that,'' said Durkin, who had called at Gulfstream for five years.
``I had only planned to work at Gulfstream one more year, and I
felt, with the change in administration, that it would have looked
bad for everybody if I had resigned after just one season. Leaving
Gulfstream will allow me more time to focus attention on my two
most important professional priorities, New York racing and the
Breeders' Cup. Equally important, the lighter work load will allow
me more time at home in New York, and more time for personal
development.'' No word yet on who might succeed Durkin, but Larry
Colmus, who calls at Suffolk and Monmouth, is one of the best in
the country.

A CYNICAL LOOK AT AMERICAN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT L. TURNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE NEW PRINCE 
By Dick Morris 
Renaissance Books, 256 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reviewer approaches Dick Morris's new book with caution, as
one would a mangy dog. Is it clean? Is it dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Prince,'' it turns out, is even scruffier than it
looks, but its contents are essentially harmless _ except in the
unlikely event that anyone would take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Appearances count. The cheesy faux-parchment cover of the book
is adorned with an enormous faux-Florentine ``P'' giving the
impression of a put-on. Can it be that this hurried book from
President Clinton's infamous political manipulator is just for
laughs? No, the cover promises a serious tract ``in the spirit of
Machiavelli's classic work on statecraft and government'' written
by the great Italian's ``modern equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   What the book delivers is a deeply cynical perspective on
American politics from its most notoriously sleazy practitioner.
Morris says essentially that the way to lead is to give the people
what they want. Every president, governor and mayor, he says,
``needs a popular majority every day in his term.'' The way to
achieve this is simple: Take polls, and follow them.
</P>
<P>
   One variation on this theme: women candidates, according to
Morris, ``should be Thatcheresque in their positions on crime,
taxes and defense.'' It matters not, apparently, what these women
candidates might believe. A ``leader's'' own goals can become a
factor, but only if carefully circumscribed and packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers may suffer a twinge of sympathy for Morris because
it seems his book could not have had an editor. Many high schoolers
can write better _ at least 42 grammatical and syntactical gaffes
clog his text. And a sixth-grader knows to avoid cliches _ or at
least if one seems necessary, then don't repeat it _ certainly not
six times in 150 pages, as Morris does with Thoreau's ``different
drummer.'' Slapdash Dick didn't bother to check the spelling of
Democratic consultant Bob Beckel (``Bekel'') or US Senator George
Voinovich (``Voinivitch'').
</P>
<P>
   It might be possible to overlook slips, but Morris's
contradictions and factual errors too often make a hash of what is
supposed to be his argument. He says President Clinton's 1994
health care initiative failed partly because it was too bold, but
has ``happened incrementally'' since. This will be news to the 4
million more persons who are uninsured today. Likewise, he says
that national student testing was defeated when the proposal called
for mandatory tests, but says this changed when Clinton agreed to
voluntary tests. Wrong again: Republicans, including Morris client
Trent Lott, have killed all national test proposals.
</P>
<P>
   And what lesson is the reader to draw from Morris's views of one
modern president? He writes, ``Harry Truman did an inestimable
disservice to politics by popularizing the notion that the public
likes a feisty candidate who `gives 'em hell.' They don't. Voters
feel such candidates are irresponsible, negative windbags who don't
have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Six pages later: ``As Truman gained popularity, his feistiness,
aggressiveness, willingness to speak plainly, and his tendency to
`give 'em hell' endeared him to voters. A new form of charisma
attached itself to his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Patient readers will find a few sensible nuggets. Morris
observes that both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Al Gore have enlarged
the roles of their jobs, perhaps permanently, while the national
parties continue to diminish their own roles. And Morris is right
in saying the press would perform a valuable service if it took
more seriously its function in policing campaigns. Still, nothing
is insightful enough to take attention away from Morris's inane
attempts at self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Most galling is the passing reference he makes to his tawdry
role in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. When Clinton called as the
story broke, Morris writes, ``I urged him to consider telling the
truth.'' Yet several accounts, including the report of Kenneth
Starr, whose office took grand jury testimony from Morris, give a
different story. After taking a quick survey for Clinton, Starr
reported, ``Mr. Morris explained that the poll results suggested
that the president should not go public with a confession or
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   The book does not deserve actual comparison with ``The Prince.''
Suffice it to say the Machiavelli is entertaining to read and
offers both wisdom and heart along with his steely advice _ all
beyond Morris's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Tossed in at the end of ``The New Prince'' is a snapshot of a
tubby Morris looking very small in front of Machiavelli's tomb in
Florence. Read Morris's book and he'll become even smaller.

THE EVOLUTION OF `DEVOLUTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the time, devolution trots onstage to play a sober
geopolitical role _ describing the transfer of powers, for example,
from the United Kingdom to local governments in Scotland, Wales,
and Northern Ireland. But devolution (along with its verb form,
devolve) has a lighter side, too. We use it to suggest our species
is losing its grip on civilization, or vice versa: ``White tie and
tails have all but vanished from the fund-raising scene here, which
is as lamentable a devolution of style as can be imagined,'' wrote
the Globe's John Robinson in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is amused. Skip Ascheim, a Globe correspondent
who writes about theater, puts the jocular devolve first on his
list of bugbears, above comprise for compose, reticent for
reluctant, and nonplused for blase. These are bad enough, he
writes, but ``particularly grotesque'' is using of devolve ``as if
it meant de-evolve _ assuming there is such a concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Does this devolve deserve to be deep-sixed? First, the short
answer: History is on its side. Devolution, meaning degeneration,
surfaces in an 1882 citation in the Oxford English Dictionary: ``If
there be e-volution, there surely is de-volution, a degradation of
the species.'' The meaning is still current in Webster's 3rd
unabridged dictionary (1961), which gives ``retrograde evolution''
as a definition of devolution. And a mere 17 years later, along
comes the rock group Devo, short for devolution _ the band's
``dystopian notion of backward progress,'' as one reporter
summarized it.
</P>
<P>
   So the popular senses of devolve and devolution have been with
us for more than a century. There is, indeed, such a concept _ but
do you want it in your vocabulary?
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends partly on what you think of evolution. Long
before Darwin, the word _ whose root meaning is ``unroll, roll
out'' _ had a variety of meanings related to unfolding or
development, whether of organisms or logical arguments. As
evolutionary theory was refined, these older meanings marched
alongside the newer ones: Darwin himself referred to ``the gradual
evolution of the young animal or plant from its egg or seed.'' But
evolution by natural selection was something else entirely, and
unlike the growth of a chicken from an egg, it did not imply any
kind of progress.
</P>
<P>
   So strictly speaking, for Stephen Jay Gould and his colleagues
in the evolution game, there is no ``devolution.'' Organisms adapt
or die out, and some adapt in more complex ways than others, but
things don't get better or worse by evolving; they just get
different. If the Earth's conditions changed to favor survival of
the less sapient members of Homo sapiens, the species might flunk
 &UR; today &LR; 's SATs, but evolution would call it a success.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us, though, don't speak strictly about evolution.
Whether we think human beings were planted atop the Great Chain of
Being by God, like the couple on a wedding cake, or are _ like all
other surviving species _ the result of random events, we feel as
if we're on top of the world. That image of our long climb from the
primordial slime is as powerful as any creation myth, and here we
are, with our Miatas and our laptops and our own sweet selves;
science or no, it sure looks like progress. So we joke about whose
whose husband is ``more evolved'' _ that is, more sensitive and
egalitarian, further removed from his caveperson forebears _ even
if we know doing the laundry is probably neither adaptive nor
maladaptive in evolutionary terms.
</P>
<P>
   In the past couple of decades, such casual usage has spread _ a
story of a failure is headlined ``Devolution of a Deli,''
restaurant sauces and Garry Shandling are both described as ``very
evolved.'' Whatever it means _ and sometimes you wonder _ evolved
is clearly a compliment in everyday lingo, if not in science.
</P>
<P>
   Should we try to stamp out these usages? Well, science has a
defense for our imprecision about scientific concepts. Humankind,
says psycholinguist Steven Pinker, occupies ``the cognitive niche''
of the local habitat; we're clever enough to overcome our
deficiencies in other realms (smell, strength, and so on), and thus
we consider our deficiencies trivial. If we persist in talking as
if we're evolution's top dogs, that's because we evolved to think
that way; we're metaphor-making animals as well as reasoning
animals. And some days, even in an age of science, we find we need
the metaphors more.

TWA'S ICY SIDE REMAINS INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here it is the middle of July, the heart of what should be a
carefree summer, and death hangs in the air like a cloud bank too
heavy to be blown out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. is gone before we ever really knew what he
might become. His graceful wife and her accomplished sister died
with him. They crashed on the same weekend that, three years ago,
TWA Flight 800 exploded in its ascent over the shores of Long
Island, a calamity that nags even now.
</P>
<P>
   TWA is an airline, in short, that refuses to get things right.
Recall their actions in the aftermath of the July 17, 1996,
explosion of the 747 jet bound from John F. Kennedy Airport to
Paris that killed all 230 passengers and crew on board.
</P>
<P>
   The company's CEO was nowhere to be seen. When he did appear in
New York the day after the tragedy, he spoke for less than a minute
and abruptly left without answering questions or spending time with
the families.
</P>
<P>
   TWA didn't notify some families of the dead until 36 hours after
the explosion. Its toll-free information line was so understaffed
that frantic callers couldn't get through for hours, and when they
did, were offered no information about passenger identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seven members of my family trying to get through,'' said
Frank Carven, a Maryland lawyer whose sister and nephew died. ``It
took from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. to get through, and then I was put on
hold for 20 minutes. And the person on the other end was just
taking information. They kept saying, `I don't have that
information. I don't have that information. We'll get back to you.'
And of course, they never did.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was, in the words of some management consultants at
the time, a case study in how not to react to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And the problems have continued over the years. When TWA
hurriedly planned a group memorial service for 15 passengers whose
remains could not be found, burying empty caskets in a Long Island
plot, families fumed.
</P>
<P>
   When TWA reluctantly agreed to fly family members to New York in
1997 for the first anniversary of the tragedy, executives initially
asked passengers to sign liability waivers in case of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold and cruel,'' Carven said Monday. ``That's been how
they've dealt with us all along.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, as the long investigation winds to an uncertain
completion, TWA is at it again. As families struggle with their
loss on the anniversary of far too many deaths, TWA is fighting a
request that it pay some of the exorbitant costs of warehousing the
wreckage of its downed plane.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jim Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, publicly complained that TWA shirked federal requests
to contribute to the costs of recovering the plane's scattered
wreckage at sea and storing it during the investigation. The
government has paid $4.5 million a year to keep the reconstructed
wreckage at an aircraft plant in Calverton, N.Y. The cause of the
explosion is believed to be a mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They refused to participate at all, even though we
requested,'' Hall told reporters. To back up his point, he made
public a 1996 letter he sent to TWA requesting $5 million in
assistance, and he also produced TWA's letter of rejection. He
indicated that airlines have helped with such costs in the past.
</P>
<P>
   TWA executives have their reasons, and most of them probably
have to do with the company's finances. It was once one of the
premier international airlines in the world, the lone rival of Pan
Am. But now the company has been in and out of bankruptcy for
years, its stock is currently trading near a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was wholly inappropriate for TWA or any airline or
any private party to contribute to a congressionally funded
investigation,'' TWA spokesman Jim Brown said Monday. He said that
a private contribution might be perceived as having unduly
influenced the course of a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Of the recovery costs, Brown said that because the plane was
lost at sea, aviation law doesn't require the airline to pay for
the search and collection of wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remain over who now owns the plane and what will be
done with it when the investigation ends. Brown said, ``They've had
that wreckage for so long that we consider them to have ownership
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   How typically thoughtful. Tragedy brings out the best in some,
the worst in others _ a lesson to remember in a week when mourning
will be the way of the world.

COSMO'S LITTLE SISTER DOWNPLAYS S-E-X 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   X-rated board games. Man-melting sex moves. Women who snag
celebrity husbands. Cosmopolitan magazine has covered it all for
women since the liberating '60s. Now _ in a new crusade _ the racy
monthly is targeting teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Magazines, Cosmo's publisher, recently unveiled
CosmoGIRL!, a ``spunky kid sister'' magazine aimed at 12- to
17-year-olds. ``We are taking the original Cosmo formula created by
Helen Gurley Brown and adapting it for the teenage girl,'' says
Cathleen P. Black, Hearst president.
</P>
<P>
   What? A teen 'zine version of headlines like July's ``Sex Tricks
He's Never Seen Before'' and ``5 Perfect Pickup Lines''?
</P>
<P>
   Relax. As a little sister, CosmoGIRL! is decidedly virginal. The
first issue _ for August/September _ features a modest covergirl
(actress Melissa Joan Hart) in minimal makeup, a non-revealing tank
top, and khakis. Even her bellybutton is covered by a headline. The
stories are no more daring. Consider: ``Back-to-School Fashion
Blitz;'' ``The One Thing That Really Bugs Guys;'' and ``How to Get
an Easy A.'' The word orgasm appears only once, in a Dr. Ruth
column.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did our research, we found out that girls are very
embarrassed by sex stories. They don't want to read about it,''
says CosmoGIRL! editor Atoosa Rubenstein. ``We certainly will cover
sex as a health issue. But we're not about advice or anything else
on that topic. . . . I want it to be known that we are definitely
Cosmo's little sister but not in the way some people assume.''
</P>
<P>
   Why bother with a typical teen magazine at a time when
newsstands are filled with competitors like Teen People, Twist,
Girl, Jump, Seventeen, YM and Teen? Economics. Black says teenagers
in the United States spent, or encouraged their parents to spend,
almost $125 billion in 1998. ``This is a growing market and the
time is right for us to introduce this title,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein says CosmoGIRL! stands out because of its connection
to the legendary Cosmopolitan and its focus on the ``inner girl.''
``A lot of other magazines focus on the outer girl _ fashion and
beauty,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to the reader about every relationship in her life.
Her changing body. The new way boys might be treating her. Issues
with her parents, other girls, popularity, self-esteem. I want to
address the language barrier that comes between mom and daughter.
When mom says she doesn't like your pants, it's not because she
hates you. My goal is to step in there as a big sister and give
them advice. I'm young enough to understand where they're at,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at 27, Rubenstein remembers her experiences growing up
on Long Island very well. In a nutshell: high school was miserable.
``I really felt it couldn't have gotten any worse. At camp, boys
beat me up. I didn't go to my prom. I took a job at Carvel's just
because I needed something to do the night of the prom. My friends
butted me out of conversations. Why? Because girls can be mean,''
she says, adding quietly, ``I think I'm going to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   In her editor's letter, Rubenstein describes herself as ``the
biggest loser in school. . . . I had the hairiest legs (Mom
wouldn't let me shave), the worst skin . . . and a Pinocchio nose.
. . . I could barely get the crossing guard to be nice to me, much
less get a date!'' The editor then points out her extremely bushy
eyebrows in an accompanying photo of her at 15 years old. ``Nice
eyebrows, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein majored in political science at Barnard College in
the early '90s. She interned at Sassy magazine before being hired
as a fashion assistant by Gurley Brown after graduation in 1993.
After that, she served in various roles as a fashion editor. When
Hearst conceived of CosmoGIRL!, Kate White, Cosmo's editor,
recommended Rubenstein for the job, much to her amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little pipsqueak of a girl who never believed in
herself. When I met with the president of the company, all I kept
saying was `What am I doing here with you?' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubenstein has signed on to the mission. Surrounded by a
staff of 20-somethings (and one 30-year-old), she works 16-hour
days sometimes, honing ideas like a money page that recommends ways
to make more money babysitting (teach the kids how to use the Web)
or how to turn a Sweet-16 $500 gift into $1,000 (invest in a mutual
fund).
</P>
<P>
   Her first issue profiled a teenaged entrepreneur, eating
disorder activists, and five girls who survived hardships and
changed their fates. ``These stories need to be heard,'' she says.
``When things are (bad), as we know they can be in teen life, it's
good to have these role models.''
</P>
<P>
   CosmoGIRL! hit newstands June 29 with an initial print run of
850,000. Two additional issues are expected in 1999. ``There's
nothing firm planned for 2000,'' says Rubenstein. ``We have our
fingers crossed.''

FILM BASED ON TRAGIC ROLE OF UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Almighty drug lord is hooked into most of the city's
hard-core crime. Heroic undercover agent vows to bring him down by
infiltrating the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer helps undo the ruthless gangsta but pays a
heavy price _ tearing his soul in the eternal struggle faced by
undercover cops who try to preserve their identity while
play-acting as hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
   It's the stuff of pure Hollywood, and it's coming to a theater
near you next month, in a Miramax film called ``In Too Deep''
starring Omar Epps, Pam Grier, Stanley Tucci, and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, as they say in Tinseltown, partly ``inspired'' by
one of the most searing real-life cop dramas this city has known:
Boston undercover operative Jeffrey Coy's final mission to topple
drug kingpin Darryl Whiting, a man whose power was reflected in a
nickname that even Hollywood chose not to top: ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-screenwriters/producers Paul Aaron (``A Force of One'') and
Michael Henry Brown (``Dead Presidents'') said they have produced a
contemporary Jekyll-and-Hyde police story that will scorch the
silver screen with the edgy reality of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In their good-triumphs-over-evil version, hero cop Jeffrey Cole
(Omar Epps) recaptures his own life after capturing Dwayne ``God''
Gittens, played in a projected breakthrough role by rapper/actor LL
Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   In the hauntingly true tale of Boston's undercover operator,
Jeffrey Coy emerged from his deep cover assignment _ which helped
send Whiting to prison for life _ financially broke and emotionally
spent. In 1994, at age 33, he committed suicide by hanging himself
from a belt slung over his bedroom door.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Coy says he fears that the upcoming celluloid story
will not serve as an everlasting epitaph, but it could be the final
indignity to a man who spent his last days unsuccesfully trying to
sell to moviemakers an authentic portrayal of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Jones, former chief of the Boston Housing Authority
police who launched Coy's undercover career, said he worries that
Hollywood's penchant for rewriting history might do a disservice to
Coy's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was an opportunity for him to become financially
stable, and in the long term his life would have been depicted in a
way that gave value and creedence to all the work he had done in
trying to make a difference,'' said Jones, who now serves as a
national consultant on community reinvestment.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron (Keanu Reeves's stepfather) said he had picked Coy's brain
about undercover work for several days after first reading a news
story about the case. Then he and Brown melded Coy's experiences
with those of undercover operatives in Los Angeles and New York,
and came up with a composite character that could be compared to a
sort of ``Serpico of the 'hood.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is set in Cincinnati, not Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the Jeff Coy story,'' Aaron said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said that because Coy died before the movie deal was
clinched, he did not receive any financial compensation for his
input, but might have had he lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``His death was a loss not only to Boston police,'' Aaron said,
``but to lots of people who may have been able to understand the
life of a cop better if he had been allowed to'' illuminate it.
</P>
<P>
   The promo for ``In Too Deep'' breathlessly describes the dilemma
of undercover detective Jeffrey Cole: ``Will he be able to separate
himself from the character he created after the mission is
finished, or will he lose himself in the same evil he hopes to
destroy? Now, with every friend he makes and every threat he faces,
he's getting one step closer to the man he's after, and one step
further from the man he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Coy found his identity as a religious and righteous
police officer overtaken by Jay Reed, the ruthless Rhode Island
drug dealer he'd adopted as his undercover alias.
</P>
<P>
   During nearly five years of undercover work, Coy had a gun
thrust into his chest in the Franklin Field housing complex, a
knife put to his throat at Orchard Park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, federal authorities recruited Coy to complete the
assignment he'd started under Jones: to infiltrate the organization
of Whiting, who'd come from New York and maneuvered to unite the
city's youth gangs into a drug-dealing force.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Jay Reed, Coy made undercover buys of cocaine, witnessed
money-laundering, and pistol-whipped a guy to avert suspicions that
he was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   But after eight months, Coy was pulled off the case. He was in
too deep: Holed up in an undercover apartment protected by actual
wolves, he snorted coke and swallowed Valium, trying to chase away
post-traumatic stress flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   He was also arrested for assaulting a police officer following
an altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a year of psychotherpay, Coy declared himself whole.
But he had trouble finding work that could be fulfilling to a man
whose star testimony helped defeat ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his last jobs: surveilling shoplifters at a Somerville
Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking redemption, Coy developed his own script about an
undercover cop. He hoped to star in the movie. But in 1994, Coy
rewrote the ending: He hung himself, fading his life to black.

FOR GOOD TELEVISION, SIGN UP FOR HBO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ About five or so years ago my wife and I
ditched HBO. There was nothing really to watch, except for the same
movies over and over and over.
</P>
<P>
   We must not have been the only ones. Not much later HBO set out
in a ``definitely conscious'' effort to crank out more original
series, chairman and chief executive Jeff Bewkes told a gathering
of television critics last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago we set out to dramatically increase what we
could hopefully find in series,'' Bewkes said. ``We were looking
for the hour drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to this past spring. When the largest-grossing
movie of all time splashes across your television screen, it's big
news. But when HBO hosted the cable premiere in April of
``Titanic,'' it was not even close to the networks' most shining
moment of the season. Which, to HBO, was great news.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the premium movie outlet has now become the home
to premium series. Not fair series. Not good. Not very good. Great
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oz.'' ``Sex and the City.'' ``Arli$$.'' The late ``Larry
Sanders Show.'' ``Real Sports.'' Not a dog in the bunch. Can any
network make such a claim? Did we miss any? Oh yeah, just the best
show on television: ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the original movies, often good to stellar, as
well as first-time-on-television theater films. Although HBO costs
extra, it has become basic that cable viewers should shell out the
bucks. Once considered an overvalued luxury, HBO is riding a wave
that should make it the artistic envy of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it feels like a high-water mark,'' Bewkes said.
</P>
<P>
   HBO really has two seasons: summer, when shows like ``Oz'' and
``Sex and the City'' start up, and January (``The Sopranos'').
</P>
<P>
   This past week HBO highlighted special events coming up in the
fall, including Cher live in concert, and original movies like
``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge''; ``RKO 281,'' about the making of
the legendary movie ``Citizen Kane''; and ``Witness Protection,''
starring Forrest Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' justifiably a critics' fave, fell into HBO's
lap after Fox took a pass on the original script from David Chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get sent every busted script, every busted pilot,'' said
Chris Albrecht, president of HBO original programming. But Albrecht
said Chase rewrote the script for HBO. Added were the edgier
sensibilities (vulgarities, nudity) that is out of bounds even for
out-there Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did for Fox did not take full advantage of what he
could do for HBO,'' Albrecht said. Being a premium cable outlet
gives producers for HBO latitude that does not exist elsewhere. For
one, the absence of commercials allows more of a movie feel rather
than the traditional four-act, television drama.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the network is able to air shows with obscenities and
nudity, which in context allow for greater dramatic effect. Hey,
Tony Soprano needs to curse.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, HBO shoots most of its series on film, as opposed to
video before a live audience, a more expensive proposition but one
that gives its shows a distinct feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our mission ... is to do something different on
HBO,'' Bewkes said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year my wife and I did something different, too. We signed
up for HBO again.

JUDGING THE CELLUCCI BENCH: MUCH EXPERIENCE, LITTLE DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Governor Paul Cellucci's 34 choices for new
judgeships, for the most part, have been a lot like him: non-Ivy
League, white, male, with years on end of practicing
bread-and-butter law in small towns, dabbling in politics, and
living in Central and Western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern, unintentional or not, is subtly changing the face
of the state's courts from one that looked like his predecessor,
William F. Weld, who had a penchant for appointing federal
prosecutors, academicians, or those with blood as blue as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Weld, while Michael S. Dukakis was governor,
Massachusetts was reputed to have a state judiciary that was
unusually well-tutored in legal theory.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's appointees, however, generally have more hands-on
experience than legal scholarship. His prototypical selection
offers a possible glimpse at two high-impact Supreme Judicial Court
appointments he will make by the end of the summer, from more than
three dozen resumes.
</P>
<P>
   While many in the legal community have praised the governor's
choices to other courts, saying they are seasoned judges who
understand people and the system, others see potential downsides
should the pattern hold for the SJC _ which Cellucci has a rare
opportunity to remake.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, his choices for the bench have hardly been
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the judicial files shows that less than a quarter of
the 34 new appointments were female. Two were black, and one was
Hispanic _ and they were named just before the election last
November, when diversity was a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   And with nearly half of the justices coming from communities
west of Inteerstate 495, some are questioning whether
accomplishments matter as much as connections and associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not plugged in . . . there are a lot of doors that
are still closed,'' said June Miles, a Dukakis-appointed justice at
Boston Juvenile Court and president of the 30-plus-member
Massachusetts Black Judges Conference, which represents a small
fraction of the state's 400 judges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, eight of Cellucci's selections have held political
jobs, including Thomas J. Curley Jr., a member of the Massachusetts
Turnpike Authority board. At least one, Diane E. Moriarty, ran for
office, specifically mayor of Boston. Another, David B. Locke, is
the son of former Senate Republican leader David Locke.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph I. Macy, appointed to Taunton District Court, contributed
$13,000 in three years to Republican party causes, prompting a few
people who scrutinized his qualifications to question whether he
was trying to buy a judgeship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being involved in politics . . . doesn't hurt you,'' said
Ralph Boyd Jr., a member of the Judicial Nominating Committee and
an attorney at Goodwin Procter &AMP; Hoar.
</P>
<P>
   However, party affiliation does not appear to be an issue when
judicial candidates are winnowed out. Of the GOP governor's 34
justices, 19 are registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   More than party registration, Cellucci culls from district
attorneys' offices for ``judges who are going to apply the law, not
judges who are going to make law from the bench,'' said his
spokeswoman, Ilene Hoffer. ``And he looks for law-and-order types,
people with a background of putting victims' rights and concerns at
the top of their agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld had similar prosecutorial inclinations, although his
choices often came from the US attorney's office in Boston, which
he ran for years before making the leap into politics. He is now a
member of the New York firm of McDermott Will &AMP; Emery.
</P>
<P>
   It is not lost on many practicing lawyers that some of Weld's
lower court appointments, yanked from big law firms, were stunned
to discover they had to do their own typing when they became
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's picks may not be as surprised, or as annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   And so lawyers are warmly greeting the subtle shift in judicial
personnel under Cellucci, although many like the Weld picks, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For lawyers, they want judges who have been in a courtroom and
know how it operates,'' said Benjamin Fierro 3d of Lynch &AMP; Fierro
of Boston. ``I think the broader view is Paul Cellucci was an
active lawyer who practiced in the courts. . . . Bill Weld, I
wonder if he ever stepped foot in the state courts until he became
governor. Less so with ideology, but I think their backgrounds and
experiences may be reflected in their appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Boston College Law School, Cellucci, the
son of an immigrant car dealer, practiced family law at the small
Marlborough firm of Kittredge, Cellucci and Moreira. He settled
divorces, estates, and other issues before judges in the Worcester
area for 17 years, also serving in the Legislature for most of that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Grounded in that life experience, Cellucci admits a preference
for lawyers who work hard to get where they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like people who have had to overcome some adversity and
stuck with it,'' the governor said recently. ``I think they become
very good role models and very good judges. I certainly have worked
my way up the ladder. I don't think anyone can deny that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming up the hard way is a theme among many of his judicial
appointments. Although 27 of them passed the bar exam on the first
try, six of them took it twice, and one succeeded on her third
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while the premier law schools are represented on the
judges' resumes, not one has graduated from an Ivy League law
school. (That may change soon. Last week, Cellucci nominated Leila
Kern, a cum laude Harvard Law alumna.) Suffolk Law, Boston College,
and Western New England College School of Law have issued most of
the diplomas to this crop of judges.
</P>
<P>
   But they have much experience. On average, the new judges had
been lawyers for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll probably see there's more people who worked in
a district attorney's office, been a public defender, worked in the
community,'' Cellucci said. ``I think you might see that more often
than you'll see someone from a top-notch law firm. That doesn't
mean we don't appoint people from top notch lawfirms . . . but I
like life experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana L. Maldonado, who was appointed to Chelsea District Court
last year, might fit the prototype.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of 10 children, Maldonado grew up in the South
Bronx. Her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. She went to
public schools, graduated from the State University of New York at
Stony Brook, and got her law degree from Northeastern University in
1985. The 40-year-old has spent much of her career as a public
defender.
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado, one of Cellucci's three minorty selections, says she
got the judgeship the old-fashioned way: She applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't the blueblood. I wasn't someone who had the best
education or background. And I think he was willing to say, this
person shows comitment,'' she said recently. ``I think he's really
looking for people who bring a lot to the job, not just by their
academic background. I'm impressed by that, actually. And I think
it makes the lawyers respect the process more.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Maldonado, who has had to jump in as the courtroom
Spanish interpreter when none is available, said there still are
not enough minorities on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think more can be done,'' she said. ``Just because
you put a couple people up there doesn't end the demand for
diversity.''

A TIME TO RESPECT, NOT HATE, THE KENNEDYS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The death of John F. Kennedy Jr. seems to pose a
perplexing problem for those who hate the Kennedys _ or at least
for the ones who've called me.
</P>
<P>
   They can't criticize JFK Jr. for romancing mobster molls, like
his old man. They can't fault him for an unseemly thirst for booze
and broads, like his uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. They
can't even accuse him of political naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Young JFK never really expressed a partisan sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   They can't accuse him of laziness or stupidity or greed. He went
through an Ivy League university and a tough law school. He finally
passed what's probably the roughest bar exam in the country.
Instead of hooking up with some ritzy Wall Street firm, he used his
education to prosecute purse snatchers before starting up a fairly
classy national magazine.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. did all this, by the way, when he could have used his
inherited wealth and movie-star looks to loll on the beach in
Cannes with a blonde on each arm, and who would have blamed him for
it?
</P>
<P>
   So they're stuck with assailing him for hubris, for letting his
courage as a fledgling pilot outweigh his skills. And they do that
when nobody knows yet just what really happened over the sea off
Martha's Vineyard. No experienced pilot I've heard is yet ready to
level those criticisms. I'm hearing them, though, from people whose
most intimate experience with aviation is watching Sky King reruns
on TV Land.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy haters are stuck with wailing about the excessive
media coverage of the death of somebody whose bloodlines they
dislike. They also complain bitterly about all the taxpayer
resources devoted to finding the plane's wreckage and the bodies.
Several people who called me moaned that nobody paid this much
attention last October when a 49-year-old lawyer named Ronald H.
Sinzheimer died in the crash of a private plane he was piloting in
the same general area.
</P>
<P>
   They're right about that, too. The death of the Albany man was
inside news in my newspaper, not front-page news all around the
world. And the Coast Guard used a single helicopter to search for
the wreckage of Sinzheimer's plane while this search involved a
flotilla of air and sea vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a scandal?
</P>
<P>
   Sinzheimer, I'm told, was a fine man of substance and
accomplishment. He was not, however, the son of a president and the
nephew of two U.S. senators. He was not somebody whose daily life
was of intense interest to millions.
</P>
<P>
   Get real, Kennedy haters. This is the best you can do? The fact
is that JFK Jr. was a significant man from a profoundly significant
American family.
</P>
<P>
   You might not understand what the first JFK's election 39 years
ago meant to the one in six Americans of Irish extraction. His
entry into the White House signified, quite simply, that we finally
were full-fledged Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, his 1,000-day presidency wasn't momentous in
terms of substance. But his style and personal grace made us proud.
JFK's son, as a public man in his own right, demonstrated those
qualities in wide-screen technicolor. In a tabloid era that would
have made his philandering father a figure of derision, young JFK
relentlessly exuded class, quality and character.
</P>
<P>
   From all reports, he was a thoughtful, responsible guy who
understood that millions he never knew had expectations of him _
not that he become president, but that he live life in a way that
reflected credit on both himself and on those who recall what his
father represented. Until that plane crash Saturday night, that's
precisely what JFK Jr. did.
</P>
<P>
   So, Kennedy haters, give it a rest. Be patient until Teddy
checks out. Then you can really live it up.
</P>

SUSHI, SAKE, SUMO _ ALL IN NEWPORT

   Japan is coming to Newport, R.I. July 22-25. It's the 16th
anniversary of the Black Ships Festival and it's going to be a
great opportunity to experience Japanese art, culture, and foods.
</P>
<P>
   Among events will be a sushi and sake sail, sumo wrestling, art
and culture workshops and demonstrations, a Japanese food market, a
festival of drums, kite flying, karate, a tea ceremony, paper
folding, sushi making demonstrations, activities for children, and
a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Ships Festival commemorates Commodore Matthew C.
Perry, a Newport native, who negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa in
1854, opening Japan to trade from the West and ending two centuries
of isolation. Black Ships refers to foreign vessels that were
excluded from Japan until the treaty was signed. Shimoda, Japan,
Newport's sister city, also commemorates this celebration of
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   For information or tickets to events, call 800-976-5122 or
401-846-2720 or visit www.NewportEvents.com. Newport is an easy
drive from Boston, and is known for its mansions, colonial history,
dining, and water activities. A great weekend destination anytime,
but especially during the Black Ships Festival.
</P>
<P>
   For those who wonder just how fat a sumo wrestler is, a Japan
Airlines newletter reports the average weight is 412 pounds, up
from 317 in 1953. Now sumo wrestlers have to have their body fat
measured, and possibly go on a diet.

   The schooner AmericA(cq), a replica of one of the most famous
racing boats in history, is in Boston through September for tours
and sails. The 139-foot schooner will be docked at Rowes Wharf
behind the Boston Harbor Hotel. The vessel is a replica of the
America, which in 1851 soundly defeated 14 British yachts and won
the 100 Guinea Cup around the Isle of Wight. The race was attended
by Queen Victoria who asked, ``Who is first?'' ``America has won,''
she was told. ``Who was second?'' the queen asked. The famous reply
was, ``Your Majesty, there is no second.'' The race was renamed
America's Cup. AmericA is owned and operated by Historic Tours of
America, which owns the Boston Tea Party Ship and Museum and Old
Town Trolley Tours. While in Boston AmericA will be managed by The
Liberty Fleet of Tall Ships. For information, call 617-742-0333.

THE JFK JR. STORY: MORE VOYEURISM, OVERKILL ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It's uncomfortable to be cynical in the face
of sadness.
</P>
<P>
   The networks said they were going to learn their lesson _
particularly after the funeral of Dianna, Princess of Wales, and
then the long Clinton-Lewinsky nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   And then Littleton, Colo. Where the only thing that could wash
away the dime-store analysis was the tears.
</P>
<P>
   How often do you cut an industry slack when, after the lights go
down, it begs forgiveness and promises change, only to revert to
its bad, old ways? You don't. It will be easier, then, to just
accept the truth:
</P>
<P>
   Journalistic standards on television are not relevant in today's
world. In fact, we're not getting much journalism on television _
we're getting entertainment and therapy and voyeurism, but not
credibility, restraint when necessary and a fundamental belief that
there's a difference between reporting the news and leaving the
camera turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Our latest example: The fate of John F. Kennedy Jr. _ a death
put on hold. For television, it's the perfect story. Tragedy,
celebrity, history, shock and breaking news. Without coming out and
saying, definitively, ``They all died in that crash,'' television
news didn't feel obligated to have any boundaries. It could go on
forever, a sad solo story for 24-hour news networks and one hell of
an extended special report for everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 24 hours of the story, they were at the same game
all over again: Nonstop coverage of a story even when there was
nothing to add. Relentless archival tape-loops of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with so-called experts, even if that meant
journalists at the same network who happened to know Kennedy. And
anchors killing inordinate amounts of time, rambling, trying to
create first a sense of drama, then of regret, then shared memories
and lastly that best friend to all, the sad, big-picture
retrospective, complete with heart-tugging music.
</P>
<P>
   On that initial day, what else could they do? It's the nature of
the news beast to never, ever waver. Go away from the story and
viewers will flip somewhere else. Move off a story too early and
risk missing the slow unraveling of news fragments that could
advance the story.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Kaplan, president of CNN/U.S., stood in a room full of
television critics from around the country in Pasadena and
dismissed the notion of cutting back that first day because ``this
is of extraordinary importance, especially to Americans.'' And to
CNN's credit, the coverage had some restrictions that seemed to go
unheeded by others.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal CNN memo that indicated the direction came from
Kaplan, staffers got this notice early: ``Do not refer to JFK Jr.
in the past tense. He is missing. Stop eulogizing him. And do not
talk about a Kennedy family curse.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just good journalism, nothing more. These days, that
translates into a noble effort rather than business as usual on
television. So, if in those first 24 hours it was just the nature
of the beast, the networks were begrudgingly excused for the
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   And viewers certainly didn't mind. No question about it. Like
Diana before, this death had soap-opera elements that lured in
virtually everyone. But what about after 48 hours? What excuses can
be used then, when network teases imply that coverage would
continue wall to wall, right after this commercial break.
</P>
<P>
   What about when everyone had seen the same watery footage
endlessly? Or when there were catchy titles to the coverage? Or
when the aforementioned eulogizing, which CNN tried hard to
contain, simply busted loose all across the dial?
</P>
<P>
   We were back to tragedy as ratings. Another sad day in
television journalism.
</P>
<P>
   An argument often made by networks, tired of stinging rebukes of
their habits, is that newspapers are equally guilty, that the news
often remains on the front page for days. But the equation doesn't
hold up. Newspapers, in addition to telling a story more
thoroughly, never fill space when there's no advancing the story.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't news articles that capture that same kind of vacant
nothingness of cameras watching helicopters watching rescue boats.
</P>
<P>
   Also, most newspaper coverage doesn't turn maudlin so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper account can't show Kennedy and his wife attending
the same function or making the same speech every half-hour. A
newspaper does not fill 24, 48, even 72 hours with static
storytelling, or give time to an unceasing array of half-qualified
pundits or distant friends who illuminate nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Television news is unique in its overkill. And it's not getting
better.

<P>
   MSNBC's coverage, as usual, was loathsome.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Brian Williams talked breathlessly about a government
search vessel that possibly had uncovered evidence of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The boat, Williams said, ``is stopped over _ something.''
</P>
<P>
   That something could be anything, was the implication. And that
anything could be something _ ``possibly bodies,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Was there a need to watch further? Well, sure, because the
Kennedy curse had to be resurrected again. It must have been
difficult for MSNBC _ and to most networks covering this story _
that a funeral wasn't already under way.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be. And the wedding- to-funeral tale will arise
again. Mary Jo Kopechne will take her place on the anchors' lips
one more time. Sad to say, this Kennedy story is a cash cow that
will continue to be milked.

GOT   A LIGHT? YES, 575,000 OF THEM

   For more than two decades, the crowds cheered when an
other-worldy voice proclaimed:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, Disneyland
proudly presents our spectacular pageant of of nighttime magic and
imagination in thousands of sparkling lights and
electro-syntho-magnetic musical sounds . . . the Main Street
Electrical Parade!''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   And now the crowds are cheering again. The original Main Street
Electrical Parade from Disneyland in California is again being
performed nightly _ but it has moved 2,400 miles to Walt Disney
World's Magic Kingdom in Florida. Disney World itself had a version
of the parade for 15 seasons, but this is the one that ran the
longest, from 1972 to 1996, with just a couple of time-outs for
specially themed events. Here are some facts about this shimmering
spectacle, which features the most beloved Disney characters:
</P>
<P>
   --There are approximately 575,000 lights in six colors: amber,
blue, chartreuse, green, pink, and red _ plus clear.
</P>
<P>
   --Amber is the most-used color, with 152,000 lights.
</P>
<P>
   --The patriotic finale stretches 122 feet and involves 80,000
lights.
</P>

UPN: FOR YOUR GUYS ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ At no other time in its history has the UPN
network been more likable.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's likable _ not dislikable.
</P>
<P>
   Considered the sixth-place network in a six-way race, UPN always
has been picked on by the critics, often deserving its status as
the butt of some ``Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' joke or for
imploding almost on cue.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed since then? Not a lot, but UPN, on the air since
January 1995, no longer seems in the business of explaining itself
or of trying to please the masses, its ill-fated first goal as a
network.
</P>
<P>
   As of this coming season, broadcasting _ in its purest sense _
is out the window. Women, older people, the thirtysomething crowds
_ watch if you want, but UPN is going, unapologetically it seems,
after young males. The network that tried to do a little bit of
everything to attract people from across the social fabric is done
with the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The commander in chief of the new approach is Dean Valentine,
president and chief executive of the network. When pressed several
times Monday to explain violence and sexism in wrestling, one of
the coming linchpins in the UPN turnaround, Valentine would have
none of it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``WWF Smackdown'' block _ a full two hours every Thursday _
is just a ``soap opera for young guys,'' he said. ``There's not a
`Rocky' movie made that hasn't been more violent than any WWF
episode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think wrestling is popular entertainment and I don't have
any problems with the message it sends,'' he said. That led to a
flurry of examples of wrestling's past and present sins against
political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe there's anything sexist or violent on WWF,''
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   All he needed then was a dismissive wave of his hand and it
would have been perfect theater. Valentine, one of the few real-guy
leaders in the TV industry, is not always easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   One moment he puts on a lousy show and confronts television
critics when they don't like it. The next minute he apologizes for
the show and says he was wrong about its redeeming qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UPN lost about a third of its audience as viewers
couldn't grasp its direction, its message or its brand.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of Valentine's reign _ about 18 months ago when
he launched the new ``Love Boat'' idea _ UPN has been everyone's
favorite whipping boy. To this day, the network suffers from the
perception that it couldn't produce anything of quality, despite
the fact it has created a number of good shows.
</P>
<P>
   But things are changing for UPN _ even if a lot of people aren't
noticing. The network made money in the all-important advertiser
courtship period known as the ``upfronts,'' when potential buyers
see new products. The network generated $140 million in sales,
compared with $135 million the previous year. Remember, this comes
after losing a third of its viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Why the increase? Simple. UPN knows what it's all about now.
</P>
<P>
   It's about young males _ the hardest-to-reach audience and
therefore one of the most lucrative demographics. UPN will get them
through wrestling and action movies and a couple of pretty cool new
series _ ``Secret Agent Man'' and ``The Strip'' _ that feature guys
with guns, cool gadgets and a healthy dose of personal attitude,
much like Valentine possesses.
</P>
<P>
   These are good changes. UPN is even repositioning itself ever so
subtly, with Valentine and Entertainment President Tom Nunan
repeating, like a good Hemingway paragraph, the idea that, ``We
function as an alternative network.'' Translation: We won't win the
total viewers race, but we'll form a nice niche. In turn,
expectations get lowered (so get off our backs). And just to
dismiss the sense that a death knell will toll soon for the sixth
network _ a favorite preoccupation with critics _ Valentine said,
forcefully, ``We're never going away.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a refreshing change. UPN and Valentine in particular are
ill-suited for actively courting respectability. We need a network
that says, ``We know our audience. You're not it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, UPN is putting out an early contender for worst show of
the season _ a ludicrous hip-hop-esque version of ``The Monkees''
called ``Shasta McNasty,'' and there's a feeling that the network
(whoops, ``alternative network'') knows the show is awful and
doesn't care what critics think.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, just maybe, ``Shasta McNasty'' will mix well with the
wrestling and the two promising new action shows, not to mention
last season's decent addition, ``7 Days,'' to become a watchable
option. Probably not _ it's likely to flop. But, hey, that's how it
goes. If you don't like it, don't watch it. UPN doesn't care about
getting everyone's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes the network infinitely more likable.

BIG VOTE OF APPROVAL FOR MIDNIGHT BUFFET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What time is the midnight buffet?'' That's one of those silly
questions heard on many a past cruise. (Maybe not so silly _ some
began at 11:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   The midnight buffet, once a staple on all cruise ships, has been
disappearing from many lines in favor of smaller specialized
buffets such as a chocolate feast. And with the increase of pizza
parlors on the seas and 24-hour dining rooms, who needs another
buffet? A lot of people, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Omega World Travel/ CRUISE.COM online survey found
respondents going 2 to 1 in favor of keeping the midnight buffet.
That question drew the widest majority of any of the poll's four
questions.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of on-board casinos (a major moneymaker for
cruise lines), only 42 percent said they were important. On the
question of smoking, 51 percent said they though non-smoking
cruises were a good idea (many lines do offer smoke- free dining
rooms; Carnival has a smoke-free ship, the Paradise).
</P>
<P>
   Preferenes twoard ship sizes also drew a mixed response. Medium
ships were preferred by 35 percent of respondents, large ships by
30 percent. Megaships received only 22 percent approval, and small
ships had just 13 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Omega World Travel is a travel management company, and polled
2,416 people in June. Participation in the current on-line cruise
survey is available at www.cruise.com.

   One of New England's treasures is its windjammer fleet that
sails along the Maine coast. While these authentic sailing vessels
offer short sails of three or four days, that's still too long for
some visitors. The schooner Wendameen that sails out of Rockland,
Maine, offers one-night sails. Passengers board the 67-foot yacht
at 1:30 p.m. and soon set sail guided by the wind. The 1912
schooner returns around 10 a.m. the next day. For information, call
207-594-1751.

<P>

What next?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now you can sail without ever boarding a ship. Princess Cruises
found its Grand Princess BridgeCam to be one of the most popular
features of its Web site. Now additional live cameras have been
added to six more Princess ships and there is a second view to the
Grand Princess. This Internet feature allows visitors to visit
www.princess.com to enjoy the view from the bridges of Sun
Princess, Dawn Princess, Sea Princess, Crown Princess, Royal
Princess, and Sky Princess as they cruise Alaskan and European
waters. This marks the first time a Web site has offered such a
feature. Visitors to the Grand Princess site reportedly spend up to
15 minutes viewing the scene. The BridgeCams are placed on or near
the ship's bridge, and the image is updated every 60 seconds,
allowing viewers to ``sail'' with the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also offers visitors information on all Princess
ships including the onboard experience, itineraries, and
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Princess has also announced that the original Love Boat, the
Pacific Princess, will begin sailing from New York to Bermuda next
year. The weekly cruises begin May 7.

   PADANARAM, Mass. _ They look like nothing else on the water.
</P>
<P>
   They enter a harbor as a beauty enters a room. The mere presence
of one in San Diego Bay earlier this year set the huge sailing
community there on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was saying, `Did you see? Someone brought a Concordia
yawl into the bay,' '' recalls Dan Nowlan, director of the Offshore
department of the US Sailing Association, the national governing
body for the sport. ``There are thousands of boats in San Diego
Bay, but this is the one everybody wanted to see.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way since the late Ray Hunt picked up Harrier,
his Concordia yawl, at the Abeking and Rasmussen shipyard in
Lemwerder, Germany, in 1955 and walked off with six firsts in six
races at Cowes, the prestigious international race week off
England. A year earlier, Dan Strohmeier won the Bermuda race on his
Concordia, Malay, at 39 feet the smallest boat ever to win that
celebrated contest.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday (July 16), 25 of these ocean aristocrats glided to
South Wharf by Dartmouth's Concordia Boatyard here to celebrate
their 60th anniversary, which was to have been held last summer but
was postponed because of a bad storm. There were also five owners
on hand who came without their boats. Kersten Prophet, who owns the
only Concordia in Germany, flew from the Baltic for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   These saltwater folk traded stories and fibs over libations that
evening and then raced a 15-mile course Saturday in the chop of
Buzzards Bay. The wind was out of the southwest at a spirited 20
knots, good air for the yawls.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are obsessed. ``We're all nuts,'' says Walter Schulz,
owner of Absynthe. ``But instead of fast women and booze, I've done
it with wooden boats.'' He first saw Absynthe a few years ago under
a tarpaulin. It was badly in need of repair. ``I opened the cover,
and that was the kiss of death,'' he adds, shaking his head. ``Life
has never been the same since.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, who owns the Shannon Boatyard in Bristol, R.I., finished
building a 43-foot, state-of-the-art, fiberglass sailboat last week
that will sell for $650,000. Yet he sails a Concordia, modest by
those standards. ``It keeps me in touch with the Phoenicians,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks surprise no one familiar with the Concordia
mystique. Owners of the yawls, built at 39 or 41 feet with their
mizzenmasts located behind the rudder post, will drop whatever they
are doing to sail. And they're great on water. ``The Who's Who of
America yachting got into these boats,'' says Brodie MacGregor, the
current owner of the Concordia Boatyard and organizer of the
reunion. More Concordias would have been here this weekend but for
the regatta at Edgartown and the New York Yacht Club cruise to
Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Concordia owners even have their own newsletter, published twice
a year by Skip Bergmann (owner of Paramour), in which they write
detailed narratives about endless maintenance and cruising.
</P>
<P>
   To own one of the 103 Concordia yawls made between 1938 and 1966
is to belong to a club as subtle as it is exclusive. ``It is a
cult,'' says Strohmeier, now 88, who has skippered 15 Bermuda and
18 Halifax races. A cult, yes, but an active one. No boat has been
lost yet, and almost all are still on the water _ a stunning
record.
</P>
<P>
   There are far more expensive boats to be had, far faster ones,
too. But then there is pride, first among the seven sins. In words
eerily intoned by other Concordia owners, John Bullard, who sails
Captiva, the yawl his father bought 34 years ago, says, ``I love
sailing into a harbor and watch everyone on every other boat turn
their heads.'' What's more, adds Ted Danforth, owner of Oriane,
``They all know the make. They ask, What number hull is that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Concordia yawl speaks about the values and taste of an owner
as do few other possessions. It is wooden boat in an age of
fiberglass, an elegant one in an inelegant time. ``If God had said
`yacht,' he'd have thought of a Concordia,'' says Danforth, who has
sailed on 150-foot schooners. ``It is an entirely simple elegance.
It is exactly the right size. It is the perfect Zen thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The yawl was built to cruise Buzzards Bay but excelled as an
ocean racer as well. It was designed in 1938 by Ray Hunt, better
known for the Boston Whaler, the deep V hull craft that
revolutionized the power boat industry; the 110 and 210 classes of
sailboats; and Easterner, the 12-meter that sailmaker Ted Hood said
was ahead of its time.
</P>
<P>
   But the driving force behind the Concordia yawl (and most
everything else in these parts) was the late Waldo Howland, who
owned the boatyard and tapped Hunt to design a boat after his
father's boat was destroyed in the hurricane of 1938.
</P>
<P>
   The first four Concordias were built in New Bedford and Boston.
After World War II, though, an extraordinary relationship began
between Concordia and the Abeking and Rasmussen shipyard in
Germany. From 1950 to 1966, the next 99 boats were built there,
then shipped from Bremen by steamer to Boston and towed through the
Cape Cod Canal to Padanaram, where they were finished. All of them
were built without a single contract. Everything was based on the
handshake.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, the Concordia is simply easy on the eyes. Up
close, it is an exquisite piece of work, crafted from oak, African
mahogany, locust, and butternut. Its spars were made of Sitka
spruce, its decks of teak, sometimes topped with canvas. ``Every
screw, visible or not, is lined up with the grain of the wood,''
says Bullard. ``You know the hands that screwed that screw.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it is spare. ``My father was always reducing things
to their essence,'' says Kinnaird Howland, one of his four sons.
</P>
<P>
   Waldo Howland wanted a boat that would be timeless. He got it in
the Concordia. Part of the allure of his yawls is that they have
never been out of fashion because they were not built to the
strictures of International Offshore Rule.
</P>
<P>
   When other boatyards built to the IOR, ``All the boats began to
look the same,'' says Dan Nowlan. ``None looked like the graceful
Concordia yawls.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard recalls that in 1975 he crewed on a boat in the one-ton
world championships that was considered the fastest in its class at
the time. By August 1976, it had been outdesigned. ``In nine
months, we went from the fastest in the world to a boat with no
chance,'' he says. It is notable, then, that a Concordia won the
Bermuda race in 1978, 24 years after its first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Howland abhorred what he called ``the IOR horror'' almost as
much as he despised fiberglass. ``That's not where the truth was,''
explains his son, who recalls his father asking, voice laced with
sarcasm, ``Why not have a fiberglass diningroom table? They're
easier to clean. Or why not a fiberglass violin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved wood,'' explains the younger Howland. ``It's kind to
the touch. It requires that you take care of it, and it's good to
take care of things. He felt that a wooden boat was something that
is worth having.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldo Howland had particular ideas about a lot of things. ``When
you had a daiquiri with my father, it had to be with Key limes, not
Persian limes,'' he adds. ``He could never get a decent one at a
bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat's sheer beauty explains in part why people pay $120,000
for a Concordia yawl in good shape _ seven times what one cost new
in the early Sixties. But never lost in its looks is its marvelous
sailing ability. It is a dream to handle in most conditions and
superb when it starts to blow. ``Two knowledgeable sailors can sail
that boat in almost any weather,'' says Larry Moulton of
Marblehead, owner of White Wave.
</P>
<P>
   The yawl is also narrow, heavy, wet, and a tight squeeze for the
crew of six needed for serious offshore racing. It doesn't like
light air. A new boat half its size has far more room below. ``It's
a canoe,'' says Kinnaird Howland. Worse, upkeep means the
hemorrhaging of time and money. But, he adds, none of this matters
because of ``the Concordia thing'' _ the mystique of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logic does not prevail here,'' concedes Rusty Aertsen, owner
of Snowbird and a smaller Concordia sloop, Kestrel. ``They grow on
you like golden retrievers.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was just what Waldo had in mind.

   WASHINGTON _ What curse? There is no curse, not on the Kennedy
family, not on anything.
</P>
<P>
   What genetic streak of recklessness? There is no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of celebrity culture, phony melodrama, and
debased journalism that defines modern American mass media is not
the stuff of true legend and myth _ epic concepts both. They are
the ingredients of absurdity and obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was correct in observing for a heartbroken
country on Sunday that the loss of John F. Kennedy Jr. is no
isolated event, that his family ``has suffered much, and given
more.'' It is the two halves of that insightful point that need to
be seen together.
</P>
<P>
   For the fact is that none of the genuine feelings this tragedy
has evoked _ and none of the blarney we have endured through the
airwaves _ would exist had not three sons of Joseph and Rose
Kennedy lost their lives in the service of their country.
</P>
<P>
   It is an obvious fact that has escaped notice, but it is central
to the point the president made. Without those deaths, the extended
family's later tragedies would not be special, much less unique.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., John F. Kennedy, and Robert
F. Kennedy were not events isolated in a past time. Each left
enduring legacies that make them a part of our culture and politics
today.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Jr.'s death is a metaphor for the thousands of kids who
volunteered for dangerous assignments during World War II and
didn't return. And John and Robert Kennedy don't live on because
there are so many pictures of a glittering time in the 1960s when
so much of the country was so vigorously positive. In part they
live on through their siblings.
</P>
<P>
   By now, it is generally recognized that Senator Edward Kennedy
has been one of a handful of the most important legislators in
American history. And it helps to know that one of his sisters
(Eunice Kennedy Shriver) has had more of a positive impact on
social services in the country than most of the relevant Cabinet
officers of recent decades; and that another (Jean Kennedy Smith)
was the ambassador to Ireland who helped transform the violent
despair of the North to real hope.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Camelot was never the correct analogy. Instead
of one brief, shining moment, it has been half the American
century, and it is already certain to be a good chunk of the next
one.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy has two main components. The first is the ongoing
capacity to motivate Americans to get involved in public service on
the basis of a faith that effort leads inexorably to improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The second is an enduring impatience with the ideological status
quo and a relentless experimentation with new ideas. John and
Robert Kennedy, especially the latter after his brother's murder,
were the bridging figures between the New Deal era of government
services and the modern, creative concept of empowerment. It is no
accident that their ideas _ from Medicare to empowerment zones,
from tax cuts to welfare reform _ have been invoked by the likes of
Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp as well as by Bill Clinton and Jesse
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition 53 years after John Kennedy ran for Congress is
clearly dynastic, but this a dynasty of effort and achievement, not
of heredity and entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   I have written about Kennedys for 30 years, and the only thing I
know for sure is that, apart from the motivation to service and the
intense family ties, each one is an individual, and assertively so.
</P>
<P>
   Though his death was tragic because he was still young, John
Kennedy fit the mold of mold-breaker perfectly. I am positive he
was headed for politics himself, but his way was going to fit his
generation's lack of romantic illusions and be from the outside in.
His heroes (Nelson Mandela and Cesar Chavez) were activists more
than politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no accident that his passing shifts our gaze
naturally. Maryland's lieutenant governor, Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend (Robert Kennedy's daughter), is a national leader among
New Democrats. Representative Patrick Kennedy (Senator Kennedy's
son) is part of Dick Gephardt's leadership in the House. There are
scholar-writers (Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg); and innovative
environmentalists (Robert Kennedy Jr. and Maxwell Taylor Kennedy);
and there is possibly the next governor of Massachusetts (former
Representative Joe Kennedy).
</P>
<P>
   Perseverance in the face of tragedy rests not only on a
religious faith that a day of real justice will come, but also on
President Kennedy's inaugural affirmation that on earth, God's work
must truly be our own. In hundreds of speeches by various Kennedys
through the years, there are three consistently repeated thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   With Oliver Wendell Holmes, that a person is involved in the
actions and passions of his time at the peril of being judged not
to have lived; with George Bernard Shaw, that while some see things
as they are and ask why, I dream things that never were and ask why
not; and, the one that always hits me hardest, that all of us can
make a difference and each of us should try.
</P>
<P>
   You can grieve and weep with these special Americans, and you
can honor their heritage by vowing never, ever, to give up.
</P>

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Don't you know that some days the b.s. is just
too thick for the filter of absurdity, and the whole system has to
back up?
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, in less time than you can say, ``minimum wage,''
members of the House of Representatives gave themselves and their
Senate colleagues a 3.4 percent salary increase.
</P>
<P>
   This occurred without debate or apology on the same day the
Senate passed a pathetic rights bill for the patients of managed
care providers that is guaranteed a presidential veto and,
according to the Chicago Tribune, ``all but smothered the slim hope
that patients would gain any new federal protections before the
2000 elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Two bits of related nonsense:
</P>
<P>
   _ House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who has been widely
trashed _ as being a total non-force _ by many of his own party
members, will now pull down an annual salary of $175,400.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the same day, the House passed by a single vote a $28
billion Treasury appropriations bill that included the doubling of
the salary of the next president of the United States (from
$200,000 to $400,000). Many Republicans voted against the bill, not
because they wanted to short the commander in chief, but because
the bill included a provision that requires most federal employees'
medical plans to cover prescription birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Still in our nation's capital, 99 more managed care
organizations announced that, come January, they will boot 327,000
old people from their Medicare-supplementing health maintenance
organizations, or HMOs. Eight months ago, nearly 100 HMOs
self-destructed, leaving some 400,000 Medicare patients with no
HMO.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry says it had to make the cuts because
the federal government is stingy with its Medicare reimbursements;
the feds say the managed care providers did it to increase their
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we believe they are both lying but correct?
</P>

   PRIEST-GAYS (Washington) _ The Rev. Robert Nugent, rebuked by
the Vatican last week for ministering to gays around the nation for
the last 25 years, says the action was ``a setback and a
disappointment'' for Catholic homosexuals seeking greater
acceptance in the church. By ERIC ROSENBERG.
</P>
<P>
   SWEEPSTAKES-SCAMS (Washington) _ Support for a bill to crack
down on sweepstakes companies is growing in the Senate as more
evidence of deceptive practices by small firms is uncovered. The
measure, offered by Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Carl Levin,
D-Mich., has 33 co-sponsors. By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN. Will also
be filed in the FINANCIAL-BUSINESS NEWS (``f'') category.

   PRIVACY-BANKS (Washington) _ Consumers should be given the right
to stop banks from releasing to other companies private information
about them such as what they buy or how much they earn, business
and privacy experts tell Congress. By MARK HELM. Will also be filed

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The split-up of that champion of
traditional family values, ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and his
wife Marianne confirms that his political claim to spousal devotion
didn't mean beans. And Gingrich isn't the only politician who
preaches high moral standards for others and fails to behave
accordingly himself. So let's get off the family values kick. It's
hypocritical. By MARIANNE MEANS.

Eric Robert Rudolph. (Manuel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BEYOND-BARS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ As the last paper plate and
Styrofoam cup are tossed in the big trash bin, a guard does an
early-evening head count. Then, troop activities begin. This night
mothers and daughters learn dance moves and sing Girl Scout songs,
such as ``Alice the Camel.'' But this isn't a typical Girl Scout
meeting because mothers are prison inmates. Nationally, an
estimated 1.5 million children have a jailed parent, and more than
200,000 children have imprisoned mothers, according to the Child
Welfare League of America. Nearly 11,000 women were incarcerated in
Texas prisons in April. Criminal justice experts say parent-child
contact is essential to preserving emotional bonds while a parent
is serving time. The relationship will, hopefully, help the
imprisoned parent to change and the child to cope. But maintaining
the relationship often requires structured programs, such as Beyond
Bars, which gets the mothers and daughters out of the crowded,
assigned-seat environment of routine weekend jail visits. (Martin,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   SCI-ORGAN-TRANSPLANTS (Undated) _ Fifteen months after the
Clinton administration ordered a controversial overhaul of the
nation's system for distributing human organs, an independent panel

</P>
<P>
   FAT-SUBSTITUTE (Undated) _ Two years ago, Procter &AMP; Gamble
thought it could make the fat substitute olestra into a staple, and
it projected nearly $1 billion in sales by the end of this year.
But consumers didn't bite _ partly because regulatory approval was
so long in coming that the fickle cycle of consumer taste had edged
away from low-fat food, partly because olestra has an image _
backed up by numerous complaints _ of causing stomach upset. And
sales may now hit only half that $1 billion target. While olestra
is hardly a flop, the backpedaling from the original lofty goals
represents a stark reversal for a company that never likes to tap
the brakes. And it is a testament to the struggle the global
behemoth has had in coming up with the next hot brand to rev up its
slowing growth engine. By Dana Canedy.

<P>
   TRADE-REPORT (Washington) _ The U.S. trade deficit surged in May

billion _ wider than forecasts and a 14.8 percent increase from the
$18.6 billion deficit in April. The deficits with Europe and China
widened, while the deficit with Japan narrowed. By David E. Sanger.

BRIDGET FONDA DIVES INTO `LAKE PLACID'
</HEADLINE>
 BC - FONDA-BRIDGET-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Eds: note italics below 
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In her dozen years as a film actress, Bridget
Fonda's pale, slender beauty has lent itself to roles as a Single
White Female, a bong-smoking beach bunny and a waitress. Now, she's
trying something a little different _ playing a reluctant crocodile
chaser in the quirky/scary creature flick ``Lake Placid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a body-hugging black sweater set and slim skirt (from
which, she discovered, she hadn't yet removed the price tag),
Fonda, at 35, seems to look more like a Fonda every day. The lanky
frame and piercing eyes bear a strong resemblance to those of
father Peter, grandfather Henry and aunt Jane. Though she says she
has to watch her weight a bit more now than in the past, it's hard
to sympathize when she pinches what she imagines is a bit of fat on
her leg. (BEGIN ITAL) Please, (END ITAL) you think, (BEGIN ITAL)
allow me to show you what fat really looks like. (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   It may not be coincidental, then, that Fonda was offered the
lead role in ``Ally McBeal.'' The huge TV hit was created by ``Lake
Placid'' writer David E. Kelley; Fonda says she's just not
interested in doing television right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if something came along that I wanted to
do (on TV),'' Fonda said. ``I love the character and writing on
`Ally McBeal,' but my favorite part of making a movie is the
preparation. I'm not that spontaneous, to work on a series the way
they do, changing things up to the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   It's often said that Kelley is the busiest man in show business:
He has three shows on the air (``Ally,'' ``The Practice'' and
``Chicago Hope'') and finds time to write movies on the side when
he's not busy being a family man with wife Michelle Pfeiffer.
Everyone involved with ``Placid'' says Kelley's smart,
tongue-in-cheek writing was a main attraction in doing the film and
that Kelley was always available to make small tweaks when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never actually seen him on the set of anything, but he's
always there,'' said director Steve Miner. With credits that range
from ``Halloween: H20'' to TV's ``Dawson's Creek,'' Miner seems to
have been a natural choice to bring this mixture of horror and
dark, offbeat humor to the screen. ``We had a little trouble
setting (the movie) up,'' admits Miner, ``because people had a
little trouble understanding what kind of movie it was. But David
and I always knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda plays a paleontologist called in to figure out how a giant
crocodile may have made its way into a Maine lake. As part of her
preparation, Fonda paid a visit to the Museum of Natural History in
New York, where she was debriefed on the fine points of identifying
a crocodile from one of its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda admits she can relate to the insecurities of her
character, who's a bundle of insecurities because she's fresh off a
broken relationship and is out of her element in the wild. ``I
loved this character. She's been having a bad time. She's a bitch
because she's so afraid of being not good enough ... her
self-esteem is so low that she doesn't want to leave her cubicle
and her microscope,'' said Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   As for her own insecurities, Fonda admits she's afraid of
heights _ and doesn't relish looking back at her own work on film.
``I'm not that crazy about my own work ... I'll watch the dailies
and go to the premiere,'' Fonda said, ``but looking back _ I don't
really get into what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she grew up among Hollywood royalty _ or perhaps
because of it _ Fonda says she can relate to the fear that grows
from insecurity. But according to Fonda, who recently ended a long
relationship with actor Eric Stoltz and is currently dating
singer/actor Dwight Yoakam, she doesn't suffer from it when it
comes to feeling like she has to measure up against anyone else's
fame, or the Fonda ``legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sense of competition. That's probably from
being the child of someone famous,'' Fonda says, ``that I don't
look at fame as a register of anything real. Fame just doesn't mean
anything concrete. It's so changeable. You can't count on it. It
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda says that, unlike her father, who released a juicy
autobiography last year (``Don't Tell Dad: A Memoir''), she's
learned to keep a part of her life private. ``The way I grew up was
that there was no privacy. My father is very, very open,'' Fonda
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up thinking that's the way you had to be. But then,''
said Fonda, ``I found out I didn't want to be that way ... I had to
sort of learn how to not feel bad about not answering certain
questions. My natural instinct is to try to give an answer _ that's
the gracious thing to do. I'm a people pleaser, which makes me feel
bad about not giving an answer, but I'm also kind of shy and
private. So sometimes I'm torn.
</P>
<P>
   Workwise, Fonda says she's conscious these days of moving beyond
parts that cast her as merely window dressing: ``corsage parts,''
as she calls them. She says she'd be interested in developing her
own projects if she could ``find a way to do it: It takes time _
and a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Fonda says she's happy and grateful for the parts
she's gotten so far in her career and is just trying to take things
one role at a time. ``Do I think about my legacy? I can't really
think about that,'' Fonda said. ``If I think about that ... it's a
setup for a feeling of failure for me; I'll never measure up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get objective about my own work,'' Fonda admits, ``so
I just have to let go of that and hope other people like what I
do.'' &QL;

By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Shakespeare was the house playwright of kings and
queens, but he never neglected the unwashed mob. He pitched his
plays not only to the swells in the balconies but also to the hoi
polloi thrashing around in ye olde mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   A similar high-low sensibility marked the prolific career of the
African-American composer known by his regal moniker. While Duke
Ellington's mature orchestral works are embraced at Carnegie Hall,
his bouncy pop standards still endure as urbane masterpieces of
compressed, streetwise vitality.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, then, if you take a few of Duke's greatest hits and
combine them with ``Twelfth Night,'' the Bard's ever-popular comedy
of love and gender-swapping identity, you should have a work of
bipolar genius _ sophisticated yet soulful, classy yet down to
earth. Three years ago, director Sheldon Epps and book writer
Cheryl West turned that promising idea into the musical ``Play
On!'' which opened in San Diego and enjoyed successful runs in
Chicago and Seattle after a mixed New York reception.
</P>
<P>
   But in its present form at the Pasadena Playhouse, where Epps is
now artistic director, ``Play On!'' plays like an over-cautious
experiment in cultural cross-pollination. While the show has
flashes of robust wit and jazzy sensuality, its conceptual miscues
and reluctance to court danger, plus an erratic cast, keep it from
conveying the full creative heat of its twin icons.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely transposed from the mythical Illyria to the magical
Harlem of the 1940s, ``Play On!'' streamlines Shakespeare's story
about a young woman, here called Vy (Natalie Venetia Belcon), who
impersonates a man in order to gain access to a lovelorn ruler. In
``Play On!'' the ruler is a prince of jazz, naturally named Duke
(Raun Ruffin), who's in a royal funk over his standoffish
mistress-muse, the haughty, golden-throated Lady Liv (Nikki
Crawford).
</P>
<P>
   Vy has come to Harlem from rural Mississippi hoping to break
into the sex-segregated composing world, and her entrance to the
strains of ``Take the `A' Train'' instantly sends the ensemble of
dancers, brilliantly costumed by Marianna Elliott, into
high-stepping overdrive. Set against designer James Leonard Joy's
splashy, abstract urbanscapes, the sequence feels like an Archibald
Motley Jr. painting sprung to life.
</P>
<P>
   But the number also underscores the hazards of mixing and
matching familiar tunes with unfamiliar contexts. For example, when
Duke first appears at a candle-lit piano, pouring his unrequited
passion into ``I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart,'' the lyrics are
too diffuse, too tangential to what's actually happening on stage
to register much impact.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington's songs have a self-contained, universalized
perfection that tends to work against the musical theater's
nuts-and-bolts need for specifics. Of the show's 21 songs,
elegantly orchestrated by Rahn Coleman, only about five or six
succeed in moving the singer from point A to point B.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the score often resembles a revue more than a
narrative. With a couple ofexceptions, so do the lively but
emotionally unexpressive dance numbers choreographed by Ellington's
granddaughter, Mercedes. And West's rough paraphrasings of
Shakespeare's text mostly fail to take up the poetic slack.
</P>
<P>
   One happy exception occurs when the mischievous trio of Jester,
Sweets and Miss Mary (well-performed by Kevin Ramsey, Clinton
Derricks-Carroll and Yvette Cason) urge Lady Liv's dour protector,
Rev (Richard Allen), to loosen up a little. Epps wittily sets the
scene to a pleasantly relaxed version of ``It Don't Mean a Thing If
It Ain't Got That Swing.'' Allen, a gifted vocal interpreter and
supple comic actor, supplies a bright spot as the puritanical Rev,
later reborn as a hip-swiveling, zoot-suited would-be ladies' man.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three principals, only Crawford, with her torchy soprano
and feline swagger, seems made for her part. The petite Belcon has
a dignified bearing and a rich, husky voice that bottoms out in
Marian Anderson territory _ fine attributes but perhaps too severe
for a Chaplin-esque schemer like Vy. Ruffin's honey-voiced Duke
unfortunately comes up flat once or twice, and his character, like
his performance, lacks psychological coloring.
</P>
<P>
   Like the uptight, ultra-respectable Rev, ``Play On!'' apparently
knows how to swing but seldom leaves itself room to do so. Apart
from the raunchy blues wailer ``Rocks in My Bed,'' performed by
Ramsey and Derricks-Carroll with exhilarating comic abandon, the
show's creators give a very wide berth to anything that might smack
of sexual raciness or ethnic caricature _ an understandable
instinct that nonetheless cramps their material.
</P>
<P>
   Why not explore, as Shakespeare does, the Duke's sexually
ambivalent attraction to Vy, a woman he believes to be a man? Might
there not be an interesting parallel here with Ellington's own
romantic attachment to his real-life collaborator Billy Strayhorn?
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reasons, such gray areas are beyond the ken of this
hot-color, but strangely cool-blooded show. &QL;

sipping mint-garlanded mojitos, sparkling flutes of
champagne-and-vodka mambo kings and lovely, apricot-toned
Floridians with squiggles of orange peel dangling from the rims of
the glasses. The scene is not at South Beach or in the Bahamas, but
on Madison Avenue, on the four-sided balcony bar at Asia de Cuba.

SHE'S `DROP DEAD GORGEOUS'   AND DROP DEAD NICE, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Given the insolent young women she has played so
convincingly in movies like ``Wild Things'' and the current beauty
pageant satire, ``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' it's a surprise to meet
Denise Richards and find her to be so darn ... nice.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not an act. Go behind the glamorous looks that have
left male moviegoers speechless (and women a little green with
envy), and you have an unfailingly polite, friendly Midwestern
woman who would have been perfectly at home in a Norman Rockwell
tableau _ if Rockwell had been into, say, Varga girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very nice; but when you look at her, you don't expect
that,'' says ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' director Michael Patrick Jann.
``She's a walking magazine cover, and you expect that a diva
attitude will come along with that. But she has a grace to her.
Sometimes it seems like she's holding something back when all it is
is that she doesn't want to say anything bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Things'' director John McNaughton agrees that
expectations don't jibe with reality when it comes to Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard Denise's name, I (heard) she was this
fabulously wealthy princess who was brought up by her parents in
some isolated palace tower and raised to be a movie star,''
McNaughton says. (Interestingly enough, that description fits
Richards' ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' character to a T.)
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I met her,'' McNaughton continues, ``I was kind of
intimidated by her obvious physical beauty and this myth. When we
got to know one another a little better, I asked her where she was
from _ trying to dig around a little, find out about the whole
palace tower thing. She told me she was from Chicago and that her
dad worked for the phone company.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the palace tower theory. Richards laughs _ and she
has a big, throaty roar _ about the way her looks inspire certain
presumptions in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some people that hope I'm a bitch,'' she
says, laughing with glee. ``Personally, I don't ever want to work
with someone who considers herself a diva, much less be one. Who
has time for that? If I ever got a big head, my family would be the
first people to put me back into line. I'm a nice person, and I
enjoy working with nice people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And from the way her career is steadily moving forward, people
seem to like working with Richards, too. After taking almost a year
off after ``Wild Things,'' Richards landed a part she seemed born
to play _ the Bond girl _ in the upcoming 007 feature, ``The World
Is Not Enough.'' Richards plays a nuclear scientist (!) named Dr.
Christmas Jones. Obviously, with a name like that (and with a
figure like Richards'), the actress won't be spending too much time
on screen wearing a lab coat.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Bond girl meant a six-month shoot in England, countless
hours spent doing silly things in front of a blue screen (``Acting
really is a ridiculous job,'' Richards says, again with the laugh)
and the inevitable offer to follow in her predecessors' footsteps
and pose nude for Playboy. Richards declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a very generous offer, but I didn't even have to
think about it,'' she says. ``It's not like I'm against nudity.
After all, I did that scene for `Wild Things.' And I'm comfortable
with my sexuality. But at the end of the day, Playboy isn't where
I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to that ``Wild Things'' scene. For those who missed the
movie (it was a bigger hit on video than in theaters), Richards
stripped down to her birthday suit for a steamy menage a trois with
Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon. She knew that by doing it she ran
the risk of being stereotyped, and sure enough, for months after
the movie opened, Richards was deluged with scripts containing
``eight-page lesbian scenes'' and other carnal acts. She passed and
didn't work for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was hard, but at the same time I'm trying to be a good
actress,'' Richards says, citing Susan Sarandon as a role model.
``I want to have a long career. I'd rather be a great actress than
be a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   Her patience has been rewarded. Richards was recently cast
opposite Ben Affleck and Luke Wilson in ``The Third Wheel,'' a
romantic comedy from Miramax that recently began filming. Richards
_ surprise _ plays Affleck's dream girl.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't always been known for glamour. Raised in the suburbs
of Chicago, Richards grew up as a tomboy, playing in the dirt,
eating bugs and hanging out with boys who did the same. Her
favorite Halloween costume speaks volumes: Richards loved dressing
up as a hobo. (Another blow to the princess theory.)
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around the age of 10, though, a transformation took
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' says Richards, who lists her age
as ``20-something,'' with sources putting it around 28. ``One day I
discovered makeup and clothes, and I've never gone back.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father and housewife mother moved the family (Richards has a
younger sister) to Oceanside when Richards was 15. She soon began a
modeling career, landing a YM magazine cover and a print campaign
for Bonnie Bell. She kept it a secret from all but her closest
friends, however, afraid of the teasing that might ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with modeling, she moved to Los Angeles after graduation
and landed parts on ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' ``Life Goes On,''
``Seinfeld'' and ``Melrose Place.'' (Richards played Loni
Anderson's daughter, a pretty good bit of ``Melrose'' casting.) She
also made several straight-to-video movies before landing a role in
1997's bugfest ``Starship Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   She had met ``Starship'' director Paul Verhoeven during an
audition for his sex romp ``Showgirls.'' Fortunately for Richards'
career, Elizabeth Berkley got the part. ``I don't think I could
have done it anyway,'' Richards says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her roles have revolved around her bombshell beauty, but
Richards brushes her glamorous image off as mostly smoke and
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't realize is all the work that goes into
looking like this,'' Richards says. ``I mean, when I'm on a movie
set, I'm in a trailer for two hours while they fuss with my hair
and makeup. Off the set, I don't think I'm any big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when she's not working, Richards can typically be found
wearing jeans and a T-shirt (sans makeup) and cruising the malls
with her sister (``my best friend,'' Richards says) and boyfriend
Patrick Muldoon (he co-starred with her in ``Starship Troopers'').
She even made a trip _ or three _ out to the cavernous Mall of
America when filming ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' in Minnesota. (``You
can't go more than 10 feet in any direction without running into a
Gap or Body Shop,'' Richards says.)
</P>
<P>
   Sounds ... nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved being back in the Midwest,'' Richards says earnestly.
``People are great back there. In Hollywood, if you're polite,
people usually think, `OK. What does she want?' I've had people
say, `You're so nice,' like they were suspicious that I had some
hidden agenda. In the Midwest, nice is nice.'' &QL;

BRIDGET FONDA DIVES INTO `LAKE PLACID'

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In her dozen years as a film actress, Bridget
Fonda's pale, slender beauty has lent itself to roles as a Single
White Female, a bong-smoking beach bunny and a waitress. Now, she's
trying something a little different _ playing a reluctant crocodile
chaser in the quirky/scary creature flick ``Lake Placid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a body-hugging black sweater set and slim skirt (from
which, she discovered, she hadn't yet removed the price tag),
Fonda, at 35, seems to look more like a Fonda every day. The lanky
frame and piercing eyes bear a strong resemblance to those of
father Peter, grandfather Henry and aunt Jane. Though she says she
has to watch her weight a bit more now than in the past, it's hard
to sympathize when she pinches what she imagines is a bit of fat on
her leg. (BEGIN ITAL) Please, (END ITAL) you think, (BEGIN ITAL)
allow me to show you what fat really looks like. (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   It may not be coincidental, then, that Fonda was offered the
lead role in ``Ally McBeal.'' The huge TV hit was created by ``Lake
Placid'' writer David E. Kelley; Fonda says she's just not
interested in doing television right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if something came along that I wanted to
do (on TV),'' Fonda said. ``I love the character and writing on
`Ally McBeal,' but my favorite part of making a movie is the
preparation. I'm not that spontaneous, to work on a series the way
they do, changing things up to the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   It's often said that Kelley is the busiest man in show business:
He has three shows on the air (``Ally,'' ``The Practice'' and
``Chicago Hope'') and finds time to write movies on the side when
he's not busy being a family man with wife Michelle Pfeiffer.
Everyone involved with ``Placid'' says Kelley's smart,
tongue-in-cheek writing was a main attraction in doing the film and
that Kelley was always available to make small tweaks when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never actually seen him on the set of anything, but he's
always there,'' said director Steve Miner. With credits that range
from ``Halloween: H20'' to TV's ``Dawson's Creek,'' Miner seems to
have been a natural choice to bring this mixture of horror and
dark, offbeat humor to the screen. ``We had a little trouble
setting (the movie) up,'' admits Miner, ``because people had a
little trouble understanding what kind of movie it was. But David
and I always knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda plays a paleontologist called in to figure out how a giant
crocodile may have made its way into a Maine lake. As part of her
preparation, Fonda paid a visit to the Museum of Natural History in
New York, where she was debriefed on the fine points of identifying
a crocodile from one of its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda admits she can relate to the insecurities of her
character, who's a bundle of insecurities because she's fresh off a
broken relationship and is out of her element in the wild. ``I
loved this character. She's been having a bad time. She's a bitch
because she's so afraid of being not good enough ... her
self-esteem is so low that she doesn't want to leave her cubicle
and her microscope,'' said Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   As for her own insecurities, Fonda admits she's afraid of
heights _ and doesn't relish looking back at her own work on film.
``I'm not that crazy about my own work ... I'll watch the dailies
and go to the premiere,'' Fonda said, ``but looking back _ I don't
really get into what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she grew up among Hollywood royalty _ or perhaps
because of it _ Fonda says she can relate to the fear that grows
from insecurity. But according to Fonda, who recently ended a long
relationship with actor Eric Stoltz and is currently dating
singer/actor Dwight Yoakam, she doesn't suffer from it when it
comes to feeling like she has to measure up against anyone else's
fame, or the Fonda ``legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sense of competition. That's probably from
being the child of someone famous,'' Fonda says, ``that I don't
look at fame as a register of anything real. Fame just doesn't mean
anything concrete. It's so changeable. You can't count on it. It
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda says that, unlike her father, who released a juicy
autobiography last year (``Don't Tell Dad: A Memoir''), she's
learned to keep a part of her life private. ``The way I grew up was
that there was no privacy. My father is very, very open,'' Fonda
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up thinking that's the way you had to be. But then,''
said Fonda, ``I found out I didn't want to be that way ... I had to
sort of learn how to not feel bad about not answering certain
questions. My natural instinct is to try to give an answer _ that's
the gracious thing to do. I'm a people pleaser, which makes me feel
bad about not giving an answer, but I'm also kind of shy and
private. So sometimes I'm torn.
</P>
<P>
   Workwise, Fonda says she's conscious these days of moving beyond
parts that cast her as merely window dressing: ``corsage parts,''
as she calls them. She says she'd be interested in developing her
own projects if she could ``find a way to do it: It takes time _
and a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Fonda says she's happy and grateful for the parts
she's gotten so far in her career and is just trying to take things
one role at a time. ``Do I think about my legacy? I can't really
think about that,'' Fonda said. ``If I think about that ... it's a
setup for a feeling of failure for me; I'll never measure up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get objective about my own work,'' Fonda admits, ``so
I just have to let go of that and hope other people like what I
do.'' &QL;

she's gotten so far in her career and is just trying to take things
one role at a time. ``Do I think about my legacy? I can't really
think about that,'' Fonda said. ``If I think about that ... it's a
setup for a feeling of failure for me; I'll never measure up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get objective about my own work,'' Fonda admits, ``so
I just have to let go of that and hope other people like what I
do.'' &QL;

POPULAR AUTHOR REMAINS A PARIAH IN HIS HOMETOWN

   SALINAS, Calif. _ Monty Roberts, the best-selling author and
acclaimed horse trainer, is a hero to horse lovers around the
world, but his name is still mud in Salinas, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after ``The Man Who Listens to Horses'' took the
literary world by storm and assured Roberts' celebrity, his
relatives still are boiling mad over its claims that his father was
a child abuser, killer, racist and cruel to horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monty sold his soul to the devil for money,'' said Salinas
taxidermist Al Martins, Roberts' cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Martins was among 200 friends of the late Marvin Roberts Sr. who
gathered Thursday at the Monterey County Sheriff's Posse Grounds to
celebrate publication of a book rebutting many of the basic claims
of his son Monty's million seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horse Whispers &AMP; Lies,'' written by Monty Roberts' niece Debra
Ann Ristau of Modesto and aunt Joyce Renebome of Galt, argues that
exaggeration, improbability, fibs, whoppers and fantasy so pervade
their relative's bestseller that it is essentially a work of
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Ristau and Renebome acknowledge that discrediting Roberts with
3,000 copies of their own privately published (Veracity Books,
Berkeley, 332 pages) book is like pinging away at an elephant with
a BB gun. Nevertheless, Ristau said, ``the truth does matter. I
know that somehow, some way, it will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty Roberts, 64, a trainer and breeder of thoroughbred stakes
winners at his Flag Is Up ranch in Solvang, has popularized a
nonviolent method of breaking or starting horses that he has
trademarked as ``join up.'' Roberts' public demonstrations of the
technique, in which an unbroken horse is gentled, saddled, bridled
and ridden in about 30 minutes draw gasps of astonishment and
appreciation from spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he developed the join up process in reaction to his
father's brutal treatment of horses and from his days alone in the
high desert of Nevada, where as a 13-year-old, he observed wild
horses and began deciphering horse language, which he calls
``Equus.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Roberts Sr., who died at age 77 in 1985, was a Salinas
icon _ a teacher, a police officer, and a horse trainer whose
techniques, some say, anticipated his son's.
</P>
<P>
   With his redoubtable wife, Marguerite, he schooled generations
of Salinas youngsters in horsemanship, instructed students in
traffic safety, and was widely regarded as a paragon of probity and
an indulgent parent.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Monty Roberts' assertions that his father
frequently beat him, was cruel to horses and was a racist who,
while on duty as a police officer, beat a black man to death jolted
Marvin Roberts Sr.'s family, friends and former students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monty was their golden boy, their tuxedo son,'' Joyce Renebome
said. ``We all knew Monty was arrogant and conceited ... but this
was indescribably reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bare-faced liar,'' said Larry Roberts, a former bronc
and bull rider who scoffed at several of his brother's claims,
including one that the late film star James Dean buddied up and
stayed with Monty at the Roberts house while filming ``East of
Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We slept in the same room, and if somebody's going to be
sleeping in my bed for four months, I'd know about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way in hell he went to Nevada to get wild horses.
... None of these things ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd just have left his parents alone, nobody would've said
anything,'' said Monty Roberts' childhood friend, Dick Gillott.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin and Marguerite Roberts have been memorialized at the
National Steinbeck Center in Salinas, where friends have raised
nearly $50,000 _ some of it at an auction Thursday _ to dedicate
the center's popular ``Red Pony'' exhibit to them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism of ``The Man Who Listens to Horses,'' Roberts
stands by the accusations he made against his father and goes from
triumph to triumph, both in the show ring and on the bestseller
lists. Monty Roberts' son Marty said Friday that his father had not
yet read the Ristau-Renebome book and had no comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   His second book, ``Shy Boy: The Horse That Came in From the
Wild'' (Harper Collins), a lavishly illustrated account of his join
up with a wild horse after a 100-mile chase, was published this
spring. It hit No. 1 on the Washington Post's bestseller list and
No. 2 on the New York Times list.
</P>
<P>
   Andree Forzani, a Carmel Valley horse trainer who knows the
Roberts family, called the venture that produced the book a sterile
and unoriginal stunt. ``Just to prove you could chase him (the
horse Shy Boy) until he was so tired you could catch him was plain
stupidity. ... It had a very Hollywood flair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ristau-Renebome book is somewhat shapeless, lacks narrative
flow and suffers from disorganization and repetition as it alleges
inconsistencies and errors of fact in Monty Roberts' book. Many of
the testimonials from friends and former students of Marvin Roberts
Sr. verge on hagiography.
</P>
<P>
   It is, nevertheless, unmistakably a cry from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvin and Marguerite didn't have much in their lives, but
they had their good names'' that their son has sullied, Ristau
said. ``It's so hard to disprove something that's just a total
imaginary thing.''

BLACKS UNVEIL STRATEGY TO ADD COLOR TO TV PROGRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Executives at Black Entertainment Television
don't admit relishing the major networks' lily White new fall
season, but they don't deny trying to take advantage of it to reach
more African-American viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say we're pleased,'' Debra Lee, president of BET,
told a gathering of critics here last week as she announced a slate
of 10 original movies _ all made with Black talent and money _ her
network will broadcast this fall. ``I mean, we're all part of the
African-American community, and we think that they should be part
of the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it does present an opportunity for us to showcase the
films that we're here to talk about . . and the other programming
that we plan to launch in the fall season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest commitment that BET has ever made to
original programming, so I think it does provide us a window of
opportunity. But we think the networks should be held accountable
for not showing the diversity in this country today.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not the only one who thinks so. None of the 27 new
comedies and dramas premiering on the top four networks this fall
has a minority in a leading role, and few have them in supporting
roles. So the NAACP announced June 13 that it would monitor and
seek action on what it called the ``virtual whitewash'' in fall TV
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The group's new NAACP Television &AMP; Film Industry Diversity
Initiative will monitor the entertainment industry. NAACP president
Kweisi Mfume called for congressional and Federal Communication
Commission hearings on licensing and ownership of networks, adding
that the campaign could lead to lawsuits and boycotts of
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have responded by saying that diversity is a
priority but that more work needs to be done. Meanwhile, Robert
Johnson, BET's chairman, said his network is already doing that
work with its original movies, which begin airing in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, Black business people and Black creative
people are saying, `We're going to solve this problem our way,' ''
he said. ``We're not going to do it the other way, we're going to
do it our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the actors involved in the movies, all of which are
adapted from the Arabesque line of African-American romance novels,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities for actors of color are definitely stronger
in the cable area,'' said Khalil Kain, who stars in ``Intimate
Betrayal.'' ``There is more interesting work available and more
work available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about what's going on with the NAACP, I think, is
valid only because nobody's actually talking about the fact that
there is a large number of actors that depend on work in television
to help pay their bills, to help support their lives. And if you go
an entire season with absolutely nothing available in TV, that
impacts the acting community hugely. Hugely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all very proud and respectful to have these
opportunities set forth,'' said Phil Morris, who stars in
``Incognito.'' ``We hope the networks follow suit. But we can't
wait for them. So on we go.'' &QL;

FILM BASED ON TRAGIC ROLE OF UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Almighty drug lord is hooked into most of the city's
hard-core crime. Heroic undercover agent vows to bring him down by
infiltrating the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer helps undo the ruthless gangsta but pays a
heavy price _ tearing his soul in the eternal struggle faced by
undercover cops who try to preserve their identity while
play-acting as hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
   It's the stuff of pure Hollywood, and it's coming to a theater
near you next month, in a Miramax film called ``In Too Deep''
starring Omar Epps, Pam Grier, Stanley Tucci, and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, as they say in Tinseltown, partly ``inspired'' by
one of the most searing real-life cop dramas this city has known:
Boston undercover operative Jeffrey Coy's final mission to topple
drug kingpin Darryl Whiting, a man whose power was reflected in a
nickname that even Hollywood chose not to top: ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-screenwriters/producers Paul Aaron (``A Force of One'') and
Michael Henry Brown (``Dead Presidents'') said they have produced a
contemporary Jekyll-and-Hyde police story that will scorch the
silver screen with the edgy reality of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In their good-triumphs-over-evil version, hero cop Jeffrey Cole
(Omar Epps) recaptures his own life after capturing Dwayne ``God''
Gittens, played in a projected breakthrough role by rapper/actor LL
Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   In the hauntingly true tale of Boston's undercover operator,
Jeffrey Coy emerged from his deep cover assignment _ which helped
send Whiting to prison for life _ financially broke and emotionally
spent. In 1994, at age 33, he committed suicide by hanging himself
from a belt slung over his bedroom door.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Coy says he fears that the upcoming celluloid story
will not serve as an everlasting epitaph, but it could be the final
indignity to a man who spent his last days unsuccesfully trying to
sell to moviemakers an authentic portrayal of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Jones, former chief of the Boston Housing Authority
police who launched Coy's undercover career, said he worries that
Hollywood's penchant for rewriting history might do a disservice to
Coy's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was an opportunity for him to become financially
stable, and in the long term his life would have been depicted in a
way that gave value and creedence to all the work he had done in
trying to make a difference,'' said Jones, who now serves as a
national consultant on community reinvestment.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron (Keanu Reeves's stepfather) said he had picked Coy's brain
about undercover work for several days after first reading a news
story about the case. Then he and Brown melded Coy's experiences
with those of undercover operatives in Los Angeles and New York,
and came up with a composite character that could be compared to a
sort of ``Serpico of the 'hood.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is set in Cincinnati, not Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the Jeff Coy story,'' Aaron said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said that because Coy died before the movie deal was
clinched, he did not receive any financial compensation for his
input, but might have had he lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``His death was a loss not only to Boston police,'' Aaron said,
``but to lots of people who may have been able to understand the
life of a cop better if he had been allowed to'' illuminate it.
</P>
<P>
   The promo for ``In Too Deep'' breathlessly describes the dilemma
of undercover detective Jeffrey Cole: ``Will he be able to separate
himself from the character he created after the mission is
finished, or will he lose himself in the same evil he hopes to
destroy? Now, with every friend he makes and every threat he faces,
he's getting one step closer to the man he's after, and one step
further from the man he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Coy found his identity as a religious and righteous
police officer overtaken by Jay Reed, the ruthless Rhode Island
drug dealer he'd adopted as his undercover alias.
</P>
<P>
   During nearly five years of undercover work, Coy had a gun
thrust into his chest in the Franklin Field housing complex, a
knife put to his throat at Orchard Park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, federal authorities recruited Coy to complete the
assignment he'd started under Jones: to infiltrate the organization
of Whiting, who'd come from New York and maneuvered to unite the
city's youth gangs into a drug-dealing force.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Jay Reed, Coy made undercover buys of cocaine, witnessed
money-laundering, and pistol-whipped a guy to avert suspicions that
he was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   But after eight months, Coy was pulled off the case. He was in
too deep: Holed up in an undercover apartment protected by actual
wolves, he snorted coke and swallowed Valium, trying to chase away
post-traumatic stress flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   He was also arrested for assaulting a police officer following
an altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a year of psychotherpay, Coy declared himself whole.
But he had trouble finding work that could be fulfilling to a man
whose star testimony helped defeat ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his last jobs: surveilling shoplifters at a Somerville
Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking redemption, Coy developed his own script about an
undercover cop. He hoped to star in the movie. But in 1994, Coy
rewrote the ending: He hung himself, fading his life to black.
</P>

<P>
   PADANARAM, Mass. _ They look like nothing else on the water.
</P>
<P>
   They enter a harbor as a beauty enters a room. The mere presence
of one in San Diego Bay earlier this year set the huge sailing
community there on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was saying, `Did you see? Someone brought a Concordia
yawl into the bay,' '' recalls Dan Nowlan, director of the Offshore
department of the US Sailing Association, the national governing
body for the sport. ``There are thousands of boats in San Diego
Bay, but this is the one everybody wanted to see.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way since the late Ray Hunt picked up Harrier,
his Concordia yawl, at the Abeking and Rasmussen shipyard in
Lemwerder, Germany, in 1955 and walked off with six firsts in six
races at Cowes, the prestigious international race week off
England. A year earlier, Dan Strohmeier won the Bermuda race on his
Concordia, Malay, at 39 feet the smallest boat ever to win that
celebrated contest.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday (July 16), 25 of these ocean aristocrats glided to
South Wharf by Dartmouth's Concordia Boatyard here to celebrate
their 60th anniversary, which was to have been held last summer but
was postponed because of a bad storm. There were also five owners
on hand who came without their boats. Kersten Prophet, who owns the
only Concordia in Germany, flew from the Baltic for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   These saltwater folk traded stories and fibs over libations that
evening and then raced a 15-mile course Saturday in the chop of
Buzzards Bay. The wind was out of the southwest at a spirited 20
knots, good air for the yawls.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are obsessed. ``We're all nuts,'' says Walter Schulz,
owner of Absynthe. ``But instead of fast women and booze, I've done
it with wooden boats.'' He first saw Absynthe a few years ago under
a tarpaulin. It was badly in need of repair. ``I opened the cover,
and that was the kiss of death,'' he adds, shaking his head. ``Life
has never been the same since.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, who owns the Shannon Boatyard in Bristol, R.I., finished
building a 43-foot, state-of-the-art, fiberglass sailboat last week
that will sell for $650,000. Yet he sails a Concordia, modest by
those standards. ``It keeps me in touch with the Phoenicians,'' he
explains.

   Such remarks surprise no one familiar with the Concordia
mystique. Owners of the yawls, built at 39 or 41 feet with their
mizzenmasts located behind the rudder post, will drop whatever they
are doing to sail. And they're great on water. ``The Who's Who of
America yachting got into these boats,'' says Brodie MacGregor, the
current owner of the Concordia Boatyard and organizer of the
reunion. More Concordias would have been here this weekend but for
the regatta at Edgartown and the New York Yacht Club cruise to
Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Concordia owners even have their own newsletter, published twice
a year by Skip Bergmann (owner of Paramour), in which they write
detailed narratives about endless maintenance and cruising.
</P>
<P>
   To own one of the 103 Concordia yawls made between 1938 and 1966
is to belong to a club as subtle as it is exclusive. ``It is a
cult,'' says Strohmeier, now 88, who has skippered 15 Bermuda and
18 Halifax races. A cult, yes, but an active one. No boat has been
lost yet, and almost all are still on the water _ a stunning
record.
</P>
<P>
   There are far more expensive boats to be had, far faster ones,
too. But then there is pride, first among the seven sins. In words
eerily intoned by other Concordia owners, John Bullard, who sails
Captiva, the yawl his father bought 34 years ago, says, ``I love
sailing into a harbor and watch everyone on every other boat turn
their heads.'' What's more, adds Ted Danforth, owner of Oriane,
``They all know the make. They ask, What number hull is that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Concordia yawl speaks about the values and taste of an owner
as do few other possessions. It is wooden boat in an age of
fiberglass, an elegant one in an inelegant time. ``If God had said
`yacht,' he'd have thought of a Concordia,'' says Danforth, who has
sailed on 150-foot schooners. ``It is an entirely simple elegance.
It is exactly the right size. It is the perfect Zen thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The yawl was built to cruise Buzzards Bay but excelled as an
ocean racer as well. It was designed in 1938 by Ray Hunt, better
known for the Boston Whaler, the deep V hull craft that
revolutionized the power boat industry; the 110 and 210 classes of
sailboats; and Easterner, the 12-meter that sailmaker Ted Hood said
was ahead of its time.
</P>
<P>
   But the driving force behind the Concordia yawl (and most
everything else in these parts) was the late Waldo Howland, who
owned the boatyard and tapped Hunt to design a boat after his
father's boat was destroyed in the hurricane of 1938.
</P>
<P>
   The first four Concordias were built in New Bedford and Boston.
After World War II, though, an extraordinary relationship began
between Concordia and the Abeking and Rasmussen shipyard in
Germany. From 1950 to 1966, the next 99 boats were built there,
then shipped from Bremen by steamer to Boston and towed through the
Cape Cod Canal to Padanaram, where they were finished. All of them
were built without a single contract. Everything was based on the
handshake.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, the Concordia is simply easy on the eyes. Up
close, it is an exquisite piece of work, crafted from oak, African
mahogany, locust, and butternut. Its spars were made of Sitka
spruce, its decks of teak, sometimes topped with canvas. ``Every
screw, visible or not, is lined up with the grain of the wood,''
says Bullard. ``You know the hands that screwed that screw.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it is spare. ``My father was always reducing things
to their essence,'' says Kinnaird Howland, one of his four sons.
</P>
<P>
   Waldo Howland wanted a boat that would be timeless. He got it in
the Concordia. Part of the allure of his yawls is that they have
never been out of fashion because they were not built to the
strictures of International Offshore Rule.
</P>
<P>
   When other boatyards built to the IOR, ``All the boats began to
look the same,'' says Dan Nowlan. ``None looked like the graceful
Concordia yawls.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard recalls that in 1975 he crewed on a boat in the one-ton
world championships that was considered the fastest in its class at
the time. By August 1976, it had been outdesigned. ``In nine
months, we went from the fastest in the world to a boat with no
chance,'' he says. It is notable, then, that a Concordia won the
Bermuda race in 1978, 24 years after its first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Howland abhorred what he called ``the IOR horror'' almost as
much as he despised fiberglass. ``That's not where the truth was,''
explains his son, who recalls his father asking, voice laced with
sarcasm, ``Why not have a fiberglass diningroom table? They're
easier to clean. Or why not a fiberglass violin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved wood,'' explains the younger Howland. ``It's kind to
the touch. It requires that you take care of it, and it's good to
take care of things. He felt that a wooden boat was something that
is worth having.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldo Howland had particular ideas about a lot of things. ``When
you had a daiquiri with my father, it had to be with Key limes, not
Persian limes,'' he adds. ``He could never get a decent one at a
bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat's sheer beauty explains in part why people pay $120,000
for a Concordia yawl in good shape _ seven times what one cost new
in the early Sixties. But never lost in its looks is its marvelous
sailing ability. It is a dream to handle in most conditions and
superb when it starts to blow. ``Two knowledgeable sailors can sail
that boat in almost any weather,'' says Larry Moulton of
Marblehead, owner of White Wave.
</P>
<P>
   The yawl is also narrow, heavy, wet, and a tight squeeze for the
crew of six needed for serious offshore racing. It doesn't like
light air. A new boat half its size has far more room below. ``It's
a canoe,'' says Kinnaird Howland. Worse, upkeep means the
hemorrhaging of time and money. But, he adds, none of this matters
because of ``the Concordia thing'' _ the mystique of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logic does not prevail here,'' concedes Rusty Aertsen, owner
of Snowbird and a smaller Concordia sloop, Kestrel. ``They grow on
you like golden retrievers.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was just what Waldo had in mind.

RESEARCHERS SEE MORE OMINOUS SIGNS OF GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Like an omen from the Book of Revelation, a
wispy, silvery-blue noctilucent cloud hovered over Colorado late
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't have been more appropriate. The cloud _ a
harbinger of climate change, some call it _ appears as global
warming research is becoming a major scientific industry in fields
ranging from atmospheric physics to biology.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are increasingly convinced that carbon dioxide gas
from the burning of fossil fuels is at least partly responsible for
the marked warming of recent years. And the warming is
accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every climate model says the same thing,'' said ocean
chemist Peter G. Brewer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute in Monterey. ``In the next decade, we might see the same
amount of warming that we saw over the last century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the diverse world of global warming research, the latest
projections suggest that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Coastal residents can look for rainier weather, and sea levels
could rise one to three feet around North America. Heavier rain and
higher seas would increase coastal damage during storms.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pacific ecosystem, especially fish that benefit much of
the West Coast economy, could be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of data showing there are big changes in marine
ecosystems from the tropics to the poles,'' said biological
oceanographer James P. Barry of the Monterey Bay Institute. For
example, ``if you look at the record from 1992 to now, there's just
been a precipitous decline in salmon stocks _ they're smaller and
have less fat.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ An ominous absence of icebergs in the Grand Banks shipping
lanes off Newfoundland might be an early warning sign of global
warming, Science magazine reported July 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ New York City will suffer repeated flooding in the next
century as global warming raises the sea level, soaking subways and
turning parts of Brooklyn into wetlands, said a report issued
jointly on June 29 by the Environmental Defense Fund and Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming might seem like an unreal issue to residents of
Northern California: They are shivering through one of the chillier
summers in long memory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such short-term coolings can't obscure the long-term
signal that it is getting warmer all over the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   New projections of global warming indicate it might be even
slightly worse than originally foreseen. Previously, scientists
expected an average planetary temperature rise of 1.4 to 6.3
degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years. Now they're looking at
a rise of 2.3 to 7.2 degrees, said Tom Wigley, a climatologist at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   That 1-degree difference in projections might seem slight, but
it equals the increase in average global temperature over the last
century, Wigley said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the worsened climate projections is the increased
success in controlling another pollutant: sulfur dioxide. While
carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide cools it. Until
recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would
counterbalance global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Now that hope is fading as nations establish tighter controls on
sulfur dioxide emissions, Wigley said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level
rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study
written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global
Climate Change in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the next century, the rates of rise in temperature and sea
level might occur up to seven times as fast as in the 20th century,
the Pew study adds.
</P>
<P>
   Computer models have indicated that global warming in the lower
atmosphere would be accompanied by high-altitude cooling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, professor Gary Thomas of the University of Colorado at
Boulder forecast that as the upper air cooled, beautiful
noctilucent clouds _ common in polar latitudes _ would appear at
southerly latitudes. The clouds are wispy and silvery-blue,
composed of very small ice crystals. They resemble cirrus clouds,
but are far higher, some 50 miles up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, 50 miles in the sky over Boulder, a silver-bluish
noctilucent cloud drifted overhead. It is the farthest south such a
cloud has been recorded, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The southerly drift of noctilucent clouds may be the miner's
canary of global warming, a signal of bad times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing are some dramatic effects that are far
greater than what the models are predicting'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the national response to global warming remains sluggish and
divided, in part because of fears that tough pollution-control
measures could hurt a vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are astonished that some members of Congress continue to
ignore warnings from the scientific community,'' said Walt Oechel,
a biology professor and director of the Global Climate Change
Research Group at San Diego State University. ``Climate scientists
from around the world are in wide agreement that global warming is
real and could greatly disrupt society.''

AMERICANS SHOW FAITH IN THE POWER OF GREEN TEA

<P>
   This summer, iced green tea has become the beverage of choice
for the health conscious, threatening to leave such standards as
black tea, coffee and even white wine in the dust. While some
drinkers are no doubt drawn to green tea for the novelty of it,
most are probably hoping that it will reduce their risk of certain
diseases, including cancer and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have indicated that green tea's pharmaceutical
properties may do just that. The tea contains polyphenols, powerful
antioxidants with cancer-fighting capabilities. Studies have
indicated that polyphenols may help protect against cancers of the
breast, lung, mouth and pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   But those studies were done in animals. The studies done in
humans, looking for green tea's effects on colon, rectal, stomach,
esophageal, pancreatic and bladder cancer, have had conflicting
results.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, all that has been proven for sure is that green tea
kills cancer cells in test tubes. There is epidemiological evidence
that the Japanese and the Chinese, who have been drinking a lot of
green tea for centuries, have a lower risk for several kinds of
cancer. Maybe it is the green tea, maybe it is something else. But
for many Americans, those laboratory studies seem to be enough to
start believing in green tea. Miriam Novalle, the owner of T Salon
T Emporium in Manhattan, says sales of green tea in her shop, which
carries 480 varieties of teas, of which 60 to 75 are green, have
risen 25 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't have to go to a tea shop. Last week, I found 22
varieties of green tea at one health food supermarket. There were
plain green teas and plenty of green teas flavored with ginger,
lemongrass, jasmine, spearmint, lemon verbena and citrus, as well
as those that had echinachea or ginkgo biloba, complete with claims
to health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Food and beauty products that loudly boast of green tea as an
ingredient have also proliferated. That same health food market had
three kinds of green tea pills, as well as a body cream containing
green tea and ginkgo biloba. It was not clear from the package what
the tea was suppose to do for the skin. But it is also not at all
certain that any product can claim bona fide health benefits just
because it contains green tea. Yet, many people seem willing to put
their faith in all kinds of unproven remedies, despite recent
history.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the oat bran craze? It turned out that people were not
willing to consume the large amounts that would reduce cholesterol.
And then there was the run on beta carotene supplements because
studies suggested the nutrient would reduce the risk of cancer.
Beta carotene in whole foods is indeed good for you, but clinical
trials determined that beta carotene supplements did not reduce the
risk of cancer and might actually increase it.
</P>
<P>
   Will green tea ultimately suffer the fate of oat bran? Stay
tuned. Among the studies under way are those trying to determine
whether green tea extract in the form of a pill would be effective.
But before consumers get to the point of taking a pill, research
will have to determine whether green tea is actually effective and
whether it is more effective than black tea; 95 percent of the tea
consumed in this country is black. Dr. John Weisburger, director
emeritus of the American Health Foundation in New York, doesn't
believe there is much difference between the two, but other
scientists disagree.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the caffeine question. Six ounces of green tea
has 25 milligrams of caffeine; black tea has about twice as much,
while brewed coffee has 105 milligrams. When green tea is
decaffeinated, it may lose some of its polyphenols, according to
studies at the Mayo Clinic. If it is decaffeinated by the water
process, the tea retains about 95 percent of the compounds. If it
is decaffeinated with ethyl acetate, which is also used to
decaffeinate coffee, it retains only about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With or without caffeine, not everyone likes the taste of green
tea, which can be astringent or bitter. But Ms. Novalle of T Salon
says the new spring teas, which have much younger leaves, are much
less astringent.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be no downsides to making green tea your drink
of choice. How much you have to drink before any health benefits
kick in is another unknown. Some studies suggest two or three cups
is enough; others say 10 cups.
</P>
<P>
   There is already green tea jelly and green tea ice cream. Can
green tea muffins be far behind? But how much green tea ice cream
would you have to eat to get enough of those polyphenols? And would
their effectiveness be canceled out by the cream and egg yolks?
</P>
<P>
   This week, at least, I think I'll take my green tea in a
smoothie with lush peaches. As a hot weather refresher, it can't
hurt.

SUMMER ACCENT ON HERBS

 This is the first of eight columns by Waldy Malouf, the chef and an
owner of Beacon in Manhattan. His collaborator on these columns is
Melissa Clark.  
 By WALDY MALOUF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If fresh fruits and vegetables are the vocabulary of summer,
fresh herbs are the accent, instilling the light dishes of the
season with character and liveliness.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs are so plentiful and full of flavor at this time of year
that I always find myself experimenting more than usual. But it's a
risky business _ these little things have very big flavors. They
can easily overwhelm a dish or, in combination, fight each other so
violently the dish is left in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't use herbs indiscriminately or with abandon. No matter
how casual the dish, there's rarely that
handful-tossed-in-at-the-last-minute. I prefer a lighter, more
subtle touch, one that lets the meat or fish or vegetable be the
star, and the herbs a complement to their natural flavors.
</P>
<P>
   I am, of course, especially careful with the stronger herbs like
tarragon, sage, cilantro and rosemary. It's fine to have a dish
flavored primarily with one of them, like tarragon chicken, but
then, it's best to use the herb by itself, or with just a little of
a light, fresh counterpart like parsley or chives. I'm also wary
about mint or cilantro in cooked dishes. They have a tendency to
taste medicinal once they are heated.
</P>
<P>
   Once I've settled on the specifics, I tend to use the same
technique with almost everything I cook with herbs, layering their
flavors so they can be tasted in all their permutations. I like to
start with a marinade or rub, and then finish the dish with chopped
fresh herbs _ stirred into a sauce at the end of cooking, tossed
into a salad that's served alongside or just sprinkled on as a
garnish.
</P>
<P>
   This lets you experience the herbs as they infuse the food while
it marinates, as they cook and change in the heat, and in their
natural state, lively and fresh, at the very end.
</P>
<P>
   This chicken dish is a perfect example of that layering, and of
my summertime experimentation. It shows how a wintry dish can be
transformed with herbs, and a lot of trial and error, into
something lighter and more seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   Roast chicken is classic with a brown sauce and mashed potatoes,
but I was looking for something lighter and brighter for the warm
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a compound, or flavored butter under the chicken skin
before roasting is a traditional way to add seasoning. But instead
of using just butter, I use a lighter mix of olive oil and butter.
And instead of using only three or four herbs, I use ten.
</P>
<P>
   For something that sounds so simple, it turned out to be one of
the harder dishes for me to develop. Deciding which herbs I would
use was the easy part. I picked the ones whose flavors I knew would
work well together. There are lots of fresh, minty-flavored ones _
cilantro, chervil, mint and parsley _ because they give the dish
its zesty, summery quality.
</P>
<P>
   The more complex, pronounced herbs _ licorice-flavored tarragon,
piney rosemary and woodsy thyme _ add depth. Chives, oregano and
sage round out the mix _ but there's no basil. I find that it
fights with tarragon and rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out the proper proportion of each herb was the tricky
part. I probably made this dish 20 times before I settled on a
combination I was truly happy with.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the rosemary would overpower everything, and I'd have
a chicken that tasted like Vicks Vaporub. Other times, the tarragon
would be too strong, and I'd have licorice chicken. One mix ended
up tasting grassy, like lawn mower clippings.
</P>
<P>
   We kept charts in the kitchen and marked off how much of each
herb we used in the butter mixture, and how we would modify the
next day's mix. All I wanted was a succulent chicken covered in a
very crisp skin with a layer of herbs underneath.
</P>
<P>
   We forged on. Eventually, I got the chicken I imagined, and the
herb mixture became one of the few things we measure in the
restaurant kitchen, to insure the right proportions.
</P>
<P>
   I serve the chicken with a bread salad, made with the same herbs
I use in the butter compound, plus lightly sauteed wild mushrooms
and fresh tomato. In the end, it's the earthiness of the mushrooms
that gives the chicken a final roundness and brings the entire dish
together.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, I cook this chicken on the rotisserie, but
you can easily roast it in the oven at home. The recipe for the
herb butter makes more than you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   Form the remaining butter into a log, roll it up in plastic wrap
and freeze it. It's a terrific thing to have on hand. Just slice
off a few coins whenever you want to add a little zing to grilled
meats, fish or vegetables. It's a perfect summer condiment. &QL;

   TEN HERB ROASTED CHICKEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, plus 4 hours' marinating time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 3{-pound chicken
</P>
<P>
   { cup plus 2 tablespoons Ten Herb Butter (see recipe), softened
</P>
<P>
   Reserved herb stems from Ten Herb Butter
</P>
<P>
   { cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   \ cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   Herbed and Mushroom Salad (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced chopped herbs like those in Ten Herb
Butter, for garnish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken on
its back. Using a small, sharp knife, make 6 incisions into bird:
one in meaty part of each drumstick (go through the flesh), one at
joints of thighs (go under skin) and two under skin of breasts (one
cut on each side). Turn chicken over and make an incision on upper
part of each thigh.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place { cup herb butter in a heavy-duty resealable plastic
bag. Snip off a corner of bag and use it like a pastry bag. Squeeze
butter from opening into incisions in chicken (try to use an equal
amount in each incision). Massage herb butter into chicken. If any
squeezes out of incision, wipe it into cavity.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stuff cavity with reserved herb stems. Rub remaining 2
tablespoons herb butter all over outside of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   4. Using a piece of kitchen string, truss chicken, beginning at
neck and tying legs together. Place chicken in a bowl and cover.
Let chicken marinate in refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   5. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place a rack in a roasting pan
and chicken on rack, breast side up. Roast chicken for 30 minutes.
Reduce oven to 300 degrees, and add chicken stock and wine to pan.
Roast chicken for another 25 minutes. Turn oven off and let chicken
rest inside it for another 15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Remove chicken from oven and pour off all chicken juices,
reserving them. Spoon fat offtop and measure drippings; you should
have about { cup. Reserve for salad.
</P>
<P>
   7. When ready to serve, carve chicken into 8 pieces. Place
Herbed Bread and Mushroom Salad on platter and top with chicken.
Garnish with chopped fresh herbs.

owner of Beacon in Manhattan. His collaborator on these columns is
Melissa Clark.  
 By WALDY MALOUF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If fresh fruits and vegetables are the vocabulary of summer,
fresh herbs are the accent, instilling the light dishes of the
season with character and liveliness.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs are so plentiful and full of flavor at this time of year
that I always find myself experimenting more than usual. But it's a
risky business _ these little things have very big flavors. They
can easily overwhelm a dish or, in combination, fight each other so
violently the dish is left in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't use herbs indiscriminately or with abandon. No matter
how casual the dish, there's rarely that
handful-tossed-in-at-the-last-minute. I prefer a lighter, more
subtle touch, one that lets the meat or fish or vegetable be the
star, and the herbs a complement to their natural flavors.
</P>
<P>
   I am, of course, especially careful with the stronger herbs like
tarragon, sage, cilantro and rosemary. It's fine to have a dish
flavored primarily with one of them, like tarragon chicken, but
then, it's best to use the herb by itself, or with just a little of
a light, fresh counterpart like parsley or chives. I'm also wary
about mint or cilantro in cooked dishes. They have a tendency to
taste medicinal once they are heated.
</P>
<P>
   Once I've settled on the specifics, I tend to use the same
technique with almost everything I cook with herbs, layering their
flavors so they can be tasted in all their permutations. I like to
start with a marinade or rub, and then finish the dish with chopped
fresh herbs _ stirred into a sauce at the end of cooking, tossed
into a salad that's served alongside or just sprinkled on as a
garnish.
</P>
<P>
   This lets you experience the herbs as they infuse the food while
it marinates, as they cook and change in the heat, and in their
natural state, lively and fresh, at the very end.
</P>
<P>
   This chicken dish is a perfect example of that layering, and of
my summertime experimentation. It shows how a wintry dish can be
transformed with herbs, and a lot of trial and error, into
something lighter and more seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   Roast chicken is classic with a brown sauce and mashed potatoes,
but I was looking for something lighter and brighter for the warm
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a compound, or flavored butter under the chicken skin
before roasting is a traditional way to add seasoning. But instead
of using just butter, I use a lighter mix of olive oil and butter.
And instead of using only three or four herbs, I use ten.
</P>
<P>
   For something that sounds so simple, it turned out to be one of
the harder dishes for me to develop. Deciding which herbs I would
use was the easy part. I picked the ones whose flavors I knew would
work well together. There are lots of fresh, minty-flavored ones _
cilantro, chervil, mint and parsley _ because they give the dish
its zesty, summery quality.
</P>
<P>
   The more complex, pronounced herbs _ licorice-flavored tarragon,
piney rosemary and woodsy thyme _ add depth. Chives, oregano and
sage round out the mix _ but there's no basil. I find that it
fights with tarragon and rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out the proper proportion of each herb was the tricky
part. I probably made this dish 20 times before I settled on a
combination I was truly happy with.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the rosemary would overpower everything, and I'd have
a chicken that tasted like Vicks Vaporub. Other times, the tarragon
would be too strong, and I'd have licorice chicken. One mix ended
up tasting grassy, like lawn mower clippings.
</P>
<P>
   We kept charts in the kitchen and marked off how much of each
herb we used in the butter mixture, and how we would modify the
next day's mix. All I wanted was a succulent chicken covered in a
very crisp skin with a layer of herbs underneath.
</P>
<P>
   We forged on. Eventually, I got the chicken I imagined, and the
herb mixture became one of the few things we measure in the
restaurant kitchen, to insure the right proportions.
</P>
<P>
   I serve the chicken with a bread salad, made with the same herbs
I use in the butter compound, plus lightly sauteed wild mushrooms
and fresh tomato. In the end, it's the earthiness of the mushrooms
that gives the chicken a final roundness and brings the entire dish
together.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, I cook this chicken on the rotisserie, but
you can easily roast it in the oven at home. The recipe for the
herb butter makes more than you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   Form the remaining butter into a log, roll it up in plastic wrap
and freeze it. It's a terrific thing to have on hand. Just slice
off a few coins whenever you want to add a little zing to grilled
meats, fish or vegetables. It's a perfect summer condiment. &QL;

<P>
   TEN HERB ROASTED CHICKEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, plus 4 hours' marinating time
</P>
<P>
   1 3{-pound chicken
</P>
<P>
   { cup plus 2 tablespoons Ten Herb Butter (see recipe), softened
</P>
<P>
   Reserved herb stems from Ten Herb Butter
</P>
<P>
   { cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   \ cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   Herbed and Mushroom Salad (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced chopped herbs like those in Ten Herb
Butter, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken on
its back. Using a small, sharp knife, make 6 incisions into bird:
one in meaty part of each drumstick (go through the flesh), one at
joints of thighs (go under skin) and two under skin of breasts (one
cut on each side). Turn chicken over and make an incision on upper
part of each thigh.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place { cup herb butter in a heavy-duty resealable plastic
bag. Snip off a corner of bag and use it like a pastry bag. Squeeze
butter from opening into incisions in chicken (try to use an equal
amount in each incision). Massage herb butter into chicken. If any
squeezes out of incision, wipe it into cavity.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stuff cavity with reserved herb stems. Rub remaining 2
tablespoons herb butter all over outside of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   4. Using a piece of kitchen string, truss chicken, beginning at
neck and tying legs together. Place chicken in a bowl and cover.
Let chicken marinate in refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   5. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place a rack in a roasting pan
and chicken on rack, breast side up. Roast chicken for 30 minutes.
Reduce oven to 300 degrees, and add chicken stock and wine to pan.
Roast chicken for another 25 minutes. Turn oven off and let chicken
rest inside it for another 15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Remove chicken from oven and pour off all chicken juices,
reserving them. Spoon fat offtop and measure drippings; you should
have about { cup. Reserve for salad.
</P>
<P>
   7. When ready to serve, carve chicken into 8 pieces. Place
Herbed Bread and Mushroom Salad on platter and top with chicken.
Garnish with chopped fresh herbs.

WINE TALK: JOURNEYING INTO THE WORLD OF THE UNFAMILIAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a vacation without guilt? For most Americans, no vacation
at all. Elsewhere in the world, a trip to the beach is a mindless,
happy frolic in the sun. An American takes a book, a serious book.
``Irregular French Verbs,'' perhaps, or a Dostoyevsky novel. And
doesn't read either one.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a self-improvement course of a different sort. Stay with
it and you'll love it; drop out and it won't make the slightest
difference to anybody. You'll just miss out on a few very good
wines.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is white wine season, and Americans drink more white wine
than anybody, most of it California chardonnay. Much of it is
excellent, but nevertheless there are hundreds of alternatives,
probably thousands. Many may be hard to find at your local
purveyor, as Americans are stick-in-the-muds when it comes to wine.
They find something they like and stay with it.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps we can change that. Just for the summer, why not
join me while we explore some little-known white wines? A tour
d'horizon, as it were, of the world's white grape vineyards.
There's nothing to sign, and no one will call. There are even a few
chardonnays on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The only serious contender to the chardonnay crown in this
country is sauvignon blanc. Almost everyone in California makes a
sauvignon blanc, but we're going to go far afield to search for
others: to New Zealand and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Sauvignon blanc is at its best, I think, when it has good acid
and the taste and smell of green vegetables. There are good ones
from France, but New Zealand astonished the wine world a few years
back with Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc, a delicious, pungent wine
that seems to take your breath away. Cloudy Bay is still hard to
find _ it's that popular _ but there are other excellent sauvignon
blancs from New Zealand. Try Stoneleigh's, for example, or the new
Seresin, or one from Brancott.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's Mulderbosch sauvignon blanc is normally a bit
more fleshy than the New Zealanders' but gives up none of the
exciting bite and herbaceousness that characterizes these great
wines. Mulderbosch sauvignon blanc can be as hard to find as
Springsteen tickets, but rest assured, it's worth the search.
</P>
<P>
   If there is such a thing as an offshore grape, it's vermentino,
which grows on Corsica and thrives on Sardinia. Probably related to
the malvasia family, vermentino produces an assertive, full-bodied,
slightly lemony white wine that's just right for summer. Sella &AMP;
Mosca, Sardinia's best-known winemaker, turns out a delicious
vermentino.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mix up pinot gris and pinot blanc: both are white
wine grapes, and both are derived from pinot noir, the red wine
grape of Burgundy. Pinot blanc has more body and a more pronounced
bouquet than pinot gris, which tends to be softer. Both grapes are
more popular in Eastern Europe than in the West, except for Alsace,
where pinot blanc weighs in as a respectable featured player billed
just below riesling and gewuerztraminer.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger's pinot blanc is a worthy example of what Alsace
can do with the grape. The wine is lean and flavorful, but with
little of the complexity of a good riesling. In Santa Barbara
County, Calif., Au Bon Climat makes a delicious pinot blanc.
</P>
<P>
   For pinot gris, we'll pass over the obvious, the many Italian
pinot grigios, and settle on an Oregon version from the King
Estate, a relatively new player on the Oregon scene.
</P>
<P>
   More and more Oregon wineries are experimenting with pinot gris,
with interesting results. The best are fresh, lively wines, often
with an intriguing mineral taste. They might give Oregon chardonnay
some serious competition.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing exotic about a wine from St.-Veran; it's
basically a good Macon blanc with an upgrade. The Macon region,
technically a part of Burgundy, is a huge, white-wine-producing
region between Burgundy proper and Beaujolais. About 30 years ago,
the powers that be combined six towns near Pouilly-Fuisse into one
appellation, St.-Veran. The wines, 100 percent chardonnay, often
approach Pouilly-Fuisse in quality and are invariably cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   From Galicia in Spain's wet and wild northwest corner comes
Albarino, a wine high in alcohol and rich in both body and flavor.
It has been compared with France's viognier but is, to my taste,
more restrained and elegant. Albarino is one of only a handful of
Spanish varietals, wines identified by the name of the grape. And
while little known outside Spain, it is arguably Spain's finest
white wine.
</P>
<P>
   Equally obscure is Italy's arneis, a wine found almost
exclusively in the Piedmont, where for years it was used to soften
wines like Barolo, made from the powerful nebbiolo grape. Because
of this connection, it was once known mostly as the nebbiolo
bianco, or white nebbiolo. The best-known arneis is made by Bruno
Giacosa, who is known principally for his red wines. Angelo Gaja
introduced me to arneis in a little restaurant near his winery in
Alba.
</P>
<P>
   Marsanne and roussanne are the white wine stars of the Northern
Rhone Valley. Marsanne is more plentiful and is more readily found
blended into the region's better white wines like St.-Joseph,
Crozes-Hermitage and white Hermitage. In California, it turns up
now and then as a varietal. Roussanne, the more attractive of the
two, has an aroma that has been likened to green tea. Its
pronounced acidity enables it to age for many years. Chateau de
Beaucastel in Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Bonny Doon Vineyard in
California both make delicious roussannes.
</P>
<P>
   For New Yorkers, particularly those who regularly frolic on the
golden strands of the Hamptons, an enticing little reward awaits
them if they travel to Long Island's North Shore: it's the
gewuerztraminer at Lenz Winery in Peconic. Gewuerztraminer is not
for everyone; its pungent flowery bouquet and pronounced taste can
be off-putting for the faint of heart. But this is summer and, for
even the most timid enophiles, a time for adventure. What's more _
and this from an old gewuerz fan _ Lenz's version of this Alsatian
favorite is delicious.
</P>
<P>
   And there you have it. Not a long list, but a reasonably serious
one. And _ be honest, now _ more fun than Dostoyevsky on the beach.

DISSOLVING YEAST IN MILK OR WATER  
 EXPLAINING MODIFIED FOOD STARCH  
 CHIPOTLE CHILI POWDER, SO DISTINCTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why does yeast dissolve in water but clump in milk? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yeast will clump in any liquid that is cold, whether water or
milk. The temperature must be around 105 degrees to dissolve it.
But milk, unlike water, needs to be scalded first, or heated to 198
degrees, to break down enzymes that inhibit the growth of the
yeast. After scalding, the milk must be cooled to 105 degrees (it
will feel very warm to the touch) and then stirred to eliminate any
hot spots that can kill the yeast. (Uneven heating is common with
milk because of its fat and protein content.) The yeast can then be
safely added. However, it's much easier and less risky to dissolve
yeast in a small amount of warm water and to add the milk later.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Modified food starch is listed as an ingredient in many
foods. What is it made from, and why is it used? Are there any
health drawbacks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Modified food starch is simply a starch from a vegetable like
corn that has been chemically treated to make it easier to
incorporate into processed foods like puddings and gravies. It may
also be found in baby food, where it works to keep the purees from
secreting liquid. According to the Food and Drug Administration,
modified food starch is perfectly safe to consume. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I want to make a chili recipe that calls for chipotle chili
powder. Can I use regular chili powder instead? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Chipotles are actually smoked jalapenos. It's difficult to
find a substitute for the powder because the flavor is so
distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Kalustyan's _ at 123 Lexington Avenue (28th Street) in New York
City; (212) 685-3451 _ sells chipotle powder for $3.99 for 4
ounces. The store also fills mail orders.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor fades as the powder sits, so you may want to buy
whole chipotle chilies ($3.49 for 1.25 ounces at Kalustyan's),
which keep almost indefinitely. To use them, toast them in a dry
skillet for about a minute on each side and then grind them in a
food processor or by mortar and pestle.
</P>
<P>
   You could also consider the canned chipotle chilies in adobo
sauce sold in large supermarkets and Mexican markets. Stirring in
one or more of the chopped chilies will impart that characteristic
smoky taste to your chili.

ANOTHER SIDE OF EGGPLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eggplant is so strongly associated with the cuisines of Italy
and southern France that no matter what the cooking method, it is
usually prepared with olive oil and garlic. But with a few changes,
you can make a relish that turns a plain boneless chicken breast
into an unusual and appealing dish.
</P>
<P>
   The flavors of ginger, shallots and cilantro, which I prefer
here, are not strictly linked to any style of cooking, nor are they
the only possible ones. If you want a more traditional dish,
substitute garlic for ginger (or use half of each to make the
total) and revert to olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting additions include seeded and chopped tomatoes,
stirred in at the last minute to boost color as well as flavor; the
combination of tomatoes and ginger is unexpectedly pleasant. (Peel
the tomatoes if you like, but I don't think it's worth the effort
in this case.) Or you could cook some chopped red or yellow bell
pepper along with the eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of grilling or broiling chicken breasts to serve with
the eggplant mixture, you could use any reasonably tender steak of
beef, pork or lamb, or a sturdy piece of fish like tuna or
swordfish.
</P>
<P>
   Some may wonder whether or not to salt the eggplant. For years,
I believed this time-consuming step aided in browning. But browning
is more of an issue when you slice eggplant and want crisp
tenderness. Here you want it to become soft, almost mushy, so don't
waste your time salting.
</P>
<P>
   Do spend a few extra minutes to cook the shallots before the
eggplant, letting them brown and begin to soften. And hold out the
ginger until near the end. Ideally, this dish combines creamy
eggplant with tender but slightly crunchy shallots and sharp
ginger. With the cilantro, it's downright exotic. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN BREAST WITH EGGPLANT, SHALLOTS AND GINGER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces shallots (about 6 large)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1\ pounds eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger or 2 teaspoons dried ginger
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts (4 half-breasts)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup or more minced fresh cilantro for garnish, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Peel shallots. If they are small, leave them whole.
Otherwise, cut them in half the long way. (Most large shallots have
two lobes and will naturally divide in half as you peel them.) Heat
the broiler or a gas or charcoal grill.

COVERAGE OF KENNEDY TRAGEDY AN EXAMPLE OF MEDIA OVERKILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT PLEASANT, Mich. _ John F. Kennedy Jr. was missing. His
private plane was flying to Martha's Vineyard, disappeared from
controllers' radar screens and didn't land on time. The Coast Guard
launched a search, as it does in every case of a missing aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The media went gaga.
</P>
<P>
   I had been out in the woods of Northern Michigan for a week, and
returned Saturday, stopping off at a laundromat in Mio, Mich., a
tourist town on the Au Sable River, to wash my filthy camp clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Like many public places, the Sit and Spin Laundromat has a
television. When I walked in, the tube was showing pictures of
water with a ``Breaking News'' logo.
</P>
<P>
   Was it another Flight 800? Was the president's plane missing?
Had a cruise ship gone down, with the Coast Guard desperately
pulling children and grandmothers from the icy ocean? Had
terrorists or some rogue nation managed to torpedo the USS Harry S.
Truman, the United States' newest and most powerful aircraft
carrier, provoking World War III?
</P>
<P>
   I noticed something else. No one was watching.
</P>
<P>
   I got closer to the TV so I could hear the sound. No one had
turned it up. The rumble and clatter of the washers and driers,
along with the bangs and squawks from the lineup of video games and
a couple of old-fashioned pinball machines, made it hard to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The picture cut to Dan Rather. I got close enough to hear him
explain, obviously for what seemed to the 47th time for the benefit
of those who just tuned in, that the airplane piloted by John F.
Kennedy Jr. was missing. Details remained sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I understood why no one was watching.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people my age, I will never forget where I was that
November afternoon in 1963 when Kennedy's father, President John F.
Kennedy, was murdered in Dallas. I was in the third grade at St.
Helen School in Saginaw, Mich., and the principal, Sister Marie
James, was in tears as she announced the assassination of the
president on the school's public address system.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot forget the photograph of the president's son,
John-John, saluting his father's casket. Great photos are great
photos, and it still brings a lump to my throat.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the emptiness I felt after the killing of Robert
Kennedy in California in 1968. The world had gone crazy. But life
went on. The story was over, except for the supermarket tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in high school and college, it seemed that not a week
went by without some sleazy tale about Jackie O. I ignored it all.
</P>
<P>
   About the time John Jr. got his law degree, I started making
decisions about what to put in news reports, first in broadcast,
later in print. I was aware Kennedy had had trouble passing the bar
exam, but I also knew he passed eventually. He was just like
thousands of other aspiring lawyers. His failures and his successes
weren't news, as far as I was concerned. The New York media kept up
their heavy breathing and Kennedy became famous for being famous.
</P>
<P>
   He started a magazine about politics. He called it ``George.''
I, too, have dreamed of starting a magazine. What stopped me was
the fact that I didn't know enough rich people to cover the
inevitable startup costs.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. had money and knew rich people.
</P>
<P>
   I bought George on the newsstand because its edgy attitude
appealed to me. I bought it despite the fact it was edited by a
Kennedy, not because of it. I bought it because it was a good
magazine. I suspect JFK Jr. would have appreciated that.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. was famous and had an impact on society,
both through his charitable work and his specialty magazine. His
passing is tragic. It certainly was news. But the wall-to-wall
coverage given the event by the national media was overkill, pure
celebrity-driven hype.
</P>
<P>
   The customers of the Sit and Spin understood that. They sent the
message loud and clear by turning away from the TV and dropping
quarters into the video games.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Her friends and supporters put on their
protest T-shirts, carried ``Prisoner of Conscience'' signs and even
brought flowers to greet her as she left the federal prison on
Monday. But Kathleen Rumpf, a New Yorker and a roaming protester
for left-wing causes, never showed up. On the day of her scheduled
release from the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, where she served
a year for spray-painting a sign outside a controversial U.S. Army
post in Georgia, Rumpf started another protest _ she is refusing to
promise to pay her $2,000 fine, imposed when the judge sent her to
prison. EDS: Will be updated with any spot developments. By CHRIS

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Phil Morris must have found the whole thing
professionally unsettling or, at least, personally amusing. One
moment he's a B-list actor whose last TV credit was The Love Boat:
The Next Wave on a D-list network. The next, he's resurrecting his
recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie
Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry
Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David. And slated for 8:30
Thursday nights, no less. Reporters who normally scurry by Morris

years ago. By BUD KENNEDY. Story will move in ``k'' commentary

 &HT;    CAPE COD: THE KENNEDY LEGEND AND MUCH MORE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ Our travel plans to Cape Cod had not
included a sunny weekend of staking out the Kennedy compound
overlooking the sparkling blue waters of Nantucket Sound.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, that's what happened after my wife, Sherry,
clicked on the TV in our hotel room and said, ``Hey, you'd better
come look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Before journalistic duty called, however, we had explored other
parts of the scenic peninsula that extends 70 miles into the
Atlantic. There's much more to the Cape than the exclusive Kennedy
enclave, a cluster of white clapboard houses that has served as a
TV backdrop since John F. Kennedy Jr.'s private plane disappeared
into the waters off the nearby island of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Cod is shaped like a flexed arm with the Massachusetts
mainland at the shoulder, the Chatham Lighthouse at the elbow, Cape
Cod Bay above the biceps, and funky old Provincetown at the fist.
</P>
<P>
   Spread over the Cape's 399 square miles are 15 towns _ similar
to counties, each containing several villages. Hyannis Port, for
instance, is a village in the town of Barnstable.
</P>
<P>
   With about 560 miles of shoreline, there are stretches of
crowded beaches, scores of secluded coves, dozens of docks, a
desert of sand dunes, 13 lighthouses and waves of waterfront
restaurants where the staples are local lobsters and clam chowder.
</P>
<P>
   Along the crowded sidewalks of Main Street in Hyannis and
Commercial Street in Provincetown, there are all sorts of bars,
shops and eateries and pedestrians. The style ranges from tattooed
torsos in tank tops to polo shirts, cargo shorts and Topsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims explored Cape Cod before deciding to settle in
nearby Plymouth. Sandwich, the Cape's oldest town, was established
in 1637. Naturally, history provides much of the allure for
tourists. There are museums and weathered old shingled houses and
antique shops galore.
</P>
<P>
   We took two drives along 6-A, the scenic road also known as the
Old King's Highway, that winds along the northern shore of the Cape
from the Sagamore Bridge to Provincetown, although at times it
merges with the multi-lane Highway 6.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was formidable. The year-round population of about
208,000 swells to more than 500,000 between Memorial Day and Labor
Day. With many winding byways and small communities, there are
frequent ``rotaries'' _ the local term for terrifying traffic
circles where three or five roads converge.
</P>
<P>
   Route 6-A provided glimpses of the restored houses of sea
captains, many set in yards abloom with blue hydrangea. Two
centuries ago, Cape Cod was the bustling home port for whaling
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the road wound beneath a canopy of leafy interlocking
branches, and at other times it passed prairies of salt marshes or
inlets crowded with sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, passing through the town of Orleans, we drove down
a side street to the Rock Harbor docks and found the seafood shanty
of Cap'n Cass. A charitable adjective would be ``rustic'' for the
tiny place, where old buoys served as decor. But our meal was
delicious _ a salad of lobster and crab meat surrounded by wedges
of fresh tomatoes from nearby gardens. We drank iced tea, but
noticed that other diners, aware of local blue laws, had brought
their own bottles of wine or small coolers of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps liquids were on our minds because a few hours earlier we
had traversed the hot, dry and seemingly endless sand dunes in the
Cape Cod National Seashore _ 20,000 acres of undeveloped terrain
that President John F. Kennedy preserved in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1946, Art Costa has been conducting tours of the inner
dunes near Provincetown. Riding in an aging Chevy Suburban on
under-inflated tires, we crossed miles of sand, passing scrub oaks
and pitch pines that were more like shrubs than trees, and
marveling at the few remaining dune shacks where folks still live
without electricity or running water.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Eugene O'Neill and automotive mogul Henry Ford once
owned dune shacks here, our driver declared. But he couldn't shed
much insight on why anyone would want to live amid such hardship
and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be a good place to have a party,'' he reckoned. ``You
could whoop and holler all you want, with no neighbors to
complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Running out of ice would be catastrophic, however.
</P>
<P>
   Art's Dune Tours, which cost $12 and last about an hour, begin
and end in Provincetown, where the Pilgrims first landed in the New
World in 1620. Nowadays, P-town's Commercial Street offers a
lively, tawdry strip of T-shirt shops, art galleries, sidewalk bars
and restaurants near the docks that was reminiscent of both Key
West and the New Orleans French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brassy men wearing miniskirts and Dolly Parton wigs rode
tricycles down the street and passed out invitations to the Barbie
Drag Review. Families lined up nearby to take the Portuguese
Princess out to watch whales in Cape Cod Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Another center of activity on the Cape is Main Street in
Hyannis, where the promenade continues practically around the
clock. Indeed, we ate two meals at Main Street establishments on
one Saturday _ an 8 a.m. breakfast at The Egg and I and an 11 p.m.
dinner at the Hyannis Brewing Company. Both seemed great _ perhaps
because all we had to eat in the intervening 17 hours was an ice
cream cone at the Four Seas. This was the day after the Kennedy
plane went down, so there wasn't much time to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The Egg and I serves only breakfasts. We went for the regional
fare _ cranberry pancakes for me and crab cakes egg benedict for
Sherry. Sticking with this theme for our late dinner, we both
ordered baked lobster topped with a seafood mixture of shrimp, crab
meat and scallops. No complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few miles from Main Street, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. bought
a beach house in Hyannis Port in 1929. A decade later, the Four
Seas shop opened in nearby Centerville. Four generations of
Kennedys have eaten its ice cream _ charging their cones, since
vacationing members of the family rarely carry cash. The homemade
peach was Jacqueline Kennedy's favorite flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Kennedy compound is several houses around a
cul-de-sac in a quiet waterfront neighborhood. The best way to view
the houses and their private beach is from the boat cruises that
leave from Hyannis Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overstate the Kennedy presence around Hyannis.
</P>
<P>
   The John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum is located on Main Street,
and its exhibits focus on the Kennedy family's ties to the Cape.
The John F. Kennedy Memorial is located in a park overlooking
Hyannis Harbor. There is a Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Memorial Bowling
Alley, and the lobby of the Four Points Sheraton, the hotel where
we stayed, is decorated with pictures of the Kennedy family at the
Cape.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Lore has it that Muhammad Ali is partial to the rice
and beans. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. liked the fried
chicken, Sammy Davis Jr. and Cab Calloway the corn muffins and
catfish. And Mayor Harold Washington held legendary strategy
sessions over the baby back ribs and black-eyed peas.
</P>
<P>
   The place is Army &AMP; Lou's, smack on the South Side of Chicago, a
city that over the years became perhaps the greatest stronghold of
soul food in the North. Army &AMP; Lou's, like soul food itself, is
still a stalwart, still serving chitterlings and smothered chicken,
still attracting politicians like Mayor Richard M. Daley and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson to take the pulse of the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But soul food in Chicago has been breaking out of some of its
familiar boundaries _ geographically and gustatorially. At new
``soul'' restaurants in new neighborhoods, the catfish may be
studded with pecans and the cook may not even be black. And as soul
food branches out, it reflects changes in the city, in Chicago's
black population and in the very role of soul food itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Chicago has become far more diversified,'' said Sterling
Plumpp, a professor of African-American studies and English at the
University of Illinois at Chicago. ``African-American culture has
arrived to the point where it's being accepted in other
communities, and African-American cuisine is being mainstreamed.
There are select geographies in the city now where skin color is
not used as a passport for participation in communal life.''
</P>
<P>
   That is no small feat in Chicago, still one of the country's
most segregated cities, where, beginning early in the century,
waves of blacks migrating from the South clustered primarily on the
South and West Sides. Soul food, passed down through generations of
plantation and sharecropper families, swept into these
neighborhoods the same way the blues did, as people from
Mississippi and Georgia and Alabama brought their mothers' or
great-aunts' recipes for sweet potato pie, collard greens and the
parts of the hog like the feet and intestines that were
traditionally left to slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them set up cafes, which became pivotal gathering
places. Black celebrities and sports stars stopped in, and
politicians of all races knew the value of visiting prospective
voters there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost, in some way, as important as the church or the
barbershop or the beauty parlor,'' Plumpp said. ``It's a safe place
to meet and talk and discuss. At a time when the city was not as
open to African-Americans as it is now, it was a place to call
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some soul food restaurants still serve that purpose, but others
are simply intended to be entertaining places to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul food has quote-unquote come out of the closet, and it's
no longer perceived as scraps,'' said Dolores Reynolds, the latest
owner of the 54-year-old Army &AMP; Lou's.
</P>
<P>
   But another kind of stratification is taking place, Plumpp and
others say. The blacks and whites who eat at the new soul food
restaurants like the Shark Bar, where pork chops sell for $14.95,
rarely make it to more traditional, less expensive places like
Nina's on the far West Side, where pork chops cost only $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the assimilation of soul food is traveling in both
directions, with some of the old-timers braiding in new ideas. At
Army &AMP; Lou's, Ms. Reynolds has tried to sprinkle in updated
approaches, using turkey instead of bacon to season collard greens
and replacing fatty pork neck bones with beef, without alienating
her regulars or disregarding the homespun tradition of soul food.
When she took over the restaurant seven years ago, the patrons were
about 80 percent old-timers, ``which really worried me,'' she said.
Now about half are new diners.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in homage to the ``Amistad'' movie and opera craze,
she whipped up a spicy black-eyed-pea soup with okra and tomatoes
and called it M'baazi. It's still on the menu, but to keep her
regulars comfortable, she deleted the African name and calls it
black-eyed-pea and okra soup.
</P>
<P>
   More seismic changes are noticeable at places like Soul Kitchen,
a colorful, eclectic restaurant in the Soho-esque Wicker Park
neighborhood. The menu is a melange of Cajun, Caribbean and even a
few Indian, Mediterranean and Mexican influences. Many dishes are
piled high in arty layers, like the fried green tomato special
stacked like a napoleon with smoked trout and horseradish sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few classic soul food dishes are served, and even those
take liberties. The catfish is gussied up, coated with pecans,
sauteed and flavored with Dijon mustard and lemon juice. Grits
arrive with Cajun shrimp, tasso, mushrooms, tarragon, scallions and
Herbsaint, an anise-flavored liqueur. Monique King, who until
recently was the chef, said she made the grits not with water or
even milk but with heavy cream, Parmesan and a little nutmeg,
``treating them a little more like polenta.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King, who is of Puerto Rican descent, is well aware that the
``soul'' in Soul Kitchen is a metaphorical emotion rather than a
literal culinary tradition. She said she occasionally hears a ``How
dare you?'' from customers, ``mostly people of color.'' But she
said she sees her menu's mission as a melding of tastes from many
cultures. ``What makes us the same as any sort of soul food place
is the notion of making not the most fancy ingredients out there
taste good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of the Loop at the Shark Bar _ part of the New York,
Los Angeles and Atlanta chain _ soul food sticks closer to
tradition but still hits the trends. The menu features pork chops
smothered in skillet gravy and honey-dipped fried chicken. But the
chef, Michael Marquez, also serves catfish with the usual side
dishes of black-eyed peas and collard greens stuffed inside, or
hickory-smoked barbecued salmon with sauteed spinach and
horseradish whipped potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't understand that soul food is a
feeling,'' said Marquez, who grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant in
Brooklyn. ``It's a way of cooking, allowing flavors to come out
without sitting here measuring this and measuring that.'' He said
his mother, who was from the South, cooked a sweet potato pie so
good he is trying to persuade the management to do it her way,
roasting the potatoes rather than boiling them, because boiling
takes away some sweetness and color.
</P>
<P>
   With all the tweaking and teasing going on, there are still
plenty of places in Chicago where, quite consciously, nothing has
really changed.
</P>
<P>
   One classic is Nina's, a homey place with green and white
checked tablecloths and green vinyl booths. The Rev. Snirly
Simpson, 56, started it 15 years ago with his mother-in-law as cook
and his mother as baker. His mother-in-law moved back to
Mississippi and his mother died, but Nina's still attracts
regulars: city workers, school employees and tradespeople, mostly.
Simpson, who is the pastor of the Mound Ridge Baptist Church,
dishes out pastoral advice on occasion along with his Mississippi
sausage, country ham, salt pork, grits, ham hocks, candied yams and
peach cobbler.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said one hallmark of soul food has always been
affordability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make sure if a person don't have but a dollar and
dime, he can still get something to tide him over for the day,'' he
said. ``Everybody doesn't want to spend what the price for pork
chops is, so they might be eating ham hocks _ ham hocks are less
expensive. We have a meal in a biscuit: a sausage patty, one egg in
a biscuit, for 99 cents.'' But even more important is making sure
his food remains a touchstone of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us who have migrated from the South were accustomed to
their mother, their grandmother, who went into the kitchen and put
some things together,'' he said. ``When you get to changing with
the changing times, you lose some of that. You get away from Big
Mama's potatoes, you get away from chicken and dumplings.''

TOASTY, MELLOW NUT OIL FOR VINAIGRETTES OR FISH

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Europeans, especially the French, have always had a
monopoly on good nut oils, which are a luxury in vinaigrettes and a
fragrant substitute for butter on grilled fish. But now a
two-year-old company in California is making what are probably the
best toasted nut oils on the market.
</P>
<P>
   In Yountville, a town once better known for its groves of walnut
trees than its vineyards, John Baritelle is producing five nut oils
under the California Press label: walnut, pecan, almond, hazelnut
and pistachio, each capturing the essence of the nut. They can add
a flavorful finish to a soup, a salad, a risotto or can even be
drizzled on cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Baritelle, a former professor of economics at the University of
California at Riverside, is recapturing a childhood taste. ``I grew
up in Walnut Creek,'' he said, referring to a town near San
Francisco. ``We always had walnut oil and almond oil that one of
our neighbors made. That led to a quest.'' In search of an
intensely delicious walnut oil, he started in France three years
ago and wound up importing walnut oil in ceramic jugs. The brand
name was The French Press. ``Then I asked my wife why we couldn't
do it here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baritelle bought an old sesame oil press and experimented with
different kinds of walnuts at various levels of toasting. Once he
was satisfied with the results, he changed his company's name and
hired Chuck Schutte, an engineer, and his wife, Gayle, to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Oils are easily pressed out of nuts, but their flavor blossoms
only when the nuts are toasted first. Baritelle toasts his in what
looks like a small coffee roaster. Then they are pressed in
15-pound batches. He grows some of his own walnuts and buys the
almonds and pistachios from a California grower. The pecans are
from Arizona, and the hazelnuts from Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between Baritelle's oils and most of the
competition is that he uses whole nuts or halves, not the broken
bits usually accepted by nut oil producers. The result is nuttier,
deeper and more mellow oil, with no hint of rancidity or other off
flavors. (They still should be stored in the refrigerator to keep
them fresh.)
</P>
<P>
   And there is a bonus. Because The California Press uses
high-quality nuts, the cakelike residue from the pressing can then
be ground and sifted and used as nut flour in baking and cooking.
Baritelle is selling that, too, by mail for $17 a pound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   California Press nut oils cost $15 to $18 for 8.4 ounces at
markets including Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street), and
Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street). They are
also available by mail, (800) 736-6602. Shipping is extra.

   Chalone Vineyard Chardonnay 1997, Monterey, Calif. About $30.
</P>
<P>
   Among its many unusual distinctions, Chalone Vineyard, in the
Gavilan Mountains east of Soledad, Calif., can claim its own
appellation.
</P>
<P>
   To have, let's say, a Napa Valley appellation, a wine must be
made at a Napa Valley winery from Napa Valley grapes. Dozens of
wineries can claim the Napa appellation.
</P>
<P>
   The Chalone appellation, however, was created and approved by
the federal government solely for Chalone because its setting, its
soil and its climate are truly unique. So are its wines, when at
their best, and this chardonnay is at or near that level.
</P>
<P>
   Chalone wines have had some rough years but those times seem to
be in the past. This is a big and intense chardonnay. There is
plenty of oak but the wine sustains it handily. Acidity is
assertive enough to guarantee considerable age. For me, it recalled
a great Corton-Charlemagne, a Faivelely or a Latour, white wines
that sometimes seem eternally young.

MEDICAL HELICOPTER CRASHES INCREASING

By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A sudden upswing in the number of emergency medical
helicopter crashes has the specialized wing of the aviation
industry looking at re-evaluating its safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, seven air ambulances have
crashed, including one Saturday that killed a Life Flight crew of
three from Hermann Hospital in Houston. In February, a Hermann
Hospital Life Flight helicopter struck a high-tension wire as it
left an accident scene. Though damaged, it was able to land without
injuring any of the three crew members or two patients on board.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven such accidents occurred in all of 1998, according to
the Air &AMP; Surface Transport Nurses Association, which tracks them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of accidents are a little bit high for the industry
this year,'' said Dick Wright, director of safety and flight
operations for the Helicopter Association International, an
industry organization. ``It does have our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten helicopter crew members have died in the rash of crashes,
and three injured, caused by everything from adverse weather
conditions, poor visibility, mechanical breakdown and pilot error.
It is still unknown what caused the fatal crash Saturday in
neighboring Fort Bend County.
</P>
<P>
   In June, two University of Kentucky Hospital pilots, a nurse and
a paramedic returning to base at night in the fog were killed when
their aircraft ran into a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   In April, an emergency medical pilot and two nurses died when
their helicopter crashed on their return to Valley Hospital Medical
Center near Las Vegas in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Flanagan, Hermann's administrative director of emergency
services, including Life Flight, said the Houston hospital stands
by its program, which is one of the busiest in the nation. He said
that in 22 years it has had only four accidents, including the one
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers and air ambulance crews say they have been
unable to identify any trends in the accidents. In the 1980s, acute
and chronic pilot fatigue was implicated in 14 crashes in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency medical helicopters, unlike commercial airplanes, are
not required to have flight data instruments that record the
movements of the aircraft and the actions taken by the pilot,
including part of cockpit conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk comes with this type of work,'' said Tom Reiser,
immediate past president of the air ambulance nurses association.
``You are called out at a moment's notice, in all kinds of
conditions and the pilot has to make a decision on whether to take
the mission based on the weather and the forecast predictions.
There are a lot of judgment calls they have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an industrywide practice not to tell a pilot the age,
condition or nature of the injuries of the patient being
transported. The officials' reasoning is they want the pilot's
decision to launch to be based only on safety matters, such as
weather, not an emotional sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Air Medical Services, another industry
organization, says that the emergency helicopters' unusual takeoff
or landing sites _ they often do not have access to helipads and
have to avoid power lines, tall buildings and other obstacles _
have not been a problem historically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the weather or pilot error,'' said Dawn Mancuso,
executive director of the Alexandria, Va.-based association.
``Safety is one of the topics that are always at the top of the
list in terms of our information programs. The policy of the
industry has always been safety has to come first even if that
means the patient doesn't get a helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry estimates put the number of air medical services
operations in the United States that use helicopters at 225.
Annually, they log about 200,000 hours in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Danko, an aviation lawyer and pilot whose firm specializes
in helicopter cases, says fatigue is a probable culprit in many
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been coming to light recently is the duty conditions
for the pilots,'' he said from California. ``They are very harsh,
and the big thing pilots seem to be complaining about is the lack
of sleep. It's one thing to be awakened in the middle of the night
to make a call, and another to have to fly the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue isn't a problem with Life Flight, hospital officials in
Houston say, pointing out that it has 12 pilots and, until
Saturday, three helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not anticipating that something is wrong,'' Flanagan
said. ``We are still very proud of our safety record and our
operations.``
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, president of the state Association of Air Medical
Services, acknowledged that the group is aware of the 1999
nationwide accident rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at what is causing these accidents,'' Flanagan
said. ``Is it related? Is it pilot error? Is it mechanical
failure?''
</P>

   He said air ambulance programs employ the best pilots, provide
them the best equipment and follow all federal rules and
regulations, but accidents still happen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a Hermann Life Flight crew was injured in an accident
attributed to pilot error; there were no patients aboard. In 1995,
another helicopter had a failure in both engines and landed safely
at an area shopping mall, with no injuries to crew and or the
patients aboard.

 Special for The Arizona Republic

<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE - The husband of Rorie Susan Buchanan wrote the
following recollection of his wife's and family's ordeal over her
losing battle with Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Now, after all the people have left, all the
thank-you cards have been signed, all the friends have expressed
their sympathy, and the ashes are at home awaiting the journey to
Hawaii, I can sit down and tell our story. Maybe it will be of help
to someone.
</P>
<P>
   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: What a name for a diagnosis that
dooms the patient to death. No cure, no real government research
support, no FDA support of drugs that can ease the burden, no
insurance company understanding of the need for coverage, and no
real time frame other than an average life expectancy of three to
five years after diagnosis. Some patients have gone longer, but
most last less. If it's not diagnosed early - and there are still a
lot of doctors who don't know what to look for - it can be too late
by the time a diagnosis is made for anything to help.
</P>
<P>
   ALS gets the young, the old, man, woman, priest, secretary,
rich, poor, wife, husband, brother, sister. Less than 5 percent of
the cases are inherited. It affects walking, talking, eating,
breathing. Wheelchairs, canes, ramps, hospice, home health care,
beds, special diets, support groups, church, work, community. All
become a part of your day.
</P>
<P>
   OUR JOURNEY
</P>
<P>
   Rorie and I were in San Francisco. I was on business, and, with
a long weekend, we decided to take some time for us. We had noticed
that she had started to slur her speech - not always, just
occasionally. Someone had commented that after one glass of wine,
she was smashed. That's what led her to believe what the family had
been trying to tell her for months. Something was not right. She
also was having trouble with her right foot. Two episodes of
tripping and falling. (The foot doctor said all she needed was some
corrective surgery and all would be healed. What a dork!)
</P>
<P>
   A small thyroid problem was discovered, and she began medication
to treat it. That helped somewhat, but the slurring and foot drop
were not getting better. An MRI was next. What else could be
causing this? Brain tumor? Cancer? All of the really ugly (or so we
thought) diseases. But nothing showed up on the MRI. Now what? The
doctor suggested we consult a neurologist.
</P>
<P>
   We were scared - not terrified, but anxious about what might be
causing this. Our attitude was that we'd just get another opinion
if we didn't like the first one. Besides, we had plans and dreams.
Rorie was going back to school to finish her degree; I was going to
work until she had a job, and then retire and become a flight
instructor. Great plans. ''Man plans and God laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) When did you first notice the speech problem? When
did you first have problems with your foot? Have you noticed muscle
twitches? Let's do an exam, and then we can talk. I have noticed
what we call fasciculation - muscle tremors. I would like to do one
more test, an EMG, where we will be inserting a needle into
different parts of your muscles and measuring the impulses or motor
neuron signals to be absolutely sure of what I think, but I am
pretty sure of your diagnosis: ALS. Have you ever heard of it? (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   Silent shock! ALS. We were very familiar with it. A friend had
died recently after battling ALS. Now we were devastated. Not MS,
not a tumor, not something ''simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis was confirmed by the EMG and a neurologist who
specializes in neuromuscular diseases. No mistake. We tell him
thank you. We have to come back in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ALS. We caught our breath. We cried. We hugged. We went home.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet in the house. Tears. Talking without really talking. Both
of us trying to work it out. OK, we can work with this. ALS, we can
do this. We're OK. No we're not.
</P>
<P>
   What to do. Whom to talk to. Let's get as much information as
possible before we have to go back to the doctor. Call the National
ALS Association. Don't tell the family until we're sure. Hold out
hope that maybe, just maybe, the tests will show something else. We
could live with MS.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, the kids are asking, ''How's Mom? What did you
find out?'' Info has come from the various sources. It doesn't
really say anything other than we're in for the ride of our lives
and to send away for even more info.
</P>
<P>
   All the test results are back, and the diagnosis is confirmed
again. ALS. Maybe we should try the Ford Clinic. Cleveland? Mayo?
Houston?
</P>
<P>
   But are you 100 percent certain?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   THE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   One daughter away at school. Son here. Other daughter in Ann
Arbor with her newborn son - our first grandchild. He's struggling
to make it after surgery to repair his heart. Another whole story.
</P>
<P>
   We have to tell them straight. Tell them all at the same time.
Varied reactions. All sad, but all hoping that there will be hope,
help, a new drug.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get busy gathering data. This is our new project,
educating us so we can help Rorie. Daughter leaves college and
moves home.
</P>
<P>
   Rorie's sisters are in the hunt, too. Everyone is trying to help
us find a miracle out there. New drugs reported in various rags and
relayed by friends and family, but none have been approved. You
have to get in the lottery for a chance to get them. The first few
times we're rejected but told our request will go into the next
pot. It's expensive.
</P>
<P>
   How long until we hit the insurance cap?
</P>
<P>
   Another project. Now we have to decipher insurance coverage and
definitions. The beginning of the hard questions. Who will take
over the information gathering? Who will put their life on hold?
Close friends - actually family by default since ours live so far
away - circle the wagons. Nancy, Rorie's best friend and surrogate
sister, says she'll be there no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ALS, family and friends. The first requires the other two.
Without them, nothing can get done. This is not a disease that can
be handled alone. You find out what a friend is. You find out just
how very much you can't do by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   OK. We need to plan. Go over wills and get a durable power of
attorney for health care. What's our financial position? Let's not
panic. We still have some time. Continue to work until it's too
hard to get into the job. Stick with the vacation plans. Let's talk
about remodeling the house. A bedroom and bath on the first floor.
Maybe another car that's easier to get in and out of.
</P>
<P>
   Initial panic, then a resigned atmosphere that we need to stop
worrying and live as much as possible. A few months pass.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not dying from ALS. I choose to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   She's braver than I give her credit. There's no real
breakthrough in the medications. The FDA doesn't consider this a
serious enough affliction to warrant a lot of time. Congress
doesn't fund ALS research. The doctors and researchers who are
fighting for a cure are almost alone. New drugs, new hope but no
cure. (Later, there will be a bill before Congress funding ALS and
neuromuscular disease research and putting pressure on the FDA to
get off its butt and let ALS patients have Myotropin, a drug that
has proven to add a few months to their lives. Initially, the FDA
couldn't be bothered.)
</P>
<P>
   We went to Hawaii. A few years earlier than expected, but it was
now or never. Our community, our friends pooled their
frequent-flier miles and hotel coupons so we could go. It was a
second-honeymoon dream to get there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Rorie really can't enjoy the beach. She's not steady enough to
stand and let the waves roll over her feet and ankles. The sand is
too hard for her to walk on, so we sit and watch others enjoy it.
It's a little difficult getting into the pool, but this is where
she wants to be. The legs work underwater. We take a helicopter
tour and an airplane ride - open cockpit. She's afraid of flying in
anything smaller than an airbus. She flew with me a few times in a
single-engine Cessna but never really liked it. Now she's giving me
an open-cockpit biplane ride and not a word of complaint.
</P>
<P>
   It's peaceful here. She's happy. Maybe we'll just stay until . .
.
</P>
<P>
   No, let's go home.
</P>
<P>
   Hand in hand. Slow, deliberate. Dragging the foot.
</P>
<P>
   January: Let's go to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Great time. Bought a cane. It helps with the walking. She loves
the mountains. Spent a lot of time in the Colorado Rockies when she
was younger.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER PLATEAU
</P>
<P>
   ALS is a disease of plateaus. Always down, never up. The job has
to go. It's getting too hard to get into the car and drive. Almost
tripped in the lobby. The kids are worried. People who overhear her
talk wonder if she's had a stroke or if she's been drinking. The
kids press for medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't we have it?
</P>
<P>
   No, not yet. Give her dignity a little while longer.
</P>
<P>
   We go to the support group in Ann Arbor. Hopefully, we can find
one closer, but our grandson is still in the intensive-care nursery
and it gives Rorie a chance to see him and to hold him. The support
group is depressing. One man without the use of his legs, though
perfectly able to talk and eat. Another with a respirator since he
caught pneumonia, but still very active. Some old, many young. And
still no hope.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Will I be like that?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Let's move. A house with everything on the same floor. Abandon
the big house. She loves to entertain, but it's not much fun
anymore. It's become too hard to do all the preparations and then
watch people look at you like you're disabled or shout as though
you were deaf. Without the muscle control of the diaphragm, she
can't generate enough air to speak above a whisper. Speech therapy
is next. Later, perhaps oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   No respirators. No heroic measures.
</P>
<P>
   A do-not-resuscitate order in the living will.
</P>
<P>
   Time again for her family reunion. This time, it's on board a
cruise ship out of Los Angeles. It's a long way away, it's
expensive, but we go. She wants to see the family. She spent a lot
of time with her cousins growing up. We'll take the wheelchair. It
gets us on early and in line first. Big family gathering and a good
way to get away from home and doctors. Cousins strain to understand
her when she talks. They sit with her, push her wheelchair in port.
</P>
<P>
   Push her around the dance floor in the disco. They know they
probably won't see her again. Tears. Hugs. Tough goodbyes. We
decide to stay longer in California and visit the cabin at Lake
Arrowhead where we spent our first honeymoon. We take the kids.
Lots of good memories. Lots of sad ones now.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time she asks, Why did I have to get this damn
disease?
</P>
<P>
   HOSPICE
</P>
<P>
   The family is finally starting to realize the end is drawing
close. Time to take more time to smell the roses. The newest
plateau is a hard one: We need to start thinking about some help.
Up in the morning to help with the bath and dressing and toilet
care. Home at noon. Home early from work. She doesn't want
strangers helping her do such private things. Spend a lot of time
doing maintenance things late at night - laundry, cleaning, paying
bills.
</P>
<P>
   A new word enters the vocabulary: caregiver. A new job, only
more intense. Husband, lover, friend for almost 30 years. Now this.
For better or for worse. Strong statement. How many can live it?
</P>
<P>
   A decision has been made to ''talk'' about hospice. She's not
ready, but we need them. Angels enter the house: Hospice workers
give 110 percent and ask for nothing in return. $100 per day.
Limited days for now. More later.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company says it won't pay for hospice. OK, let's
drag them into the 20th century. We can put Rorie in the hospital
for $1,000 per day, or they can approve hospice. Another battle. An
OK, very grudgingly, with a $20,000 cap. (This becomes another
battle later when the cap is exceeded.)
</P>
<P>
   So, who cares? Sign 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   There's a retirement fund that can pay if needed. After this,
who's going to work another 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   Hospice comes three days a week, a few hours a day. Rorie
finally gets used to the angel - Mary - who is going to be her
friend, nurse, bather, dresser, listener. Mary becomes part of our
family. The family grows ever larger with great friends who
volunteer time, meals, errands or to just hang around for company.
Our church family gets its marching orders from Nancy. Judy,
Rorie's other surrogate sister, starts a weekly lunch visit - food,
dishes, talk, listen. Judy and Nancy are a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   We decide to take a weekend away with Nancy and husband Steve.
Up north in wine country. We used to do this all the time, but now
it's more important. Good time, even with having to lug the
wheelchair up a steep staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas. Rorie's favorite season. She always goes overboard
decorating. The girls try to do it the way their mother would.
</P>
<P>
   Hospice is now fully involved, and Nancy, a home-health-care
nurse by trade, announces she's adding Mondays, her normal day off,
to fill the gaps in Rorie's care. Our oldest daughter, whose son is
still critically ill and requires in-home nursing care, takes
Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Our son moves to Florida to go back to school. His mother tells
him to go and get on with his life. Don't put it on hold because of
her. She will miss him, and it pains her to see him go. She worries
when he and his wife drive non-stop for two days each time they
come home to see for themselves how she is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER PLATEAU
</P>
<P>
   Equipment: chair, bath aids, suction machine, hospital bed. Over
the next few months, it all ends up in the house. A motorized
recliner is needed for comfort and ease of moving her. Another
fight with the insurance company. The doctor has ordered it, but
the insurance company doesn't think it's needed. So what? Insurance
workers should be given a six-month case of a disease that they
have to live with to get a taste of how their industry treats
people.
</P>
<P>
   Rorie spends most of her day in her recliner. Her legs ache, and
she needs me to adjust her position several times each night. More
time in the chair and a start at considering the hospital bed. The
regular bed is getting too hard to work with. She's exhausted. We
all are.
</P>
<P>
   (beginital) I don't want to give up sleeping beside you. It's
the last of so many things lost. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The hospital bed stays in the garage for a while longer, and she
sleeps in the recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Eating is becoming a drawn-out affair. Even though swallowing is
becoming difficult, she eats what everyone else eats. No feeding
tube. Meals take on a new light. Eventually, it takes more than an
hour to feed her. Meals start early and end late. Thank God for the
people who drop a meal by. A lot of chicken. Sometimes something
special and different. Grateful for it all.
</P>
<P>
   We're all tired. Nerves are frayed. We're spending about 14
hours a day as caregivers. Demands are high. For better or for
worse, in sickness and in health. If this schedule continues, we'll
need to consider alternatives. Respite care, a nursing home. But
she wants to stay home. I want her to stay, but I can't give much
more.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tired. Maybe the start of a hernia from lifting her in and
out of bed, in and out of her chair, in and out of the shower, the
commode. I'm not sleeping. Hospice is concerned. Her care is taking
a lot out of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance cap is met. Another fight for a reasonable amount
of coverage. If we don't win this one, I'll quit and take my
retirement to pay for care. It's three weeks before the company can
make a decision. I hope none of them ever need this kind of care,
or do I? They need to live this to understand. Cap is increased
from $20,000 to $35,000. We're at $28,000, and hospice is billing
about $1,800 a month. Do the math. Maybe a nursing home for a
while, just to get a respite. Hospice can get us in for about $125
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Another plateau: This time it's big.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I want to see my mom. I want to see my son. I'm
tired of fighting, and I want to rest. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   More candid talks late at night about us, the last 30 years, the
next few weeks. Finally in the hospital bed. She knows, we all do.
</P>
<P>
   It's done. A few days of being there. A few days of not.
Sometimes she's awake, sometimes coherent. The drugs help. We have
to keep increasing the dosages to help with the breathing and the
peace of mind. It's not going to be pretty. The kids are all here.
Her mom is here. Say goodbye now. Don't wait.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Promise to take care of everyone. Promise. (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   30 years gone.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to go back to Hawaii, ashes spread with orchids on the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S OVER
</P>
<P>
   So, we did all this. Over three years. Some days went fast. Some
went very slow. It was physically very demanding the last few
months. Mentally, you think you are prepared, but you're not. I
can't believe how ingrained our routine had become. Days after the
funeral, my youngest daughter and I were both up in the middle of
the night ready to move her, stretch her legs, help her get
comfortable. But she wasn't there. The hospital bed, everything was
folded up and in the garage waiting to be taken away. Katie and I
stood there in the dim light of the hallway and realized there was
nothing for us to do. Rorie didn't need our help anymore.
</P>
<P>
   People say they don't know how we coped for so long. We're a
family, and we did exactly what was required to make Rorie
comfortable for as long as possible. Toward the end, we were tired,
sick and worn out beyond comprehension, but we did what we had to
and blocked out the outside world for
</P>
<P>
   a while. We did the best we could.

BUFFALO GAPPERS SPARE ABILENE _ THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Taylor County Old Settlers Reunion in Buffalo Gap, Texas,
went off without a hitch during the weekend, and the courthouse in
Abilene remains standing.
</P>
<P>
   It was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Gappers are still angry about losing the county seat 116
years ago, and there has been some talk around town that they might
storm the courthouse in Abilene to recover the old county records.
They also want the desk the records were stored in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has been done at this time,'' Velma Prentice, the
Buffalo Gap city secretary, said this week. ``I have some knowledge
of what's going on, but I am not going to say anything at this
time. When it all comes about, it will be a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Gap is a picturesque bend in Farm Road 89, nestled in a
small valley and shaded by huge live oak trees. Many of the people
who live there are descendants of the 200 founding settlers who
made their homes in the cut through the Callahan Divide _ a small
range of hills often called the Tonkawa Mountains. It was the first
town in Taylor County.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Taylor County's first county seat. The sandstone
courthouse is the centerpiece of Buffalo Gap Historic Village, a
small, neatly kept remnant of the town's past.
</P>
<P>
   The first floor of the 2,448-square-foot, 2-story building was
used as the courthouse, the upper level was Taylor County's first
jail. The sandstone was quarried from the nearby hills, and civil
war cannon balls were placed between the stones for support.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Gap had everything it needed _ plenty of trees, shade,
water and protection from both the Indians and the elements _ but
it didn't have the railroad, and that's where the rub came.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bitter fight for the Texas &AMP; Pacific Railroad, but
the rails were laid across a much flatter terrain into a tent city
called Abilene. In 1883, the 1,174 voting residents of Taylor
County agreed to move the county seat there. The county papers were
transferred, along with the desk.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Buffalo Gap say they were deceived by the railroad and
the election was nothing more than a theft of their county seat and
their economic future.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a newly formed group of Gap zealots who not only
want to promote the virtues of Buffalo Gap _ which are plenty _
they want the historic desk and its contents returned as well.
</P>
<P>
   There were secret plans made to raid Abilene during the weekend,
but group President Tom Perini cautioned the Gappers to use
restraint. Knowing it was meant only as a good-natured poke in
Abilene's ribs, Perini still warned that officials in Abilene might
not see the humor in a full-fledged frontal assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might want to let somebody at the courthouse know what
we're going to do,'' The Abilene Reporter-News quoted him as
telling his group. ``We really don't want to surprise Taylor County
with this. You know, they've grown quite a bit since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the group heeded his advice and backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean anything,'' Prentice said of the forestalled
attack. ``There was too much going on down here anyway with the Old
Settlers Reunion. When the raid comes, it will be a celebration
within itself.''

AGENTS RECALL PROTECTING YOUNG JFK JR. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Secret Service agents who watched over John F.
Kennedy Jr. as a child worked hard to keep him safe and out of the
hands of kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are trying to come to terms with his death, much as
they did when his father was killed while they were charged with
protecting the children more than 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think, God, I busted my butt to keep anything from
happening to that kid when he was vulnerable and not able to take
care of himself,'' said John Giuffre, a retired Secret Service
agent who lives in Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then later on, it comes to something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Giuffre was part of the team of agents who were
assigned to guard Jacqueline Kennedy, Caroline and John Jr. He
guarded the children until 1964, when the family moved to New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much was done to help them and bring them along and to see
it end like this. It's just really sad, really sad. It's tough,''
said Giuffre, 64. As he spoke Monday tears came to his eyes and
flowed down his cheeks before he wiped them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had one word to describe him, he was probably an imp,''
Giuffre said of JFK Jr. ``He was not really a very adventurous
child. He was not one of those `I'll get into anything, do
anything.' He cried just like other little kids do. It was not
drilled into him `Kennedys don't cry.' ... That was the Bobby
Kennedy family. ... That was not the case with these children. And
like I said, he had the glint of the devil inside of him at times.
You just knew he was up to something.''
</P>
<P>
   After the family moved to New York, Giuffre did not keep in
touch with them. Instead he watched the children grow and maintain
their grace under the glare of the media lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were two great kids,'' largely because of Jacqueline
Kennedy's influence on them, said Giuffre, who was in the Secret
Service from 1959 until 1986. ``Those two kids were brought up in
such way that you just knew good things were going to come from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Kennedy wanted the children to have as normal a life
as possible and she taught them to be well-mannered and respectful.
The agents were never referred to by first name, Giuffre said.
</P>
<P>
   The children were taught that the dark-suited men were not there
to be their playmates. But every now and then, the agents got to
play with the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bounced John on my knee. He was an active little boy,'' said
Don Brett, who is also a retired Secret Service agent living in
Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   Brett guarded the children during the summers of 1962 and 1963,
when they vacationed in Hyannis Port with their mother, and again
during Christmas 1963 in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   That Christmas was a poignant one for the agents. It was a month
after President Kennedy had been assassinated. They were away from
their own families and guarding Jacqueline and the children.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her grief, the first lady made sure that each of the
agents received a Lacoste shirt for Christmas, Brett and Giuffre
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the children ignored the toys they were showered with and
made their own fun, Brett said.
</P>
<P>
   Of ``all these elaborate gifts that John and Caroline had they
took more pleasure in playing in an empty box,'' said Brett, 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask what kind of kids they were? They didn't care if the
toys came from FAO Schwarz or from Woolworth's. They were
interested in playing with the empty boxes.''

THEY MAY BE BABOONS, BUT THEY'RE NOT AS MACHO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Humans have bigger brains than those of baboons,
but many of us, sad to say, don't have much better personalities.
Members of both species are vicious, overly aggressive and
competitive to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder a human who's called a baboon takes it as an insult _
and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sapolsky of Stanford University, a onetime MacArthur
Fellow, runs a lab where he does important work on the neurobiology
of stress and disease. He has a terrific book (``Why Zebras Don't
Get Ulcers'') and a great reputation.
</P>
<P>
   So why has he been journeying to Africa just about every summer
for over two decades to roll in the muck and mire of baboonland?
Science. It makes people do strange things.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Sapolsky carved out a niche
by observing a troop of baboons in the Serengeti Plain of Kenya. By
plugging selected males with sleep-inducing darts, he was able to
extract blood and tissue for lab examination.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered something that was immensely reassuring to all
those guys who aren't quite kings of the hill: Top guns _ alpha
males who always got their way _ paid a price.
</P>
<P>
   While the testicles of dominant males had better supplies of
blood under stress _ thus increasing the levels of circulating
testosterone, a hormone likely to enhance muscle metabolism,
conferring a competitive advantage _ they were more susceptible to
disease when any slippage in rank occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical enabling them to function at high levels under
stress _ cortisol, an adrenal steroid _ was associated with
hypertension, impaired immunity and other ills. As they dropped in
rank, their basal, or resting, levels of cortisol tended to rise
and remain elevated whether or not they were under stress.
</P>
<P>
   It was a finding with important implications for humans.
</P>
<P>
   Then something terrible happened: Sapolsky's subjects began
dying.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-year period, the macho males critical to his work
indulged themselves at a tourist lodge's garbage heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each morning they barreled out of the trees, ran a mile and
hit the dump,'' Sapolsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the meat in the dump was crawling with
tuberculosis germs, thanks to a scam run by a Kenyan meat inspector
and the lodge operator. TB kills people slowly. Baboons die from it
in a month. Sapolsky's pals _ Jessie, Shem, Saul and the others _
dropped like flies.
</P>
<P>
   He published two papers on TB in baboons, then called it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disgusted. It was a trauma. It wiped out my work. I
switched my attention to a new troop 40 miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, in the early 1990s, Sapolsky mustered up the
stomach to show his new wife the baboons of his professional youth
_ those that remained, at least. The experience shocked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was apparent this was a different troop than any I'd seen.
There were much lower levels of aggression. They were grooming each
other all the time. I saw a lot more male-to-male grooming.''
</P>
<P>
   The new guys weren't gay, they'd been socialized differently.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions were down dramatically. The No. 1 baboon still
dominated No. 10, but he didn't rub 10's nose in it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the new guys in the troop were no longer peripheral
figures _ living at the literal edge, without sex lives, hammered
into the dust anytime an alpha had a bad day. Now they were treated
with some civility. Still no sex, but punching bags no more.
</P>
<P>
   What had happened, Sapolsky discovered, was this: The vacuum
left by the dead alpha baboons had been filled by adolescent
baboons from another troop. Those young males, in turn, had been
socialized by the baboons remaining from the old troop _ females
and males who hadn't pigged out at the garbage dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were living in a hippie commune-type troop,'' Sapolsky
said. ``They had lower stress hormones than I'd ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapolsky decided to return to his old troop and resume his work,
beginning next month. This time, he'll look at the whys and
wherefores of mellow baboon behavior, instead of the macho stuff.
</P>
<P>
   He'll test the theory that ``reconciliative behavior'' improves
health by bolstering the immune system and reducing disease caused
by stress.
</P>
<P>
   The work is being funded by ``A Campaign for Forgiveness
Research,'' an organization with a touchy-feely name that's engaged
in important work. It's on the Internet at Forgiving.org.
</P>
<P>
   The co-chairmen of the organization are Archbishop Desmond Tutu
of South Africa and former President Jimmy Carter.

THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO GET GRUMPY
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, July 27)  
(lb) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not that the public is always wanting to pick a fight. It's
just that it tends to not trust what it can't see.
</P>
<P>
   It feels that way particularly about corporations where
decisions seem to be made in a galaxy far away by someone who cares
more about money than people.
</P>
<P>
   So when the public thinks something is being foisted on it that
is not in the public good, it protests.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the San Francisco Bay Area public is protesting what
is being done to public radio. The public, at least a large, vocal
group of dismayed listeners, has rallied by the thousands to
protest management changes at KPFA-FM in Berkeley and apparent
moves by the Pacifica Foundation, its parent organization, to
muffle and mainstream the good old leftie.
</P>
<P>
   KPFA has long billed itself as a bastion of free speech, a truly
alternative media source that encourages dissent and debate.
</P>
<P>
   It was for and by the people. So now the people demand to know
what's up.
</P>
<P>
   During pledge season, public radio solicitors make a point of
saying that without you, the public, the station would not exist.
That the station cares most what you, the public, wants to hear.
And thanks to your individual pledge dollars, the station can bring
you what you will never get on commercial radio.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, KPFA convinced its listeners that they meant
exactly that, and that its loyal fans were part of the KPFA
community. The public, with all its warts and rants and opinions on
everything from the bombing of Iraq to goddess art, would always
have a voice on KPFA.
</P>
<P>
   The voice believed it so much that now the voice is in the
streets and at the front door of the station demanding to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as if the public is being more true to the radio
station's mission than the station itself, celebrating dissent,
encouraging debate and demanding to know the story behind the
story.
</P>
<P>
   KPFA's public helped create something so Berkeley, so Bay Area,
so Californian and so American in terms of healthy diversity that
those who believe in all the above are naturally fried. They worry
that KPFA will be permanently replaced by bland, predictable,
middle-of-the-road radio in order to appeal to big corporate
donors.
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect people in public radio to care about making
money. They don't drive SUVs and play golf. They are a different
breed, spending their time worrying over places in the world that
commercial radio doesn't even try to pronounce.
</P>
<P>
   The public gets mad at people at the top when it thinks the top
isn't listening.
</P>
<P>
   It's why the public can work itself up over coffee sites and
bookstore chains. A few city blocks from KPFA headquarters,
shoppers and residents have their choice of four coffeehouses on
Piedmont Avenue in Oakland. But now Starbucks wants a piece of the
action and the neighbors are upset.
</P>
<P>
   Now, why is Starbucks insisting on shoving into a place so amply
caffeinated? And where it's not particularly welcome? There is
already a Starbucks close by, at a strip mall, a place where
shoppers might be grateful for an espresso break. But on classic
old Piedmont Avenue, it's seen as an affront.
</P>
<P>
   It's become a common adversarial position _ corporate vs.
community _ so much so that some communities are on knee-jerk alert
to all newcomers. The one-bookstore town of Calistoga is fighting a
Copperfield's Books coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Independently operated and locally owned (local being over the
hill and county line from Napa to Sonoma County), Copperfield's
Books would normally seem like a compatible neighbor. But because
Copperfield's has other stores, its move into Calistoga is
challenged by the same town law that keeps out a Starbucks. It's
ironic, because Copperfield's had to deal with book giant Barnes &AMP;
Noble moving across the street from one of its stores.
</P>
<P>
   In Calistoga, it's less a David vs. Goliath contest and more a
David vs. Dave challenge. But the newcomer is still going to have
to convince a public naturally worried about being homogenized.
</P>
<P>
   Back to KPFA and its riled public. I think that even casual
listeners are identifying with the radio staff because of the issue
about corporate or outside control.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people are wary of corporate control. We suspect that
people at the top have a ``whatever'' attitude toward the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   And the public is at the bottom. That isn't always the case and
it hasn't always been that way.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think it was the public that changed.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shaken or stirred? It's a question that sounds like
the ultimate in sophistication. But the truth is that James Bond,
despite his smug smile, knew only the half of it. Cocktail-making
technique, a highly evolved skill, is as important to bartenders as
a drink's recipe. And often it's the technique _ including the
style of the shaker and the size of the ice cubes _ that
distinguishes one great mixologist from another.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I was at Eleven Madison Park, searching for
something cool and refreshing to take the edge off the summer heat.
I ordered a Stanford: Bombay sapphire gin infused with chartreuse,
fresh lemon juice and mint, served straight up in a martini glass.
The liquid shimmered like a jewel, and the glass was as cold as a
beer from an ice cooler.
</P>
<P>
   What really made the drink, though, was not the cool glass or
the zip of fresh lemon juice. It was the tiny flat shards of ice _
almost imperceptible to the eye _ that floated on top of the liquid
and that melted on my tongue as I drank it, making it that much
more refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Had Francis Harris, the bartender, added shaved ice to it before
serving? No, he said, he just shakes his cocktails hard. So hard
that the ice shatters into shards, some of which slip through the
strainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bartenders are fussy,'' said Gustav Lee, the head bartender at
City Hall in Tribeca. ``I'm extremely particular about what I use
and how I use it.'' His fussiness begins with equipment. Lee uses a
silver-lined shaker, rather than the standard stainless-steel and
glass model.
</P>
<P>
   Silver shakers are expensive and difficult to find. ( Lee bought
his in an antiques store, and totes it back and forth to work every
day.) He insists that the difference is marked; silver shakers, he
says, get colder faster than the stainless steel ones, and stay
colder longer. He also detects a slight metallic taste to a drink
shaken in steel.
</P>
<P>
   He mixed two drinks for me, one in the silver, one in the
stainless steel. I put my palm to each shaker containing ice and
spirits. The silver shaker was so solidly cold it was difficult to
keep my hand on it for more than a second or two. The stainless was
mildly but perceptibly warmer. As for the metallic taste, that,
too, was apparent _ but not something I would want to prove in a
blind taste test.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Lee's dedication to silver requires more attention
than most bartenders are willing to give their shakers. Silver must
be relined just like tin-coated copper cookware, and it is simply
too much of a luxury for a piece of equipment that gets banged
around all day long. A used, silver-plated shaker is $50 to $100,
if you can find one (Jean's Silversmiths, at 16 West 45th Street,
will keep an eye out for them by request). Tiffany &AMP; Co. sells two
solid silver models _ for $775 and $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   A more common shaker that is falling out of favor lately is the
stainless-steel one with a cap and built-in strainer. It usually
comes in small sizes for individual portions. Some bartenders find
it clumsy; the cap rarely makes a tight seal, and it is too small
to shake vigorously enough to break up large pieces of ice.
</P>
<P>
   The great challenge of cocktail making is to get the liquids as
cold as possible as quickly as possible so the alcohol mixture
doesn't become too diluted. Which is why bartenders also obsess
over ice cube size.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Maher, the beverage manager at Beacon in midtown, uses
3/4-inch ice cubes. Dale DeGroff, the head bartender at Blackbird
on East 49th Street, insists on large one-inch cubes. Lee uses
flat, Frisbee-shaped ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use a one-inch cube, they won't break down,'' Ms. Maher
said. Though, she added, they are better for drinks on ice, because
they melt more slowly, keeping the drink intense for a longer
period. Lee contends that his flat ice has more surface area and is
less solid, therefore cooling liquids down more quickly and
breaking up amply in the shaker.
</P>
<P>
   No issue of cocktail making, though, causes more argument than
shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking serves two purposes. First, by shaking liquid in ice, it
splashes up against the ice and against the cold sides of the
shaker, cooling it very rapidly before the ice has time to melt and
dilute the liquid. Stirring will also chill down the liquid, but
not as thoroughly and not as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking a drink also homogenizes, or emulsifies, it. Think of a
vinaigrette. If you stir the vinegar and oil together, they will
fuse loosely and separate. But if you whisk them together
vigorously, they will form a tight bond and emulsify into a uniform
liquid. The same goes for a shaken drink. The liquids, a small
amount of water from the ice and a little air emulsify, creating a
uniform, cold, lightly frothy drink. The temperature and particles
of water refresh and the air bubbles spread the flavor across your
palate. Traditionally, drinks with any kind of citrus juice are to
be shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want that spritz in a cocktail,'' DeGroff of Blackbird
said as he made me a Hemingway daiquiri. He poured rum, lime juice,
grapefruit juice, maraschino liqueur and simple syrup into a shaker
with those big cubes, fitted a glass into the open end and gave it
a shake so vigorous, his arm and the shaker were merely a blur.
</P>
<P>
   He strained it into a frosty chilled martini glass. When it
splashed in, the drink melted like whipped cream in hot chocolate,
frothing and bubbling. It was as cloudy as milk, then it settled.
As I drank it the bubbles in the liquid seemed to lift the flavor
out of each component; the froth was like cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Craddock of the Savoy once said `You shake them to wake
them up, not to put them to sleep,''' DeGroff said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is also an adamant and vigorous shaker. His technique is so
finely tuned, he works like a machine. When he makes a drink, he
adds the ice first to get the shaker chilling immediately.
Sometimes he will chill the vessel, dump the ice and refill it with
new ice before adding any liquor. Then he moves as if in
fast-forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to my ear,'' he said of the shaker. ``You can hear the
ice cracking and you can hear when it's done. It has a denser sound
when it's done. At that point you need to immediately pour it. You
can't dillydally.''
</P>
<P>
   His movements are so quick and powerful that the ice breaks up.
Though he strains his drinks well, all of his shaken drinks have
flecks of ice scattered across the top. ``I think they add a
certain something,'' he said, ``like a crema on espresso.'' He even
shakes a Manhattan, though he does it with less force, what he
describes as more of a flip or a toss.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Justin Hatch, the bartender at Union Pacific on East 22d Street,
does not worry about crema. He lets shaken drinks rest for 30
seconds before pouring. This method, he says, allows the drink to
get extremely cold without a lot of dilution.
</P>
<P>
   Though shaking techniques can vary as much as golf swings, the
idea is to hold the vessel with two hands and shake it back and
forth over the front of one shoulder, near your ear. Most
bartenders shake a drink for less than 10 seconds. If the drink has
many components and large ice cubes, they may go the full 10
seconds. If it is simply two liquids, they may shake it for as few
as five.
</P>
<P>
   Drinks made of pure spirits _ like vodka, gin or bourbon _ are
traditionally stirred. Shaking supposedly ``bruises'' the spirits,
by adding water and flattening their flavor. This issue divides
many bartenders today.
</P>
<P>
   DeGroff is a traditionalist. He stirs. If you shake a martini,
for instance, he said, ``the first thing that hits your tongue is a
frothy aerated drink.'' He prefers that first thing to be cold,
heavy and silky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martinis you are not supposed to shake,'' said Charlie Nezaj,
who has been the bartender at La Cote Basque for 19 years.
``Otherwise, it is not a martini. It is water.''
</P>
<P>
   More watery and some believe inferior. ``Because of the
vigorousness of the shaking,'' explained Ms. Maher, a stirrer of
martinis, ``the air bubbles remove the nuances of the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a stirred drink, you may taste layers of flavor. A Manhattan,
for example, is not a homogenous cocktail. If stirred lightly, a
sheet of whiskey may cover your tongue, then a splash of sweet
vermouth, or an uneven mix of the two. The vermouth has a greater
density, and because the two are not emulsified, they will slowly
separate and the vermouth will sink to the bottom as you drink it.
</P>
<P>
   DeGroff stirs his drinks about 50 times, but he uses large ice
cubes. With smaller cubes, he would stir less, perhaps 25
rotations, so that the drink doesn't become diluted. The method is
simple: you slide a cocktail spoon down the side of the shaker,
with the concave side of the spoon facing the side of the shaker,
and rotate the handle along the edge of the shaker.
</P>
<P>
   Which method is better? It depends on what you want out of a
drink. I tasted, side by side, two martinis made by Lee. One was
shaken. One was stirred. There was something more herbal, more
intense about the stirred one. I would not have refused the shaken
one. It was simply more mellow.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy, of course, is good. Today, new cocktails are
created as often as the weather changes. Techniques come and go.
There is often more flair than form. What is important is that
there are bartenders who continue to raise drink mixing from a
craft to an art. They are as much philosophers as they are drink
makers with a curiosity for the physics behind their craft.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until you push them too far. When I asked Lee why he
puts three olives in his martinis, he responded instantly, with a
grin: ``It's a prime number. Superstition.''

BUSH PROVIDES NAMES OF `PIONEER' FUND-RAISERS
</HEADLINE>

By R.A. DYER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Under criticism from citizen groups, Gov. George W.
Bush has defended his ``Pioneer'' fund-raising efforts in which
individual supporters have each pledged to raise $100,000 or more
for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed to release the names of the 115 Pioneers, saying
they have led a grassroots effort on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have decided to go out and solicit
contributions on behalf of my candidacy,'' Bush said on Monday.
``This is a grassroots organization and these are people who have
decided to take time out of their lives to help me become
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Although campaign finance law prohibits individual contributions
of more than $1,000, the influential supporters each volunteered to
collect $1,000 from up to 100 acquaintances and businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has come under fire by Texans for Public Justice
and the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington, D.C., both of
which contend that it skirts campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This buys access and influence,'' said Texans for Public
Justice director Craig McDonald. ``A $100,000 donor is going to
have more clout than a $1,000 donor. ... And that's what's going
on: In essence, these Pioneers are turned into $100,000 donors _
with all the clout that that implies.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hendrie, spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics,
said the Pioneers will end up becoming ``ambassadors and attending
state dinners'' if Bush wins the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a private club you buy your way into,'' Hendrie
said. ``The people who are doing this certainly expect some perks
out of the whole thing. ... But this certainly is not unique to
Governor Bush _ he just is doing it better than any of the other
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the names on the list of Pioneers released by the Bush
campaign were former U.S. Rep Tom Loeffler of Texas; Bradford
Freeman of Los Angeles, a Stanford University trustee;
Michigan-based Heinz C. Prechter, who served as chairman of former
President Bush's Export Council; Democrat James Langdon, an old
friend of the governor's from Midland; Fort Worth businessman Lee
Bass; and Rusty Rose, who with Bush headed a group that purchased
the Texas Rangers in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the key fund-raisers would have greater access to
him if he were elected president, Bush responded: ``You either have
somebody in the process who is honest or not honest.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many of his best friends are among the Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to let the people respond, in order to give the
people a chance to express their decision in the year 2,000, it
requires organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, whose Texans for Public Justice had called on Bush to
release the names of the Pioneer fund raisers, and Hendrie, of the
Center for Responsive Politics, each praised Bush for identifying
members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush joked during an afternoon news conference Monday that
he wanted to publicize the names in order to pressure those who had
failed to reach the $100,000 goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I want you to publish the list,'' Bush said when
asked whether he would also provide the names of would-be Pioneers
who failed to meet the $100,000 goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, having raised $37 million for his presidential bid, has
far outpaced fund raising of other presidential contenders. The
Bush campaign has also announced that it will not accept public
campaign matching funds, which will allow the campaign to avoid
strict spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said yesterday that the system gives undue advantage to
Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the Democrat's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to put their candidate on a plane _ paid for by
taxpayers _ that's called Air Force 2,'' said Bush. ``And that
person can fly around the country, the whole time on taxpayer
money, making all kinds of promises _ and in the meantime, have an
opponent stuck with a bunch of limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Others on Bush's Pioneer list include Michigan Gov. John Engler;
state Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo; Houston lobbyist and attorney
Joe B. Allen; former Florida Gov. Bob Martinez; and Colorado Gov.
Bill Owens.

`SHORT AND SWEET': QUICK MEANS, SWEET ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even people who love to cook have days when they don't have time
to dawdle at the cutting board. So, cookbook writers have responded
with many books geared toward speed. They are rarely filled with
original recipes. Rather, they are packed with familiar ones that
have been dissected and reconfigured _ much in the way
manufacturers retool a production line _ to save the home cook a
few precious minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, food is not a widget, and many times these
streamlined recipes are disappointing. The shortcuts erode the
authenticity, force you to sacrifice ingredient quality with
packaged foods or result in dishes with inferior flavor for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Barnard, the author of ``Short and Sweet'' (Houghton
Mifflin, $25), understands this problem, and in her collection of
more than 175 desserts, she proves over and over that the recipes
can be pared down without losing their integrity.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the book appears as gimmicky as so many other
quick-cook books. But after using it, I almost forgot its theme. It
is smartly assembled with recipes that are appealing and
sophisticated. And there is no flab. There is a brief, well-written
foreword, and each recipe is introduced with an interesting tidbit.
That is all.
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes, like those for rhubarb fool, ice cream sandwiches
and chocolate pudding, serve as reminders: even years ago, home
cooking was not always a labor-intensive ordeal. Almost all of the
recipes are made from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnard is inventive, too. Tangelos in warm caramel sauce is
a clever dish. She takes two flavors, citrus and herbs, that have a
natural kinship in savory dishes, and places them under a sweet
lens: the caramel sauce contains rosemary, bay leaves and B&AMP;B
liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   Many of her desserts contain ingredients that are like a nudge
in the side, that wake up the senses. There is curry in a fruit
salad, salted mixed nuts in honey-nut shortbreads, and Strega in a
syrup splashed over pears with pecorino and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnard pays great attention to flavor and relies on
elementary techniques, like broiling fruit or whisking zabaglione,
to emphasize it. As a result, the recipes are efficient without
sacrifice. I spent no more than 20 minutes (excluding baking) on
any single recipe. The peppered pineapple papayas, which had a
sauce of pineapple, lime juice, rum and jalapeno, were the only
disappointment. The sauce lacked sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Every other one I tried, though, was startlingly good. The
Tuscan rosemary and pine nut bars took about two minutes to
assemble and turned out coarse, crumbly and heady with rosemary,
just as I imagined a Tuscan cookie would be. Candied ginger and
brandied plum sundaes were beautiful _ a sweet and fragrant
rose-colored syrup, soft pieces of tart plum and ginger, all
sliding down a scoop of sweet vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   The butterscotch pudding was a revelation. It takes a few
minutes longer to thicken than the recipe says, but when it does,
it is a treat _ silky, buttery and fantastically rich. Though it
takes very little time to make, it takes even less time to eat.

CLEAR SAILING FOR GERALDO IN MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ In those final seconds of the year, when
most of world's 6 billion people are experiencing millennium
moments among the throngs, Geraldo Rivera will be bobbing on a
70-foot ketch called the Voyager, as close as he can get to the
international date line in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   It might be Fiji. Tonga is a possibility, too. The king of Tonga
apparently is a big Geraldo fan _ he sort of tilts toward big,
period _ and he's planning a party to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very large man with a very big family and seems like a
real fun guy,'' Rivera says.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera seems to be aiming for an off-coast placement when
midnight arrives, the better to capture the moment for his Travel
Channel cable documentary, ``Sail to the Century With Geraldo
Rivera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be among the first to experience the new
millennium, and that's why we're doing it,'' Rivera said an
interview on the TV press tour. ``That's why the date line.''
</P>
<P>
   For all you sticklers out there, Rivera knows that yes,
technically, 2000 will be the last year of the current millennium.
Still, ``going nine-nine to zip-zip is pretty dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, even if Tonga's tops, Fiji's fine. The point is, this is
an altogether good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Come the millennium observance this New Year's, I'll want to
know where Geraldo is, and I'll like knowing he's thousands of
miles beyond serious mischief. Sailing somewhere in the serene
South Pacific, searching for an invisible line in the ocean, seems
a splendid thing to keep Geraldo occupied.
</P>
<P>
   One down, a few dozen to go. If there's room on the ketch for
Jerry Springer, Y2K would be looking sunnier still.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera has been at this for two years, sailing around the world
with his family since they left Cape Cod on Aug. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That was thousands of miles ago, though Rivera hasn't been under
sail continuously. He does have a day job. No, it's been a ketch as
ketch can kind of trip. Right now, the Voyager is docked in
Australia awaiting Rivera's arrival for another leg of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually came to the Travel Channel,'' he said, explaining
the two one-hour specials that make up ``Sail to the Century.'' The
first half is supposed to be shown in December, and the New Year's
Eve climax will be televised sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to document it. At first, I thought I would write a
book about it, and then I said it would probably be better if I
made a movie. We were doing some home video anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be a traditional travel documentary, Rivera said. Of
course not. They'll be stopping periodically to search for empty
bottles and Satan worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   No! Kidding. It'll be unusual because it'll be the Riveras _ dad
Geraldo, wife C.C., their two small daughters and Geraldo's son,
who was 18 at journey's start _ caught in the act of being
themselves, on a cramped 30 feet of floating real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of think of it as National Geographic meets the Loud
family,'' Rivera said. ``Or MTV's `Real People.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera signed an NBC News contract after he set off on his epic
sail. NBC allowed him to continue with the Travel Channel project,
and that decision has produced dividends.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rivera says he was in the Mediterranean and one of
the last to know that Princess Diana died two years ago. So that
delayed his coverage. Same thing with the Kosovo crisis;
incommunicado for more than a week, Rivera was crossing the Indian
Ocean when he heard, late again, that the NATO bombing had begun.
But he was soon behind Serb lines in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightly News'' anchor Tom Brokaw, not as big a Geraldo fan as
the king of Tonga, must have approved of keeping Rivera on board
the ketch and away from breaking news as long as possible. Brokaw
has successfully barred Rivera from the newscast, leaving Geraldo
with the ``Today'' program and with his one-hour specials on NBC.
Rivera says he can manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never be `one of the guys' over there,'' he said.
``But, you know, I'm on my fourth special now. They've been,
generally speaking, highly regarded by most of you all'' _ we all
would be the critics _ ``which is a great pleasure after having
survived six generations of TV critics ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And NBC is big enough that Brokaw and I can co-exist. You
know, it's like hopefully in the future the Kosovars and the Serbs
will get along.''

`BETWEEN SILK AND CYANIDE': BRITAIN'S WARTIME SPIES AND SABATEURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In July 1940, after the Nazis had turned much of Europe into
occupied territory, Winston Churchill created the Special
Operations Executive, with instructions to ``set Europe ablaze.''
The idea was to infiltrate agents into conquered countries,
including France, Norway and the Netherlands, to collect
intelligence, engage in sabotage and prepare secret armies to
harass German forces once Allied landings took place.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the agency was a young cryptographer named Leo
Marks, the son of London's most famous old-book dealer and later
the screenwriter of the cult classic ``Peeping Tom.'' He was 22
when he was hired in 1942 to ``keep an eye on the security'' of the
agents' codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Silk and Cyanide'' is Marks' memoir of his nearly four
years in the agency. It is an enthralling book, one full of an
eccentric charm as well as fascinating, previously undisclosed
details of the secret war waged in the occupied countries. It is
also consistently informed by an understated kind of moral passion,
and that makes it not only a fascinating memoir but an inspiring
one as well. As much an account of his own contribution to the war,
it is a testament to those who risked their lives behind enemy
lines and whose precarious communications with home it was Marks'
duty to protect.
</P>
<P>
   His book is valuable despite some flaws in its execution. In a
few places his story is muddled and difficult to follow. His book
could have used better editing, and the index is unreliable. Marks
is one of those people who cannot resist a witticism, and this
gives his narrative a perpetual and predictable flippancy.
</P>
<P>
   His wisecracks are sometimes pretty funny, but they are often
strained, sophomoric and tiresome. (``When I realized what I
 &UR; should &LR;  have done, I hit my forehead so hard I improved its
shape.'') Still, his story is intrinsically interesting, and he is
very likable. The tendency is to forgive him his foibles and
appreciate him for his many good qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Marks' story is about cryptography and the battles he
fought against bureaucratic resistance to the innovations he knew
were necessary to make agents safer. He insisted, for example, that
unending efforts be made to decode the many agents' messages that
arrived so mangled as to be indecipherable. The pre-Marks practice
was to require the agent to repeat the indecipherable message in
the next scheduled transmission, a practice that increased the risk
that the agent would be caught.
</P>
<P>
   Marks pioneered clever new decoding techniques, and he exhorted
the young female volunteers who did most of the routine decoding
work never to give up on an indecipherable message. In a speech to
the women he evoked a young female agent who has had no sleep for
three nights, is being hunted by the Gestapo and has to re-encode a
message she has already sent:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasn't that agent a right to make a mistake in her coding?
And, if she does, must she pay for it with her life? Must she come
on the air again to repeat her message, whilst German
direction-finding cars get her bearings?''
</P>
<P>
   Marks' book is also an anecdotal history of the agency and some
of its operations. One of his duties was to give final briefings on
codes and coding to agents about to go into the field, and he got
to know many of the men and women who went behind enemy lines.
Among them were members of the commando team that destroyed the
heavy-water plant in Norway that the Germans were using for their
atomic bomb program. The destruction of the Norsk heavy-water plant
is one of the better known episodes of derring-do in the war, but
Mark's portraits of the Norwegian commandos are vivid and intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Marks' account of the Gestapo's capture of almost the entire
network of agents that had been sent into the Netherlands is one of
the best and most concrete you are likely to read about the awesome
uncertainties of behind-the-lines warfare. The agents continued to
send properly coded messages to London. The crux of the matter
therefore was ascertaining from small clues in those messages (one
of which was the absence of the more common coding mistakes)
whether they had indeed been captured and were sending
disinformation with the Gestapo at their shoulders. Marks also
tells the stories of several other agents he briefed or trained,
and his portraits are always deft and touching.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the man known to Marks as Tommy (real name Forest
Frederick Yeo-Thomas), a Royal Air Force lieutenant who spoke
perfect French and was part of the Free French branch of the
British agency. How Marks remembers verbatim conversations he had
with Yeo-Thomas that took place 50 years ago is not explained. But
these conversations have a terse, rough sort of camaraderie about
them, and they ring true.
</P>
<P>
   Yeo-Thomas made several undercover trips to France, the last one
to try to rescue another leader of the Free French Resistance,
Pierre Brossolette, captured by the Gestapo in Brittany early in
1944. The story of Yeo-Thomas' rescue effort as filtered through
the eyes of his friend back in England would alone justify this
book.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much else here as well, including the stories of
two memorable women who flew into enemy occupied territory but
never made it back. There are funny scenes, too, as when Marks
persuades a roomful of proud and touchy French officers that the
code they believe impregnable is actually easy to break. Marks
tells the suspicious Frenchmen that if they don't change that code,
their agents in France won't be around after the war. Stories like
that one give this book its wonderfully concrete, practical and
ultimately moral character.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Lore has it that Muhammad Ali is partial to the rice
and beans. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. liked the fried
chicken, Sammy Davis Jr. and Cab Calloway the corn muffins and
catfish. And Mayor Harold Washington held legendary strategy
sessions over the baby back ribs and black-eyed peas.
</P>
<P>
   The place is Army &AMP; Lou's, smack on the South Side of Chicago, a
city that over the years became perhaps the greatest stronghold of
soul food in the North. Army &AMP; Lou's, like soul food itself, is
still a stalwart, still serving chitterlings and smothered chicken,
still attracting politicians like Mayor Richard M. Daley and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson to take the pulse of the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But soul food in Chicago has been breaking out of some of its
familiar boundaries _ geographically and gustatorially. At new
``soul'' restaurants in new neighborhoods, the catfish may be
studded with pecans and the cook may not even be black. And as soul
food branches out, it reflects changes in the city, in Chicago's
black population and in the very role of soul food itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Chicago has become far more diversified,'' said Sterling
Plumpp, a professor of African-American studies and English at the
University of Illinois at Chicago. ``African-American culture has
arrived to the point where it's being accepted in other
communities, and African-American cuisine is being mainstreamed.
There are select geographies in the city now where skin color is
not used as a passport for participation in communal life.''
</P>
<P>
   That is no small feat in Chicago, still one of the country's
most segregated cities, where, beginning early in the century,
waves of blacks migrating from the South clustered primarily on the
South and West Sides. Soul food, passed down through generations of
plantation and sharecropper families, swept into these
neighborhoods the same way the blues did, as people from
Mississippi and Georgia and Alabama brought their mothers' or
great-aunts' recipes for sweet potato pie, collard greens and the
parts of the hog like the feet and intestines that were
traditionally left to slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them set up cafes, which became pivotal gathering
places. Black celebrities and sports stars stopped in, and
politicians of all races knew the value of visiting prospective
voters there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost, in some way, as important as the church or the
barbershop or the beauty parlor,'' Plumpp said. ``It's a safe place
to meet and talk and discuss. At a time when the city was not as
open to African-Americans as it is now, it was a place to call
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some soul food restaurants still serve that purpose, but others
are simply intended to be entertaining places to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul food has quote-unquote come out of the closet, and it's
no longer perceived as scraps,'' said Dolores Reynolds, the latest
owner of the 54-year-old Army &AMP; Lou's.
</P>
<P>
   But another kind of stratification is taking place, Plumpp and
others say. The blacks and whites who eat at the new soul food
restaurants like the Shark Bar, where pork chops sell for $14.95,
rarely make it to more traditional, less expensive places like
Nina's on the far West Side, where pork chops cost only $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the assimilation of soul food is traveling in both
directions, with some of the old-timers braiding in new ideas. At
Army &AMP; Lou's, Ms. Reynolds has tried to sprinkle in updated
approaches, using turkey instead of bacon to season collard greens
and replacing fatty pork neck bones with beef, without alienating
her regulars or disregarding the homespun tradition of soul food.
When she took over the restaurant seven years ago, the patrons were
about 80 percent old-timers, ``which really worried me,'' she said.
Now about half are new diners.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in homage to the ``Amistad'' movie and opera craze,
she whipped up a spicy black-eyed-pea soup with okra and tomatoes
and called it M'baazi. It's still on the menu, but to keep her
regulars comfortable, she deleted the African name and calls it
black-eyed-pea and okra soup.
</P>
<P>
   More seismic changes are noticeable at places like Soul Kitchen,
a colorful, eclectic restaurant in the Soho-esque Wicker Park
neighborhood. The menu is a melange of Cajun, Caribbean and even a
few Indian, Mediterranean and Mexican influences. Many dishes are
piled high in arty layers, like the fried green tomato special
stacked like a napoleon with smoked trout and horseradish sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few classic soul food dishes are served, and even those
take liberties. The catfish is gussied up, coated with pecans,
sauteed and flavored with Dijon mustard and lemon juice. Grits
arrive with Cajun shrimp, tasso, mushrooms, tarragon, scallions and
Herbsaint, an anise-flavored liqueur. Monique King, who until
recently was the chef, said she made the grits not with water or
even milk but with heavy cream, Parmesan and a little nutmeg,
``treating them a little more like polenta.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King, who is of Puerto Rican descent, is well aware that the
``soul'' in Soul Kitchen is a metaphorical emotion rather than a
literal culinary tradition. She said she occasionally hears a ``How
dare you?'' from customers, ``mostly people of color.'' But she
said she sees her menu's mission as a melding of tastes from many
cultures. ``What makes us the same as any sort of soul food place
is the notion of making not the most fancy ingredients out there
taste good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of the Loop at the Shark Bar _ part of the New York,
Los Angeles and Atlanta chain _ soul food sticks closer to
tradition but still hits the trends. The menu features pork chops
smothered in skillet gravy and honey-dipped fried chicken. But the
chef, Michael Marquez, also serves catfish with the usual side
dishes of black-eyed peas and collard greens stuffed inside, or
hickory-smoked barbecued salmon with sauteed spinach and
horseradish whipped potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't understand that soul food is a
feeling,'' said Marquez, who grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant in
Brooklyn. ``It's a way of cooking, allowing flavors to come out
without sitting here measuring this and measuring that.'' He said
his mother, who was from the South, cooked a sweet potato pie so
good he is trying to persuade the management to do it her way,
roasting the potatoes rather than boiling them, because boiling
takes away some sweetness and color.
</P>
<P>
   With all the tweaking and teasing going on, there are still
plenty of places in Chicago where, quite consciously, nothing has
really changed.
</P>
<P>
   One classic is Nina's, a homey place with green and white
checked tablecloths and green vinyl booths. The Rev. Snirly
Simpson, 56, started it 15 years ago with his mother-in-law as cook
and his mother as baker. His mother-in-law moved back to
Mississippi and his mother died, but Nina's still attracts
regulars: city workers, school employees and tradespeople, mostly.
Simpson, who is the pastor of the Mound Ridge Baptist Church,
dishes out pastoral advice on occasion along with his Mississippi
sausage, country ham, salt pork, grits, ham hocks, candied yams and
peach cobbler.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said one hallmark of soul food has always been
affordability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make sure if a person don't have but a dollar and
dime, he can still get something to tide him over for the day,'' he
said. ``Everybody doesn't want to spend what the price for pork
chops is, so they might be eating ham hocks _ ham hocks are less
expensive. We have a meal in a biscuit: a sausage patty, one egg in
a biscuit, for 99 cents.'' But even more important is making sure
his food remains a touchstone of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us who have migrated from the South were accustomed to
their mother, their grandmother, who went into the kitchen and put
some things together,'' he said. ``When you get to changing with
the changing times, you lose some of that. You get away from Big
Mama's potatoes, you get away from chicken and dumplings.''

WRESTLING SHOWS GAIN STRENGTH  
 OLD NAME, NEW GAME  
 A `NIGHTLINE' DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Program times are for the New York area.) 
(lb)

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The first five days of the twice yearly
Television Critics Association convention here might have been
mistaken for a sociologists' gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Racism vs. ``colorblindness'' dominated the interview sessions,
thanks to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People and its announcement on July 12, two days before the
convention began, of a campaign to lobby for more ethnic diversity
on prime-time television.
</P>
<P>
   On the sixth day UPN changed the subject. Suddenly all anyone
wanted to talk about was professional wrestling, which will expand
from its cable niche with a two-hour Thursday night show on UPN
called ``W.W.F. Smackdown,'' starting on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   That sudden shift of focus was paradoxical because UPN, sixth
among broadcast networks in the Nielsen ranking, has perhaps the
best record on racial diversity, along with CBS.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's lineup includes ``Moesha,'' returning for its fifth
season; ``The Parkers,'' a ``Moesha'' spinoff; ``Grown-Ups,'' a new
comedy starring Jaleel White (Steve Urkel on ``Family Matters'');
``Malcolm and Eddie,'' a returning buddy sitcom, and a new comedy
called ``Shasta McNasty,'' all with interracial or predominantly
African-American casts.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, UPN's day at the microphones, Dean Valentine, the
network's president, fielded four questions on racial issues, seven
on other topics and 15 (not counting follow-up questions) on
wrestling. Most questions dealt with the perceived violence, sexism
and vulgarity of the decades-old spectacle, which, like the popular
culture around it, has become more blatantly suggestive in its
story lines and characters.
</P>
<P>
   Although UPN will give the ``W.W.F.'' show a TV-14 label,
meaning that it is not intended for those younger than 14,
Valentine called the show ``an incredibly mild form of
entertainment,'' adding that ``there's not a `Rocky' movie made
that isn't more violent than any `W.W.F.' show.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he said that ``Baywatch'' was more sexist and ``Walker,
Texas Ranger'' more violent. Still, he had trouble convincing the
audience of critics that it was not sexist to have, as the
``W.W.F.'' show does, a character called the Godfather, who struts
on stage with a bevy of showgirls he calls his ``hos'' and whose
signature phrase is ``Pimpin' ain't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's comedy,'' Valentine admonished critics. ``Lighten up.''
Wrestling, he said, is comic-book-style entertainment, not to be
taken terribly seriously. ``We do not believe there is anything
sexist or violent about the W.W.F.,'' he said. ``Were it not for
the fact that there is occasional bloodletting, it wouldn't even be
TV-14; it would probably make it TV-PG.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Name, New Game
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment executives are forever having to admit mistakes _
``Oops, that show didn't work; cancel it'' _ but rarely are such
admissions heard from the head of a top news organization. It
happened last weekend, though, when Rick Kaplan, president of
CNN/U.S., announced a makeover of the 10 p.m. magazine program that
had been his baby, ``CNN Newsstand.''
</P>
<P>
   The name will remain, but ``Newsstand'' as three distinct
programs, each a specific partnership with a Time Inc. magazine _
Time, Fortune or Entertainment Weekly _ is gone. Instead ``CNN
Newsstand'' will appear five nights a week, combining live news
updates with magazine-style reports, some of which will still be
done in conjunction with various sister magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Too few viewers, too many pre-emptions. Kaplan said
that breaking news had forced him to pre-empt fully half the
``Newsstand'' programs in January, February and March, which had
helped sink the ``Newsstand'' Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real tough to have a breaking news story happening and
then at a key time when people tune in say, `And now, an hour of
Entertainment Weekly or an hour of Fortune, as wonderful as those
programs were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But breaking news is always an occupational hazard for a 24-hour
news network. When Kaplan announced the start of ``Newsstand,'' he
said that CNN needed some high profile ``appointment viewing''
programs in prime time to shake the ``news wheel'' doldrums and to
hold onto the audience of its highest-rated show, ``Larry King
Live'' at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   So what has changed? ``I'm hoping that I'm a little smarter than
I was a year or two ago when I first came,'' Kaplan told reporters
on Saturday. ``You can put a great mix of programs on an
entertainment network, and people expect that kind of diversity.
But CNN's audience is special, and they do expect news.''
</P>
<P>
   On CNN even the ``appointment'' programs like ``Larry King
Live'' or ``Moneyline'' need to address the day's hot topics, he
said, because CNN's audience expects that. ``What we've learned is
that we need to touch base with folks, so they know we're out there
covering the news of the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One entry that will survive the revamping: ``CNN and Time,''
which will appear on Sunday night at 9. That is the program that
forced Kaplan and CNN to make perhaps their biggest admission of
error ever: the retraction of a report on the Tailwind secret
military operation in Vietnam, which appeared on the debut of the
``Newsstand'' series.
</P>
<P>
   A `Nightline' Dream
</P>
<P>
   Ted Koppel said he hated the phrase but he used it nonetheless:
He wants ``Nightline'' to remain ``cutting edge.'' So ABC has given
Koppel and his partner, Tom Bettag, the ``Nightline'' executive
producer, eight 10 p.m. slots on Thursdays starting next week to
attempt this, with a series called ``Nightline in Prime Time: Brave
New World.''
</P>
<P>
   Reported by the unconventional and sweepingly inquisitive Robert
Krulwich, the eight programs tackle seemingly weighty subjects _
the wisdom of cloning, possibilities of life on other planets, the
absorption of computers into human brains _ in decidedly unweighty
and provocative ways.
</P>
<P>
   Krulwich uses performance artists, computer gadgetry and even a
house band (They Might Be Giants, who appear in each episode) to
illuminate his subjects. ``I've always been jealous of the people
who made the `other' side of television,'' Krulwich said. ``Shows
like `Homicide,' `Seinfeld,' `The Sopranos' because they can shoot
the moon, creatively, inventing situations, inventing
complexities.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he wants to ``invent'' news. But Krulwich said that the
formats for presenting news topics to viewers have become
routinized and predictable, with certain expected rhythms, tones of
voice and story arcs.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to break that mold, he said, and to ``try to do what
the best guys in Hollywood do, and be as daring, as complex, as
original as we can be.'' He added, ``How far you can expand the
style of storytelling and still have it feel like a news show?''
</P>
<P>
   This results in a series that, if successful, could be added to
the ABC prime-time lineup at midseason. If nothing else, the series
has helped to reinvigorate Koppel and Bettag, whose contracts
expire next year. Both said they intended to stay at ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more deeply invested in `Nightline' than we've ever
been,'' Bettag said.

CALIFORNIA TIGHTENS GUN LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gov. Gray Davis declared California the state
with the nation's strongest gun laws after signing into law a bill
that will help restrict the manufacture and sale of assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the measure will only lead to confusion and
litigation when it takes effect Jan. 1, as gun makers, dealers and
buyers try to decode the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The new restrictions, which Davis signed into law on Monday,
will ban guns with some accessories typically found on assault
weapons. A second bill he signed limits the purchase of handguns to
no more than one per month per person.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deadly weapon of war is not going to destroy one more
future,'' Davis said, holding up a cut-in-half Chinese-made SK-47
with several features that will be illegal starting Jan. 1. ``This
bill is now law.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who owns guns defined by the law will have to register
them with the state attorney general by 2001. No one has to turn in
legally owned guns. Davis and other legislators said the new law,
which bans semiautomatic weapons with accessories such as pistol
grips and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition,
will end the sale of copycat assault weapons that don't fall under
a 10-year-old law.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Hensley, the state liaison for the National Rifle
Association, said the new law will not stop the flow of weapons,
only force confused dealers to make small modifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come the first of the year, everyone will discover that this
is not a ban,'' Hensley said. ``We'll be in court because there are
all sorts of terms in the bill that are not defined.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hensley said he doesn't know what to make of the
ban on pistol grips that protrude ``conspicuously beneath the
action of the weapon'' on semiautomatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure, sponsored by state Sen. Don Perata,
D-Alameda, said the law is clear and will stand any test in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten the best legal minds that we could to work on
this bill,'' Perata said. ``I'm as confident as any one person can
be that what can be done has been done in this law.''
</P>
<P>
   Perata said California now has the most widespread ban of
copycat weapons.

<P>
   Luis Tolley, the Western director for the Handgun Control
advocacy group, said California's assault weapons laws are the
strongest in the country, particularly because of the provision
banning large magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no state that comes close,'' Tolley said.
</P>
<P>
   Tolley said only Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina have laws
that restrict handgun purchases to one per month.
</P>
<P>
   The bills were set up to remove loopholes in the 1989 California
assault weapon law, which outlawed specific gun models but was
easily thwarted by slightly modifying and renaming the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Popular guns like the Colt AR-15 and TEC-DC9 will be illegal to
possess, because of the size of their pistol grips, magazines or
other features, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the types of guns used in mass killings at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., would be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   The law bans detachable magazine semiautomatic rifles with
thumbhole stocks, vertical or forward handgrips, folding or
telescopic stocks, grenade or flare launchers and flash
suppressors.
</P>
<P>
   It also bans detachable magazine pistols with threaded barrels,
a second vertical handgrip or a shroud that allows the gun owner to
fire without burning his or her hand.

 &HT;    HIRING OF AIDE HIGHLIGHTS GORE'S TANGLED HISTORY ON TOBACCO
ISSUE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first campaign for president, back in 1988,
Al Gore would occasionally cite his proposal to strengthen the
health warnings on cigarette packages as an example of his own
political courage.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Tennessee, a state with about 100,000 tobacco
farmers, ``it was not easy ... to lead the fight (in Congress) for
the toughest possible health warnings,'' the then-junior senator
from the Volunteer State would say.
</P>
<P>
   But critics charge that Gore's recent hiring of Carter Eskew, an
old friend and media adviser, to help him in his current
presidential campaign is hypocritical because Eskew helped kill
tobacco reforms backed by the Clinton administration last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore really believed his own speechifying about values,
he wouldn't hire a front man for the merchants of death, the
tobacco industry,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional
Accountability Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smacks of hypocrisy, because the vice president has taken
such a militant stance against tobacco over the past few years,''
said Darrell West, a political science professor at Brown
University. ``And that helps opponents who want to paint Gore as
just another Washington politician engaging in politics as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides say the hiring of Eskew, considered one of the most
skilled image-shapers in politics, has nothing to do with Gore's
policy on tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has worked hard to keep tobacco out of the hands of
children and he will continue to do so,'' said Roger Salazar, a
presidential campaign spokesman. The addition of Eskew to the
campaign team ``doesn't change that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even some people dismayed by Gore's hiring of Eskew do not
question the vice president's support for anti-smoking initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carter Eskew did a terrific job of harming the greatest piece
of legislation ever to come down the pike,'' said Bill Novelli,
president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. ``I also believe
Vice President Gore's commitment to protecting kids from tobacco
was and is genuine. I find it all ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Eskew is just the latest twist in Gore's long and
conflicted relationship with tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who only months ago announced a $142 million
federal research effort to combat underage smoking, has supported
the federal government's tobacco allotment program virtually
throughout his 23-year career in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The program restricts the acreage on which tobacco can be grown.
The restrictions keep the price of tobacco high, making it a
lucrative cash crop for small farmers who either grow it themselves
or sell their allotments to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it's legal and is going to be grown and sold, ...
then of course we have the right to structure the marketplace and
say the money that is earned growing tobacco should go to the small
family farmers rather than to a few large companies,'' Gore said in
a presidential debate in Iowa in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent campaign swing through North Carolina, Gore
tried to emphasize his own emotional ties to tobacco farming with
words the Republican National Committee gleefully faxed to
reporters following the hiring of Eskew:
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout most of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to
know that with my own hands, all of my life, I've sprayed it, I've
chopped it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and
stripped it, and sold it. I know what what it's about, how
important that way of life is.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments were intended, in part, to relieve tobacco
farmers's worries about Gore and the legislation he had introduced
five years earlier in the House to require cigarette makers to
place stronger health warnings on their product.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation grew out of the illness of Gore's sister,
Nancy, a smoker who only recently had been diagnosed with lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans did not know of his sister's death until Gore
spoke of her in an emotional speech at the 1996 Democratic National
Convention, concluding with a vow to protect children from the
dangers of smoking ``until I draw my last breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, however, Gore acknowledged that he continued to
receive annual checks from his family's tobacco farm for several
years after his sister's death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the twists and turns in Gore's relationship with
tobacco, one of his biographers and harshest critics, former ABC
news correspondent Bob Zelnick, insists there has been ``no
substantial change'' in Gore's position: endorsing government
efforts to discourage young Americans from smoking while supporting
the system that guarantees good prices for farmers.

REAL ESTATE SITES OFFER VIRTUAL HOUSE HUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Material for an infobox is at the end of this report.) 
(lb) 
 By DWAYNE FATHERREE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet revolution is changing the way a lot of businesses
interact with potential clients, but nowhere as visibly as in the
real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers used to be at the whim of local agents when searching for
a new home. Because not everyone has access to the listings that
agents use to market properties, the layman had to depend on
professional help to get a true picture of the home market.
</P>
<P>
   Now all prospective buyers need is a computer with an Internet
connection, and the whole world is at their feet. And at this
year's Real Estate Connect '99 conference in San Francisco, online
industry leaders were recognized for their achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate sites have moved beyond simple property listings and
pictures of homes for sale. Many now offer step-by-step guides for
getting the best deal possible on your home, from advice on
choosing agents or lenders to looking for potential trouble spots
in your new home.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you wanted to, you could find, finance and close on
a home without ever seeing it in person.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the preferred method, of course, but it shows how the
real estate industry has embraced the Web. For example, many
lenders work with online sites to accept applications now, turning
what used to be an interminable wait for approval into a 24- to
48-hour process.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the move to consolidate online listings (such as
on Microsoft's HomeAdvisor site) means shoppers can get a better
idea of home values in specific areas nationwide without a lot of
trouble. Just pick a ZIP code and you can see a fairly
comprehensive selection of available properties.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to find an agent to help you secure the property you
want, there is online help for that as well. HomeGain.com offers
agent listings and advice on selecting the right agent for your
needs. Additionally, the American Association of Realtors site
(www.realtor.com) will help the uninitiated find a local licensed
Realtor.
</P>
<P>
   Like most businesses, the real estate industry doesn't want to
replace its offices with online services. But re-engineering those
functions that can be moved to the Internet makes it easier for
incoming clients to be more aware of the process. That sort of
education makes the job of the agent much easier.
</P>
<P>
   It could also serve to remove some of the mystery from the loan
process, which is still listed as one of the most stressful life
events humans experience. Although making so much information
available to the public may make the agent a redundant fixture in
real estate trading, there is still no replacement for an
on-the-ground representative protecting your rights. And, if you
are better informed going into a purchase, the agent's handholding
will be that much less time consuming.

'99 conference

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of heavy showers and thunderstorms will erupt over the
southern Great Lakes on Wednesday morning as a stream of very humid
air flowing northward impinges upon a slow-moving warm front.
During the day, the showers and storms will move east and
southeast, reaching the upper Ohio Valley and western Pennsylvania
by evening. Local flooding is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of showers and thunderstorms will form over the
southern Middle Atlantic States near the eastern extension of the
front. Partial sunshine and very humid conditions will cover the
remainder of the Southeast with spotty, mainly afternoon
thundershowers occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Sinking currents of air associated with high pressure over New
England will promote ample sunshine and pleasantly warm conditions
over the Northeast on Wednesday. Humidity will stay low, though
breezes from the south will bring increasing humidity on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A weak disturbance near 20,000 feet will spiral slowly westward
into southern Texas, causing numerous showers and thunderstorms.
Showers will be most likely just inland from the coast where
developing sea breezes undercut and lift sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-altitude disturbance will cross the interior
Northwest, sparking spotty thundershowers east of the Cascades
while onshore breezes bring patchy clouds to coastal areas.
California will be mainly sunny, aside from a few morning clouds
near the coast. Elsewhere, residual moisture in the lowest few
thousand feet of the atmosphere will cause scattered thunderstorms
over the high ground of the southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Trading Places
</P>
<P>
   While Newark, N.J., set a record high of 100 degrees on Monday,
marking the fourth time this month of reaching the century mark,
Las Vegas notched its 12th consecutive day with readings below 100
degrees, setting a new record. So far in July, Las Vegas has had
100-degree temperatures on only seven days. The fewest number of
days of 100 degrees was 18, in 1984. Unless the mercury reaches 100
every day for the rest of the month, this record will also be
broken. Clouds and thunderstorms associated with an active monsoon
have kept the desert city unusually cool by summer standards.

IS `SEINFELD' SPINOFF A RUMOR OR REALITY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Phil Morris must have found the whole thing
professionally unsettling or, at least, personally amusing. One
moment he's a B-list actor whose last TV credit was The Love Boat:
The Next Wave on a D-list network. The next, he's resurrecting his
recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie
Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry
Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.
</P>
<P>
   And slated for 8:30 Thursday nights, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who normally scurry by Morris en route to a
higher-grade celebrity are sticking tape recorders in his face and
clamoring for more specifics concerning the big announcement that's
really no announcement at all.
</P>
<P>
   Says Morris, as a joke, I hope: ``This whole thing could be
wrapped up by the time I make it home.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to his pretentiously sordid profession, a
business in which the art of the deal can be something of a bizarre
art form in itself. That no matter how much talent you have, or how
decorative a resume you possess, you're only as valuable as you're
perceived to be.
</P>
<P>
   Read on and this might make sense yet.
</P>
<P>
   Morris hasn't signed anything for anyone. In fact, he hasn't
even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy
series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny
punch line in a Honda TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as newspapers ran the item, entertainment television picked
up the story. And as one cable executive said while reading the
blurb in the Los Angeles Times, under the heading ``Seinfeld
Spin-off?,'' ``If they hadn't made a deal, they're probably in
serious talks by now.''
</P>
<P>
   This reminds me of the 1989 film The Big Picture, in which a
young filmmaker, depressed by his inability to find work, spends an
afternoon driving around with his girlfriend and, in the space of a
few hours, becomes the hottest director in town. Why? Because he
didn't return phone calls. Not because he's juggling the many deals
pouring in, but because he was simply unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Morris might be experiencing a similar snowball effect. He was
part of a news conference promoting a movie for Black Entertainment
Television when asked about the lack of minority characters who
toiled on Seinfeld. Seeing that the Jackie Chiles character is the
only one to resurface since the comedy ended, Morris was merely
pointing out the irony of it all: that the first and perhaps only
spinoff of a series constantly attacked for its lack of minority
characters could, would, should be fronted by the show's lone black
character.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists pounced on the just-kinda-thinking-aloud comment,
and before long the news was making the rounds as though it had a
life of its own. Which, of course, it did.
</P>
<P>
   In understanding this, we have to remember that a disdain for
truth in labeling seems to be par for the course in this company
town, and though there are certainly talented people working and
creating here, it's by and large a place of style without content
and progression without talent.
</P>
<P>
   It's so backward that it's a wonder the talented ever get their
share of the pie. For example: Despite his striking leading-man
looks and effortless acting style, Jessie Martin was struggling
until David E. Kelley cast him in a handful of episodes of Ally
McBeal playing Ally's (Calista Flockhart's) love interest. Martin's
buzz came not during his episodes but after his character returned
after being written out. Sensing that audience reaction convinced
Kelley to bring Martin back, networks started falling over
themselves to sign the actor to development deals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox seemingly had the inside track, but once Benjamin Bratt
exited Dick Wolf's Law &AMP; Order, NBC came up with the best offer: a
key spot on a stable, creatively satisfying series.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Tea Leoni, a former ``it'' girl who came to our
attention as the good-time girl in the Fox comedy Flying Blind and
nearly immediately landed in the disastrous The Naked Truth. She's
now out of TV.
</P>
<P>
   Jenna Elfman's similar tale had a more positive result. She was
jobless after the Molly Ringwald-led sitcom Townies, in which she
co-starred, flopped. But not for long. This could be debated, but
it seems Elfman raised her stature when, during a promotional party
for ABC stars, she leapt on the stage at the House of Blues and
danced, if you want to call it that.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, the statuesque, slinky Elfman became a hot
commodity _ and ABC gave her a sitcom, Dharma &AMP; Greg.
</P>
<P>
   Will Morris actually do a sitcom based on Jackie Chiles? The
wait will be interesting. Or did his comments have about as much
validity as the cabbie who tried to convince me that CBS is sitting
on a sitcom script of his, one about a taxi driver and the wacky
people who parade in and out of his back seat?
</P>
<P>
   My advice? Don't return phone calls.

   Q: Where can I find pants stretchers? _ C.T., Cleburne
</P>
<P>
   A: They're available in the current catalog of the Vermont
Country Store.
</P>
<P>
   Pants stretchers are wire contraptions that are placed inside
damp pants as they are drying to crease the pants and prevent
wrinkles. They also may be sold in some independent hardware stores
and country stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Country Store includes pants stretchers in its
Summer 1999 ``Voice of the Mountains'' catalog. A large pair sells
for $14.95 as item No. 26082, and a small pair sells for $13.95 as
item No. 30105.
</P>
<P>
   To order or request a free catalog, call (802) 362-8440 or visit
the World Wide Web site www.vermontcountrystore.com. You also can
write to the company at Box 3000, Manchester Center, VT 05255-3000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Tony Goldwyn, the voice of Disney's new
``Tarzan?'' _ G.F., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to him in care of Creative Artists Agency, 9830
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn is a grandson of the ``G'' in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer _
Samuel Goldwyn, the pioneering film producer who co-founded
companies that became Paramount Pictures and MGM Studios. His
parents are producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and actress Jennifer
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old actor made his directing debut this year with
``A Walk on the Moon'' and has two more directorial assignments
upcoming. ``Tarzan'' was one of the first projects his 4 and
9-year-old daughters are allowed to see in full. They never made it
to the end of his first major film role, 1990's ``Ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to turn it off because it was near the end of the movie
and I was about to get axed,'' he told the Toronto Sun. ``When
they're 12, 13 years old, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who wrote ``The Hunchback of Notre-Dame,'' and what was the
history behind the author? _ M.D.H., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Hunchback of Notre-Dame'' is the English title of
``Notre-Dame de Paris,'' a French novel written in 1831 by Victor
Hugo.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo, who lived from 1802 to 1885, was already one of France's
most successful poets and playwrights at the time ``Notre-Dame''
was published. He wrote the book to fulfill an 1828 contract for a
historical novel, finishing it more than two years past deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor Hugo: A Biography,'' a recent book by Graham Robb, was
published in paperback last month.

IS `SEINFELD' SPINOFF A RUMOR OR REALITY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Phil Morris must have found the whole thing
professionally unsettling or, at least, personally amusing. One
moment he's a B-list actor whose last TV credit was The Love Boat:
The Next Wave on a D-list network. The next, he's resurrecting his
recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie
Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry
Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.
</P>
<P>
   And slated for 8:30 Thursday nights, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who normally scurry by Morris en route to a
higher-grade celebrity are sticking tape recorders in his face and
clamoring for more specifics concerning the big announcement that's
really no announcement at all.
</P>
<P>
   Says Morris, as a joke, I hope: ``This whole thing could be
wrapped up by the time I make it home.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to his pretentiously sordid profession, a
business in which the art of the deal can be something of a bizarre
art form in itself. That no matter how much talent you have, or how
decorative a resume you possess, you're only as valuable as you're
perceived to be.
</P>
<P>
   Read on and this might make sense yet.
</P>
<P>
   Morris hasn't signed anything for anyone. In fact, he hasn't
even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy
series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny
punch line in a Honda TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as newspapers ran the item, entertainment television picked
up the story. And as one cable executive said while reading the
blurb in the Los Angeles Times, under the heading ``Seinfeld
Spin-off?,'' ``If they hadn't made a deal, they're probably in
serious talks by now.''
</P>
<P>
   This reminds me of the 1989 film The Big Picture, in which a
young filmmaker, depressed by his inability to find work, spends an
afternoon driving around with his girlfriend and, in the space of a
few hours, becomes the hottest director in town. Why? Because he
didn't return phone calls. Not because he's juggling the many deals
pouring in, but because he was simply unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Morris might be experiencing a similar snowball effect. He was
part of a news conference promoting a movie for Black Entertainment
Television when asked about the lack of minority characters who
toiled on Seinfeld. Seeing that the Jackie Chiles character is the
only one to resurface since the comedy ended, Morris was merely
pointing out the irony of it all: that the first and perhaps only
spinoff of a series constantly attacked for its lack of minority
characters could, would, should be fronted by the show's lone black
character.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists pounced on the just-kinda-thinking-aloud comment,
and before long the news was making the rounds as though it had a
life of its own. Which, of course, it did.
</P>
<P>
   In understanding this, we have to remember that a disdain for
truth in labeling seems to be par for the course in this company
town, and though there are certainly talented people working and
creating here, it's by and large a place of style without content
and progression without talent.
</P>
<P>
   It's so backward that it's a wonder the talented ever get their
share of the pie. For example: Despite his striking leading-man
looks and effortless acting style, Jessie Martin was struggling
until David E. Kelley cast him in a handful of episodes of Ally
McBeal playing Ally's (Calista Flockhart's) love interest. Martin's
buzz came not during his episodes but after his character returned
after being written out. Sensing that audience reaction convinced
Kelley to bring Martin back, networks started falling over
themselves to sign the actor to development deals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox seemingly had the inside track, but once Benjamin Bratt
exited Dick Wolf's Law &AMP; Order, NBC came up with the best offer: a
key spot on a stable, creatively satisfying series.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Tea Leoni, a former ``it'' girl who came to our
attention as the good-time girl in the Fox comedy Flying Blind and
nearly immediately landed in the disastrous The Naked Truth. She's
now out of TV.
</P>
<P>
   Jenna Elfman's similar tale had a more positive result. She was
jobless after the Molly Ringwald-led sitcom Townies, in which she
co-starred, flopped. But not for long. This could be debated, but
it seems Elfman raised her stature when, during a promotional party
for ABC stars, she leapt on the stage at the House of Blues and
danced, if you want to call it that.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, the statuesque, slinky Elfman became a hot
commodity _ and ABC gave her a sitcom, Dharma &AMP; Greg.
</P>
<P>
   Will Morris actually do a sitcom based on Jackie Chiles? The
wait will be interesting. Or did his comments have about as much
validity as the cabbie who tried to convince me that CBS is sitting
on a sitcom script of his, one about a taxi driver and the wacky
people who parade in and out of his back seat?

THE CARTER LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE MUSEUM OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In less than two weeks, our sleepy, mild,
small-town summer is going to end. Forever.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. on Aug. 1, the Amon Carter Museum will close its doors
on the intimate art space it has been for nearly 40 years.
Demolition will commence within days and, with that, the Carter
will become Fort Worth's first museum building to begin catching up
with contemporary times.
</P>
<P>
   I won't pretend to miss the part of the Carter's structure
slated for removal _ the two awkward additions to the original
porticoed box, which opened in 1961 and will be the only piece of
the structure left standing, according to the plan. But I already
feel nostalgic about the quiet encounters with art that it has
stood for, for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugurated as a memorial to a Fort Worth and West Texas legend,
the Carter quickly grew into a study center for American art.
Almost as quickly, it developed into an important gallery with an
exemplary and growing collection. Its following expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Carter was caught in a loop that bedevils countless
other American museums. Its success _ and the success of American
art museums in general _ had rendered the Carter's old building
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   But with its new building, a workmanlike design from Philip
Johnson and his associates, the Carter will be a museum in the most
contemporary sense.
</P>
<P>
   When it reopens in two years, it will be a place where large
groups of people can view a considerable number of artworks. Where
they can socialize, shop, see and be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On an obviously more modest scale, it will be the sort of art
place that came into being with Cesar Pelli's addition/redesign of
New York's Museum of Modern Art and I.M. Pei's East Wing for the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. It will reflect what a
number of museum construction projects from San Francisco to
Houston to New York (and another new building for MoMA) continue to
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   They all serve art. But, even more, they serve people.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton Kramer addressed this in his 1984 essay ``MOMA
Reopened.'' Art museums, he wrote, had acquired ``a new public
which, while lacking both the knowledge and the sensibility to be
found in the elite art public,'' possesses ``a keen appetite for
whatever modes of cultural experience are persuasively and
conspicuously commended to its attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``new'' public continues to exert enormous pressure on
museums.
</P>
<P>
   For this public _ and that means a lot of people reading this
column _ the museum experience includes a lovely and congenial
ambience, information supplied through a variety of media, food,
shopping, social interaction, live entertainment and, yes, art.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Carter's transformation gets under way, crews
working for the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth will begin site
preparation for its new building, designed by Tadao Ando.
</P>
<P>
   Its appearance alone _ to say nothing of the artworks its ample
galleries will be able to show _ will transform everyone's
perceptions of this museum. It will cease to be a regional art
center whose ambitions have fluctuated over the years: It will be a
site of national and international importance in the world of
modern and contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new Meadows Museum is being constructed in Dallas
for similar reasons. A mediocre, Georgian-styled structure, the
Meadows' future home withstands no comparison to those buildings
planned for Fort Worth, although its collection of Spanish art is
of superb quality.
</P>
<P>
   In notable contrast, the Dallas Museum of Art is pursuing a very
different goal. Unlike its sister institutions, the DMA has the
building required for today's and tomorrow's public. But DMA needs
to realize its reason for existing, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   With plenty of help, its new director, Jack Lane, is going to
get it there. And, when the DMA arrives, joined by the Nasher
Sculpture Garden planned for an adjacent lot, there'll be no more
jokes about people going to Dallas to shop and to Fort Worth for
museums.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kimbell, the arrival of new buffet furniture and the
possibility of temporary fabric panels for some of the walls are
about all that's likely to happen this fall. But don't be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, at least five years from now, Kimbell officials likely
will seek an architect to design a building for the site they
purchased across the street. In the meantime, though, director
Timothy Potts and his curators are considering new shows and
acquisitions. They're planning a new handbook of the collection
and, in general, readying for the future.
</P>
<P>
   So, contemplate the forces that have worked on American museums
for the past two decades: They are now at work in North Texas, in a
dramatically compressed length of time.
</P>
<P>
   Look around at museums in North Texas _ and Texas overall _ and
you'll see history repeating itself. And being made.

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A sudden upswing in the number of emergency medical
helicopter crashes has the specialized wing of the aviation
industry looking at re-evaluating its safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, seven air ambulances have
crashed, including one Saturday that killed a Life Flight crew of
three from Hermann Hospital in Houston. In February, a Hermann
Hospital Life Flight helicopter struck a high-tension wire as it
left an accident scene. Though damaged, it was able to land without
injuring any of the three crew members or two patients on board.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven such accidents occurred in all of 1998, according to
the Air &AMP; Surface Transport Nurses Association, which tracks them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of accidents are a little bit high for the industry
this year,'' said Dick Wright, director of safety and flight
operations for the Helicopter Association International, an
industry organization. ``It does have our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten helicopter crew members have died in the rash of crashes,
and three injured, caused by everything from adverse weather
conditions, poor visibility, mechanical breakdown and pilot error.
It is still unknown what caused the fatal crash Saturday in
neighboring Fort Bend County.
</P>
<P>
   In June, two University of Kentucky Hospital pilots, a nurse and
a paramedic returning to base at night in the fog were killed when
their aircraft ran into a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   In April, an emergency medical pilot and two nurses died when
their helicopter crashed on their return to Valley Hospital Medical
Center near Las Vegas in the snow. The other crashes this year
occurred in Sarasota, Fla., near Rockton, Ill., and in Toldeo,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Flanagan, Hermann's administrative director of emergency
services, including Life Flight, said the Houston hospital stands
by its program, which is one of the busiest in the nation. He said
that in 22 years it has had only four accidents, including the one
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers and air ambulance crews say they have been
unable to identify any trends in the accidents. In the 1980s, acute
and chronic pilot fatigue was implicated in 14 crashes in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency medical helicopters, unlike commercial airplanes, are
not required to have flight data instruments that record the
movements of the aircraft and the actions taken by the pilot,
including part of cockpit conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk comes with this type of work,'' said Tom Reiser,
immediate past president of the air ambulance nurses association.
``You are called out at a moment's notice, in all kinds of
conditions and the pilot has to make a decision on whether to take
the mission based on the weather and the forecast predictions.
There are a lot of judgment calls they have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an industrywide practice not to tell a pilot the age,
condition or nature of the injuries of the patient being
transported. The officials' reasoning is they want the pilot's
decision to launch to be based only on safety matters, such as
weather, not an emotional sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Air Medical Services, another industry
organization, says that the emergency helicopters' unusual takeoff
or landing sites _ they often do not have access to helipads and
have to avoid power lines, tall buildings and other obstacles _
have not been a problem historically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the weather or pilot error,'' said Dawn Mancuso,
executive director of the Alexandria, Va.-based association.
``Safety is one of the topics that are always at the top of the
list in terms of our information programs. The policy of the
industry has always been safety has to come first even if that
means the patient doesn't get a helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry estimates put the number of air medical services
operations in the United States that use helicopters at 225.
Annually, they log about 200,000 hours in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Danko, an aviation lawyer and pilot whose firm specializes
in helicopter cases, says fatigue is a probable culprit in many
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been coming to light recently is the duty conditions
for the pilots,'' he said from California. ``They are very harsh,
and the big thing pilots seem to be complaining about is the lack
of sleep. It's one thing to be awakened in the middle of the night
to make a call, and another to have to fly the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue isn't a problem with Life Flight, hospital officials in
Houston say, pointing out that it has 12 pilots and, until
Saturday, three helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not anticipating that something is wrong,'' Flanagan
said. ``We are still very proud of our safety record and our
operations.``
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, president of the state Association of Air Medical
Services, acknowledged that the group is aware of the 1999
nationwide accident rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at what is causing these accidents,'' Flanagan
said. ``Is it related? Is it pilot error? Is it mechanical
failure?''
</P>
<P>
   He said air ambulance programs employ the best pilots, provide
them the best equipment and follow all federal rules and
regulations, but accidents still happen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a Hermann Life Flight crew was injured in an accident
attributed to pilot error; there were no patients aboard. In 1995,
another helicopter had a failure in both engines and landed safely
at an area shopping mall, with no injuries to crew and or the
patients aboard.

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The separation of that noisy champion of
``traditional family values,'' former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
and his wife Marianne is the latest confirmation that politicians
who wrap themselves in moral purity are often full of hooey.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial couple, married in 1981, are now living apart
and reportedly negotiating a divorce settlement. It would be the
former Georgia congressman's second divorce. He dumped his first
wife after she underwent serious cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is not the only politician who preaches so-called
family values for others and ignores those principles of household
peace himself.
</P>
<P>
   The state of his marriage would be none of our business if he
hadn't been so aggressive in his crusade to demolish his opponents
as morally inferior. Political hypocrisy is a legitimate voter
concern. Saying one thing while doing another is not good public
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is no longer a dominant figure on the national
political stage; so his prospective divorce is something of an
afterthought. But he's still hanging around, making speeches for
megabucks and lobbying chums on Capitol Hill. And while in power,
Gingrich blamed a mother's murder of her two little sons on the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed a ``moral framework'' for his plans to dismantle the
domestic policies created by President Lyndon Johnson to provide
aid to education, health care for the elderly, affirmative action
to fight discrimination and assistance for poor folks. ``The
welfare state kills more poor people in a year than private
business,'' Gingrich once asserted, without offering any proof that
he knew what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Other conservatives continue to holler for family values,
catering to the religious right and contrasting their own presumed
integrity with President Clinton's deplorable womanizing and bad
ethical habits. Every 2000 presidential candidate has raised the
issue in one way or another. Some Republican leaders claim that all
party candidates must pass a litmus test of spousal fidelity,
although proof of accuracy would seem to be awkward.
</P>
<P>
   But the moralizers ought to consult some fresh polls and clam
up. Unless they are certain their own spouses will remain passive,
contented and publicly silent, they are begging for a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Take Georgia Rep. Bob Barr, a leader in the GOP drive to impeach
Clinton for immoral behavior. He lectures piously on the evils of
homosexuality, feminism and abortion. He would ban the procedure
with no exception, even to save the mother's life. But Barr's
former wife says he willingly drove her to a clinic for an abortion
during their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Elizabeth Dole, a genuinely squeaky-clean
presidential candidate who doesn't mind advertising it. But her
husband Bob embarrassed her by doing commercials sponsored by the
firm that makes a male potency pill and suggesting recently that he
might make a campaign contribution to one of her presidential
rivals, Arizona Sen. John McCain. This is not immoral, but
certainly bad spousal form. As Republicans of the 1950s taunted the
divorced Democratic presidential candidate, Adlai Stevenson: How
can you run a country when you can't run your spouse?
</P>
<P>
   And how about Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice, a dedicated
campaigner on behalf of traditional, conservative standards of
behavior. It turns out he prefers another woman to his wife of 44
years and wants a divorce. Tsk, tsk. His wife isn't cooperating and
dismisses his expressed hope for a split ``with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fordice was a major supporter of the presidential campaign of
former Vice President Dan Quayle, who swears he has never committed
adultery and is making family values a centerpiece of his campaign.
Under the circumstances, Fordice was forced to bow out.
</P>
<P>
   What is to become of the family values scam when so many of its
prominent advocates turn out to be less than perfect themselves?
Voters aren't dumb. They don't like to be told they are sinners,
particularly by a bunch of politicians who barter their souls for
campaign contributions every day.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia evangelist Pat Robertson, as responsible as anyone for
the political moralizing craze, senses that its day may have run
its course. A year ago he gave up the presidency of the Christian
Coalition and sold his goody-two-shoes Family Channel to Rupert
Murdoch, a ruthless media baron prone to exploiting sex to get
viewers. Robertson took Murdoch's money and ran, leaving our morals
to take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has always had its share of sex scandals and marital
troubles, and always will. But the holier-than-thou clucking
reached drastic proportions with President Clinton's Senate
impeachment trial and acquittal. It went too far. We are sick of
it.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to change the subject. Tax cuts, anyone?

KENNEDY LEGEND, MEMORIES RETAIN TIES WITH TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas tried for a quarter century to forget the Kennedy
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the city now helps the world remember.
</P>
<P>
   As mourners in Massachusetts and New York grieve the loss of
John Kennedy Jr., others gather at what might seem an unlikely
shrine: the Dallas corner where his father was fatally shot 36
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Until 10 years ago, no polite Dallas conversation ever included
certain names and words: ``Dealey Plaza. School Book Depository.
Triple underpass. Grassy knoll.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dallas salutes the memory of President John F. Kennedy in a
Sixth Floor Museum, built inside the Elm Street textbook warehouse
where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is said to have perched.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas will forever walk a tightrope. An entire planet expects
the city to remember and preserve the history of Kennedy's visit
Nov. 22, 1963 _ but never insult his family. The assassination site
has become the city's unofficial No. 1 tourist attraction, almost a
branch location for the seemingly perpetual cycle of Kennedy grief.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fort Worth wants onto the same tightrope. A proposed
memorial statue at the site of Kennedy's final speech, Eighth at
Main streets, is ``nearly ready to be announced,'' city tourism
executive Doug Harman said this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, tourism official Greg Elam drew a breath before
offering advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would only tell Fort Worth,'' he said, ``that whatever the
city chooses will create a great concern for sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more sensitivity over this than anyone else can
possibly comprehend.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy family members originally praised the Sixth Floor Museum
for its dignity and historical accuracy. But when the museum posted
a live ``Sixth Floor Webcam'' street view for World Wide Web
readers last month, a family spokeswoman called it ``insensitive''
and ``tasteless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someone over there tried to do something special with
new technology,'' Elam said. ``It has been widely criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   The Webcam recreates what is believed to have been Oswald's view
of the oncoming presidential motorcade, but not the supposed path
of gunfire. All weekend, a lobby Webcam monitor was switched to
live television coverage of John Kennedy Jr.'s triple-fatality
plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   A steady line of mostly young adults filed into the museum
lobby. The younger Kennedy's generation _ the same generation that
often seems more obsessed with celebrity than with history _ now
dominates crowds at the Sixth Floor Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``People react one of two ways,'' Elam said. ``If they remember
the assassination, they become lost in their own thoughts. They
start remembering where they were that day, their mother, their
brothers, their childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is interesting is how so many visitors are younger. They
want to know what life was like then. They have an active interest
_ a curiosity _ in knowing the entire experience.''
</P>
<P>
   When three young adults fell suddenly into the sea, a new
generation inherited custody of the Kennedy family legend _ and the
lore of their recurring family tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, we can no longer try to forget the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   We must safeguard the memories.

COURT CONVICTS, THEN FREES, JOURNALIST WHO WARNED OF NUKE-WASTE
DUMPING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A crusading Russian journalist was freed from a
Vladivostok jail on Tuesday after a military court ruled that he
had misused his office but was entitled to amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia these days, government authorities virtually never
admit making a mistake. So the decision on Tuesday was probably the
best that Grigory Pasko, the 37-year-old military journalist, could
have expected from the three-man tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Captain Pasko, who spent 20 months in prison while his
case dragged on, said he would fight for a complete vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a slight feeling of euphoria,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Vladivostok, Russia's main Pacific port. ``But we
have not won in general. The verdict indicates that the wolves are
alive and the sheep are alive as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pasko, who was kept in solitary confinement, had been charged
with treason after documenting the Russian navy's practice of
dumping nuclear waste at sea. The military prosecutor had demanded
that he be stripped of his rank and sent to prison for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   But protests from international human rights groups had turned
the case into an embarrassment for the Kremlin. And on Tuesday, the
Vladivostok court appeared to seek a face-saving way out.
</P>
<P>
   Though the seven-month trial was conducted behind closed doors,
the court allowed the press in for Tuesday's dramatic verdict.
Pasko sat in a metal cage as a judge read out the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of treason was dropped, and Pasko was convicted of
the lesser crime of overstepping his authority as a military
journalist. Then the military court sentenced the officer to three
years in prison but freed him immediately by granting him amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Galina Morozova, Pasko's wife, fainted as it became clear that
he would finally be released.
</P>
<P>
   Pasko said in an interview Tuesday night that he was determined
to appeal his conviction to the Supreme Court. But Anatoly Pyshkin,
his attorney, later suggested in an interview that his client might
be wise to quit while he was ahead because there was a risk the
court might order a new trial, renewing Captain Pasko's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Under Russian law, the appeal would be considered by a special
Supreme Court panel made up of seven military officers. A final
decision on whether to appeal will be made next week, Pyshkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety over an appeal is not the only indication of the
fear security authorities have instilled in Russia's environmental
movement.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Federal Security Service raided the
Vladivostok laboratory and home of Vladimir Soifer, looking for
classified information. Soifer, an internationally known scientist
and confirmed Communist, has investigated the problem of nuclear
waste and storage in Russia's Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Nikitin, a retired navy captain, has also been accused
of espionage for helping the Norwegian environmental organization
Bellona document nuclear pollution by Russia's Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin is no longer in prison. But after Russia's Supreme Court
refused to drop treason charges in February, the Federal Security
Service in St. Petersburg has moved to renew the case.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, the director of the Federal Security Service,
recently defended his agency's vigilant stance against
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, foreign secret service use not only diplomatic cover,
but also all sorts of ecological organizations,'' he told the
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the security service is simply trying
to help the military cover up an embarrassing legacy of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of Pasko, a career naval officer, began two years ago,
as he chronicled the Russian navy's environmental abuses.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a reporter for Boyevaya Vakhta (Battle Watch), the
newspaper of the Russian Pacific Fleet. But he also did freelance
work for NHK, Japan's largest television network.
</P>
<P>
   After he provided NHK with a videotape about the ocean dumping
of nuclear waste, Pasko was arrested in November 1997, and charged
with treason for selling secret information.
</P>
<P>
   Denied bail, Pasko kept up the fight from behind bars,
documenting his life in a Soviet jail on the Internet. Throughout
the ordeal, he has insisted he was innocent. And on Tuesday the
court acknowledged that some of the evidence amassed against him
had been collected illegally and, in some cases, was even
fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   While Pasko said he would ask to be reinstated at his military
newspaper, he said his main ambition now is to publish a book on
his experience n solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal has left him with a dim view of the human rights
situation in Russia. And for all the grit he has displayed, he
seemed stunned that he had been allowed to resume his once familiar
life once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like Neil Armstrong on the moon,'' he said.

REAL ESTATE SITES OFFER VIRTUAL HOUSE HUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds, CORRECTS to National Association from American Association in
8thgraf)  (Eds: Material for an infobox is at the end of this report.) 
(lb)

 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet revolution is changing the way a lot of businesses
interact with potential clients, but nowhere as visibly as in the
real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers used to be at the whim of local agents when searching for
a new home. Because not everyone has access to the listings that
agents use to market properties, the layman had to depend on
professional help to get a true picture of the home market.
</P>
<P>
   Now all prospective buyers need is a computer with an Internet
connection, and the whole world is at their feet. And at this
year's Real Estate Connect '99 conference in San Francisco, online
industry leaders were recognized for their achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate sites have moved beyond simple property listings and
pictures of homes for sale. Many now offer step-by-step guides for
getting the best deal possible on your home, from advice on
choosing agents or lenders to looking for potential trouble spots
in your new home.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you wanted to, you could find, finance and close on
a home without ever seeing it in person.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the preferred method, of course, but it shows how the
real estate industry has embraced the Web. For example, many
lenders work with online sites to accept applications now, turning
what used to be an interminable wait for approval into a 24- to
48-hour process.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the move to consolidate online listings (such as
on Microsoft's HomeAdvisor site) means shoppers can get a better
idea of home values in specific areas nationwide without a lot of
trouble. Just pick a ZIP code and you can see a fairly
comprehensive selection of available properties.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to find an agent to help you secure the property you
want, there is online help for that as well. HomeGain.com offers
agent listings and advice on selecting the right agent for your
needs. Additionally, the National Association of Realtors site
(www.realtor.com) will help the uninitiated find a local licensed
Realtor.
</P>
<P>
   Like most businesses, the real estate industry doesn't want to
replace its offices with online services. But re-engineering those
functions that can be moved to the Internet makes it easier for
incoming clients to be more aware of the process. That sort of
education makes the job of the agent much easier.
</P>
<P>
   It could also serve to remove some of the mystery from the loan
process, which is still listed as one of the most stressful life
events humans experience. Although making so much information
available to the public may make the agent a redundant fixture in
real estate trading, there is still no replacement for an
on-the-ground representative protecting your rights. And, if you
are better informed going into a purchase, the agent's handholding
will be that much less time consuming.

SUPPORT FOR SWEEPSTAKES LEGISLATION GROWS IN SENATE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Support for legislation that would crack down on
sweepstakes companies is growing in the Senate as more evidence of
deceptive practices by small firms was uncovered Tuesday by a
Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered a pattern of highly deceptive solicitations by
dozens of smaller companies,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,
chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
which has been probing the marketing practices of sweepstakes
operators. Collins held a hearing Tuesday to discuss the deceptive
practices used by some small sweepstakes firms.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said 33 lawmakers have now signed on to legislation that
she and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., introduced earlier this year,
that would impose new rules on sweepstakes operators.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would regulate those sweepstakes companies that use
deceptive practices to entice people to buy products such as
magazines and compact discs by offering contests that give people
the chance to win prizes like cars, stereos and thousands or even
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate panel held hearings earlier this year focusing
on larger sweepstakes firms like Reader's Digest Association, Inc.
and Publishers Clearing House, Collins said she received more than
1,000 letters from people who had received sweepstakes letters from
lesser known companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these smaller companies tend to be fly-by-night
operations that use multiple trade names to hide their identities
and to confuse consumers,'' Collins said. ``Often their mailings
are designed to deceive even the most cautious consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   One such company, operated by Anthony Kasday of Las Vegas, Nev.,
uses a letter that appears to be from a Lake Forest, Ill., law
office.
</P>
<P>
   The letter says an anonymous client has requested that the
recipient of the letter be located to receive ``your portion of the
disbursement fund.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter goes on to say the client has ``authorized Mellon,
Astor and Fairweather to disburse your portion of the client
fund.'' It then says a $10 fee is required to obtain a $3,000 cash
savings voucher folio.
</P>
<P>
   The voucher turns out to be coupons from national hotel chains,
rental car companies, car service firms like Jiffy Lube and food
chains like Dunkin Donuts, but that is not clearly explained in the
fine print. In most cases a person would have to spend thousands of
dollars to fully use the $3,000 worth of discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Another promotion offered by Kasday tells people they are a
``guaranteed winner'' of $10,000 cash or a 1999 Ford Escort.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Collins, Kasday admitted that Mellon, Astor
and Fairweather is a fictitious name and that the office address is
really a Mail Boxes Etc., a company that rents mailboxes. In many
cases Kasday asserted his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent
when asked whether his promotions were misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The practices used by Kasday and other sweepstakes firms would
become illegal under the bill sponsored by Collins and Levin.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would:
</P>
<P>
   _ ban companies from telling people they are winners when they
haven't actually won anything;
</P>
<P>
   _ require promoters to use much larger print in describing such
details as the long-shot odds of winning a contest and in telling
people no purchase is necessary to win.
</P>
<P>
   _ allow U.S. district courts to impose nationwide restraining
orders to stop delivery of mail in cases where the U.S. Postal
Inspection Service has determined a sweepstakes company is engaging
in a deceptive marketing scheme. Under current law the government
must file for restraining orders in each of the districts in which
consumer response mail is received.

   Previous Senate hearings have focused on how elderly people are
particularly vulnerable to sweepstakes contests and showed that
many spent thousands of dollars purchasing magazines and other
items to enter contests.
</P>
<P>
   David Dobin, who runs a firm called Lone Star Promotions based
in Merrick, N.Y., said he uses up to 40 different company names to
promote the same $10,000 contest. He also offers a $3,000 coupon
booklet that can be purchased for $10.
</P>
<P>
   He also said people who purchase a coupon book could be sent as
many as 25 to 30 additional mailings from his various companies
enticing them to enter the same $10,000 contest offered by Lone
Star.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers blasted that practice and said it should be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they are entering different contests,'' Levin
said. ``It is so fundamentally deceptive what you are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Dobin pointed out that the more often a contestant
enters the sweepstakes, the greater his or her chance of winning.

HERE'S HOW TO HELP YOUR CRITTERS HANDLE THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tiny Chihuahua appeared bloated _ her belly extended, her
legs sticking straight out, stiff. Tremors shook her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an emergency _ temperature 105,'' said the technician,
alerting the veterinarian, who was examining a beagle in the next
room.
</P>
<P>
   The time was 4:45 p.m., the temperature outside 94 degrees _ not
that hot for midsummer in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chihuahua had given birth two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stays in the house, but she was scratching at the door,
wanting out, so I let her out in the yard,'' explained the man who
brought in the dog, accompanied by two young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was only outside for about 20 minutes, but she was running
all around the yard, and when she came in, she just collapsed on
the floor,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The pet was not suffering from heat exhaustion, as the family
feared. She had eclampsia, a form of high blood pressure associated
with pregnancy. Most pets with similar symptoms this time of the
year have been out in the heat too long, often without enough
water, sometimes in a hot car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually 105 degrees is a life-threatening temperature in a
dog, no matter what is causing it,'' said veterinarian Clare
Williamson, who quickly cooled down the Chihuahua and treated her
with calcium injections to stop her postpartum contraction
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   With Texas heat soaring into the high 90s this week, pet owners
should be aware of the dangers of heat stress on animals,
especially puppies or kittens; animals that are older or overweight
or that have chronic health problems; and those that are pregnant
or have recently given birth, said the Texas Veterinary Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to remember, if the heat is unbearable for you
outside, it's going to be unbearable for your animals. Not all
outside dogs were meant to be outside in hot, hot weather for hours
at a time,'' said Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a pet must be confined to a small kennel, veterinarians
recommend keeping it inside with air conditioning when the
temperature gets above 100 for hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we are comfortable in our climate-controlled buildings
and vehicles, we sometimes forget how dangerous the heat can be,''
said veterinarian Margaret Thompson, who operates Thompson Animal
Hospital in Colleyville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal body temperature of a dog or cat is between 100 and
102 degrees. Hyperthermia occurs when the animal's body temperature
exceeds 105 degrees,'' she notes. ``The severity of symptoms
depends upon how high the temperature gets, how long the
temperature has been elevated, the humidity, and even the breed of
dog or cat. Breeds with short noses (such as bulldogs, pugs and
Persian cats) are at greater risk for heat stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogs and cats do not sweat, except from the pads of their feet,
so they do not have evaporative cooling on the surface of their
skin as humans do. Their only cooling mechanism is through their
noses and mouths when they pant.
</P>
<P>
   The long hair of dogs and cats acts like the insulation in your
attic. It is not comparable to our wearing a fur coat in hot
weather. If you have your pet shaved, you are actually increasing
its risk of heat stroke if it is an outdoor pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symptoms of mild and short-duration hyperthermia can include
extreme panting, excessive salivation and darkened gums and lips
(on the inside.) As the duration of the hyperthermic episode
increases, and the temperature continues to rise, the chance of
permanent damage or death also increases. High body temperature can
lead to death of cells in the nervous system and to hemorrhages in
the brain that can lead to seizures, coma and death,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you find your pet showing signs of heatstroke or
hyperthermia, immediate cooling and supportive care are essential
for recovery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   First aid for heatstroke includes gently cooling down the pet
with cool water and getting it to a veterinarian as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson and Thompson recommend putting the pet in a sink or
tub of cool water or wrapping it with a wet towel if possible. If
not, hose it down with tap water and take an ice pack and wet rag
with you to use on the way to the vet's office.
</P>
<P>
   Water and shade are the most important things in preventing
summer heat from threatening a pet's health, said the Texas
Veterinary Medical Association. Make sure fresh water is available
at all times. Remember, heat will evaporate some of it. Ice cubes
in the water are a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Most heatstroke victims seen in veterinary hospitals have been
left in a vehicle, according to TVMA.
</P>
<P>
   Never leave your pet in a closed automobile, said Rolf Lippke, a
spokesman for TVMA. ``If it is 85 degrees outside, it would take
only 32 minutes for the temperature to rise to 120 degrees in a
parked car with the windows rolled up. A five- or six-degree rise
in a dog or cat's temperature could result in brain damage or
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, caution should be taken in exercising pets in the midday
heat, said TVMA. Activities such as hiking or playing fetch with
your dog should be done in the early morning or late evening.
Joggers who want to take their dogs along for the run should
recognize that animals require conditioning to get in shape just as
humans do. Hot pavement can blister a dog's feet.

 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't know what a hippie was,'' said Benjy Eisen as he stood
near a sink filled with dishes in a Winnebago parked at the PNC
Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., last Thursday. ``I'm a kid of
the '90s. In our generation, we don't have Vietnam stories; we have
Lollapalooza tales. Our war stories are about the car breaking down
on the way to a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisen and 10 friends, none older than 26, had rented the camper
to follow the band Phish on its six-week summer tour, stopping in
Holmdel that evening and the next. Most of the friends were from
New York or Pennsylvania, although one had come all the way from
Bakersfield, Calif. They had driven hundreds of miles to see shows
from Kansas to Georgia, sleeping alongside one another on
increasingly dingy foam beds, selling fruit smoothies to earn
spending money, taking time off to play music in state parks, and
meeting fellow travelers at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kids in these parking lots who have seen more of the
country than their parents or their grandparents,'' said Kevin
Schoenecker, who is from Rochester. ``Some people find religion in
it, and other people find just a good time and a new city every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Such countercultural scenes are springing up like weedy flower
beds all over the country, and not just in the wake of Phish.
</P>
<P>
   The ``jam band'' community is a major underground force in pop,
with thousands of fans meeting over the Internet, teaming up to
tour with Phish or other bands like Moe or like the Disco Biscuits,
disseminating hundreds of bootleg tapes and supporting myriad local
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like every city in America has at least one band to
represent,'' said Chris Zahn, who books the Wetlands Preserve, New
York's premier jam-band club, when asked about the scene. Phish
shows can attract up to 70,000. Festivals staged by smaller bands
draw thousands.
</P>
<P>
   This community seems similar to the one being commemorated at
this weekend's 30th-anniversary celebration of the Woodstock
festival in Rome, N.Y. Many of its adherents appear to have stepped
from photographs of that historic event, in their calico clothes
and tangled hair, with their stashes of glass pipes for smoking
marijuana and their fondness for group hugs. But they insist
they're not trying to get back to the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term hippie is such a convoluted stereotype,'' said
Matthew Rudnicki, a 20-year-old student at Clark University in
Worcester, Mass. ``It's an explosive cliche. You jump on tour and
you think there will be people massaging you and feeding you and
it's this bubble of love, and things are a lot grittier than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot last Thursday, the mood of celebration was
underpinned by one of practicality. A ``green crew'' of volunteers
organized by Phish employees met to discuss how it would clean the
lot and recycle cans and bottles after the show. A women's group
called the ``Phunky Bitches,'' which formed through an Internet
mailing list, distributed bags containing condoms, tampons,
antacids, sanitizing gel and other necessities, and made themselves
available to answer the needs of female fans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's used as a safe haven for women if they go on tour,'' said
24-year-old Randy Schwartz. ``They know they can come to us for
supplies or a safe ride to the next show. We felt like women were a
minority on tour, and that it was a male-dominated scene.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These inheritors of counterculture chic strongly resist
romanticizing their lifestyle choices. They don't want to be social
dropouts; most refer to the Phish tour as merely a vacation. ``I
work hard, three jobs,'' said Brad Kluttz, a 22-year-old from
Atlanta who was about to drop off the tour because he was fighting
a bronchial infection. ``This is fun for me, and I love it. They
put on a great show for me every night . . . but I've got
responsibilities at home.''
</P>
<P>
   There are divisions in this subculture between the young
professionals who take time off to join the tour for a while and
fans who scramble to survive. ``Kids with coolers full of beer,
they have the money,'' said 24-year-old Matt Iarrobino, a
television cameraman by day and the lighting director at the
Wetlands by night. ``And there are kids who sell grilled cheeses
after the show just to get to the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they revel in the Phish tour's open and loving
atmosphere, these enthusiasts know that its security is not
guaranteed and its pleasures are ephemeral. But they take its
lessons with them after the tour ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This microcosm _ the lot economy, the relationships here, the
social dynamics, the travel dynamics, everything _ carries over
into a real-world application,'' said John Frattalone, a
19-year-old Long Island native and another of the Winnebago
renters. ``You see businessmen who were involved with the Grateful
Dead scene who have completely different ways of approaching
business, where no one gets hurt. That's what I want to carry out
for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   With their natural-fiber clothing, vegetarian diets and
predilection for trippy music, the members of the jam-bands scene
seem to be carrying on the legacy of their hippie forebears. But
they are not dreaming of a new Woodstock nation. They belong to one
subculture among many thriving today, and as the saying goes, they
may think globally, but they act locally.
</P>
<P>
   They learned their methods from the Grateful Dead, a band that
embodied the hippie stereotype. The ritual of the road trip
originated with Deadheads, the group's patchouli-wearing camp
followers. The custom of trading tapes and communicating over the
Internet, key to sustaining a scene that thrives largely without
the help of the mainstream music industry, also originated with
them. And the band pioneered the diverse, improvisational approach
to rock that keeps fans so deeply engaged.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet observers agree that not until the Grateful Dead disbanded
after the death in 1995 of its leader, Jerry Garcia, did the
jam-band scene solidify. ``People started to look to the clubs,
where you could have that immediacy with the bands and with one
another,'' said Dean Budnick, author of the book ``Jam Bands'' (ECW
Press) and editor of the Web site www.jambands.com. ``The older
people didn't care, and all of a sudden these young people saw
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of popular bands like Moe, the Slip, Galactic and the
Disco Biscuits are in their 20s. ``You've got a generation of
parents listening to their Woodstock CDs, and kids are like,
yuck,'' said Zahn, of the Wetlands. ``The kids are looking to
groove to great music, indulge in drinking and partying _ that
hasn't changed. But the fashions have changed. Kids are realizing
that rave and hip-hop fashion and music is way cooler than this
tired, boring classic rock.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some find the source of their rebellion in
reviving the values of the counterculture. ``Kids wanting to be
more like hippies is definitely counterculture now,'' said Chuck
Garvey, a guitarist in Moe. ``After hard-core yuppiedom, kids think
this is the alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some taking this road make the step into street politics. Larry
Bloch opened the Wetlands in 1989 as a center for activism as well
as a nightclub. He sold the club in 1997, but its Environmental and
Social Justice Center is still open, now coordinated by Adam
Weissman, who is 21.
</P>
<P>
   Every Tuesday evening at 7, the couch-filled basement lounge of
the Wetlands is the site of informal political forums. Last week,
about 30 people gathered as Bre Reiber, a 22-year-old executive
assistant at the peace group Physicians for Social Responsibility
discussed the effects of the United States' policies toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that most inspire the young people at such gatherings
are different from the ones their parents embraced.
Environmentalism is their main cause and they support animal
rights, a nascent movement in the 1960s. According to them, their
approach also differs. ``We're going to do this and get it done,''
Karen Benezra said. ``We're not going to just commune. A lot of it
is finding yourself through ethics and direct action and not wastes
of time and peyote.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benezra's flippant put-down of psychedelic drugs reflected a
certain defensiveness among these young activists. Although casual
drug use is commonplace, many young people disassociate themselves
from the image of the stoned hippie living in a hazy fantasy. They
also rejected the idea, so important in the 1960s, of generational
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're trying to build a generational movement,''
Weissman said. ``Less than a generation gap, there's a cultural gap
between people who feel that going along with a society bent on
self-destruction through massive overconsumption and global
exploitation and fundamental injustice is an acceptable thing, and
those of us who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clara Kramer-Wheeler, 17, gave a personal spin to Weissman's
rhetoric. ``If I was the only young person in a group of activists,
I'd feel left out,'' she said. ``But I go to demos with my parents
all the time. Me and my sister got them back into activism.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dreaming of a mass movement, these countercultural
kids take a do-it-yourself approach to relatively small corners of
the culture, whether that means staging guerrilla protests or
trading tapes of their favorite shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond the music-industry hype, beyond the machine,''
Garvey said. ``Now people go to dance, to meet these other folks.
Tapers support that because they're disseminating the music and
getting people interested in becoming part of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the jam bands are on major labels, and those who are,
like Phish (and, briefly, Moe, before it parted ways with Sony),
stay credible by maintaining some distance from the mainstream pop
world. Phish has never had a hit single; most of its songs are too
long and complicated for the radio. Although the band plays
standard concert venues, it sells most tickets through a
self-maintained mail-order service and holds some special events,
like last weekend's festival in Oswego County in upstate New York,
at unusual sites where the band, not a promoter, makes the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Their fans make such activities possible. The presence of the
jam bands on the Internet is extraordinary. The most popular bands
have elaborate networks of Web sites and mailing lists, and there
is even a database, www.jambase.com, that tracks concert dates
throughout the country. Well-equipped insiders bring laptop
computers and cellular modems to shows, transmitting instant set
lists and reviews on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Fans and artists also organize their own festivals, reasonably
priced alternatives to corporate events like Woodstock, throughout
the summer. The Finger Lakes Grass-Roots Festival, running Thursday
through Sunday at the Trumansburg Fairgrounds in upstate New York,
is one example. Founded by the jam band Donna the Buffalo in 1991,
the charity event has expanded to embrace a world of music _ this
year's performers include the venerable African singer Thomas
Mapfumo, the reggae veteran Justin Hinds and the Irish-American
supergroup Solas.
</P>
<P>
   Moe can't make it to this weekend's Grass-Roots Festival partly
because the band is playing on Friday afternoon at the Woodstock
concert. Garvey is happy to perform for the 250,000 people expected
at the Rome blowout, but he hopes to make it over to Trumansburg
afterward to hang out among 10,000 more like-minded folks.
</P>
<P>
   At the Woodstock festival he does not expect to run into many
``moe.rons,'' as his band's devotees are called. The gathering is
too expensive, too big, and besides, the Grass-Roots Festival and
three Midwestern Phish shows are that weekend. The children of the
counterculture will be scattered as usual, pursuing their
subcultural way of life.

`MY BROTHER, MY SISTER': A SCANDAL AND SEARCH FOR TWO ITALIAN
SIBLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My Brother, My Sister, Sold for a Fistful of Lire'' remembers
one of the darker chapters of post-World War II reconstruction in
Europe. With much of Italy in ruins, a Neapolitan-American adoption
agency arranged for tens of thousands of impoverished children to
be transported to the United States, where they were sold to
American adoptive parents for $10,000 a head.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, organized by Roman Catholic charities with the
knowledge and approval of the Vatican, was cloaked in secrecy. Many
of the children came from desperately poor farming families who
were told that their children would be returned to them when they
were 18. Most, however, fell quickly out of touch with their
original parents. And the adoptive parents were given only the
sketchiest (and in many cases erroneous) information about their
children's backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, written and directed by Basile Sallustio, follows the
search of Pia Dilisa, a stubbornly determined woman from a farming
village in southern Italy, to locate her brother, Dominic, and her
sister, Antoinetta, 45 years after they were shipped to the United
States in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Pia, who was 10 at the time, was the only child in the family
not put up for adoption. Dominic and Antoinetta were 9 and 7 when
they emigrated.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Dilisa asks to investigate the archives of the
charities involved, she is stonewalled by church officials, who
insist that her quest is hopeless because those records no longer
exist. When she presses a 96-year-old priest for information, he
takes umbrage and yells at her for accusing him of lying.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and angry, Ms. Dilisa finally travels to New York,
where she encounters the same evasions she did in Italy. But in
Chicago the facade of official ignorance begins to crack, and a
woman at the Catholic charity organization agrees to contact both
Dominic and Antoinetta.
</P>
<P>
   The three siblings soon reunite, and the movie's final scene
finds them all joyously dancing together in the town square of the
Italian village where they were born.
</P>
<P>
   If the revelations of ``My Brother, My Sister,'' which opens
Wednesday in New York City, are scandalous, the movie's portrayal
of Ms. Dilisa's search is too sketchy for it to cohere as a
real-life detective story. It doesn't show you how one step leads
to the next. And its overall view of the adoption scheme and the
cover-up remains frustratingly vague.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dilisa herself is far from an ideal documentary subject.
Stout and stone faced, speaking entirely in Italian, she seems
resolutely unemotional until the moments you see tears gathering in
her eyes. The human drama is also undernourished. Having finally
glimpsed Dominic and Antoinetta, you don't get to know them or hear
their stories.
</P>
<P>
   What the film lacks in coherence, it tries to make up for in
atmosphere. Sepia-toned newsreels show the war-ravaged Italian
landscape and the New York skyline in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Other scenes of Ms. Dilisa harvesting olives in the Italian
countryside and eating lunch with her husband, whom she sees only a
few weeks each year because he has to work elsewhere to support the
family, evoke a hardscrabble farming life that has apparently
changed little over the last half-century.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is also burdened by the intrusion of a pompous English
narrator given to windy pronouncements like his description of New
York as ``the giant concrete city made of steel, fury and noise.''
Less steel, fury and noise and more diligent connection of the dots
would have made for a far more satisfying film.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The desperation is anything but quiet in ``In Arabia,
We'd All Be Kings,'' a harrowing new play by Stephen Adly Guirgis
that is being given a menacing staging under Philip Seymour
Hoffman's direction by the Labyrinth Theater Company.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the lights come up on the seedy bar that Adly
Guirgis' misfits call home, Lenny, a week out of prison and very
angry about life in general, snarls at anyone who crosses his line
of vision, and pulls a knife on a sniveling addict he calls Skank,
just for reaching for a bowl of peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   The decibel level keeps rising as the emotional stakes get
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arabia'' is an old-fashioned slice-of-life play that takes
place around Times Square before Walt Disney replaced Damon Runyon
as resident folklorist, and it involves a collection of modern-day
losers that even Runyon might find hard to stomach.
</P>

   Zoot-suited craps players have been replaced by junkies in dirty
T-shirts who will do anything for drug money, and the Salvation
Army evangelists are now religious nuts who carve up the
prostitutes rather than preach to them.
</P>
<P>
   There is no romance in this Times Square. The happiest ever
after one teen-age girl can imagine is for her, her friend and her
boyfriend to end up together in the Betty Ford clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Adly Guirgis spends the first half-hour introducing a lineup of
characters one would be loath to meet offstage. But just when it
seems the play will settle for the shock value of its raw and
violent language and imagery _ with some comic relief thrown in at
the expense of the wasted lives it portrays _ Adly Guirgis begins
to tie all his loose ends together in a grim and sad portrait of
life on the streets, almost an updated ``Balm in Gilead'' for the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lenny (David Zayas) and Skank (Trevor Long),
there are Demaris (Ana Ortiz), a teen-ager who pulls a gun on her
mother (Begonya Plaza); Chicky (Tiprin Mandalay), Skank's devoted
girlfriend except when she needs crack money; Charlie (Sal
Inzerillo), a kindhearted bartender, and Jake (Richard Petrocelli),
the bar's owner.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a gem of a performance by Mark Hammer, there is Sammy,
an elderly alcoholic who can't hold a thought for more than 30
seconds and who provides cryptic commentary on life from a corner
table.
</P>
<P>
   Adly Guirgis pulls no punches and offers no sociological lessons
about the failures of society. The degradation these characters
endure to feed their habit _ in one brutal scene Skank is
humiliated by Greer (Russell G. Jones), a gay man slumming, as he
negotiates sex for $20 _ is only occasionally broken by humor.
</P>
<P>
   One funny scene finds Demaris and Chicky trying unsuccessfully
to hustle tricks on the street. ``You've got to smile,'' Chicky
advises Demaris, who keeps scaring off prospective customers.
``You've got to be like a party waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Demaris immediately frightens off another prospect, Chicky
suggests, ``You could do something else to get money, like rob.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, an actor making his directorial debut, has mounted a
crisp and taut production and has molded his good cast into a
strong ensemble that never seems to pause to catch its breath. Ms.
Ortiz and Long are especially effective.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the characters in ``In Arabia'' is bleak. In a
scene in which Lenny applies for a job handing out fliers, the
interviewer asks him, ``Where do you see yourself in five years?''
The line gets a laugh in performance. But as one leaves the
theater, the question returns to haunt. If any of these characters
is alive in five years, it will be a small miracle.
</P>

   TECHNOLOGY-LIMITS _ ATLANTA _ Following a study by Bell Labs,
the buzz in many technology circles has been over the ``limits'' on
future development of microchips. Scientists now see research
approaching limitations on increased miniaturization of chips given
the material now used. James Meindl, who heads chip development at
Georgia Tech, says there's a problem but it won't restrict R&AMP;D
within the next 10 years, and beyond that point there is a solution
already on the horizon: Deployment of tantalum oxides instead of
silicon oxides. Hello, Tantalum Valley. (Holsendolph, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CCE-EARNINGS _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises took a $103
million charge, or 16 cents a share, for its recall of products in
Europe in the second quarter, giving it net income of $33 million,
or 8 cents a share. Excluding the charge, profit was 24 cents a
share, higher than expected. (Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   NETBANK-EARNINGS _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Net.B(at)nk released
quarterly earnings figures Tuesday as well as updated deposit and
account numbers. Security First network bank also released numbers
recently. A look at Atlanta's Internet banks and their growth.
(Clothier, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   HOMEWIRELESS _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Home Wireless Networks,
Inc., has been trying mightily since 1996 to market its technology,
which is an inexpensive package of gizmos that will allow home or
business users to use one phone line to set up a network that
includes computers, printers, faxes and telephone linked
wirelessly. Now Lucent has invested and the regional phone
companies are studying the product and ultimately may market it.
This kind of support can turn a garage business into a
billion-dollar cash cow. (Holsendolph, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MP3 _ MP3.com prepares its IPO this week as the recording
industry gathers in New York City attempting to get a better grasp
on this runaway new medium that has the potential to change
consumer buying habits and record company policies and pracitces
that have been in place for years. The consensus is that old media
must work with the new technologies and find some kind of middle
ground. Everyone agrees it has to be done, but no one is sure how.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's investment in MP3.com could be an attempt to build that
bridge and establish an early toe-hold in an Internet sector ready
to explode. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   EQUIFAX _ ATLANTA _ Equifax announces earnings and an Internet
marketing deal with Lycos. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   COXNET WHEELS 0717: 1999 CHEVROLET IMPALA _ For the Chevrolet
faithful, the Impala name has a long and storied history, and the
2000 model won't embarrass them or its predecessors. (DeVault,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes 3-column color photo of
car's exterior and an 6-pica color photo of car's interior.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: AT A GLANCE _ Fact box previewing the 1999 Chevrolet
Impala.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SHARP DRIVING _ Saturn is about to join the midsize
bandwagon, dominated by three of the best-selling cars in America,
with its new L (for ``larger'') series. (Sharp, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). Includes 1-column color photograph of
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING _ Like a lot of other folks, I used the Fourth of
July weekend to do some traveling. I enjoy people watching. They
put on a much better show than most television programs or movies.
Perhaps my most important observation came in the area of seat belt
usage. Make no mistake about it, I think only dummies don't use
them. (Sharp, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   THE-MECHANIC _ Locating the right shop to fix your particular
vehicle's emmissions problem is going to require a little sleuthing
on your part. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 16. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TESTDRIVE _ Inside and outside, the '99 Isuzu VehiCross is an
eye-catcher that illustrates the diversity and exclusivity that
have come to the sport-utility market. (DeVault, Cox News Service)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-PROFITS _ To compete with national pharmacy chains,
community corner drugstores are clinging to their clientele by
tapping into new markets. A Gonzalez drugstore draws out-of-town
customers by selling specially flavored children's medication. But
the big chains aren't the worst enemy, according to pharmacists _
insurance companies are really pinching the profit margins. (Austin
American-Statesman)

   FBC-ACC-GATECH _ GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Each year, it appears that a
different team is poised to knock Florida State out of the top spot
in the ACC. First there was Clemson followed by Virginia and North
Carolina. This year, the new challenger is Georgia Tech. The
Jackets have quarterback Joe Hamilton and several key starters
returning from last year's team which shared the conference title
with the Seminoles and expect to contend for the ACC title again
this year. What are some of the thoughts of Tech's players and
coaches and others within the conference as the Jackets become the
latest team to challenge Florida State? (Clemons, Atlanta

MYSTERIES IN THE MIRROR OF A DUTCH MASTER'S SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For more than 40 years, Rembrandt made a point of
looking into the mirror and recording what he saw. As a result,
more than for any other major artist, self-portraits came to
represent an important part of his life's work. They show his
development and virtuosity as a painter. They also chronicle his
aging until shortly before his death at 63 in 1669. But why did he
paint himself so often?
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery's striking new exhibition, ``Rembrandt by
Himself,'' which presents all but a handful of this 17th-century
Dutch Master's 75 or so surviving self-portraits, raises this
question and more. Why did he dress up in exotic costumes? Was he
showing off his talent to potential buyers? Was he testing new
techniques on a model who charged nothing and always showed up?
Were the self-portraits true likenesses? Was he peering into his
soul?
</P>
<P>
   These questions have of course long surrounded Rembrandt van
Rijn and, since there are no sure answers, the organizers of this
show have wisely invited visitors to make up their own minds.
``Rembrandt by Himself,'' which includes 60 of his paintings and
etchings as well as works by seven of his pupils, is at the
National Gallery in London through Sept. 5 and will then be seen at
the Mauritshuis in The Hague from Sept. 25 to Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint foreword to the exhibition catalog, National Gallery
director Neil MacGregor and Mauritshuis director Frederick Duparc
say their aim is to cast new light on Rembrandt's ``meaning and
purpose'' in his self-portraits, but they are also realistic.
``What that significance was _ and it was probably not the same
throughout Rembrandt's life _ remains one of the puzzles of the
history of art,'' they note.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is compounded by some unresolved questions of
attribution (such was Rembrandt's prestige that even his
self-portraits were copied by his pupils and admirers) as well as
conflicting definitions of self-portrait, a concept that did not
exist until the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The most romantic interpretation, one that has gained sway in
post-Freudian times, has Rembrandt writing his ``autobiography in
paint,'' engaging in a personal dialogue and steadily acquiring
self-knowledge. But available evidence suggests a more mundane
explanation: that, until the death of his wife, Saskia, in 1642,
when he was only 36, he used himself as a convenient model for
studying light and facial expressions and for portraying archetypal
figures in a popular genre known as ``tronies.''
</P>
<P>
   Saskia's death may explain a subsequent pause in self-portraits.
Yet after he resumed them in 1652 and in the years that followed,
his face gradually wrinkling and sagging into old age, the sheer
force of his presence overwhelmed any suggestion of
experimentation. Now an acclaimed painter at the height of his
powers, he no longer enhanced his image with finery, instead
wearing dark working clothes that insure that his face was the
center of attention. And more than ever he seemed to be
contemplating his mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that is what some viewers see today.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst van de Wetering of the Rembrandt Research Project in
Amsterdam begs to differ. ``It is extremely unlikely that Rembrandt
made his self-portraits as a personal form of self-analysis,'' he
writes in a catalog essay in which he argues that emotional
self-awareness was a product of the later Romantic Age. In his view
Rembrandt belonged to a different age in which an artist might use
a self-portrait to test his techniques and increase his fame.
Rembrandt's self-portraits, he notes, were appreciated in his day
because they were ``typical'' Rembrandts that ``had an added
attraction in that they also showed the face of the creator.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet this does not answer why alone among his contemporaries,
who at one point included Rubens and van Dyck, Rembrandt was
continually drawn to self-portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1606, he began painting himself in his late teens in his
home town, Leiden, although his first appearance in oil was not in
a self-portrait but rather as a wide-eyed and tousled-headed
bystander in two large works, ``The Stoning of St. Stephen'' and
``History Piece'' (cameo roles he later repeated). By his early
20s, though, he has painted his first self-portraits, remarkable
studies of light as it caught his chubby cheek, his eyes shrouded
his darkness.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in physiognomy and expression is apparent in a
series of minuscule etchings, in which he portrayed himself
variously wide-eyed, with angry expression, smiling, open-mouthed,
as a beggar, with fur hat, in a cloak and with loose hair. Yet,
perhaps strangely, with only a couple of exceptions, his painted
self-portraits always show his face at rest, with little hint of
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Still in Leiden, Rembrandt began using himself as a model for
``tronies,'' a 17th-century Dutch word for head or face that came
to describe portraits of character types in which the identity of
the sitter was less important than the image of, say, a soldier or
an Oriental lord. (One 17th-century inventory referred to ``a trony
by Rembrandt, being his own likeness.'') Rembrandt apparently
enjoyed dressing up in rich costumes and plumed hats, often giving
his self-portraits a historical air by wearing 15th- and
16th-century styles.
</P>
<P>
   When he moved to Amsterdam in 1631, while he painted one
self-portrait dressed as a worthy burgher of his day, he soon
reverted to using his face in tronies, often dressed in fur-lined
gowns with gold necklaces around his neck. These paintings were in
turn powerful examples of his portraiture, and he was soon much in
demand.
</P>
<P>
   As important, in the view of some experts, this work showed off
his special talent for rendering fabrics and the human skin. It was
also in these years that thick paint (impasto) began to distinguish
his work from his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the final gallery of this show, however, where a dozen of his
late self-portraits are displayed, it becomes difficult to avoid
seeing Rembrandt more as the man than as the commercial painter.
These works also include two, ``Self-Portrait as the Apostle Paul''
(1661) and ``Self-Portrait as Zeuxis'' (1662), in which he seems to
be performing before the camera: as St. Paul he looks inquiring,
and as the Greek painter Zeuxis he is cackling mischievously.
</P>
<P>
   In the last self-portraits of his life, though, he looks at
peace with himself. In ``Self-Portrait With Two Circles,'' wearing
a white cap and a freely painted dark gown, he is holding his paint
brushes and a palette. In ``Self-Portrait at the Age of 63,''
painted the year of his death, he looks piercingly from the canvas,
perhaps a slight smile playing on his lips. Having tracked his life
through 60 different images, the visitor can be forgiven for
wondering what he is thinking.

DISCIPLINED PRIEST CALLS VATICAN REBUKE ON GAYS `A SETBACK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Robert Nugent, who has specialized in
ministering to gays and lesbians around the nation for the past 25
years, said Tuesday that his rebuke by the Vatican was ``a setback
and a disappointment'' for Catholic homosexuals seeking acceptance
in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a very negative message,'' said Nugent, 61, in an
interview. ``A lot of people are saying, `If they silence us ...
what hope is there?'''
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican disciplinary panel _ the Congregation for the Doctrine
of the Faith _ ruled last week that Nugent and Sister Jeannine
Gramick were barred for life from ministering to groups of
homosexuals. In addition, the two must submit for approval any
future theological writings and are barred from holding any office
in their respective religious orders.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment, known as a formal ``notification,'' was issued
by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, had of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised at the severity of the judgment,'' said
Nugent, adding that he expected the punishment to be a forced
year-long sabbatical, which the Vatican has dispensed in the past
to what it views as errant theologians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several other disciplinary options they had. Short
of excommunication, this was the most severe,'' said Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the penalty, which was approved by Pope John Paul II,
acceptance of Catholic gay and lesbian people in individual
parishes is growing, Nugent said, adding: ``It's a movement that
can't be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramick is a School Sister of Notre Dame and Nugent is a
Salvatorian priest.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, who said he will comply with Rome's cease-and-desist
order, and Gramick, who has indicated that she will decide by the
end of July whether to comply, co-founded the New Ways Ministry in
Mount Rainier, Md., in suburban Washington, D.C., where they have
conducted seminars and retreats for gay and lesbian Catholics since
the early 1970s. They have been under investigation by church
officials for several years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to conducting seminars and speaking around the
country, Nugent and Gramick wrote ``Building Bridges: Gay and
Lesbian Reality and the Catholic Church'' in 1992 and edited
``Voices of Hope: A Collection of Positive Catholic Writings on Gay
and Lesbian Issues'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the punishment, a Vatican statement said that
Gramick and Nugent in their writings and seminars have contradicted
church teaching by failing to stress the Catholic doctrine that
homosexual orientation is a ``disorder'' and that homosexual acts
are ``intrinsically evil'' because they don't lead to procreation.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican said the pair ``have caused confusion among the
Roman Catholic people and have harmed the community of the
church.'' It called their teachings ``erroneous and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Vatican asked Nugent and Gramick to submit
written statements showing their compliance with official doctrine
on homosexuality. But they refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could sign a statement about homosexual acts and
orientation, but I couldn't use the language of `evil and
disorder.' They will settle for nothing less,'' Nugent said.
</P>
<P>
   In their ministry, Nugent said he and Gramick discuss the
church's view on homosexual orientation and sexual behavior but
steer clear of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am trying to win gay and lesbian people back to the
church, I certainly don't want to use language that's going to
cause them alienation and pain,'' he explained. ``If we are working
with divorced people, we wouldn't constantly harp about the evil of
divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Robert Friday, a theology professor at the Catholic
University of America in Washington said Nugent and Gramick have
been careful not to trod too heavily on church teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have emphasized the dignity of the individual person and
have tried to stay away from taking a stance apart from church
teachings,'' said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Gerald Coleman, president of St. Patrick's Seminary in
Menlo Park, Calif., said the Vatican action has sent a strong
signal to Catholic clergy: ``It is important not to dilute or to
falsify or misrepresent church teaching,'' he said.

mothers and daughters learn dance moves and sing Girl Scout songs,
such as ``Alice the Camel.'' But this isn't a typical Girl Scout
meeting because mothers are prison inmates. Nationally, an
estimated 1.5 million children have a jailed parent, and more than
200,000 children have imprisoned mothers, according to the Child
Welfare League of America. Nearly 11,000 women were incarcerated in
Texas prisons in April. Criminal justice experts say parent-child
contact is essential to preserving emotional bonds while a parent
is serving time. The relationship will, hopefully, help the
imprisoned parent to change and the child to cope. But maintaining
the relationship often requires structured programs, such as Beyond
Bars, which gets the mothers and daughters out of the crowded,
assigned-seat environment of routine weekend jail visits. (Martin,

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's fitting that Kula Shaker was the first rock
act to sign up for the Lizard _ a five-day celebration, taking
place in Britain's seaside Cornwall, of the total eclipse of the
sun next month.
</P>
<P>
   Kula Shaker's retro psychedelic vibe and blend of Indian
rhythms, mantras and catchy pop melodies could be the perfect
soundtrack for the Aug. 11 eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nature's celebration of the millennium,'' says Kula
Shaker's Crispian Mills. ``The timing of the eclipse and the year
2000 are going to make this the most happening event of the year.
New Year's Eve may be a bit of a disappointment, actually. But when
the sky goes black for two minutes, it's a good opportunity to
think about change and how nature reflects change.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true child of a '60s star _ which Mills is. He's
the 26-year-old son of Hayley Mills, the former teen ingenue who
starred in such '60s films as ``The Parent Trap,'' ``Pollyanna''
and ``Whistle Down the Wind.'' Mills' grandfather is John Mills,
well-known in Britain for starring in many World War II films.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is I've been culturally privileged,'' Mills says
of his lineage. ``I haven't led a sheltered life. Performing comes
naturally to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills has embraced such concepts as numerology, astrology and
the power of certain letters of the alphabet, including ``K,'' the
title of Kula Shaker's acclaimed 1996 debut.
</P>
<P>
   Just out is the quartet's latest effort, ``Peasants, Pigs &AMP;
Astronauts'' (Columbia), produced by Bob Ezrin (Pink Floyd) with
Mills. Kula Shaker appears Wednesday at the Mayan downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the millennium is simply about inspiration,'' Mills
said. ``We're all looking for things to inspire us to move forward,
give us hope and a sense of excitement about the possibilities of
the future.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ It's 6:30 in the evening, and the crowd is sipping
mint-garlanded mojitos, sparkling flutes of Champagne-and-vodka
mambo kings and lovely, apricot-toned Floridians with squiggles of
orange peel angling from the rims of the glasses. The scene is not
South Beach or the Bahamas, but Madison Avenue, on the four-sided
balcony bar at Asia de Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Sober bottled water and iced tea may wash down lunch, but by
evening, New York has become a cocktail party of sexy, colorful
fruit-filled drinks. Vacation-style drinks. And not just because
it's summer.
</P>
<P>
   Cocktails rule in suave lounges, venerable hotel bars, Upper
West Side sidewalk cafes, funky downtown spots, hot new restaurants
for the latest in fusion food and even in chic temples of haute
cuisine like Daniel, Le Cirque 2000 and Jean Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cocktail is back in a big way,'' said Dale DeGroff, the
``drink chef'' at Blackbird in midtown, where drinks are designed
to be sipped with dinner, not just before or instead of. ``Food led
the way, making palates more adventuresome,'' he added. ``Now the
interest in Latin and Asian cuisines has people drinking cocktails
inspired by those regions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Asian and Latin-fusion trends that prepared taste buds for
the pungent, sweet-and-sour flavors of Southeast Asia and South
America have given rise to a new breed of drinks. Martinis, which
steered a generation back to the cocktail shaker, are now made with
sake or fresh ginger or, at Lot 61 in Chelsea, shiso leaf. Other
new cocktails have the alluring tartness of mango and passion
fruit. Rum and tequila drinks are more in demand than ever. But
increasingly, drinks are getting their kick from once unfamiliar
spirits like pisco, a potent Peruvian brandy; cachaca, the
Brazilian sugar-cane juice distillate, and aguardiente, a similar
Latin American spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of experimentation now, a lot of interest in
new alcohols,'' said Fernando Saralegui, the owner of L-Ray in
Greenwich Village, which specializes in drinks made famous in Cuba
and New Orleans, like mojitos and hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's cocktails have an upbeat exuberance, a technicolor
dazzle that sets them apart from the suave, black-and-white-movie
glamour of the previous cocktail era, the 1930s and 40s, when gin
reigned and the cigarette holder, not the cell phone, was in the
hand not grasping the martini glass. Once vodka came onto the scene
in the late '50s, the classic cocktail succumbed to an assault from
tall, vodka-based drinks or flavorless, colorless vodkas on the
rocks. Vodka is still big, but now, with a host of flavorings, it
inspires ever more new drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, cocktails are mixed to the rhythmic slosh of the
ice-filled metal shaker, not the deafening whir of the blender.
Bartenders are also learning to muddle, using a stick with a
rounded end called a muddler to crush herbs, fruits and peels in
the glass or shaker to release the aromatic essences.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants as diverse as Marion's Continental on the Bowery and
Eleven Madison Park have added cocktail menus to the reading
material that customers must consult before ordering. They list
prices averaging $8, sometimes as much as $12. The mint julep at
Daniel, in its silver tumbler, will set a patron back $10.
</P>
<P>
   While not as lucrative as a cup of tea, many of the drinks are
moneymakers. At Ruby Foo's on the Upper West Side, one-third of all
beverage sales are specialty cocktails, like the Blue Buddha and
the ginger martini.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-'80s you had mostly big frozen drinks or liquor on
the rocks, but for about the past three years, all our restaurants
have had drink menus with special cocktails,'' said Steve Hanson,
whose company, B.R. Guest, owns seven restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson and other restaurateurs said that the cosmopolitan, made
with vodka, sugar syrup, lime and cranberry juice, paved the way
for today's diversity of drinks. Now the martini's stiffest
competition, the cosmopolitan is on the list of 61 martinis at Lot
61, and it is the No. 1 cocktail at downtown spots like Moomba as
well as at the high-end Jean Georges.
</P>
<P>
   And the cosmopolitan is evolving. At Ruby Foo's, where it's
known as the Ruby Foo, it's made with sake, vodka and cranberry and
pineapple juices, and it outsells the traditional cosmopolitan 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Drinks like this are created in most restaurants by managers and
bartenders, often by trial and error. For example, Le Colonial's
managers wanted a ginger drink and finally came up with a ginger
martini made with ginger liqueur and candied ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Many new drinks are being made with cachaca (pronounced
cah-CHAH-sa), which may be the vodka of the next millennium. It is
also clear but a little rougher tasting than vodka, yet it provides
a clean slate for the concoction of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Cachaca is essential in the caipirinha, a Brazilian drink made
with sugar syrup and lime, which has taken New York by storm and is
served not just in churrascerias or pan-Latin places like Calle
Ocho and Bolivar, but even in bastions of tradition like the ``21''
Club.
</P>
<P>
   At Blackbird, the caipirinha is open to interpretation. DeGroff
muddles fresh sour cherries, now in season, with lime for a cherry
caipirinha. At Viva Brasil on the Upper West Side, the drink is
interpreted with the fruit of the day, like mango or peach.
</P>
<P>
   But such drinks are not syrupy cousins to the old pina colada
and strawberry margarita. And in their own sly way, they also taste
more sophisticated than the cloying drinks that characterized
places like Trader Vic's, extravaganzas sprouting paper parasols,
skewers of fruit and sometimes flames.
</P>
<P>
   At Ruby Foo's, the Emerald Dragon, made of Midori, orange vodka,
blue Curacao and pineapple juice, looks garish and carnival green
but tastes tangy and delicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinks are becoming less sweet,'' said Clark Wolf, a
restaurant consultant. ``There is a lot of fruit and rum, but the
drinks are drier, balanced with a sour note. The 20- and
30-year-olds are really into these cocktails, and the 40-to-'60s
crowd are rediscovering them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Klein, the director of Authentic Bartending School in New
York, said that for the last two years, the program, which includes
a 48-hour training course and job placement, has been busier.
``More places are opening,'' he said. ``And the drinks are becoming
more complicated. We update our course every year with trendier
drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the going-out-and-drinking trend, especially among
people in their mid-to-late '20s, the Zagat Survey is publishing a
New York night life guide. Due out in the fall, it will list about
1,000 places.
</P>
<P>
   But the taste for cocktails is not limited to bars and
restaurants. Tiffany &AMP; Co.'s bridal registry has more couples than
ever listing bar paraphernalia, especially martini glasses and
cocktail shakers, but also ice buckets, tongs and swizzlers.
Elisabeth Ames, the vice president for retail sales, says Tiffany's
has reintroduced a 1930s silver cocktail shaker set with
moonstones.
</P>
<P>
   ``As never before, what the drink is in is as important as
what's in it,'' Wolf said. For instance, silver julep cups, which
hold flowers on the table in some restaurants, are used at Daniel
for classic mint juleps. But who orders mint juleps at Daniel when
the menu offers Champagne with crushed strawberries? ``People see
it on the list and they're intrigued,'' said Michael Lawrence, the
assistant manager.
</P>
<P>
   While new drinks are making inroads everywhere, nostalgia is
also coming on strong in this cocktail revival. At Marion's
Continental, a restauant and bar on the Bowery, the next four weeks
will be devoted to crazy Polynesian-style concoctions served in
coconut shells and oversize glasses as the restaurant becomes a
palm and bamboo fantasy Kahiki Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are drinkers like Adam Rodriguez, 37, an
insurance executive, who was ignoring the Floridians, mojitos and
mambo kings around him at Asia de Cuba the other night. He ordered
classic Manhattans for his friends from Arizona. And for himself,
his favorite: rye and ginger ale.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cocktails and drinks, anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some cocktail recipes call for ingredients that home bartenders
may not have on hand, or may be reluctant to use. Here are some
basic ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Sugar syrup: Simmer 1 cup sugar in 1 cup water for 2 to 3
minutes, until sugar dissolves. Cool and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Sour mix: A commercial product. For a substitute, mix four parts
lemon juice to one part confectioners' sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Egg whites: Powdered egg whites, dissolved in water according to
package directions, can replace raw egg whites in drinks like pisco
sours.

PRIVACY EXPERTS CALL ON CONGRESS TO PROTECT CONSUMER INFORMATION

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Consumers should be given the right to stop banks
from releasing private information such as what they buy or how
much they earn to outside financial and marketing firms, business
and privacy experts told Congress Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers and the Internet are making it easier and easier for
companies to track almost everything that we as consumers do and to
store that information forever,'' Mary Culnan, a business professor
at Georgetown University, told a House subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   She said Congress should require banks to notify customers that
they are considering releasing their private financial data to
outside firms and then give the customers the option of blocking
them from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to have control of their private information,''
she told the House Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
Subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Litan, director of economic studies at the Brooking
Institution, a Washington think tank, said consumers are tired of
banks selling their private information to marketing companies that
use the data for direct mailings and telemarketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bank needs to pass along information for business
purposes, that's one thing,'' he said. ``But when they sell your
private information to some company that has nothing to do with
banking or servicing your account, that's something Congress should
take a look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Clayton, senior privacy analyst for Stone Investments, a
technology investment firm in Dallas, Texas, said growing consumer
concerns over privacy threaten to slow the growth of commerce on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are still not comfortable giving out personal and
financial information on the Internet, and that could pose a real
problem for companies such as banks that would like to increase
their online operations,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Chairwoman Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said the
``quickening pace of technology'' has left many people, including
herself, questioning how access to their private information has
been obtained and how it is being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be able to trust that our financial, medical and other
personal information is being used in the right way,'' Roukema
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House passed a measure that would give people
the right to block banks and other financial companies from sharing
their personal data with outside firms.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was attached to sweeping legislation that would
allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge. The
Senate passed similar merger legislation in May, but its version
contained no privacy-protection provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills must be blended into one by House and Senate
negotiators before legislation can be sent to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer activists have maintained that the financial overhaul
legislation would create serious privacy risks for people because
banks, brokerages and insurers have compiled profiles of customers'
buying habits, hobbies and health information. Critics see the
potential sharing of these profiles as a particular threat to
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to convince our friends in the Senate that privacy
protection must be a part of this legislation,'' Roukema said.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers agree that a consumer's private information should be
kept confidential. But they argue that to do their job, banks need
to release certain account information.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barsness, president of Prior Lake (Minn.) State Bank,
testified that his bank relies on ``dozens'' of outside firms to
handle many of its functions including data processing, check
clearing and processing, check printing, credit card processing and
ATM processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to get a customer's approval for each of these
operations, that customer would be getting a stack of letters every
day,'' he said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Barton, senior vice president for congressional
relations for the Direct Marketing Association, an international
group representing 4,500 marketing firms, told lawmakers that
despite some annoying phone calls, consumers usually benefit from
the information-gathering done by companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more information we have, the more able we are to pinpoint
the kinds of products a consumer wants and doesn't want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton added: ``Actually, the last thing any marketing firm
wants to do is bother somebody who doesn't want that product, and
information helps us avoid targeting the wrong people.''

FBI LOOKS FOR COINS LINKED TO ATHEIST FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In a weird twist in the case of missing atheist
figure Madalyn Murray O'Hair, a gang of burglars apparently ended
up with most of the $500,000 in gold coins that vanished along with
O'Hair and her two adult children in late 1995, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out breaking into storage warehouses, which was
their livelihood, and they just happened to hit the right one at
the right time,'' Roderick Beverly, the FBI agent-in-charge of the
San Antonio office, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Beverly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As best we can tell, these people did not keep records, and
they have very little to show for the pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly said the thieves apparently made the score of a lifetime
in late 1995 when they found a heavy suitcase during a break-in at
the Burnet Road Self-Storage in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   It contained an estimated $420,000 in Krugerrands, Canadian
Maple Leaf and American Eagle coins, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, in spending the windfall, the San Antonio thieves
eventually caught the attention of federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about three primary suspects in the theft, and another
8 or 10 who were involved in the aftermath. But based on their
cooperation and candid comments to us, none have been charged,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly declined to say who put the coins in the storage locker,
an never mentioned O'Hair at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was called to encourage anyone with
knowledge of unusual activity involving gold coins to contact the
FBI, the Austin Police Department, the San Antonio Police
Department or the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Details in an FBI news release as well as information in other
court documents make it clear that these were the coins purchased
in San Antonio in September 1995 by O'Hair's son, Jon Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, O'Hair and her daughter Robin Murray O'Hair disappeared
shortly after the coin purchase. They are presumed to be dead,
although their bodies have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   In May, three men were named in a federal affidavit as the
abductors and killers of the family. Two of them, David Waters and
Gary Karr, are behind bars on weapons charges. Waters has pleaded
guilty, and Karr is awaiting trial in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The third man, Danny Fry, was killed and his head and hands cut
off, allegedly by Waters and Karr, shortly after the O'Hair family
members vanished.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, has been charged with any crimes relating to
the O'Hair or Fry cases.
</P>
<P>
   Madalyn Murray O'Hair gained prominence more than 30 years ago
for her brash legal battles to remove religion from schools and
went on to lead an atheist organization that had followers around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal affidavit, a confidential source described
renting unit No. 1640 for Waters at the Burnet Road Self-Storage in
late September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The source quoted Waters as saying he was going to ``put a
briefcase with a half-million in gold coins inside the storage
unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Three or four days later, Waters reported someone had broken
into the unit and taken the coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said something to the effect of, `Oh, well! It's gone,'''
said the source.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents said they have recovered only one coin from the
$420,000, and approximately $80,000 remains unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly said there are no apparent links between the burglars
and the various figures in the O'Hair case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe they discovered the coins by accident. The only
affiliation we have found is among themselves,'' he said.

 &HT;    REPORT SAYS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE VICTIMS OF ``DRUG
SWITCHING''
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In many cases, Medicare beneficiaries show up at a
pharmacy only to find that their prescription is no longer covered
by their health maintenance organization. Instead, they're given a
lower-cost generic drug that could be harmful to their health, a
congressional report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, found that 15 of the 16 Medicare HMOs examined
including seven in South Florida made changes to their list of
covered drugs. In one-fourth of the cases, HMOs did not notify
beneficiaries about the alterations, GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs were not identified in the report to the Senate Special
Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that three-fourths of the HMOs require the
substitution of lower-cost generic drugs when available. Seven of
the HMOs allowed patients to pay a higher copayment for brand-name
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members agreed there should be adequate information
available to seniors about how their HMO covers prescription drugs
and they should be notified before a change is made. They
emphasized the need for more accurate information on ``drug
switching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Older Americans should know what they're getting with managed
care plans,'' said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the committee's
chairman. ``It's like buying a car. Before you buy, you expect to
know all of your options. If prescription drug coverage is part of
a benefit package, seniors should know the extent of that coverage
before they sign on the dotted line.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said that there is potential harm to beneficiaries when
they are switched ``to other drugs, which may have different side
effects or clinical outcomes'' and which may react differently when
combined with other prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., warned that abuses by HMOs, such as
``drug switching,'' will make it difficult for Congress to allow
the managed care industry to regulate itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have in our country the situation where seniors sign up
believing that they're going to get specific pharmaceuticals, and
then they show up at the pharmacy and can't get it, that is going
to undermine our efforts to reinvent Medicare,'' Wyden said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Helms, a spokesperson for Citizens for the Right to
Know, a patient advocacy group, said that most patients cannot make
an informed choice when their drug is changed. She said it should
be as easy as reading the ingredient labels on food products.

HUGH FISH, 76, WHO HELPED CLEAN UP LONDON'S RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hugh Fish, a British environmental engineer whose love of
pristine rivers led to the Thames being cleaned up _ enough for
salmon to thrive there after 150 years _ died on May 26 in
Wallingford, Oxfordshire. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Working for the Thames Conservancy and the fledgling Thames
Water Authority in the 1970s and '80s, Fish played a central role
in restoring the river's quality. Its toxic putridity had not
merely killed all fish life but was eating away at boat hulls by
the time real pollution controls were first applied in the
mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Government pressure on industry and local authorities made the
river fit just for eels around the mid-'60s. Fish, who had worked
as a chemist for various river boards, was named chief purification
officer of the Conservancy in 1969 and director of scientific
services when that body became the Water Authority in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless campaign he led brought back some 80 species of
fish. But he was determined to make the water pure enough for
salmon, which had not been seen there for 150 years. A harbinger
came in 1974 when a single live salmon turned up in the Thames
estuary.
</P>
<P>
   That year the Authority released 5,000 salmon fry into a tiny
tributary stream, hoping that some of them would find their way
back upstream as adults to spawn. Fish forecast the first catch in
the Thames in 1979, but it took until 1985 for the first angler to
hook a salmon in the river and claim the prize of 250 pounds that
the authority had posted.
</P>
<P>
   The 6 pound 12 ounce trophy, duly mounted, signaled success in a
quest to remake the Thames into one of the cleanest metropolitan
rivers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oulton, Yorkshire, Hugh Fish was studying chemistry at
Leeds University when war broke out. He served on destroyer duty
with the Royal Navy, completed his degree at Leeds and took his
first job with a river board in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   He was the chief executive of the Thames River Authority from
1978 to 1984, when he became chairman of Britain's National
Environment Research Council, serving four years. After that he
worked as an independent consultant on environmental management.
</P>
<P>
   He was knighted in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife of 56 years, Nancy Asquith Fish,
a son and a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   A burly man, Fish said he never minded people smiling when they
heard of his work with the water authority. ``At least they never
forget my name,'' he said.

<P>
   MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank _ Enter this king-size bedroom community
for Jerusalem, and the frontier image of the hard-core Jewish
settlement fades fast.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere can be seen the stereotypical mobile homes and makeshift
water tanks staking out hills for Jewish believers. Instead, Burger
King, Ace Hardware and a concrete canyon of apartment towers
dominate the landscape, beacons of a more prosaic lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Benny Kashriel, 47, mayor of this suburban city,
belies the image of the typical religious Zionist settler leader.
</P>
<P>
   He is clean-shaven and wears no skullcap. Although once
militant, he now seems to be more bureaucrat than true believer.
With 25,000 residents and a land area larger than Tel Aviv under
his charge, he is too busy _ too settled _ to wage an ideological
war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kashriel is no anomaly, but the new public face of the
increasingly practical-minded settlement movement. Eight days ago
he was elected chairman of the Yesha Council of Jewish Settlements,
assuming a high-profile post as the top-ranking Jewish civic
activist in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Kashriel is determined to change the settlers' pariah image,
moderate their far-right politics and teach them to redefine
themselves as part of the Israeli mainstream. It is a survival
instinct, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important what we did in the 1970s and the 1980s,
settling this land for ideological reasons,'' he said in an
interview Tuesday. ``Now we are 200,000 people, and we have needs
that should not be sacrificed to a hard ideological line. We have
to be pragmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into office just days after Ehud Barak, the new prime
minister, Kashriel ushered in a new relationship between the
government and the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong member of the conservative Likud Party, he met with
Barak, the Labor Party leader, and emerged with an agreement:
Neither side would surprise the other. The settlers would refrain
from occupying new hilltops and the government would not make any
private decisions to evacuate them.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a mutual dependency. The settlers do not want to move.
And Barak, who brought the settlers' political party into his
coalition, needs both their political and their grass-roots leaders
to support his peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Jewish settlements in the West Bank is one of the
thorniest issues as Israel negotiates a final peace with the
Palestinians, and the settler population has the potential to act
as a destabilizing force.
</P>
<P>
   In Kashriel's view, previous radical activity by the settlers
not only failed to accomplish its goal _ halting the territorial
concessions of land-for-peace agreements like the Oslo accords and
the recent Wye memorandum _ but harmed the settlers' standing in
Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to my predecessors: This is the message of one who does
not wear a yarmulke,'' he said. ``You did what you did, you were
extremist, you lost land and you got Oslo. But that's not all. Now
you are no longer a pioneer. You are a burden on the shoulders of
Israel. It's time to try to win back some sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interim period before a final agreement is reached, the
Palestinians, backed by the United States, see every new Jewish
outpost in the West Bank as a unilateral act of aggression that
compromises the final deal. Barak has said he will not allow new
ones to be built during the interim period but will not dismantle
existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   As a goal, though, Barak favors preserving large blocs of
settlements under Israeli control. That would, although it goes
unsaid, mean relinquishing the many small ones scattered through
the craggy hills.
</P>
<P>
   Kashriel's predecessor, Pinchas Wallerstein, used very strong
language to condemn Barak's plan as ``ethnic cleansing.'' More
tempered, Kashriel says only, ``I don't agree with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we don't expect him to be a settler,'' Kashriel said.
``But our first meeting with him was good. For him, we are part of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven miles from Jerusalem, Maale Adumim has no real fear of
extinction, and some analysts think its mayor has become a
pragmatist because his chief battle has been won.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man who has a status equal to that of the mayors of such
cities as Netanya and Rehovot no longer needs a revolutionary
ideology,'' Meron Benvenisti, an author and former deputy mayor of
Jerusalem, wrote in an Op-Ed column in the newspaper Haaretz last
week. ``His revolution has succeeded.``
</P>
<P>
   Kashriel moved to Maale Adumim about 15 years ago, influenced by
the religious Zionist movement, whose schools he attended as a
youngster. The thousands of families in subsequent waves settled
there primarily because housing was affordable, taxes were low and
the quality of life was, in their eyes, more like that of a small
town.
</P>
<P>
   Many settlers have long enjoyed the financial benefits of living
in frontier towns _ tax breaks and special loans for housing from
the government _ but residents of the established Maale Adumim no
longer get government subsidies, Kashriel said. Two-bedroom
apartments sell for from $140,000 to $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like many settlers, many residents of Maale Adumim, where 27
percent voted for Barak, are resigned to the idea that peace means
territorial concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Kashriel protested outside the prime minister's residence when
Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Likud Party leader, was in Maryland
negotiating the Wye Memorandum last fall. This week he stayed off
the streets when Barak visited Camp David to talk about peace with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now sitting quietly, not protesting,'' Kashriel said.
``We accept reality. To make a Palestinian country _ I'm not happy,
but they are on the way there, thanks to my Likud government.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kashriel said he would organize demonstrations if Israel
withdrew from more land in the West Bank before final status talks
were well under way. That is considered likely; Barak is expected
to undertake at least a modest pullback of Israeli troops in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Kashriel said he would have a hard time controlling
radical settlers if the leftist members of Barak's coalition
antagonized them. He cited a recent decision by Ran Cohen, the new
trade minister, to suspend financing for new factories in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   To Cohen, the move meant freezing the special subsidies that the
settlements have enjoyed at the expense of poor towns in Israel
proper. To Kashriel, however, the decision was simple-minded. He
said that the industrial park in his city is completely integrated,
mixing 1,000 Palestinian and 1,000 Israeli workers; only 100 of the
Israelis are settlers, he said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A huge photograph of Yitzhak Rabin, the late prime minister,
sits at the entrance to Kashriel's office in City Hall. It is a
curious sight, given that in Rabin's final days he was at war with
the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, though, Rabin was Maale Adumim's patron. He
authorized its creation during his first term in office, and during
his second term it was the first settlement to become a city. It
was under his watch that a military commander signed an order to
expand Maale Adumim's land vastly, by another 3,000 acres, mostly
desert.
</P>
<P>
   That order became tangible when Moshe Arens, in his final weeks
as defense minister last spring, authorized an urban construction
plan to link up Maale Adumim with Jerusalem. The plan was seen as a
last-minute land grab by the outgoing administration and drew fury
from the Palestinians and worldwide condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, a U.S. official in Israel suggested that
Kashriel might not be as moderate as he was trying to portray
himself. ``Is he a wolf in grandma's clothing, or really grandma?''
the official said. ``Sometimes you can see his teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kashriel said he thought the Americans should sponsor dialogues
between the Palestinians and the Israelis in the West Bank. He said
that relations were more normal on the ground than in political
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   He said that residents of his city shopped in the neighboring
Arab town of Al Azariya, where they used to be stoned, and that
Palestinian neighbors attended movies at the new theater in Maale
Adumim.
</P>
<P>
   A drive through Al Azariya did not reveal a single settler
shopping, but Saturday is probably the busy day for the secular
settlers, who are the most likely to shop there.
</P>
<P>
   Kashriel also said that some high-level meetings between
settlers and Palestinians were already taking place. He said he
flew to the Greek island of Rhodes to meet with Palestinian
officials eight months ago _ which he said he was acknowledging
publicly for the first time on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone brought statements and we had fights,'' he said.
``Then afterward, over coffee and even a glass of beer, they made
jokes about Arafat and we made jokes about Bibi Netanyahu.'' He was
referring to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and using
Netanyahu's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extreme right-wing settlers are the ones who are all the
time in the media, disrespecting the law,'' he continued. ``But
they are not representative. I was elected; I am representative.''

   KISII, Kenya _ Ward 6 in the hospital here could not be much
more crowded: Bethsheba Bosibori, 52, lay in bed with a woman she
did not know, with another sitting at her feet and a third coughing
on a mat on the floor. In all, 113 women were packed into a room
with 23 beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are small, there can be three'' in a bed, said Sister
Elizabeth Maranga, a nurse. ``Big bodies _ only two.''
</P>
<P>
   Kisii, a small city in western Kenya, is the center of a serious
outbreak of malaria, one of the worst in recent years, and all the
more worrisome to experts because malaria has not usually been a
widespread problem here. At an altitude of nearly 6,000 feet, Kisii
had been considered too high for the mosquitoes that harbor the
parasites that spread the sickness to live very long.
</P>
<P>
   But since May, more than 300 people have died of malaria in this
regional hospital alone, among some 18,000 cases the staff has
seen. Several hundred more _ no one is sure how many _ have died
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One million people die in Africa each year from malaria, the
second biggest killer on the continent, after AIDS, according to
the United Nations. The problems in Kisii underscore how the
disease is changing and spreading on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons not fully understood, doctors say, the disease seems
to be moving to higher altitudes and to other places where
transmission has been low. Resistance to various drugs used for
treating the disease, particularly chloroquine, is also rising
steeply.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual rain patterns since the El Nino storms last year also
seem to be driving the numbers upward. In Kisii it rarely rains
this time of year, but on a recent day, it poured down, draining
into pools of water that stagnate and breed the mosquitoes that
carry the malaria parasite.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think it will disappear, then it rains again,'' said
Dr. Wycliffe Mogoa, a pediatrician and the medical superintendent
at Kisii District Hospital. ``There will be more stagnant water,
the mosquitoes will hatch and there will be problems again.''
</P>
<P>
   The rains have been so irregular that the outbreak has stretched
out for longer than three months. Last year, the worst year in
memory for malaria in Kenya because of the El Nino rains, the
outbreak here lasted only a month and a half, Mogoa said.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak has been especially hard on children and on women
weakened from recent childbirth. But no one is immune. On a recent
day, on a hill in a village near here, Machoge Akunga, a farmer
about 50 years old, lay dead under a gray blanket on a straw mat,
his wife and sister waiting next to the body inside their hut. He
had 11 children.
</P>
<P>
   His family said he came down with a headache, fever and
dizziness, and his joints became sore, all symptoms of malaria. But
they did not take him to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem serious,'' said his niece, Kemunto, 26. Three
days later, at noon, he died.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say both lack of information about malaria and poverty
help it spread, and both problems were evident at Akunga's hut. His
cousin, Samuel Kebwarwo, also has malaria but said he was turned
away from a hospital because he could not afford treatment, which
costs a little more than $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd of perhaps two dozen people there, no one could say
exactly how malaria was spread or how to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have experience,'' Akunga's niece said to visitors,
``maybe you can explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases of malaria in the highlands of western Kenya have been
rising slowly over the last five years, including in Kisii, and it
remains a mystery exactly why, said Col. Ronald Rosenberg,
commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research Unit, which is studying
malaria in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   One possible theory that appears not to be borne out is global
warming, which would theoretically create better conditions for
mosquitoes, he said. An analysis of 65 years of hospital admissions
in the nearby town of Kericho, at roughly the same altitude as
Kisii, showed that climate was unrelated to the number of malaria
cases reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said he believes drug resistance and unusual rains, at
least in the last two years, are major reasons. He theorized a
third: that public transportation has improved, and people in the
highlands are traveling more often to malaria-infected areas and
returning sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of a sociological explanation that may have some
truth to it,'' he said. ``It's probably not everything but it could
be a contributing factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the disease worse still _ often to the point
where it cannot be treated _ is that people often take only pain
relievers or go to herbalists or even quacks, cheaper than most
real doctors, said Dr. Bart De Porter, field coordinator in Kisii
for the French branch of Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, they don't come to us,'' De Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups have camped themselves in Kisii,
sending in doctors like De Porter as well as drugs and mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the outbreak has become a political issue. Local
politicians have accused President Daniel arap Moi of purposely not
controlling the epidemic as a way of punishing one of his most
formidable challengers, former Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae. He
represents this district in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   To show his concern, Moi toured the hospital here earlier this
month, and it was bursting with patients _ 800 people were here,
when the capacity is only 250. Aid organizations say that the
medical staff at a nearby government health center was beefed up
only briefly, seemingly as a show for his visit.
</P>
<P>
   But Mogoa said the government has responded well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had come to assess a serious epidemic in good
faith,'' he said. ``And instead of local politicians joining him,
they are making noise, and in the end they have never stepped foot
in this hospital, which belongs to them. You can't play politics
with an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Kenya's health officials say they do not have enough
drugs, doctors or transportation to cope with the crisis. In
frustration, they are focusing their hope on better education about
malaria in the future _ which drug companies and some international
health agencies and researchers hope someday will also include a
vaccine and aid groups hope will include greater use of preventive
measures like mosquito nets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, doctors say that July is shaping up to be the worst
month yet this year. On a recent evening, an 8-year-old boy,
Richard Mukuya, lay in a malaria-induced coma, his hand held by his
father, Anthony. Mrs. Bosibori lay in the crowded women's ward and
said many people she knew were infected with malaria, including
several of her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen so many people sick with malaria,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, a hard and steady rain began, the drops pounding
on the ward's tin roof, making it impossible to hear anything else
and dripping into yet more puddles for mosquitoes to breed and
spread sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very bad news,'' De Porter said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Twenty Hindus were killed in three incidents
before dawn on Tuesday in what is feared to be a stepped-up
campaign of hit-and-run tactics by Muslim insurgents in remote
areas of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst attack left 15 dead in Lihota, a village in the
forested Himalayan foothills of Doda District 90 miles northeast of
the Kashmiri winter capital of Jammu.
</P>
<P>
   Five of those killed were members of a village defense committee
that was armed, the police said. The authorities have set up dozens
of such militia groups to prevent raids in vulnerable areas, but
the brigades may themselves now be targets. The other 10 victims,
including eight women, were believed to be committee members'
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   India has been bracing for a violent backlash by militants after
two months of furious fighting along the northern frontier of
Kashmir between Indian armed forces and hundreds of infiltrators
who had built bunkers in mountaintop positions above a strategic
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Those infiltrators, which India believes to be a combination of
Pakistani army regulars and Muslim guerrillas, have been defeated,
although sporadic fighting continues.
</P>
<P>
   That ``humiliation'' is now driving the Pakistani-backed
fighters to mount new attacks, said the chief minister of Jammu and
Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah. The killings in Lihota ``demonstrate the
level of frustration among militant ranks and expose their sinister
designs to curb peace and tranquillity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the two other incidents, heavily armed guerrillas attacked a
labor camp in Poonch District and killed four men, the police said.
An Indian soldier also died in a rocket attack on an army post in
Poonch.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, an Indian news agency reported that government
forces in Poonch had retaliated against the militants, killing
five. That could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Violence again seems to be increasing in Kashmir, where, by
conservative estimates, 24,000 people _ half civilians _ have died
in a decadelong insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in Lihota represent the fourth mass killing in three
weeks. On July 1, nine Hindus, including a 100-year-old and his
90-year-old wife, were killed in the village of Ari. Two days
before, 15 Hindu laborers were killed in the village of Sandhu. The
police said Muslim militants were responsible in the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, however, 15 Muslims were killed in Poonch. The
police said those deaths were a result of infighting among militant
factions.
</P>
<P>
   Several militant groups operate in Kashmir. They do not always
agree on religious beliefs or military tactics, and there are
rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   According to Indian authorities, a majority of the insurgents
are no longer native to Kashmir. They are said to come from
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt and other Islamic nations.
The fight for Kashmir, in dispute by overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan
and predominantly Hindu India for 52 years, is viewed as a jihad by
the so-called mujahadeen, or holy warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The militants and Indian authorities have repeatedly been
accused of human rights violations. Scores of well-documented cases
are in the record.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch has in the last week issued a report that
criticizes both sides, but especially focuses on the Indian army.
The rights group accuses the army of continued abuses, summary
executions of suspects, indiscriminate shootings, rapes and arsons.
The report notes that the army has consolidated its control over
the Kashmir Valley and says the ``brutal tactics'' used there in
the early 1990s were being instituted in areas like Poonch and
Doda, where the militants operate with more frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggravating the situation, the army has recruited
ex-servicemen, who for historical reasons are almost exclusively
Hindu, to serve in village defense committees that assist the army
in military operations,'' the report said. ``In Doda and the border
districts, where the population is nearly evenly divided between
Hindus and Muslims, there is a growing concern that tensions
between the two communities might ignite a wider communal
conflict.''

ESCARTIN MAKES MOVE: HE'S SECOND AFTER WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIAU-ENGALY, France _ The Spaniards had a premonition Tuesday.
The Tour de France stage traveled through southern France, dipping
into Spain and finishing just miles from its border. So the
Spaniards dragged out their giant yellow and red flags and flocked
to the course, looking for an inspring countryman to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The premonition came true.
</P>
<P>
   Fernardo Escartin pedaled past thousands of cheering and
flag-waving fans up to the ski resort here, and he not only won the
race but shook up the standings. Escartin, who had been fifth
overall, moved up to second with his time of 5 hours 19 minutes 49
seconds, thanks to the demise of Abraham Olano. The fellow Spaniard
finished seven minutes back and dropped to eighth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Another crowd favorite, Frenchman Richard Virenque, also inched
up the standings to fifth overall after his third-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that made any difference to American Lance
Armstrong, whose overall lead slipped only slightly. He has a 6:19
advantage over Escartin with five days of racing to go.
</P>
<P>
   Drug rumors continued to haunt Armstrong, though, as it was
reported in Le Monde that small traces of certain anti-inflammatory
drugs had showed up in Armstrong's urine after the prologue.
Corticosteroids are banned except when used for legitimate medical
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But when Armstrong was asked about it after the race, he
continued to deny any drug use. It should be noted that as the
wearer of the yellow jersey, Armstrong is tested for drugs every
day. If found positive, he would be disqualified immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong stayed out in front of the pack for virtually the
entire 108-mile race, as the man in the yellow jersey was
surrounded by Postal Service teammates Frankie Andreu, Tyler
Hamilton, and Kevin Livingston. But over the course of the
sweltering, up-and-down race in the Pyrenees, the others lost steam
one by one. By the penultimate climb, Armstrong's teammates were
nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on your own, it's best to attack and hope someone
goes with you,'' said Postal Service team director Johann Bruyneel.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss rider Alex Zulle, hoping to preserve his third place in
the standings and a spot on the podium, did. But Escartin got an
even better jump and rode solo up the final climb to finish 2:01
ahead of Virenque and Zulle and 2:10 in front of Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Escartin, 31, has ridden seven Tours on three different teams
but has never won a stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I crossed the line, I thought of all the times I just
missed a big victory,'' he said. ``I was scared the guys behind me
might catch me, so I just put my head down and went all out.''
</P>
<P>
   The first American to finish after Armstrong was Hamilton, in
14th place. He's now 19th overall, 23 minutes behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Greg LeMond, the only other American to ever win the Tour, was
watching the race Tuesday not on a bike but from the comfort of a
car with a French TV crew. LeMond has been in France for the past
week, cycling some of the Tour courses with a tour group out of
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time Tour winner, who retired in 1994, has a touch of
gray in his hair and is a little heavier than he was five years
ago, but he still attracts almost as much attention as when he wore
the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   When he stops in a town for the start, he's surrounded by
cameras and affably chats with anyone _ in fluent French, of
course. And he acknowledges that even though his tour group wasn't
allowed to ride all the way up Alpe d'Huez, since cyclists are
banned from the last 3 miles of the mountain course, he probably
could have talked his way past the gendarmes if he had told them
who he was.
</P>
<P>
   But LeMond didn't, and he had to just sit and watch the race
that he once dominated. He said he's not really jealous but is ``a
little envious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like watching it but at the same time have bittersweet
memories,'' he said. ``I still want to be doing that.''
</P>
<P>

knows he can't. ``You realize that part of your life goes by
awfully fast,'' he said. ``When you're young, you don't see that.''

PLAYWRIGHT HAS THE `ATTITUDE' FOR A MUSICAL
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: diannetucker is cq) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Who said that somber subjects can't be
turned into a musical?
</P>
<P>
   That person hasn't seen a whole slew of musicals on Broadway
recently, from ``Parade'' to ``Side Show.'' And wait until they get
a load of what Dallas playwright diannetucker has cooked up, with
the help of Joe Rogers, for Fort Worth's Jubilee Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The show's title, ``Attitude, Girlfriend, Attitude,'' hints that
it's a musical full of sass and ``go-on-girl!'' snaps. And it is.
</P>
<P>
   But the premise is one not many people would find humor in. And
the only reason diannetucker saw the sunny side is that it really
happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago, I got a call to come to Parkland
Hospital,'' she says. ``A friend of mine had been in a car accident
and hit her head on the windshield. She had a slight case of
amnesia. She was not living in Dallas anymore, so I was surprised
when I got a call from Parkland.''
</P>
<P>
   The story follows the experience to a T. The victim's three
``best friends'' show up and find that not only is she in town
without telling them, but she is with a man who is not her husband.
To make matters worse, that man has a wife who shows up to check on
his less-severe condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people wouldn't have found this funny,'' the playwright
says. ``And it wasn't, but the way (the hospitalized friend)
responded to us was highly comedic.''
</P>
<P>
   Diannetucker is in the middle of an oral five-year contract with
Jubilee. In the past three years, the company has premiered her
plays, ``Hershey With Almonds,'' ``Daddy's Maybe'' and ``Madam
Queen,'' in that order. All are dramas with nice comic touches
thrown in. Like ``Attitude,'' all center on strong female
characters, the hallmark of diannetucker's work. ``Hershey'' is
about a woman who compares men with chocolate, ``Daddy's'' focuses
on a single mother, and ``Madam'' was based on a true story about a
wealthy black woman in the early 20th century who controlled the
lives of everyone around her, including the men.
</P>
<P>
   When Jubilee executive director Rudy Eastman asked diannetucker
if she had a musical in mind, she responded, ``I've always wanted
to write something about this experience I had in a hospital one
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastman hooked her up with frequent Jubilee collaborator and
musician Rogers, whom she had met a few months before, and they put
the idea in motion. ``I have so much admiration for Joe Rogers,''
she says. ``And we worked remotely so well. I could e-mail him
ideas and suggestions and I had so much trust and confidence. I had
no questions with his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a hilarious and touching musical about the power
of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Diannetucker has used her unusually spelled name for 25 years,
since she pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha at then North Texas State
University. (The members were required to sign their names with
lowercase letters, and she found it easier to write it as one
word.) But she has been doing theater her whole life.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Marshall, Texas, where she would put on plays on
her grandmother's front porch. ``On Saturday mornings, all the
neighborhood women would gather and I'd put on a show. And they'd
give me a quarter or something for my effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, she started the Dallas Drama Company, mainly as a forum
to get her own plays produced. ``I thought, I'll do this and
instantly I'll be famous,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The company folded 10 years later, but she didn't fade from the
scene. She has worked with other organizations, such as the Irving
Arts Council, but is best known for her association with Jubilee.
Many of her shows there received extended runs.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not writing, she's leading ``whole-brain thinking''
seminars and workshops on leadership skills, diversity and
creativity. For research in writing, she attends every local
theater production, from equity houses to community theater. ``For
me, it's like a doctoral program, getting exposed to all this
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   For future projects, she's working on a piece called ``Dear
Crooner'' and has long harbored a fantasy for writing something
about Solomon and Sheba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of ideas all the time. Someone might be talking, and
I'm thinking of something else. I have to race for a pencil. You
can't control the muse.''

RECORD NUMBER OF VIEWERS WATCHED KENNEDY COVERAGE

<P>
   Even with competitive coverage from the major broadcast
networks, the John F. Kennedy Jr. tragedy provided a huge
viewership spike _ and some record audiences _ for the cable news
channels last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Garnering an average 1.2 rating (600,000 households) on Saturday
and a 1.5 rating on Sunday (767,000 households), the Kennedy story
provided MSNBC with its two highest viewership days, edging out the
death of Princess Diana and the Littleton High School shootings,
according to ratings released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Third-ranked Fox News Channel earned a 1.2 rating (504,000
households) on Sunday, topping its previous 24-hour high on April
20, 1999 when the Littleton massacre brought the outlet a .9 rating
(361,000 households).
</P>
<P>
   And CNN racked up a 1.9 rating (1.42 million households) on
Saturday and a 2.5 rating (1.91 million households) on Sunday.
While Sunday's numbers fell far short of CNN's busiest day _ at the
outset of the 1991 Gulf War _ they edged out the highest ratings
(2.3 and 1.6 million households) for Princess Di coverage.

CHINA DETAINS 70 LEADERS OF BUDDHIST LAW MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In what could be the start of a broad crackdown,
dozens of leaders of the Buddhist Law movement were detained by the
police on Tuesday in 14 Chinese cities, according to a Hong
Kong-based human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   At least 70 leaders of the group, which stunned authorities last
April when 10,000 adherents silently materialized in a protest
outside the communist leadership's compound here, were picked up in
the police sweep that began on Monday night, the Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. Arrests were
reported in Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian and 11 other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong organization said that the police searched the
homes of the detainees, confiscating books about the rapidly
growing movement and addresses of people who attended meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The group, widely known by the name Falun Gong, combines
traditional Chinese breathing and meditation exercises with
Buddhism, Taoism and the beliefs of its founder, Li Hongzhi, who
lives in self-imposed exile in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has posed a ticklish problem for Chinese authorities
ever since the demonstration on April 25. The group was protesting
local officials' treatment of its members and demanding official
recognition, which has not been granted.
</P>
<P>
   The government normally keeps a tight leash on mass
organizations. And Falun Gong, whose members are devoted to its
mixture of martial arts and mysticism, could be a potent force in a
country that faces dislocating social and economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a crackdown against the group have circulated widely
in recent weeks, despite assurances by Chinese officials that it
would be left alone. In a meeting with Falun Gong members last
month, a senior government official warned the group not to
``promote superstition'' or ``destroy social order.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing appears to have been laying the groundwork for a
crackdown for some time. Over the last two weeks, state-controlled
newspapers and television have carried a steady stream of
commentaries about the dangers of superstitious beliefs,
particularly among Communist Party members.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page commentary on Monday _ its fifth on the topic
since the April demonstration _ the Communist Party newspaper,
People's Daily, blamed lax officials for the rampant spread of
superstitious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and television reports have also begun celebrating
people who they say overcame ``feudal superstition'' _ for example,
a rural village where the residents gave up rituals like hanging
mirrors over doors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official news media did not report this week's
detentions, officials in Beijing seemed well aware of the possible
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   At Zhongnanhai, the sprawling walled compound where President
Jiang Zemin and other leaders live, a huge police contingent
patrolled the streets on Tuesday night. The western edge of the
compound, where the Falun Gong members massed in April, was closed
to motor traffic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fears of harassment prompted Li, the founder and leader of Falun
Gong, to move to the United States last year. On June 2, he said in
a letter posted on the Internet that his followers were being
treated unjustly. He also suggested that China was negotiating to
have him extradited, in return for a $500-million reduction in
China's trade surplus with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were no signs of protest in Beijing, in Hong Kong
on Tuesday afternoon about 150 people marched to the local branch
of the official New China News Agency. There they delivered a
letter appealing to the Chinese government to release the detained
Falun Gong leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to express our shock and concern on this matter,''
said Sophie Xiao, a spokeswoman for the group in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xiao said she spoke on Tuesday with Falun Gong members in
Beijing who were worried that the government might declare the
group illegal. While not officially recognized, Falun Gong has
existed in a kind of grey area, as the government has tried to
avoid a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to threaten anybody,'' Ms. Xiao said.
``People who don't understand us may feel threatened because of the
number of people who are doing it and because of how quickly we
have grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from a standing start seven years ago, Falun Gong now
claims 100 million members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Li, 48, a former grain bureau clerk in northeastern China, began
his metamorphosis into a spiritual leader in the late-1980s, when
he discovered the ancient practice of qigong, in which people seek
to channel their vital energies to improve their health and even
heal others.
</P>
<P>
   By combining qigong with Buddhism, Taoism and his own mystical
ideas, Li fashioned an all-embracing philosophy that preaches clean
living. Eschewing politics and even the hint of a religious
identity, followers of Falun Gong work hard to portray themselves
simply as good people.
</P>
<P>
   The detentions, and the heavy police presence in Beijing on
Tuesday night, suggest that the Chinese authorities think
otherwise.

to shore to apply, ultimately, for asylum, but sends those caught

CLINTON HOPES TO DEFUSE TENSIONS BETWEEN CHINA, TAIWAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton dispatched U.S. envoys to Beijing
and Taipei on Tuesday in hopes of defusing tensions between China
and Taiwan. He also voiced concern about the inflammatory rhetoric
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reaffirmed the United States' one-China policy, but he
declined to respond when asked if America would defend Taiwan from
an attack by China.
</P>
<P>
   ``China knows very well what our policy is, and we know quite
well what their policy is,'' Clinton told reporters when asked
about his weekend telephone conversation with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin. ``I made it clear our policy had not changed,
including our view under the Taiwan Relations Act that we would
take very seriously any abridgement of the peaceful dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the administration
would send Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asia
and Pacific, to Beijing and Richard Bush, chairman of the
nongovernmental American Institute in Taiwan, to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui enraged China when he suggested
during a July 9 interview that the island should be treated on a
``state to state'' basis by Beijing. China considers Taiwan one of
its provinces and responded with hints of military reprisal should
Taiwan take any step toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``However one assesses what is going on in terms of statements
being made, I think that the important point here is that the only
way to resolve this is peacefully,'' Albright said. Roth also will
pave the way for Albright's upcoming meeting with her Chinese
counterpart at an Asian foreign ministers meeting in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reported he had a positive conversation with
Jiang when they spoke Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the action of the United States in affirming
our support of the one-China policy and encouraging Taiwan to
support that and the framework within which dialogue has occurred
will be helpful in easing some of the tensions,'' Clinton told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relations with China have ebbed in recent months as federal
agents investigated the possibility Beijing attempted to influence
the 1996 elections and the possibility that Beijing stole critical
nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia,
which Beijing suggested was intentional, prompted a three-day,
rock-throwing melee in front of the United States Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's comments prompted Chinese leaders to renew threats to
reunify Taiwan with China by force. China also made an
unprecedented military disclosure last week when it announced it
had developed the neutron bomb, statements viewed as attempts to
intimidate Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, since the defeated Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan,
the two have coexisted through diplomatic ambiguity. The United
States ended its formal recognition of Taiwan as the true China in
1972 after President Nixon visited mainland China ruled by
Communists. The United States officially recognizes one China _ the
mainland _ and maintains Taiwan has a right to self defense if
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese media Tuesday reported heavily on military exercises and
published a survey indicating the majority of Chinese support
reunification by force.
</P>
<P>
   Lee continued to stand by his statements, adding ``only after we
have democratic reunification shall there be the possibility of one
China.'' Lee maintains Taiwan, which is far more economically
prosperous and democratic, and China cannot begin unification talks
unless they negotiation on a ``state to state'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry countered that Taiwan ``should not
underestimate the determination of the Chinese government to oppose
separation and oppose Taiwan independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Taipei also downplayed the possibility of expanded Chinese war
games in the Taiwan Straits, which separates the mainland from the
island. A similar attempt in 1996 by China to intimidate Taiwan
with military exercises prompted the United States to move several
warships to the area.

   The United States' defensive relationship with Taiwan may be
ambiguous at best and President Clinton offered no clarification
when asked, stating only that the United States views ``very
seriously'' any breach of the Taiwan Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said Clinton placed the
call to Jiang on Sunday ``because he was concerned about some of
the rhetoric ...There's always some concern when you have this
rhetoric, but the president made clear he believes the best way to
resolve any issues between the parties is in the context of the
cross-straits dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the United States believes any issues that need to
be resolved between the two should be done through talks. ``I think
any rising tension in that area is something we do take seriously,
and we do have concern about,'' Lockhart said.

IN AN ABOUT-FACE, MUSHROOM FARM ACCEPTS LABOR UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUINCY, Fla. _ For farm workers in the South, where government
officials and companies often boast about the absence of unions,
what was going on in the bustling lunchroom was nothing short of
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   As 80 workers, mushroom pickers all, downed their tortillas and
sandwiches, the farm's manager and a union president _ the type of
person locals used to run out of town _ bellowed over the din to
praise each other and pledge cooperation rather than continued
combat.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding like a union pitchman, Greg Verhagen, the mushroom
farm's folksy, unpretentious manager, touted the advantages of the
contract that the farm, one of the largest employers in Florida's
panhandle, signed Tuesday with the United Farm Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement makes Quincy Farm's 450 pickers and packers the
only farm workers in Florida to be covered by a union contract, and
the contract is still more unusual because it promises profit
sharing, a rare provision in agriculture, where many workers barely
earn the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the company does well, you will do well,'' said Verhagen,
who is lord of a farm that produces 25 million pounds of white
button mushrooms a year and 500,000 pounds of giant portobellos _
all in the air-conditioned indoors.
</P>
<P>
   It was understandable that a few of the lunching workers were
mystified by Verhagen's professions of partnership, considering
that they follow three years of all-out war between labor and
management.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Quincy fired 84 pickers when they took part in a
lunch-hour demonstration that protested low wages, safety problems
and surly supervisors. Since then, the workers _ 60 percent are
Hispanic and 40 percent black _ have pressed to join the United
Farm Workers and have pushed a boycott of Quincy's mushrooms,
gaining the backing of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People and many local churches.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Quincy responded by denouncing the union as a bunch
of lying outside agitators more concerned about fillinG union
coffers with workers' dues money than about helping the workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Quincy's anti-union stance changed 180 degrees two months
ago when it brought in Verhagen, who managed a unionized mushroom
operation in Canada, where employers do not view unions as a force
of evil the way many U.S. companies do. Not only did Verhagen stop
battling the union but he agreed to recognize it when 68 percent of
the workers signed cards saying they wanted the United Farm Workers
to represent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big change from the mode we were in, entrenched in
battle,'' said Frank Curiel, the farm workers' chief organizer and
rabble rouser in this down-on-its-heels town, 30 miles northwest of
Tallahassee. ``I've been a union organizer for 25 years, and I've
never seen a shift like this. They're talking partnership. They're
going out of the way to accommodate the union, and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   For Arturo Rodriguez, the union's president and the son-in-law
of Cesar Chavez, the union's legendary founder, the new contract is
good news. (Rodriguez, who took the red eye from California to
attend the signing, said he was proud that his father-in-law was
one of the idols of John F. Kennedy Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   The Quincy agreement gives the union one of its few beachheads
outside California and is expected to speed its efforts to expand
in Florida, the No. 2 agricultural state, with 300,000 farm
workers. The contract also gives the union a much-needed boost
after it suffered an embarrassing loss last month when 1,400
strawberry pickers at Coastal Berry in California voted to reject
the UFW and join a rival union more sympathetic to management.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the Quincy unionization victory was also
noteworthy because it was brought about by Hispanics and blacks
working together, overcoming the frequent tensions between them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important aspect of Tuesday's agreement is its
signals that the union is embarking on a more cooperative approach
toward management _ at least with management willing to take the
union as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he was embracing a more cooperative approach to
demonstrate to growers nationwide that they should not fear or
fight unionization, because it could raise productivity and
profits. But he was quick to add that the union would not eschew
boycotts and other tough tactics against employers who played
hardball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see real value in creating a much less confrontational
relationship, demonstrating that the union and the employees can be
an asset to the business rather than being their enemies,''
Rodriguez said. ``One of the issues the nation is facing is a
tighter labor force. Everyone's looking for quality, productivity
workers, and we think we can assist in making that happen.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Most mushroom workers welcomed the union and the new
partnership. With the emerging thaw in recent months, several
workers said, supervisors have ended the most objectionable
practices, like requiring workers to sign in and sign out when they
went to the bathroom and reprimanding those who went too often.
</P>
<P>
   These workers said supervisors have become more attentive about
safety complaints. At Quincy, mushrooms are grown on 10-foot by
6-foot beds that have wooden sides. Sometimes stacked five or six
atop each other, these beds may climb 12 feet, and workers say they
sometimes take bad falls because the wooden sides they climb on to
pick mushrooms are often slippery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were bad conditions,'' said Francisco Lopez, a
31-year-old immigrant from Mexico who was fired after participating
in the 1996 rally. ``It was too wet, too slippery. The supervisors
put too much pressure on us, always telling you to work harder. The
union will make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-month contract will pay off immediately for many workers.
Beginning packers will get a raise increasing their pay to $5.75 an
hour from $5.25, just 10 cents above the minimum wage. The pickers,
who are paid piece rates, do not get a raise, but they hope profit
sharing will add appreciably to their average of $9 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez suggested that the company made peace with the union
because the boycott was cutting into sales. But Verhagen insisted
that the boycott hardly affected sales, acknowledging, however,
that it hurt the company's image. ``That's the last thing companies
want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple why the company decided to work cooperatively
with the employees and the union,'' Verhagen said. ``It's time to
get on with building the future and growing the future. The union
presented itself as the new light for organized labor in that it
wants to work in partnership for profit with companies like
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As a first step toward cooperation, Quincy will organize focus
groups in which workers articulate not just their complaints but
their insights for improving quality and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if the workers felt they had no stake in the
company, they might be careless in harvesting mushrooms, explaining
that such carelessness hurt the quality and quantity of subsequent
crops of mushrooms. He said he was confident that improved quality
and productivity would offset the increased labor costs resulting
from the union contract.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Stark, who earns $6.85 an hour after working for eight
years, said Quincy accepted the union because its managers saw that
sour labor relations were sabotaging productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supervisors saw that if you don't treat the workers right,
we're not going to do all the production they want,'' she said.

THE WB FACES QUESTIONS ABOUT LACK OF MINORITY SHOWS, ACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ The issue of diversity on television took
center stage again Tuesday as the top executives of the WB network
faced sharp questions about the lack of minority characters in the
network's fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Of two dozen stars and producers who took part in morning
interview sessions to discuss three new fall shows on the WB, none
were African-American or Asian-American (one, an actress in a minor
role, is Hispanic). The afternoon sessions, in which another three
new shows were presented, were likewise dominated by white actors
and producers.
</P>
<P>
   The WB, known for its teen-oriented fare, was not a target of a
recent broadside by the NAACP. The civil rights organization
threatened a boycott and legal action against NBC, CBS, ABC, and
Fox to protest the fact that no minorities are in starring roles in
the 26 new shows, which NAACP president Kweisi Mfume called a
``virtual whitewash.'' But as it became apparent that the WB is
also vulnerable to a similar charge, executives of the network _
which has been riding high with critically acclaimed shows _ were
thrown on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Kellner, chief executive officer of the WB, pointed to its
sitcoms with black themes, including ``The Steve Harvey Show'' and
``The Jamie Foxx Show'' in arguing that ``our track record thus far
is a good one.'' He also noted that the network is developing a new
comedy series to star black standup comic Nick Cannon, which will
be produced by Will Smith. However, that show is not expected to
air until the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even the producers of the new WB shows, mindful that the NAACP
criticism has intensified the focus on TV diversity, scrambled to
point to minority supporting characters they have cast or plan to
cast. For instance, it was noted that Majandra Delfino of
``Roswell,'' a new drama that has been called a ``teenage
`X-Files,' '' is the child of a Venezualean father and
Cuban-American mother. But Delfino plays a relatively small
supporting role as the best friend of the show's star.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Mayem Singer, creator of a new romantic comedy in an urban
setting titled ``Jack &AMP; Jill,'' said she plans to ``spread it out
ethnically'' by adding a couple of black supporting characters. But
the lead roles in ``Jack &AMP; Jill,'' as with all six new shows
presented Tuesday, will continue to be occupied by white actors.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of diversity on television has created a ``uniform
frustration'' among minority actors in Hollywood, according to
producer Yvette Lee Bowser, who is African-American. ``There's a
very unfortunate reality that we have to deal with this season,''
said Bowser. ``But it was the same last season, and the season
before that. It's not a new issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowser said the solution is to open up more opportunities for
``talented writers of color'' to work on more shows in order to
``kick down a few more doors.'' She suggested that may be easier
now that the NAACP's angry denunciation of the networks has created
a ``heightened sense of responsibility'' among TV executives.
Bowser herself is developing a drama featuring a ``multicultural''
cast that the WB will consider for the fall 2000 series, according
to WB president of entertainment Susanne Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels insisted concerns about diversity are ``something we do
take seriously,'' adding that the network will ``make changes where
it appropriate'' in casting to address those concerns. (Kellner
noted that the WB was in talks with Smith and Bowser regarding the
proposed shows before the NAACP issued its critique of the
networks.)
</P>
<P>
   On another social issue, Kellner acknowledged that the Columbine
High School massacre has been a wakeup call for television
executives when it comes to violent programs. However, he added,
``I don't think that (TV) is contributing the violence problem that
exists in America today.'' He also said that the WB lost millions
of dollars in advertising revenue by postponing the season finale
of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' due to post-Columbine concerns
about violent scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels announced that Nicholas Turturro of ABC's ``NYPD Blue''
has signed a deal to star in a WB sitcom for the 2000-2001 season.

   SCHWARZ-CONDUCTOR (Undated) _ There was talk, as there always is
when a young American conductor, in this case, Gerard Schwarz,
begins piling up accomplishments of a future at the helm of a major
American orchestra. ``With talent on this order,'' Harold C.
Schonberg wrote in The New York Times in 1980, after a New York
visit by the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, ``there is no place for
him but up.'' Nearly 20 years after that prediction, it is fair to
ask whether Schwarz, now 51, has indeed made his way up in the
music world. But how one answers that question is bound up with
one's view of what constitutes success for a conductor. Schwarz
continues to direct Mostly Mozart at Lincoln Center in Manhattan,
which opens its 33rd season on Tuesday evening. But the festival
has been scaled back in recent years to make way for the Lincoln
Center Festival, and Schwarz has become less of a presence. By

   SINGAPORE-DANCE (Singapore) _ Not many years ago the Singapore
arts scene was largely invisible. Now it is exploding. With a
combination of seduction and subsidies, the Singapore government is
aggressively wooing artists and arts organizations around the world
to make their homes in this affluent city-state. The first annual
Singapore Arts Festival closed its monthlong run in mid-June,
attracting 29 international troupes, more than 200 fringe
performers and a mammoth citywide sculpture exhibition, thanks to
generous government support. By Susan Heller Anderson.

   WALTZ-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Walzen,'' as any bibulous Viennese
will tell you, is ``to twirl.'' The word means more than
``rotate,'' less than ``wanken,'' or downright stagger. Drop the
umlaut, and we have what Johann Strauss the Younger and his father
had Europe doing for a good part of the 19th century. Waltzes had
existed under other names during the century before. Mozart might
call them ``Landler''; Schubert gave waltzes their proper name and
created a body of piano music stunning both for its simplicity and
for its subtlety. Weber, Liszt and Berlioz raised them to the title
of high art. Tchaikovsky and another Strauss, Richard, made a
twirling, almost staggering, three-in-a-bar ballroom dance a form
to set next to the rondo or the passacaglia. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   GOETHE'S-FAUST (Undated) _ Although Schumann's ``Scenes From
Goethe's `Faust,''' has elements of both opera and oratorio, it
fails to fit comfortably into either form. Running two hours and
requiring full orchestra and a large chorus as well as vocal
soloists, it demands much from concert presenters and audiences
alike, and is thus something of a rarity. Although it has been
performed by the American Symphony and the Orchestra of St. Luke's
the last decade, it was last presented by the New York Philharmonic
in 1973 and has not been heard at Carnegie Hall since 1891, when
the third and last part was given. New Yorkers can hear the work
Sunday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, where John Eliot Gardiner and
the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique conclude their
four-night Schumann celebration as part of the Lincoln Center
Festival. By David Mermelstein.

Evans.'' High praise, to be sure. But like most such comparisons,

   INDIA-ART (Washington) _ Major exhibitions of the art of India
are rare in this part of the world. They always have been. Why?
Nobody knows. This art has everything: epic drama and swoony sob
stories, gods, gremlins and glamour queens, the human at its most
human, the spiritual at its most ineffable. Formally, it is pure
seduction. Intellectually and emotionally, it looks you in the eye
and says, over and over again in a thousand different ways: wake
up, change your life, look again, things are not what they seem.
Which are the fundamental messages of great art, sacred or secular,
anywhere. All these elements play a role in ``Devi: The Great
Goddess,'' a gathering of 120 sculptures and paintings at the
Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution through
Sept. 6. By Holland Cotter.

<P>
   Even with competitive coverage from the major broadcast
networks, the John F. Kennedy Jr. tragedy provided a huge
viewership spike _ and some record audiences _ for the cable news
channels last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Garnering an average 1.2 rating (600,000 households) on Saturday
and a 1.5 rating on Sunday (767,000 households), the Kennedy story
provided MSNBC with its two highest viewership days, edging out the
death of Princess Diana and the Littleton High School shootings,
according to ratings released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Third-ranked Fox News Channel earned a 1.2 rating (504,000
households) on Sunday, topping its previous 24-hour high on April
20, 1999 when the Littleton massacre brought the outlet a .9 rating
(361,000 households).
</P>
<P>
   And CNN racked up a 1.9 rating (1.42 million households) on
Saturday and a 2.5 rating (1.91 million households) on Sunday.
While Sunday's numbers fell far short of CNN's busiest day _ at the
outset of the 1991 Gulf War _ they edged out the highest ratings
(2.3 and 1.6 million households) for Princess Di coverage.

 &HT;    CCE shows sharp drop in earnings after recall
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The financial fallout from the recent European recall
of Coca-Cola Enterprises' soft drinks became clearer Tuesday when
the bottler reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Coke system's largest bottler said it earned $33 million, or
8 cents a share, which includes an expected one-time $103 million
charge, or 16 cents a share, to cover the recall's cost.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the charge, CCE said it would have earned 24 cents a
share, 3 cents more than analysts expected. In the year-ago period,
CCE earned $111 million, or 27 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had already cut their estimates on what CCE would earn
in the quarter and in the coming months because of its troubles in
Europe, where two of its plants were linked to contaminated soft
drinks. Restrictions on the bottler's products, which included bans
in several countries, have been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The average estimate among analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment
Research is that CCE will earn 23 cents a share in the third
quarter and 24 cents for the year. In the third quarter last year,
the company earned 21 cents a share, and 28 cents for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is they will be in a good position to show
improved cash flow in the second half,'' said Marty Romm of CS
First Boston. Romm, who rates CCE's shares a ``buy,'' expects CCE
to earn 23 to 25 cents a share in the third quarter and 25 cents a
share for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very encouraged,'' said Prudential Securities Inc.
analyst George Thompson told Bloomberg News. ``The issue is how
quickly volume will come back in Europe, and I think it will be
relatively quickly.'' Thompson has a ``strong buy'' rating on the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Volume in the countries where the products were recalled, mainly
France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, dropped 29 percent
in the second quarter, with a decline of almost 70 percent in June,
the beginning of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But in Great Britain, where no soft drinks were recalled, volume
in the second quarter rose 6 percent, including a 9 percent
increase in the month of June.
</P>
<P>
   In another key measure of performance in the beverage bottling
industry, CCE reported cash operating profit, which excludes
interests, taxes, depreciation and other items, fell 6 percent in
the second quarter to $574 million, compared with $611 million in
the year-ago period. Excluding the charge, however, operating
profit would have been higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the disruption in our business from the product
recall in Europe, we are pleased that we were able to produce 6
percent second-quarter 1999 comparable cash operating profit growth
excluding nonrecurring costs,'' said Henry A. Schimberg, president
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co., which owns 40 percent of CCE, also took a
financial hit because of the European health scare. The world's
largest soft drink company reported recently that its
second-quarter profit fell 21 percent from a year ago. It blamed
about 25 percent of the profit decline on the recall.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, CCE's stock closed unchanged at $29.37 1/2
Tuesday. Coca-Cola Co. shares closed lower with other Dow
industrials, ending the day at $62.93 3/4, down 25 cents.

 &HT;    Beyond silicon: Microchip industry faces big change
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scientists at Lucent Technology's Bell Labs recently
highlighted a seemingly jarring fact: The use of silicon-dioxide
based transistors to make ever smaller microchips, as has been done
for decades, may have to end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon, as it happens, has just about reached its limits in
terms of miniaturization, or how small the chips can be made and
still provide the information needed to make them work.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is more directly concerned with this red flag than James
Meindl, the crew-cut, laid-back Georgia Tech professor who is
directing research by Tech and other universities into the
microchips of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Meindl, who just returned from an assignment as the keynoter for
an international convention on the future of semiconductors, was
ready for the question. The meeting he attended, the International
Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, was held earlier this month
in Santa Clara, Calif. and attracted futurists, scientists and
researchers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Meindl said, there is no basis for great
concern about the limits of silicon because, currently, technology
can improve chips ``by a factor of 10'' over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall outlook is to continue to improve as we have in
past years,'' Meindl said, ``but down the road there are some
formidable problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that, barring a breakthrough in another direction,
the basic material of the transistor may have to switch from
silicon oxides, a naturally occurring material related to sand, to
oxides of tantalum, a more artificial material that behaves
differently and will require different procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would be overstating to say that in the next
50 years we may have a change comparable to the shift from the
steel-based industries of the first half of the 20th century,''
Meindl said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as many plants and manufacturing processes changed because
of the decline in traditional uses of steel, so may the economics
and processes for making semiconductors change in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it costs about $1 billion to set up a plant for
manufacturing microchips under the current technology,'' Meindl
said, ``and we will be working hard to recapture those investments
over the next decades, producing silicon-based chips as efficiently
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new technology of using tantalum oxide as
well as other new ingredients will gradually grow and replace the
old technology. Meindl, a Pittsburgh native, said the trick will be
to manage that changeover more smoothly than we did steel, when
obsolescent plants littered the landscape of metropolitan centers
like Pittsburgh, Cleveland and other former industrial powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, given the huge investments, factories will be
used longer to capture the investments, and innovation will
probably occur less rapidly,'' Meindl said.
</P>
<P>
   Tantalum is not a brand-new ingredient in the technology world,
Meindl said. It is now used to produce memory chips called DRAMS or
dynamic random access memory chips. But its expanded use will
introduce broader changes in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes in chip technology, he said, will include the
substitution of copper for aluminum as a conductor in new chips,
even though copper presents side effects that must be managed.
</P>
<P>
   An allied problem during the period of change will be to protect
the valuable manufacturers of tools used in the production of
chips, said Meindl, and this problem is being addressed through
meetings like the road map conference in Santa Clara, where papers
were presented outlining the details of what will happen in the
next years.
</P>
<P>
   ``By paying attention to the road maps, manufacturers of tools
will be able to prepare for the changing needs and stay
profitable,'' Meindl said.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, however, miniaturization will continue as it
has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   With a twinkle in his eye, Meindl said the next hot development
will likely be whole communicating networks on a single chip,
``networks not unlike wireless phone networks now so heavily
used.''

COMMENTARY: THE DEATH OF A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As I watched the grim, relentless coverage of the
Kennedy-Bessette tragedy over the weekend, I thought of Dr. Irwin
Redlener, who is president of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore
Medical Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   I was reluctant to call him. The worst part of this business is
the way we barge in on people nearly overwhelmed with grief. I've
written about Redlener from time to time, mostly about his stalwart
efforts to bring pediatric services to homeless children. Last
month, when I called to interview him about a column, he told me
that his son Jason, 28, had been killed in a snowboarding accident
in Oregon in March.
</P>
<P>
   I was reluctant to call this week, but I called anyway. The
doctor couldn't have been more gracious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend has been so intense for us,'' he said. ``Watching
this unfold, we can't help but feel connected in a profound way.
Our hearts are sick for the families, for the Kennedys because of
the promise and the tragedy that have been so much a part of their
lives. And then for Carolyn and Lauren's parents. Losing two
children is something that is unfathomable to most people. It
cannot be spoken, the amount of grief that they must feel, and the
amount of sadness that we feel for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Redlener was a remarkable youngster _ smart, sensitive,
good-looking and athletic. He had studied religion and philosophy
in college, had worked as a contractor in New York, and then had
moved with his wife, Sheareen, to Bend, Ore., where they opened a
small business and enthusiastically embraced the area's outdoor
sports and recreation opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was an adventure to Jason,'' said Redlener. ``This
was a kid who, like a certain group of kids in his generation, was
very bold. His approach to life was exuberant. The sports that he
and his wife loved the most were snowboarding and mountain biking,
both of which he participated in to the max.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 27, as the couple was about to wrap up a few hours of
snowboarding, Jason said he wanted to take one more run.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said it was a sparkling, crystal-clear day. The
mountain was covered with fresh powder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no trees or anything there,'' said Redlener. ``He
went up to the top and got into his snowboard and went down. A ski
school class observed him in amazement because it was steep and
difficult and he was very, very talented.''
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that as Jason sped down the mountain his
snowboard caught on something that was not visible in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flipped him,'' said Redlener. ``He then landed very
traumatically flat on his abdomen. It was in such a remote place
that it took the ski patrol a good half-hour to get him and bring
him down to a place where a rescue helicopter could take him to a
hospital, by which time it was too late to do anything about it. He
died of internal hemorrhages.''
</P>
<P>
   Redlener attempted to describe the effect of such a sudden and
profound loss on him, his wife, Karen, and the surviving children,
David, 31, Michael, 23, and Stephanie, 19.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``When someone has a presence that is so large and
looming, as Jason had, and with so much charisma, and then they
disappear in a fateful second, it is impossible to get a grasp on
that level of absence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had experienced the grief as a ``physical pain'' that
lasted for many days. The pain was accompanied by intense
disorientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt unsafe,'' he said. ``I couldn't drive. I felt like it
was dangerous walking across the street because you lose that much
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Redlener and, in a later conversation, his wife both said an
extraordinary outpouring of support from relatives, friends,
colleagues and even strangers had helped carry the family through
its terrible crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a support system that I didn't quite realize existed to
this extent, and it came forward to be with us,'' Redlener said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Everything is changed forever when you have a loss
like this. So you incorporate a sense of appreciation for what you
have. We've literally told our kids to cherish each other and the
times we have together, even as we're dealing with this profound
grief of losing Jason.
</P>
<P>
   ``This causes you to think about the brevity and
unpredictability of life, which is another thing that we've
connected to what the Kennedys and the Bessettes are going
through.''

FORMER PRINCE PICKS UP THE PIECES IN BASEMENT JAM SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some arrived at 6 p.m. to line up for tickets, others
showed up when doors opened at 9; some were told the show started
at 10:30, and others came as late as midnight and even 2 a.m. They
all had to wait until nearly 3:30 Tuesday morning, when the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince came onstage at Life for a small club show
that was first announced earlier that day. His first words: ``Do
you mind if we take a few minutes to tune up?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the concert let out, the sun had come up, and some
fans had spent nearly 12 hours in the low-ceilinged basement of
Life in the West Village. But the music was well worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a band that included the saxophonist Maceo Parker
(from James Brown's and George Clinton's bands) and former Sly and
the Family Stone members, including the bassist Larry Graham, the
Artist (as he likes to be called) led one of the jam sessions that
he has been increasingly fond of holding at small clubs directly
after performing full-scale shows.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, however, he was in town courting the Internet
community, which is holding conferences, conventions, concerts and
awards shows in Manhattan this week.
</P>
<P>
   From the stage, the Artist (who after several years of releasing
records independently has said he will put out his next album,
``Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic,'' on a major label in September)
offered self-styled wisdom about computers, for example: it's OK to
``use the computer, but don't let the computer use you.''
</P>
<P>
   While his arena shows focus on hits and crowd-pleasing stage
moves, he steps out of the spotlight during the small shows,
performing few of his own songs, giving his band members and guests
ample time to solo and often keeping his back to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Like any jam, sometimes the music reaches new heights and other
times it never gets off the ground. Fortunately, the concert
Tuesday morning contained some of the best music the Artist and
friends have done in any of the recent late-night sessions that
this critic has seen.
</P>
<P>
   In a world in which musical styles are strictly subdivided and
categorized, the band insisted on seeing the complete picture,
incorporating pieces of everything from the old blues song
``Motherless Child'' to the new rap song ``Wild Wild West'' into
seamless funk workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Graham played a 10-minute crowd-roaming, feedback-filled bass
solo more inspired than at his own solo shows; Doug E. Fresh and
Kool Moe Dee appeared onstage to rap, beatbox and work the crowd;
Parker stepped up for at least four solos, and the Artist turned
``Alphabet Street'' into a country song.
</P>
<P>
   Much more time was devoted Tuesday morning to songs in the Sly
and the Family Stone catalog than in the Artist's, and Graham did a
lot more performing and playing than the Artist did. But in those
few, precious, savored moments when the Artist (wearing a giant
hoop earring, a grown-out beard and funk hippie garb) stepped
forward, he took control gently but forcefully, reminding fans who
admire him as a performer, songwriter and eccentric that he's also
one of the best guitarists in his field.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing the audience only one bone, the Artist performed
``Purple Rain'' to close the show, introducing it with a long,
soulful speech about love, respect and how Graham had convinced the
Artist _ the performer of such hits as ``Erotic City'' and ``Dirty
Mind'' _ not to swear onstage anymore, despite how much he likes to
use those words as emphasis. He then began a slow version of the
ballad that exploded near the end with a slow, grinding, dripping
wet solo more emphatic than any curse words.

ADVERTISING: BASEBALL TRAVELS IN TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unusual promotional marketing effort co-sponsored
by Major League Baseball and a big corporate advertiser, Century
21, will try turning tradition on its head by turning the clock
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is centered on the first national series of
``Turn Ahead the Clock'' baseball games, which begins Wednesday
night, when the San Francisco Giants play host to the San Diego
Padres, and continues through Sept. 18. The time-travel gimmick got
a test run on June 26 when the Anaheim Angels played the Oakland
A's, generating jokes about outlandish 21st-century concession
prices that were actually unchanged from what fans are charged in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The games will feature futuristic-looking team uniforms and
logos, scoreboards augmented with special effects and predictions
for updated argot. For instance, the position of shortstop becomes
``the intermediate station'' and left field becomes ``the left
sector.'' The rules, however, remain contemporary and the games
will count in the pennant races in this century.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion, which could be dubbed the All-Stars Meet ``Star
Wars,'' is meant as a lighthearted counterpart to the ``Turn Back
the Clock'' games that have long been popular at ballparks
nationwide, when teams revert to their long-ago apparel. One such
game was played on Saturday when the New York Mets wore vintage
uniforms to commemorate their World Series victory in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In a fast-forward flash-ahead, the Mets will pretend to move for
a ``Turn Ahead the Clock'' game in Shea Stadium next Tuesday
between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the ``Mercury Mets.'' And you
thought the Dodgers had a long schlep when they left Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion _ involving 22 of the 30 major-league teams
playing 14 games _ is indicative of efforts by large marketers to
help build their brand images through campaigns that supplement
traditional advertising measures like commercials and print
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to elevate our brand visibility,'' said Steve Savino,
senior vice president for marketing, products and services at
Century 21 Real Estate Corp. in Parsippany, N.J., a unit of Cendant
Corp. Century 21 is sponsoring the promotion as part of a two-year
partnership with Major League Baseball signed in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to more clearly define our brand's personality and
identity,'' Savino said at a news conference Tuesday at the
baseball office in midtown Manhattan, ``to position Century 21 as
cool, state-of-the-art, forward-thinking _ not how people have
traditionally thought of real estate companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make our brand more approachable,'' he added,
``to help reduce the apprehension people feel when they're buying
or selling a home. And one way to do that is to make the brand more
fun.'' That's also why new ads for Century 21 by Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS in New York _ part of the Lowe Group unit of
Interpublic Group of Cos. _ takes a humorous tack.
</P>
<P>
   Century 21 is spending about $2.5 million a year for its
baseball sponsorship, including other promotions like the Home Run
Derby at the All-Star game last week. The company is spending about
10 percent of its annual marketing budget of $45 million to $50
million on promotions, Savino said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Turn Ahead the Clock'' promotion is based on a game played
on July 18, 1998, at which the Seattle Mariners prematurely
celebrated their 50th anniversary by decking themselves out as if
it were the year 2027. Steve McKelvey, vice president for marketing
at PSP Sports in New York, developed the idea of turning that local
promotion into a national one for Century 21 to sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   For the trial game last month in Anaheim, Calif., and the 13 to
come in cities like Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Detroit and St.
Louis, the turned-ahead calendar is being turned back to 2021. Why
that odd number? Well, if you guessed it's because Century 21 is
the sponsor, you can serenade your friends by mixing ``Take Me Out
to the Ball Game'' with the theme song from ``The Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Century 21 intends to be more aggressive marketing its
brand,'' said Tim Brosnan, the baseball senior vice president for
domestic and international properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our partnership is a new one,'' he added, ``but it's one
that's indicative of the types we intend to form going forward.''
Other corporate sponsors include Anheuser-Busch, Gillette and
Mastercard International.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion is also ``a recognition by baseball of the market
reach that companies like Century 21 give us,'' Brosnan said, ``in
bringing baseball to the casual fan, to the fan who doesn't go to
the ballpark too often.'' To further woo such fans, the ``Turn
Ahead the Clock'' games will include give-aways of futuristic team
caps and auctions of autographed game jerseys, with part of the
proceeds donated to charities.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st-century-flavor togs were designed by Major League
Baseball; the participating teams; the athletic division of Russell
Corp., which provides uniforms to teams; New Era Cap Co., which
provides caps, and Century 21. Each team will get about 60 of the
fanciful outfits, at a cost of $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eight teams not taking part in the promotion are the
Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees, all
considered to be among baseball's more tradition-minded franchises.
Some already had their promotional calendars filled for the 1999
season, Brosnan said, and some perceived the promotion ``a little
different'' from what they typically do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it to be extraordinarily successful'' that 22 of
30 teams would take part, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of the outfits yielded mixed results. Most teams
outlined their logos in silver. Some will wear striking
reinterpretations of their current clothing. The Cleveland Indians
will keep their venerable mascot, Chief Wahoo _ a prediction that
the club intends to keep ignoring complaints he is racist?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most way-out look, literally and figuratively, will
be for the Mets, who are replacing the ``NY'' logo on their caps
with the symbol for Mercury as they rename the franchise for the
one game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are ``poking fun'' at franchise moves with the
renaming, Brosnan said. ``It's the ultimate expansion team,
perhaps.''

PLAYWRIGHT HAS THE `ATTITUDE' FOR A MUSICAL
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: diannetucker is cq) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Who said that somber subjects can't be
turned into a musical?
</P>
<P>
   That person hasn't seen a whole slew of musicals on Broadway
recently, from ``Parade'' to ``Side Show.'' And wait until they get
a load of what Dallas playwright diannetucker has cooked up, with
the help of Joe Rogers, for Fort Worth's Jubilee Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The show's title, ``Attitude, Girlfriend, Attitude,'' hints that
it's a musical full of sass and ``go-on-girl!'' snaps. And it is.
</P>
<P>
   But the premise is one not many people would find humor in. And
the only reason diannetucker saw the sunny side is that it really
happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago, I got a call to come to Parkland
Hospital,'' she says. ``A friend of mine had been in a car accident
and hit her head on the windshield. She had a slight case of
amnesia. She was not living in Dallas anymore, so I was surprised
when I got a call from Parkland.''
</P>
<P>
   The story follows the experience to a T. The victim's three
``best friends'' show up and find that not only is she in town
without telling them, but she is with a man who is not her husband.
To make matters worse, that man has a wife who shows up to check on
his less-severe condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people wouldn't have found this funny,'' the playwright
says. ``And it wasn't, but the way (the hospitalized friend)
responded to us was highly comedic.''
</P>
<P>
   Diannetucker is in the middle of an oral five-year contract with
Jubilee. In the past three years, the company has premiered her
plays, ``Hershey With Almonds,'' ``Daddy's Maybe'' and ``Madam
Queen,'' in that order. All are dramas with nice comic touches
thrown in. Like ``Attitude,'' all center on strong female
characters, the hallmark of diannetucker's work. ``Hershey'' is
about a woman who compares men with chocolate, ``Daddy's'' focuses
on a single mother, and ``Madam'' was based on a true story about a
wealthy black woman in the early 20th century who controlled the
lives of everyone around her, including the men.
</P>
<P>
   When Jubilee executive director Rudy Eastman asked diannetucker
if she had a musical in mind, she responded, ``I've always wanted
to write something about this experience I had in a hospital one
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastman hooked her up with frequent Jubilee collaborator and
musician Rogers, whom she had met a few months before, and they put
the idea in motion. ``I have so much admiration for Joe Rogers,''
she says. ``And we worked remotely so well. I could e-mail him
ideas and suggestions and I had so much trust and confidence. I had
no questions with his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a hilarious and touching musical about the power
of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Diannetucker has used her unusually spelled name for 25 years,
since she pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha at then North Texas State
University. (The members were required to sign their names with
lowercase letters, and she found it easier to write it as one
word.) But she has been doing theater her whole life.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Marshall, Texas, where she would put on plays on
her grandmother's front porch. ``On Saturday mornings, all the
neighborhood women would gather and I'd put on a show. And they'd
give me a quarter or something for my effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, she started the Dallas Drama Company, mainly as a forum
to get her own plays produced. ``I thought, I'll do this and
instantly I'll be famous,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The company folded 10 years later, but she didn't fade from the
scene. She has worked with other organizations, such as the Irving
Arts Council, but is best known for her association with Jubilee.
Many of her shows there received extended runs.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not writing, she's leading ``whole-brain thinking''
seminars and workshops on leadership skills, diversity and
creativity. For research in writing, she attends every local
theater production, from equity houses to community theater. ``For
me, it's like a doctoral program, getting exposed to all this
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   For future projects, she's working on a piece called ``Dear
Crooner'' and has long harbored a fantasy for writing something
about Solomon and Sheba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of ideas all the time. Someone might be talking, and
I'm thinking of something else. I have to race for a pencil. You
can't control the muse.''

   The 21st-century-flavor togs were designed by Major League
Baseball; the participating teams; the athletic division of Russell
Corp., which provides uniforms to teams; New Era Cap Co., which
provides caps, and Century 21. Each team will get about 60 of the
fanciful outfits, at a cost of $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eight teams not taking part in the promotion are the
Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees, all
considered to be among baseball's more tradition-minded franchises.
Some already had their promotional calendars filled for the 1999
season, Brosnan said, and some perceived the promotion ``a little
different'' from what they typically do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it to be extraordinarily successful'' that 22 of
30 teams would take part, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of the outfits yielded mixed results. Most teams
outlined their logos in silver. Some will wear striking
reinterpretations of their current clothing. The Cleveland Indians
will keep their venerable mascot, Chief Wahoo _ a prediction that
the club intends to keep ignoring complaints he is racist?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most way-out look, literally and figuratively, will
be for the Mets, who are replacing the ``NY'' logo on their caps
with the symbol for Mercury as they rename the franchise for the
one game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are ``poking fun'' at franchise moves with the
renaming, Brosnan said. ``It's the ultimate expansion team,
perhaps.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In an effort to assuage popular
grievances and to stop a wave of protests by unpaid army
reservists, the Yugoslav government will authorize overdue payments
to reservists, pensioners and teachers in a meeting Wednesday,
senior officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The payment plan is an indication of the anxieties of the
government of President Slobodan Milosevic, despite the inability
so far of its political opposition to channel popular anger after
the defeat in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Army reservists, many of whom retain their weapons from their
service in Kosovo, have been protesting in towns across Serbia to
demand their pay for the months spent in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in Krusevac, a town run by the governing coalition
where up to 8,000 men were mobilized for Kosovo, the reservists
blocked main roads and passenger trains and demonstrated in front
of City Hall. The police did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The reservists say each is owed 6,000 dinars for serving in
Kosovo, or $600 at the official exchange rate. Some are also
demanding help to pay electricity and telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal payments are quite likely to increase inflation
in an economy damaged by NATO air strikes and nine years of
international sanctions. Last week, the commander of the 3rd Army,
Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, said that reservists had been paid $80
million and that an additional $120 million was owed to them. The
total amount that the government plans to pay was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Cabinet minister, Goran Matic, said in an interview
that the government would surprise the West and the divided
political opposition by providing sufficient electricity, heat and
food for Serbia's winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war you have an effort at political destabilization,
to try to organize despair and hopelessness in every person,'' said
Matic, a minister without portfolio who often speaks for the
government. ``But it's more propaganda than reality. There will be
enough food and electricity. There was a bridge finished today, and
we have the potential and resources to rebuild. What we need is
political stability for reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic rejected opposition calls for Milosevic's resignation and
early elections, saying federal and local voting will proceed as
scheduled in November 2000, with elections in Serbia and
Montenegro, the two republics that remain in Yugoslavia, in 2001.
Milosevic, elected by Parliament in 1997, has a single five-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Vuk Draskovic, a leading opposition politician who
had joined the government but was ousted in the war, Matic said,
``Draskovic hasn't won national elections, and the opposition
hasn't won, and now they are trying to get what they couldn't get
through the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in a ceremony in the town of Beska, Serbian officials
reopened the first bridge to be repaired after the bombing. It is
on the main highway from Budapest through Belgrade to Nis, and the
destruction has caused significant traffic delays. Milosevic
presided last month over the beginning of the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   At least 59 bridges were destroyed or damaged in the bombing.
This one was fixed with the help of a donor from Switzerland, who
gave $360,000. Hundreds of people were bused in for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In continuing moves against what remains of the independent
press, the government imposed a new license fee of $40,000 on the
Radio Pancevo, which reported carefully but factually in the war.
The courts also issued notices to report to jail for two reporters
for the newspaper Dnevni Telegraf, or The Daily Telegraph, which
was highly critical of Yugoslav authorities and was banned in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters, Srdjan Jankovic and Zoran Lukovic, were sentenced
in March but told to start five months in jail Monday for an
article in December in which they linked a Serbian official from
the party of Milosevic's wife to a killing.
</P>
<P>
   The article did not directly accuse the official, Dr. Milovan
Bojic, a Serbian deputy prime minister, of the killing of a friend
of his, another doctor. the article said only that the dead man had
criticized Bojic but implied his involvement, which turned out to
be untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawyers for the two reporters argued Tuesday that the
case had been brought very quickly under a new information law and
that the outcome was harsh and vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   Branka Prpa, wife of the owner and editor of The Daily
Telegraph, Slavko Curuvija, who was killed in April, during the
war, by two men who shot him in front of his apartment building,
said in an interview Tuesday that the jailing ``shows the fear of
the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper.'' Ms. Prpa added, ``doesn't print any more. The
owner was killed. The journalists are unemployed and have no
influence. It's a continuation of the message and a warning of how
journalists will be treated in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovic, 27, said in an interview that he thought that ``the
case was absolutely over after the murder of Curuvija'' and the
repression of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be in their interest to push aside the
whole thing,'' he said. ``They just want to instill fear in other
journalists and anyone who thinks for himself in Serbia.''

   The New York Times Syndicate is transmitting a TIMELY article
titled ``BEST OF FRIENDS: CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR ON JOHN F. KENNEDY
JR.,'' which was created from a transcript of the TV news show ``60
Minutes.'' The show, telecast July 18, featured an interview by
Mike Wallace with Christiane Amanpour, chief international
correspondent for CNN and special correspondent for ``60 Minutes,''
who recalled her friendship with John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Kennedy and Amanpour were students at
neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, and they became close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The article is available for oneshot purchase.
</P>
<P>
   (FOR PURCHASE INFORMATION, SEE BELOW.)
</P>
<P>
   From the article ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   With John, everybody has always tried to project what they think
he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable conclusion that
he will be an office holder and president of the United States, if
he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ... But, of course, whenever we asked him that question, `What
will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh, shut up,
Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that kind of
stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed himself ... to
be swept away by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.

United States from Iran ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   With John, everybody has always tried to project what they think
he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable conclusion that
he will be an office holder and president of the United States, if
he wants to.

<P>
   ... But, of course, whenever we asked him that question, `What
will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh, shut up,
Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that kind of
stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed himself ... to
be swept away by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.

<P>
   Twenty years ago, when John Kennedy and Christiane Amanpour were
students at neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, they became close
friends, pals. It was a relationship that remained close and strong
down the years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, Christiane took a short respite from her
chores as chief international correspondent for CNN, and with her
husband, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin, went to Martha's
Vineyard to spend a few days with John and his wife Carolyn _ a
happy relaxed few days, she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Sunday, July 18, when Mike Wallace talked with
his occasional ``60 Minutes'' colleague Christiane about the man
for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   MIKE WALLACE: So we're going to talk about him as though he's
going to come in the door tomorrow morning, OK? Twenty years ago
you first met him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Twenty years ago I first met him when we were both
college freshmen in Rhode Island. And...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You were at the University of Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was at the University of Rhode Island, he was at
Brown. He was Ivy League, I wasn't. You know, I _ I don't often
talk about personal relationships and certainly ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You never have.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And I've never talked about John. But I think at a
time when the whole world is riveted by this moment, we, his
friends, owe him to tell what we know about him from an accurate
and honest perspective.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: What was it that drew you to each other, him to you,
you to him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, we were just friends. You know, we met on
college campus, at parties. I was always sort of a Brown wanna-be
and I had friends at Brown, my Iranian friends and we would meet on
weekends _ and at other occasions. And we just basically, like all
college students do, forged a friendship. I was one of several of
his college friends at this time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Just pals, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: No ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Certainly not. We shared a house off campus. There was
John, there was myself and there were three other friends. And this
went on for two years. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Three other friends, three boys?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: There were boys and girls. There was a different sort
of configuration in the two years, but John and I lived in the same
house for two years. And it was this beautiful house in Providence
and, you know, I had come from an English boarding school and I had
very clear ideas but about how you run a house. You know, I wasn't
about to sort of live with a bunch of frat boys. And so ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right. And there's a certain ... executive aura about
you that was in existence back then...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, that's what you say. No, I...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Come on. You're bossy and I'll bet you were then.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was a little bit bossy and I basically would have
these rosters that I made up. We would divide our duties every
week: somebody would cook, somebody would shop, somebody would
clean bathrooms and toilets. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Somebody would what?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Clean bathrooms and toilets. And, basically, I was the
one who sort of instigated all of that. And my friends to this day
laugh at me for that. And, you know, John used to laugh at me and _
and still does, you know, and he says `You taught me how to clean
toilets. I never had before. And I probably never will again.' You
know, and he cooked and he's a good cook and he cleaned. It started
with that kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: With John, everybody has always tried to project what
they think he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable
conclusion that he will be an office holder and president of the
United States, if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But, of course, whenever we asked him that question,
`What will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh,
shut up, Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that
kind of stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed
himself, and still doesn't, to be swept away ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did he ever talk about his dad?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes _ as a son would talk about his father. He
remembers, you know, a little bit, not everything. He was very
young when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it was never a taboo subject in his household,
quite the contrary. They talked about his father as a father.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did you ever talk privacy with him, talk about the
business of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's something that
their whole family has been concerned about, and even his sister
wrote a legal book on the whole issue of privacy. And, you know, of
course it comes up because who's had their privacy more invaded
than that family, than him?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Conceivably the current president of the United States,
and I'll bet you talked about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, we did. I remember having a dinner several
months ago and there were a group of us: his wife, my husband. And
he was just, you know, (talking) about the whole scandal in
Washington, to the point that he said, `I've got to say something
about it. I want t go on television and sort of say this is not
serious, this is just going too far. This is not politics. This is
just destruction and des ...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Destruction of the president of the United S...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, just destruction of any kind of serious public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And my husband sort of said to him, `Well, you know,
you have to be careful, or you might want to consider what risks
you're taking if you go out publicly and do that. Because of all
the publicity...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. What kind of public nature was he
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Oh, I think do an article in George, go on Larry King,
go on CSPAN, whatever. I mean, you know, he's a player.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: He now has a political magazine, he's a player...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and he's a man who knows a lot about this kind of
political life. And I think that, you know, knowing his own family
history, I think he knew that in today's climate of attack-dog
journalism that even if he tried to say something smart, relevant,
it would be torn apart and people would put the spotlight on his
own family history, his father and that presidency.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: OK, the four of you there (for dinner) for the weekend.
You're at home. You're at dinner. Your husband is an Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs, State Department, Madeleine
Albright's good right. You cover news. This is a Kennedy. I mean,
come on, the conversation _ I'm not prying. Does it not get into
the nitty-gritty of politics at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah, sometimes it does, but you know what? It's often
not as elevated as that, especially when we're sitting around a
dining-room table. We're having fun, we're talking about what we're
going to do the next day...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know, but you're also...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: His wife, Carolyn...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Mmm.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: ... I think that she may be the least known Kennedy of
all.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And theirs _ hold on a second _ except that theirs is
in the glare of the ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... international, national worldwide spotlight. So
it's really tough.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, their fights prior to their marriage were grist
for every tabloid in America.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know, I've never seen one of those and
that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to get into. Because
I've seen them happy and like a normal married couple. And any one
of their friends will tell you the same thing. Despite the lies and
the stories that were made up about them, they get through it. And
I think she is somebody who's a very private person, who went into
her marriage with her eyes open but nevertheless found it difficult
at first ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... is now coming to terms with the spotlight...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and what it means. And is a great support and
partner for her husband. And, you know, I noticed a sort of
maturing (in John) after he got married. You know, he found a
partner, a soul mate. And that's not easy for somebody like John.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: When People magazine did that cover about him, ``The
Sexiest Man Alive,'' did his pals rib him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Totally. Totally. Totally. And he was completely
mortified.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Was he?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know _ I mean, on one level, everybody's
flattered, but on another level he was totally mortified. Because
that's all everybody used to say to him, you know, for a while
after that cover came out.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: They'd say ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: They just called him that. And I remember going into
friends' houses, I swear to God, and the magazine cover would be
pinned on the refrigerator or whatever. And I never used to talk
about, you know, our friendship, but he affected a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And those of us who have been lucky enough to know him
and to be his friends are really very lucky because he's an
incredibly positive force.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And loyal.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And loyal and generous. And I think somebody like
that, the whole world would like to have known him or would like to
know him. But I was talking to some of his friends and we all agree
that to know him is really to love him. Because he's a good, funny,
honest person with all his flaws and his foibles like all of us
have. You know, he's not a saint.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it's rare that you find somebody that people
basically just like.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: The Kennedy curse, the Kennedy curse. Did you ever talk
about that with him at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: No. Again, it's something that the world and people
outside talk about.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And it's never been something that he's talked about.
He never, ever talked about that. In the same way as the Kennedy
mystique, you know, his answer is that, `To you this may seem like
history or mystique...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ...or whatever. But this is my father, my mother, my
sister. This is my family. This is the life I lead.'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And that's very much how he comes across. He doesn't
go into, at least not with me, those kind of morbid introspections.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You love this man.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. I said everybody says that to know John is to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And he loves you back.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, he loves his friends. He's a good man. He
loves his family, he's devoted and he's a joy.

   Twenty years ago, when John Kennedy and Christiane Amanpour were
students at neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, they became close
friends, pals. It was a relationship that remained close and strong
down the years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, Christiane took a short respite from her
chores as chief international correspondent for CNN, and with her
husband, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin, went to Martha's
Vineyard to spend a few days with John and his wife Carolyn _ a
happy relaxed few days, she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Sunday, July 18, when Mike Wallace talked with
his occasional ``60 Minutes'' colleague Christiane about the man
for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   MIKE WALLACE: So we're going to talk about him as though he's
going to come in the door tomorrow morning, OK? Twenty years ago
you first met him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Twenty years ago I first met him when we were both
college freshmen in Rhode Island. And...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You were at the University of Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was at the University of Rhode Island, he was at
Brown. He was Ivy League, I wasn't. You know, I _ I don't often
talk about personal relationships and certainly ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You never have.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And I've never talked about John. But I think at a
time when the whole world is riveted by this moment, we, his
friends, owe him to tell what we know about him from an accurate
and honest perspective.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: What was it that drew you to each other, him to you,
you to him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, we were just friends. You know, we met on
college campus, at parties. I was always sort of a Brown wanna-be
and I had friends at Brown, my Iranian friends and we would meet on
weekends _ and at other occasions. And we just basically, like all
college students do, forged a friendship. I was one of several of
his college friends at this time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Just pals, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: No ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Certainly not. We shared a house off campus. There was
John, there was myself and there were three other friends. And this
went on for two years. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Three other friends, three boys?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: There were boys and girls. There was a different sort
of configuration in the two years, but John and I lived in the same
house for two years. And it was this beautiful house in Providence
and, you know, I had come from an English boarding school and I had
very clear ideas but about how you run a house. You know, I wasn't
about to sort of live with a bunch of frat boys. And so ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right. And there's a certain ... executive aura about
you that was in existence back then...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, that's what you say. No, I...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Come on. You're bossy and I'll bet you were then.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was a little bit bossy and I basically would have
these rosters that I made up. We would divide our duties every
week: somebody would cook, somebody would shop, somebody would
clean bathrooms and toilets. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Somebody would what?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Clean bathrooms and toilets. And, basically, I was the
one who sort of instigated all of that. And my friends to this day
laugh at me for that. And, you know, John used to laugh at me and _
and still does, you know, and he says `You taught me how to clean
toilets. I never had before. And I probably never will again.' You
know, and he cooked and he's a good cook and he cleaned. It started
with that kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: With John, everybody has always tried to project what
they think he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable
conclusion that he will be an office holder and president of the
United States, if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But, of course, whenever we asked him that question,
`What will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh,
shut up, Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that
kind of stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed
himself, and still doesn't, to be swept away ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did he ever talk about his dad?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes _ as a son would talk about his father. He
remembers, you know, a little bit, not everything. He was very
young when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it was never a taboo subject in his household,
quite the contrary. They talked about his father as a father.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did you ever talk privacy with him, talk about the
business of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's something that
their whole family has been concerned about, and even his sister
wrote a legal book on the whole issue of privacy. And, you know, of
course it comes up because who's had their privacy more invaded
than that family, than him?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Conceivably the current president of the United States,
and I'll bet you talked about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, we did. I remember having a dinner several
months ago and there were a group of us: his wife, my husband. And
he was just, you know, (talking) about the whole scandal in
Washington, to the point that he said, `I've got to say something
about it. I want to go on television and sort of say this is not
serious, this is just going too far. This is not politics. This is
just destruction and des ...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Destruction of the president of the United S...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, just destruction of any kind of serious public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And my husband sort of said to him, `Well, you know,
you have to be careful, or you might want to consider what risks
you're taking if you go out publicly and do that. Because of all
the publicity...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. What kind of public nature was he
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Oh, I think do an article in George, go on Larry King,
go on CSPAN, whatever. I mean, you know, he's a player.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: He now has a political magazine, he's a player...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and he's a man who knows a lot about this kind of
political life. And I think that, you know, knowing his own family
history, I think he knew that in today's climate of attack-dog
journalism that even if he tried to say something smart, relevant,
it would be torn apart and people would put the spotlight on his
own family history, his father and that presidency.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: OK, the four of you there (for dinner) for the weekend.
You're at home. You're at dinner. Your husband is an Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs, State Department, Madeleine
Albright's good right. You cover news. This is a Kennedy. I mean,
come on, the conversation _ I'm not prying. Does it not get into
the nitty-gritty of politics at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah, sometimes it does, but you know what? It's often
not as elevated as that, especially when we're sitting around a
dining-room table. We're having fun, we're talking about what we're
going to do the next day...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know, but you're also...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: His wife, Carolyn...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Mmm.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: ... I think that she may be the least known Kennedy of
all.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And theirs _ hold on a second _ except that theirs is
in the glare of the ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... international, national worldwide spotlight. So
it's really tough.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, their fights prior to their marriage were grist
for every tabloid in America.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know, I've never seen one of those and
that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to get into. Because
I've seen them happy and like a normal married couple. And any one
of their friends will tell you the same thing. Despite the lies and
the stories that were made up about them, they get through it. And
I think she is somebody who's a very private person, who went into
her marriage with her eyes open but nevertheless found it difficult
at first ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... is now coming to terms with the spotlight...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and what it means. And is a great support and
partner for her husband. And, you know, I noticed a sort of
maturing (in John) after he got married. You know, he found a
partner, a soul mate. And that's not easy for somebody like John.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: When People magazine did that cover about him, ``The
Sexiest Man Alive,'' did his pals rib him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Totally. Totally. Totally. And he was completely
mortified.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Was he?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know _ I mean, on one level, everybody's
flattered, but on another level he was totally mortified. Because
that's all everybody used to say to him, you know, for a while
after that cover came out.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: They'd say ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: They just called him that. And I remember going into
friends' houses, I swear to God, and the magazine cover would be
pinned on the refrigerator or whatever. And I never used to talk
about, you know, our friendship, but he affected a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And those of us who have been lucky enough to know him
and to be his friends are really very lucky because he's an
incredibly positive force.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And loyal.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And loyal and generous. And I think somebody like
that, the whole world would like to have known him or would like to
know him. But I was talking to some of his friends and we all agree
that to know him is really to love him. Because he's a good, funny,
honest person with all his flaws and his foibles like all of us
have. You know, he's not a saint.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it's rare that you find somebody that people
basically just like.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: The Kennedy curse, the Kennedy curse. Did you ever talk
about that with him at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: No. Again, it's something that the world and people
outside talk about.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And it's never been something that he's talked about.
He never, ever talked about that. In the same way as the Kennedy
mystique, you know, his answer is that, `To you this may seem like
history or mystique...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ...or whatever. But this is my father, my mother, my
sister. This is my family. This is the life I lead.'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And that's very much how he comes across. He doesn't
go into, at least not with me, those kind of morbid introspections.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You love this man.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. I said everybody says that to know John is to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And he loves you back.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, he loves his friends. He's a good man. He
loves his family, he's devoted and he's a joy.

   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: His wife, Carolyn...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Mmm.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: ... I think that she may be the least known Kennedy of
all.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And theirs _ hold on a second _ except that theirs is
in the glare of the ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... international, national worldwide spotlight. So
it's really tough.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, their fights prior to their marriage were grist
for every tabloid in America.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know, I've never seen one of those and
that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to get into. Because
I've seen them happy and like a normal married couple. And any one
of their friends will tell you the same thing. Despite the lies and
the stories that were made up about them, they get through it. And
I think she is somebody who's a very private person, who went into
her marriage with her eyes open but nevertheless found it difficult
at first ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... is now coming to terms with the spotlight...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and what it means. And is a great support and
partner for her husband. And, you know, I noticed a sort of
maturing (in John) after he got married. You know, he found a
partner, a soul mate. And that's not easy for somebody like John.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: When People magazine did that cover about him, ``The
Sexiest Man Alive,'' did his pals rib him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Totally. Totally. Totally. And he was completely
mortified.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Was he?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know _ I mean, on one level, everybody's
flattered, but on another level he was totally mortified. Because
that's all everybody used to say to him, you know, for a while
after that cover came out.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: They'd say ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: They just called him that. And I remember going into
friends' houses, I swear to God, and the magazine cover would be
pinned on the refrigerator or whatever. And I never used to talk
about, you know, our friendship, but he affected a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And those of us who have been lucky enough to know him
and to be his friends are really very lucky because he's an
incredibly positive force.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And loyal.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And loyal and generous. And I think somebody like
that, the whole world would like to have known him or would like to
know him. But I was talking to some of his friends and we all agree
that to know him is really to love him. Because he's a good, funny,
honest person with all his flaws and his foibles like all of us
have. You know, he's not a saint.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it's rare that you find somebody that people
basically just like.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: The Kennedy curse, the Kennedy curse. Did you ever talk
about that with him at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: No. Again, it's something that the world and people
outside talk about.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And it's never been something that he's talked about.
He never, ever talked about that. In the same way as the Kennedy
mystique, you know, his answer is that, `To you this may seem like
history or mystique...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ...or whatever. But this is my father, my mother, my
sister. This is my family. This is the life I lead.'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And that's very much how he comes across. He doesn't
go into, at least not with me, those kind of morbid introspections.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You love this man.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. I said everybody says that to know John is to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And he loves you back.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, he loves his friends. He's a good man. He
loves his family, he's devoted and he's a joy.

<P>
   Twenty years ago, when John Kennedy and Christiane Amanpour were
students at neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, they became close
friends, pals. It was a relationship that remained close and strong
down the years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, Christiane took a short respite from her
chores as chief international correspondent for CNN, and with her
husband, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin, went to Martha's
Vineyard to spend a few days with John and his wife Carolyn _ a
happy relaxed few days, she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Sunday, July 18, when Mike Wallace talked with
his occasional ``60 Minutes'' colleague Christiane about the man
for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   MIKE WALLACE: So we're going to talk about him as though he's
going to come in the door tomorrow morning, OK? Twenty years ago
you first met him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Twenty years ago I first met him when we were both
college freshmen in Rhode Island. And...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You were at the University of Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was at the University of Rhode Island, he was at
Brown. He was Ivy League, I wasn't. You know, I _ I don't often
talk about personal relationships and certainly ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You never have.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And I've never talked about John. But I think at a
time when the whole world is riveted by this moment, we, his
friends, owe him to tell what we know about him from an accurate
and honest perspective.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: What was it that drew you to each other, him to you,
you to him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, we were just friends. You know, we met on
college campus, at parties. I was always sort of a Brown wanna-be
and I had friends at Brown, my Iranian friends and we would meet on
weekends _ and at other occasions. And we just basically, like all
college students do, forged a friendship. I was one of several of
his college friends at this time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Just pals, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: No ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Certainly not. We shared a house off campus. There was
John, there was myself and there were three other friends. And this
went on for two years. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Three other friends, three boys?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: There were boys and girls. There was a different sort
of configuration in the two years, but John and I lived in the same
house for two years. And it was this beautiful house in Providence
and, you know, I had come from an English boarding school and I had
very clear ideas but about how you run a house. You know, I wasn't
about to sort of live with a bunch of frat boys. And so ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right. And there's a certain ... executive aura about
you that was in existence back then...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, that's what you say. No, I...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Come on. You're bossy and I'll bet you were then.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was a little bit bossy and I basically would have
these rosters that I made up. We would divide our duties every
week: somebody would cook, somebody would shop, somebody would
clean bathrooms and toilets. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Somebody would what?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Clean bathrooms and toilets. And, basically, I was the
one who sort of instigated all of that. And my friends to this day
laugh at me for that. And, you know, John used to laugh at me and _
and still does, you know, and he says `You taught me how to clean
toilets. I never had before. And I probably never will again.' You
know, and he cooked and he's a good cook and he cleaned. It started
with that kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: With John, everybody has always tried to project what
they think he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable
conclusion that he will be an office holder and president of the
United States, if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But, of course, whenever we asked him that question,
`What will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh,
shut up, Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that
kind of stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed
himself, and still doesn't, to be swept away ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did he ever talk about his dad?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes _ as a son would talk about his father. He
remembers, you know, a little bit, not everything. He was very
young when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it was never a taboo subject in his household,
quite the contrary. They talked about his father as a father.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did you ever talk privacy with him, talk about the
business of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's something that
their whole family has been concerned about, and even his sister
wrote a legal book on the whole issue of privacy. And, you know, of
course it comes up because who's had their privacy more invaded
than that family, than him?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Conceivably the current president of the United States,
and I'll bet you talked about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, we did. I remember having a dinner several
months ago and there were a group of us: his wife, my husband. And
he was just, you know, (talking) about the whole scandal in
Washington, to the point that he said, `I've got to say something
about it. I want to go on television and sort of say this is not
serious, this is just going too far. This is not politics. This is
just destruction and des ...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Destruction of the president of the United S...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, just destruction of any kind of serious public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And my husband sort of said to him, `Well, you know,
you have to be careful, or you might want to consider what risks
you're taking if you go out publicly and do that. Because of all
the publicity...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. What kind of public nature was he
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Oh, I think do an article in George, go on Larry King,
go on CSPAN, whatever. I mean, you know, he's a player.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: He now has a political magazine, he's a player...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and he's a man who knows a lot about this kind of
political life. And I think that, you know, knowing his own family
history, I think he knew that in today's climate of attack-dog
journalism that even if he tried to say something smart, relevant,
it would be torn apart and people would put the spotlight on his
own family history, his father and that presidency.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: OK, the four of you there (for dinner) for the weekend.
You're at home. You're at dinner. Your husband is an Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs, State Department, Madeleine
Albright's good right. You cover news. This is a Kennedy. I mean,
come on, the conversation _ I'm not prying. Does it not get into
the nitty-gritty of politics at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah, sometimes it does, but you know what? It's often
not as elevated as that, especially when we're sitting around a
dining-room table. We're having fun, we're talking about what we're
going to do the next day...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know, but you're also...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.

for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   MIKE WALLACE: So we're going to talk about him as though he's
going to come in the door tomorrow morning, OK? Twenty years ago
you first met him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Twenty years ago I first met him when we were both
college freshmen in Rhode Island. And...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You were at the University of Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was at the University of Rhode Island, he was at
Brown. He was Ivy League, I wasn't. You know, I _ I don't often
talk about personal relationships and certainly ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You never have.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And I've never talked about John. But I think at a
time when the whole world is riveted by this moment, we, his
friends, owe him to tell what we know about him from an accurate
and honest perspective.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: What was it that drew you to each other, him to you,
you to him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, we were just friends. You know, we met on
college campus, at parties. I was always sort of a Brown wanna-be
and I had friends at Brown, my Iranian friends and we would meet on
weekends _ and at other occasions. And we just basically, like all
college students do, forged a friendship. I was one of several of
his college friends at this time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Just pals, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: No ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Certainly not. We shared a house off campus. There was
John, there was myself and there were three other friends. And this
went on for two years. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Three other friends, three boys?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: There were boys and girls. There was a different sort
of configuration in the two years, but John and I lived in the same
house for two years. And it was this beautiful house in Providence
and, you know, I had come from an English boarding school and I had
very clear ideas but about how you run a house. You know, I wasn't
about to sort of live with a bunch of frat boys. And so ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right. And there's a certain ... executive aura about
you that was in existence back then...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, that's what you say. No, I...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Come on. You're bossy and I'll bet you were then.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was a little bit bossy and I basically would have
these rosters that I made up. We would divide our duties every
week: somebody would cook, somebody would shop, somebody would
clean bathrooms and toilets. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Somebody would what?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Clean bathrooms and toilets. And, basically, I was the
one who sort of instigated all of that. And my friends to this day
laugh at me for that. And, you know, John used to laugh at me and _
and still does, you know, and he says `You taught me how to clean
toilets. I never had before. And I probably never will again.' You
know, and he cooked and he's a good cook and he cleaned. It started
with that kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: With John, everybody has always tried to project what
they think he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable
conclusion that he will be an office holder and president of the
United States, if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But, of course, whenever we asked him that question,
`What will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh,
shut up, Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that
kind of stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed
himself, and still doesn't, to be swept away ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did he ever talk about his dad?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes _ as a son would talk about his father. He
remembers, you know, a little bit, not everything. He was very
young when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it was never a taboo subject in his household,
quite the contrary. They talked about his father as a father.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did you ever talk privacy with him, talk about the
business of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's something that
their whole family has been concerned about, and even his sister
wrote a legal book on the whole issue of privacy. And, you know, of
course it comes up because who's had their privacy more invaded
than that family, than him?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Conceivably the current president of the United States,
and I'll bet you talked about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, we did. I remember having a dinner several
months ago and there were a group of us: his wife, my husband. And
he was just, you know, (talking) about the whole scandal in
Washington, to the point that he said, `I've got to say something
about it. I want to go on television and sort of say this is not
serious, this is just going too far. This is not politics. This is
just destruction and des ...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Destruction of the president of the United S...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, just destruction of any kind of serious public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And my husband sort of said to him, `Well, you know,
you have to be careful, or you might want to consider what risks
you're taking if you go out publicly and do that. Because of all
the publicity...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. What kind of public nature was he
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Oh, I think do an article in George, go on Larry King,
go on CSPAN, whatever. I mean, you know, he's a player.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: He now has a political magazine, he's a player...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and he's a man who knows a lot about this kind of
political life. And I think that, you know, knowing his own family
history, I think he knew that in today's climate of attack-dog
journalism that even if he tried to say something smart, relevant,
it would be torn apart and people would put the spotlight on his
own family history, his father and that presidency.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: OK, the four of you there (for dinner) for the weekend.
You're at home. You're at dinner. Your husband is an Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs, State Department, Madeleine
Albright's good right. You cover news. This is a Kennedy. I mean,
come on, the conversation _ I'm not prying. Does it not get into
the nitty-gritty of politics at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah, sometimes it does, but you know what? It's often
not as elevated as that, especially when we're sitting around a
dining-room table. We're having fun, we're talking about what we're
going to do the next day...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know, but you're also...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: His wife, Carolyn...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Mmm.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: ... I think that she may be the least known Kennedy of
all.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And theirs _ hold on a second _ except that theirs is
in the glare of the ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... international, national worldwide spotlight. So
it's really tough.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, their fights prior to their marriage were grist
for every tabloid in America.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know, I've never seen one of those and
that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to get into. Because
I've seen them happy and like a normal married couple. And any one
of their friends will tell you the same thing. Despite the lies and
the stories that were made up about them, they get through it. And
I think she is somebody who's a very private person, who went into
her marriage with her eyes open but nevertheless found it difficult
at first ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... is now coming to terms with the spotlight...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and what it means. And is a great support and
partner for her husband. And, you know, I noticed a sort of
maturing (in John) after he got married. You know, he found a
partner, a soul mate. And that's not easy for somebody like John.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: When People magazine did that cover about him, ``The
Sexiest Man Alive,'' did his pals rib him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Totally. Totally. Totally. And he was completely
mortified.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Was he?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know _ I mean, on one level, everybody's
flattered, but on another level he was totally mortified. Because
that's all everybody used to say to him, you know, for a while
after that cover came out.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: They'd say ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: They just called him that. And I remember going into
friends' houses, I swear to God, and the magazine cover would be
pinned on the refrigerator or whatever. And I never used to talk
about, you know, our friendship, but he affected a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And those of us who have been lucky enough to know him
and to be his friends are really very lucky because he's an
incredibly positive force.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And loyal.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And loyal and generous. And I think somebody like
that, the whole world would like to have known him or would like to
know him. But I was talking to some of his friends and we all agree
that to know him is really to love him. Because he's a good, funny,
honest person with all his flaws and his foibles like all of us
have. You know, he's not a saint.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it's rare that you find somebody that people
basically just like.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: The Kennedy curse, the Kennedy curse. Did you ever talk
about that with him at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: No. Again, it's something that the world and people
outside talk about.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And it's never been something that he's talked about.
He never, ever talked about that. In the same way as the Kennedy
mystique, you know, his answer is that, `To you this may seem like
history or mystique...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ...or whatever. But this is my father, my mother, my
sister. This is my family. This is the life I lead.'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And that's very much how he comes across. He doesn't
go into, at least not with me, those kind of morbid introspections.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You love this man.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. I said everybody says that to know John is to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And he loves you back.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, he loves his friends. He's a good man. He
loves his family, he's devoted and he's a joy.

   Twenty years ago, when John Kennedy and Christiane Amanpour were
students at neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, they became close
friends, pals. It was a relationship that remained close and strong
down the years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, Christiane took a short respite from her
chores as chief international correspondent for CNN, and with her
husband, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin, went to Martha's
Vineyard to spend a few days with John and his wife Carolyn _ a
happy relaxed few days, she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Sunday, July 18, when Mike Wallace talked with
his occasional ``60 Minutes'' colleague Christiane about the man
for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.

</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And theirs _ hold on a second _ except that theirs is
in the glare of the ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... international, national worldwide spotlight. So
it's really tough.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, their fights prior to their marriage were grist
for every tabloid in America.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know, I've never seen one of those and
that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to get into. Because
I've seen them happy and like a normal married couple. And any one
of their friends will tell you the same thing. Despite the lies and
the stories that were made up about them, they get through it. And
I think she is somebody who's a very private person, who went into
her marriage with her eyes open but nevertheless found it difficult
at first ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... is now coming to terms with the spotlight...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and what it means. And is a great support and
partner for her husband. And, you know, I noticed a sort of
maturing (in John) after he got married. You know, he found a
partner, a soul mate. And that's not easy for somebody like John.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: When People magazine did that cover about him, ``The
Sexiest Man Alive,'' did his pals rib him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Totally. Totally. Totally. And he was completely
mortified.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Was he?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know _ I mean, on one level, everybody's
flattered, but on another level he was totally mortified. Because
that's all everybody used to say to him, you know, for a while
after that cover came out.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: They'd say ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: They just called him that. And I remember going into
friends' houses, I swear to God, and the magazine cover would be
pinned on the refrigerator or whatever. And I never used to talk
about, you know, our friendship, but he affected a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And those of us who have been lucky enough to know him
and to be his friends are really very lucky because he's an
incredibly positive force.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And loyal.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And loyal and generous. And I think somebody like
that, the whole world would like to have known him or would like to
know him. But I was talking to some of his friends and we all agree
that to know him is really to love him. Because he's a good, funny,
honest person with all his flaws and his foibles like all of us
have. You know, he's not a saint.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it's rare that you find somebody that people
basically just like.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: The Kennedy curse, the Kennedy curse. Did you ever talk
about that with him at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: No. Again, it's something that the world and people
outside talk about.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And it's never been something that he's talked about.
He never, ever talked about that. In the same way as the Kennedy
mystique, you know, his answer is that, `To you this may seem like
history or mystique...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ...or whatever. But this is my father, my mother, my
sister. This is my family. This is the life I lead.'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And that's very much how he comes across. He doesn't
go into, at least not with me, those kind of morbid introspections.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You love this man.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. I said everybody says that to know John is to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And he loves you back.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, he loves his friends. He's a good man. He
loves his family, he's devoted and he's a joy.

   KISII, Kenya _ Ward 6 in the hospital here could not be much
more crowded: Bethsheba Bosibori, 52, lay in bed with a woman she
did not know, with another sitting at her feet and a third coughing
on a mat on the floor. In all, 113 women were packed into a room
with 23 beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are small, there can be three'' in a bed, said Sister
Elizabeth Maranga, a nurse. ``Big bodies _ only two.''
</P>
<P>
   Kisii, a small city in western Kenya, is the center of a serious
outbreak of malaria, one of the worst in recent years, and all the
more worrisome to experts because malaria has not usually been a
widespread problem here. At an altitude of nearly 6,000 feet, Kisii
had been considered too high for the mosquitoes that harbor the
parasites that spread the sickness to live very long.
</P>
<P>
   But since May, more than 300 people have died of malaria in this
regional hospital alone, among some 18,000 cases the staff has
seen. Several hundred more _ no one is sure how many _ have died
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One million people die in Africa each year from malaria, the
second biggest killer on the continent, after AIDS, according to
the United Nations. The problems in Kisii underscore how the
disease is changing and spreading on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons not fully understood, doctors say, the disease seems
to be moving to higher altitudes and to other places where
transmission has been low. Resistance to various drugs used for
treating the disease, particularly chloroquine, is also rising
steeply.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual rain patterns since the El Nino storms last year also
seem to be driving the numbers upward. In Kisii it rarely rains
this time of year, but on a recent day, it poured down, draining
into pools of water that stagnate and breed the mosquitoes that
carry the malaria parasite.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think it will disappear, then it rains again,'' said
Dr. Wycliffe Mogoa, a pediatrician and the medical superintendent
at Kisii District Hospital. ``There will be more stagnant water,
the mosquitoes will hatch and there will be problems again.''
</P>
<P>
   The rains have been so irregular that the outbreak has stretched
out for longer than three months. Last year, the worst year in
memory for malaria in Kenya because of the El Nino rains, the
outbreak here lasted only a month and a half, Mogoa said.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak has been especially hard on children and on women
weakened from recent childbirth. But no one is immune. On a recent
day, on a hill in a village near here, Machoge Akunga, a farmer
about 50 years old, lay dead under a gray blanket on a straw mat,
his wife and sister waiting next to the body inside their hut. He
had 11 children.
</P>
<P>
   His family said he came down with a headache, fever and
dizziness, and his joints became sore, all symptoms of malaria. But
they did not take him to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem serious,'' said his niece, Kemunto, 26. Three
days later, at noon, he died.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say both lack of information about malaria and poverty
help it spread, and both problems were evident at Akunga's hut. His
cousin, Samuel Kebwarwo, also has malaria but said he was turned
away from a hospital because he could not afford treatment, which
costs a little more than $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd of perhaps two dozen people there, no one could say
exactly how malaria was spread or how to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have experience,'' Akunga's niece said to visitors,
``maybe you can explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases of malaria in the highlands of western Kenya have been
rising slowly over the last five years, including in Kisii, and it
remains a mystery exactly why, said Col. Ronald Rosenberg,
commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research Unit, which is studying
malaria in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   One possible theory that appears not to be borne out is global
warming, which would theoretically create better conditions for
mosquitoes, he said. An analysis of 65 years of hospital admissions
in the nearby town of Kericho, at roughly the same altitude as
Kisii, showed that climate was unrelated to the number of malaria
cases reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said he believes drug resistance and unusual rains, at
least in the last two years, are major reasons. He theorized a
third: that public transportation has improved, and people in the
highlands are traveling more often to malaria-infected areas and
returning sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of a sociological explanation that may have some
truth to it,'' he said. ``It's probably not everything but it could
be a contributing factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the disease worse still _ often to the point
where it cannot be treated _ is that people often take only pain
relievers or go to herbalists or even quacks, cheaper than most
real doctors, said Dr. Bart De Porter, field coordinator in Kisii
for the French branch of Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, they don't come to us,'' De Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups have camped themselves in Kisii,
sending in doctors like De Porter as well as drugs and mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the outbreak has become a political issue. Local
politicians have accused President Daniel arap Moi of purposely not
controlling the epidemic as a way of punishing one of his most
formidable challengers, former Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae. He
represents this district in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   To show his concern, Moi toured the hospital here earlier this
month, and it was bursting with patients _ 800 people were here,
when the capacity is only 250. Aid organizations say that the
medical staff at a nearby government health center was beefed up
only briefly, seemingly as a show for his visit.
</P>
<P>
   But Mogoa said the government has responded well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had come to assess a serious epidemic in good
faith,'' he said. ``And instead of local politicians joining him,
they are making noise, and in the end they have never stepped foot
in this hospital, which belongs to them. You can't play politics
with an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Kenya's health officials say they do not have enough
drugs, doctors or transportation to cope with the crisis. In
frustration, they are focusing their hope on better education about
malaria in the future _ which drug companies and some international
health agencies and researchers hope someday will also include a
vaccine and aid groups hope will include greater use of preventive
measures like mosquito nets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, doctors say that July is shaping up to be the worst
month yet this year. On a recent evening, an 8-year-old boy,
Richard Mukuya, lay in a malaria-induced coma, his hand held by his
father, Anthony. Mrs. Bosibori lay in the crowded women's ward and
said many people she knew were infected with malaria, including
several of her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen so many people sick with malaria,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, a hard and steady rain began, the drops pounding
on the ward's tin roof, making it impossible to hear anything else
and dripping into yet more puddles for mosquitoes to breed and
spread sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very bad news,'' De Porter said.

   EXCHANGE PROGRAM TEACHES FUTURE RUSSIAN LEADERS ABOUT DEMOCRACY
</P>
<P>
   650. Moving on international and national wires.
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Deans
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Hoping to widen Russia's circle of pro-democracy
disciples at a critical moment in the country's post-Soviet
struggle, Congress is spending $10 million to send 2,000 budding
Russian political figures on a journey across the American
heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Some 150 of them are bound for Atlanta, where they'll each spend
a week living with a local family and meeting with area political
and civic leaders, under the sponsorship of the Atlanta-based
Friendship Force.It's the 22-year-old organization's single-largest
Russian exchange program in nearly a decade, executive director
George Brown said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the cultural exchange program that brought to Atlanta 300
citizens from various walks of life in the former Soviet republic
of Georgia in 1990, this program targets rising political and
government leaders in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to have an impact on the political and economic
evolution in Russia, then these are the key people,'' said Brown.
``These are the future leaders of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are expected to visit Atlanta in 10 groups of about
15 participants during staggered trips between mid-August and the
end of September.
</P>
<P>
   The Friendship Force, a non-profit organization that promotes
international cultural exchange, has enlisted a number of
Atlanta-area host families for the Russians, and is looking for
several dozen more, said Brown, who was here for a Capitol news
conference to announce the Russian Leadership Program.
</P>
<P>
   The program is the brainchild of Russian scholar James
Billington, the Librarian of Congress. Concerned that Russia's deep
economic woes and its geopolitical uncertainty could press the
country's democratic reforms into retreat, Billington urged
Congress to provide funding to bring a new generation of political
leaders from Russia to this country. Here, the Russians could
experience firsthand the workings of U.S. political and civic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a $10-million program to send groups of Russians
to all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest-ever, one-time visitation program to bring
current and future Russian leaders to the United States,'' said
Billington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process of exposure,'' said Billington. ``I think it
will enable people better to understand how this kind of society
functions.''
</P>
<P>
   The government of Russian President Boris Yeltsin backs the
program, anticipating that it will help to cement public support
for the painful economic and political reforms the country has been
undergoing since the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that it will lead to better relations between our
countries and between our two peoples,'' said career diplomat Yury
Ushakov, the Russian Federation's ambassador to the United States.
``It has become especially essential in the context of the current
stage of U.S.-Russian relations.''
</P>
<P>
   That relationship only began to right itself last month after a
spring of deep strains over the U.S.-led NATO air campaign against
Yugoslav military forces in the province of Kosovo. Russians have
close historical and cultural ties to their Slavic kin, the Serbs,
the dominant ethnic group in Yugoslavia's main state of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's domestic ills, combined with a rise in anti-American
sentiment stemming from the NATO strikes, have sparked fears in
this country that Russian voters could reject pro-democracy
reformers and back a less democratic or perhaps even an
authoritarian regime in parliamentary elections scheduled for
December.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Ak., a supporter of the Russian Leadership
Program, said he would soon introduce legislation proposing that
Congress make the program a continuing project. He said he would
propose spending between $15 million and $20 million a year to
bring up to 3,000 Russians to this country annually.

NASA RESETS SHUTTLE LAUNCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., _ NASA on Tuesday prepared for a second
attempt to launch the shuttle Columbia with the Chandra X-ray
Observatory, perhaps the only opportunity it will have to begin the
much delayed mission until next month.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency targeted the second attempt from the Kennedy
Space Center at 12:28 a.m. EDT Thursday. There is a small chance of
rain forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning's launch attempt was halted by a ground
controller at seven seconds from liftoff when a sensor in the
shuttle's rocket engine compartment picked up a potential leak of
explosive hydrogen fuel. Shuttle engineers determined there was no
leak, just a faulty sensor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lay out the data in hindsight, it looks like we have
a data problem with one of our hazardous gas detection systems,''
said &UR;  &LR; Ralph Roe, the NASA launch director. ``It was not a real
leak.''
</P>
<P>
   The console operator who monitors the detection system from
Kennedy's launch control center stopped the count as he saw the
hydrogen levels rise to 640 parts per million, more than twice the
limit. Engineers believe the sensor reacted improperly to a
pressure change in the engine compartment as it was ventilated
during the final seconds of the countdown.
</P>
<P>
   The effort required to recalibrate the sensors and replace an
igniter system that burns off stray hydrogen vapors, which can
accumulate in the exhaust trench of the shuttle's launch pad,
prohibited another liftoff attempt Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attempt may be the last for Columbia until
mid-August, though the space agency was negotiating with the Air
Force and Boeing for another opportunity Friday night, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chandra at this point is a very high priority for us, and at
the first opportunity we will launch it when we can safely do so,''
said Don McMonagle, chairman of NASA's mission management team.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force operates the ground radar tracking facilities that
are required to ensure that commercial as well as NASA and military
rockets do not stray over populated areas. Boeing has reserved the
use of the one-of-a-kind facilities Saturday for the launching of
an expendable Delta rocket with four communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force then plans to suspend all launching until Aug. 12
so that it can upgrade its tracking network.
</P>
<P>
   Originally scheduled for last August, Chandra's launching has
already been postponed by a succession of difficulties. They
include problems with the satellite's flight control software,
electronic circuitry and most recently the propulsion system that
is to loft it to an orbit higher than it can reach with the shuttle
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Columbia's launching was halted early Tuesday a
half second before its three rocket engines ignited. A shutdown
following the ignition would likely have required technicians to
replace all three shuttle engines, an operation that takes at least
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Had that happened, Chandra's launching could have been delayed
until late 2000. The oldest of NASA's shuttles, Columbia is already
overdue for a yearlong overhaul. None of the other orbiters has the
room in its cargo bay for the telescope and its propulsion system.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's flight will also mark the first command of a space
mission by a woman, veteran astronaut Eileen Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The milestone drew a number of prominent onlookers, including
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, her daughter, Chelsea, and the
U.S. womens' soccer team, victors in recent World Cup play.
</P>
<P>
   NASA said it felt no undue pressure to launch in response to the
presence of a prominent audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response the team has to a problem is independent to any
high level public appearance. We're proud of the team's capability
to operate without being influenced by that,'' McMonagle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole crew salutes the vigilance and professionalism of
the launch team, and we fully support the decision they made,''
Collins added. ``We will be ready whenever.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton departed Cape Canaveral after the scrub, but
NASA made preparations to receive the first lady if she elected to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra is the center piece of a $2.8 billion mission. The
observatory was developed so astronomers can study black holes,
stellar explosions and galactic collisions and their influences on
the evolution of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   If Columbia lifts off successfully early Thursday, Collins and
crewmates Jeff Ashby, Catherine ``Cady'' Coleman, Steve Hawley and
Michel Tognini would attempt to deploy the telescope later in the
day.

ADOPTION (Phoenix) - A Phoenix family is adopting 10 siblings,
ranging in age from 4 to 17. This is the largest single adoption
all from one family in Arizona, possibly the nation, DES officials
say. The children are half Native American; the parents are white.
They originally had several of the children as foster kids and met
the siblings through visits. The decided that the children should
be together; adoption is final July 23. By KARINA BLAND. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOMENTS (Phoenix) - You may not believe this now, but last
weekend's crash that killed JFK jr., his wife and her sister,
probably is not a `where were you when` moment. In fact, it's
getting harder to come by those moments, because any story almost
immediately begets 24-hour media coverage. Still, though, there are
exceptions, and they change by generation. The end of World War II;
Pearl Harbor. Kennedy's assassination. The explosion of the
Challenger. The moon landing. Even the O.J. Simpson slow-speed
Bronco chase. Princess Diana. What does it take to make those
moments? By BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AWA-EARNINGS (Phoenix) - Higher fuel prices and a $9.7 million
Y2K-readiness expense increased operating costs at America West
Airlines in the second quarter but the carrier managed record
earnings of $554.2 million. That is a 6.8 percent increase over the
second quarter of 1998 for Tempe-based America West and the best
quarterly earnings in company history, according to Doug Parker,
executive president. By PETER CORBETT. Story will move in the ``F''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NEW SHOWS-TV (Pasadena, Calif.) - They're at it again. Rarely
mentioning it by name, several syndicated shows that premiere this
fall are doing their dead-level best to pound home a single theme:
We are not ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' Not that they wouldn't kill
for his ratings. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BET-TV (Pasadena, Calif.) - Executives at Black Entertainment
Television don't admit relishing the major networks' lily White new
fall season, but they don't deny trying to take advantage of it to
reach more African-American viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say we're pleased,'' Debra Lee, president of BET,
told a gathering of critics here last week as she announced a slate
of 10 original movies _ all made with Black talent and money _ her
network will broadcast this fall. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story moved
in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAYDEBATE PACKAGE (Phoenix) - For mainline Protestants, the debate
over the acceptance and the roles of gays and lesbians in the
church - from the blessings of same-sex unions to the ordination of
non-celibate gay pastors - is growing increasingly divisive. At the
heart of the debate are six scriptures. The Arizona Republic asked
two nationally known theologians for their interpretations of those
verses - the Rev. Jimmy Creech, the United Methodist minister
acquitted in a church trial over blessing a same sex union, and the
Rev. Kevin Mannoia, the new president of the National Association
of Evangelicals. Package includes GAYSCRIPTURES, CREECHBIO,
MANNOIABIO, CREECH, MANNOIA. Stories moved in the ``L'' category. &QL;

EUROPEAN RIGHTS COURT TAKES ON SENSITIVE CASES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Britain, Turkey, Switzerland, Liechtenstein)   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRASBOURG, France _ Tucked away in an ultramodern building
here, European Court of Human Rights is beginning to take on high
profile cases that are making it more visible to the 800 million
people _ from Iceland to Vladivostok, Russia _ that it is meant to
represent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the court has ruled, in 15 separate cases, that
Turkey denied its citizens the right to free speech and fair trial,
among other violations. Turkey is a member of the Council of
Europe, the 41-nation human rights watchdog whose members have
agreed to abide by the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty requires member nations to guarantee citizens
personal liberty and fair trials, and it bans torture. The tribunal
says it is the only court where an average citizen can file a
complaint against a nation for human rights abuses _ once they have
exhausted the legal avenues in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan, who
was sentenced to death in Turkey, have promised to appeal his case
to this court if it is upheld by the country's Parliament and
president _ to this court.
</P>
<P>
   This promises to be a major test of the revamped tribunal
because Turkey would be required not to execute Ocalan while the
case is under review.
</P>
<P>
   All of this weighs heavily on Luzius Wildhaber, the Swiss jurist
who became the president _ or chief judge _ of the court last
November. ``These first cases will be a model for the court's
future rulings,'' said Wildhaber, 61, of the recent rulings
involving Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   A former law professor in Switzerland with a degree from Yale
Law School who was a judge in tiny Liechtenstein for 13 years,
Wildhaber joined the European human rights court in eight years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal was set up in 1959, but initially cases were
filtered through the European Commission on Human Rights, the
judges often worked part-time, and rulings often took years.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the court was streamlined to cope with a
skyrocketing caseload, which is still growing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the judges _ one from each member nation _ work in screening
panels to decide whether a case falls in the tribunal's
jurisdiction. Nearly 10,000 cases are on file.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cases before the court is one filed by the son of
Italy's last king, who asked the court to rule that Italy had erred
by barring royal heirs from his homeland after it ended the
monarchy in 1946. He filed the case after he was denied permission
to cross Italy's border with an aid shipment for Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal will review Britain's ban on homosexuals in the
military. It has agreed to decide whether two young boys convicted
of the 1993 killing of two-year-old James Bulger in England had a
fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal can impose fines or overturn national legal
decisions, but it has no enforcement powers. ``If a nation has no
intention of complying, the court isn't equipped to Insure that it
does,'' said Lars van Troost, of the Amsterdam office of Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly sensitive for Turkey, which is smarting
under criticism of the Ocalan trial by the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Wildhaber said that, in his view, the court must ``get rid of
nationalistic feelings and decide what is the European standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant balancing,'' he said. ``That's what's so
fascinating about it.''

CLINTON HONORS KENNEDY'S LEGACY IN HONORING ASTRONAUTS, URGING
PASSAGE OF NUCLEAR TREATY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a daylong salute to President Kennedy's
policies, President Clinton on Tuesday marked the 30th anniversary
of the Apollo moon landing, pressed the Senate to pass a
comprehensive test ban treaty and urged lawyers to renew their
commitment to racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated nod to Kennedy timed to coincide with a series of
historic anniversaries also came as the nation mourned the death of
John F. Kennedy Jr., the former president's son, from a weekend
plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   The president held an Oval Office meeting with the three Apollo
11 astronauts _ Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins _
to celebrate the first moon landing in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he appeared in the Rose Garden to call on the
Senate to vote on the treaty banning nuclear weapons testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Kennedy, who set a goal of putting a man on the moon
by the late 1960s, was committed to using technology to unlock the
mysteries of the heaven. But President Kennedy was also concerned
that technology, if misused, literally could destroy life on
Earth,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted Kennedy was the first to negotiate a limited
test ban treaty, barring all but underground testing. But he said
for too long nations have failed to ban all testing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on opponents to the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty to at least allow Senate hearings on the issue. The treaty
has been stymied by conservatives such as Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major nuclear powers, Britain and France, Russia and
China, have signed the treaty. Do we want to walk away from a
treaty under which those countries and scores of others have agreed
not to conduct nuclear tests? I believe it is strongly in our
interest to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 151 nations have signed the treaty and 41 have ratified
it. Pakistan and India, two rivals that exploded nuclear devises
last year, are being pressured to sign the treaty by the United
States and others.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton spoke to a gathering of lawyers from the American
Bar Association in a session patterned after Kennedy's East Room
address to the same group 36 years ago Wednesday. Clinton renewed
Kennedy's call for the lawyers to fight for racial justice at the
height of the civil rights battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Vice President Johnson and Attorney General Robert
Kennedy at his side, the president asked the lawyers there to
remember their duty to uphold justice, especially in places where
the principles of justice had been defied,'' Clinton said. ``I ask
you here today because we need your help as much as ever in our
most enduring challenge as a nation, the challenge of creating one
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on the lawyers not only to renew their commitment
to racial justice issues but also to increase the hiring of
minorities within their own firms.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked them to support the administration's New Market
Initiatives to provide tax incentives to businesses moving to
depresses regions and the administration's education proposals to
hire more than 100,000 classroom teachers, which the Republican
Congress wants to scrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle for one America today is more complex than it was
36 years ago. For then there was the clear enemy of legal
segregation and overt hatred. Today the progress we make in
building one America depends more on whether we can expand
opportunity and deal with a whole range of social challenges,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted that overt discrimination remains. He pointed
to the white supremacist spree killer in Indiana and Illinois, the
dragging death of James Byrd Jr. in Jasper, Texas, and the murder
of gay college student Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's honoring of Kennedy's legacy was planned prior
to the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and her
sister Lauren Bessette. Clinton made no mention of the plane crash
but in previous days spoke at length about the nation's sorrow.

10 HOT PLAYTHINGS FOR COOL POOL FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heat's up, pool's cool, but a kid can swim from one side to the
other only so many times before boredom sets in.
</P>
<P>
   We surveyed the local public pools recently and found most
children finding distraction with the same old standbys _ foam
noodles and power water guns and floating cushions. Not bad, but we
knew it could get better. So we went shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here, our suggestions for the hottest new water toys under the
sun:
</P>
<P>
   1. Dive rings
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, dive sticks ruled the pool for throw-and-go-seek
play. Last month, though, about 19 million of the sinking sticks
were recalled after several children were impaled by the 4- to
8-inch sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative? Dive ``rings,'' weighted plastic loops kids can
seek and find without risk of injury. Most sets have various point
values marked on the individual rings, so you can challenge
competitors by tossing the higher-point rings into the deepest
parts of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Made by several companies, including Aqua Games and Aqua Fun;
$7-$11.
</P>
<P>
   2. Splash Bombs
</P>
<P>
   These inexpensive soft balls are about the size of softballs,
but they behave more like sponges. Let 'em soak up water, and
they'll squish and splash when you throw them. A good choice for
backyard fun _ all you need is a hose or a bucket of cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Primetime Toys International; about $2.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Original Toypedo
</P>
<P>
   This rubbery torpedo toy glides through the water when you throw
it. It can even pick up speed as it moves, and it'll go as far as
40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Toypedo games are also available, including the Toypedo
Pop-A-Ring Target Game. Hit the underwater targets with the
Toypedo, and they'll float to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Swim Ways; $17-$21.
</P>
<P>
   4. Hologram goggles
</P>
<P>
   Create the illusion: Holograms built into these goggles cover
your eyes with piranhas or sharks, flies or skulls or lightning
bolts. Some pairs even give you reptilian eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Speedo; $5-$10.
</P>
<P>
   5. Skip Disk
</P>
<P>
   Throw this spongy Frisbee-type disc to play catch while you're
in the pool. It's designed not to sink but to skip across the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Swim Ways; About $10.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bumper Jumper and Paddle Pumper
</P>
<P>
   Floats are notorious for flipping over and dumping you off. But
not this one. Straddle the upright, ride-designed Bumper Jumper and
you'll stay on, even if you're in the middle of battle. Propel
yourself with the Paddle Pumper, a paddle with a water blaster at
the other end for serious combat.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Short Stack; About $10.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Star Wars: Episode I'' pool floats
</P>
<P>
   A good mix of summer fun and shameless marketing. Float around
with your favorite characters from ``The Phantom Menace:'' the
Jar-Jar two-person ride-in, the Millennium Falcon Island/River
Raft, Anakin's Podracer pool lounger.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Intex; $10-$15.
</P>
<P>
   8. Scuba Scope
</P>
<P>
   The Scuba Scope works like a periscope; you can swim with this
face mask and still see above water.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Short Stack; About $13.
</P>
<P>
   9. Vortex Mega Howler
</P>
<P>
   This foam football's tail makes it spiral in the air, so it can
go farther than other foam footballs, maybe up to 100 yards.
Whistles on the sides make noise as it flies _ hence the name Mega
Howler. Appropriate for play in or out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Oddzon; About $10.
</P>
<P>
   10. Splash Volleyball set
</P>
<P>
   Get a team together and spike an inflatable ball over a floating
net. Kids who've tried it say you need at least four or five people
to really have fun with this one.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Swimline; About $20.

HIGH-TECH STOCKS LEAD SHARP DROP IN PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices declined sharply Tuesday on worries that
conditions couldn't get much better _ and could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff was led by such bellwether technology issues as
Microsoft, Lucent Technologies and IBM _ stocks that have enjoyed
enormous gains so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the market was altitude,'' said Al Goldman,
chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards Inc. ``The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 is up 9 percent in the last eight weeks, and many
technology stocks are up 30 percent to 40 percent. This looked like
very normal profit-taking in a market where high-tech stocks were
due for some blood-letting.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the major market indexes, the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index bore the brunt of the damage. Led by Microsoft,
Cisco Systems and Intel, the Nasdaq suffered the fourth-largest
point decline in its history. It fell 98.11 points, or 3.5 percent,
to 2,732.18. Even with the drop, so far this year the index is
still up 24.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, big point drops in a handful of stocks _ IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, American Express and J.P. Morgan _ contributed
heavily to a 191.55 point decline in the Dow Jones industrial
average. The blue-chip index closed at 10,996.13, down 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, America Online and EMC were heavy losers among the
stocks that comprise the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. The S&AMP;P
fell 30.55 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,377.10.
</P>
<P>
   Even small stocks got hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller-cap companies fell 7.82
points, or 1.7 percent, to 453.55.
</P>
<P>
   While sessions like Tuesday's are unpleasant, they are not
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years, there have been 30 times, including
today, when technology stocks have declined 3 percent or more and
the Dow has dropped by more than 1 percent,'' said Laszlo Birinyi,
who heads his own stock-market research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may think this is the beginning of the end, but it has
happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, there have been four such trading days,
Birinyi added.
</P>
<P>
   Selling began early, and seemed to be tied to strong earnings
reports from Microsoft, Lucent and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and IBM reported strong earnings after Monday's close.
And early Tuesday, Lucent topped Wall Street's expectations with a
45 percent increase in profits. However, all three companies have
seen their stocks go up by more than 25 percent so far this year,
and were ripe for profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   By the close, IBM was down 6 3/8, to 128 1/4. Microsoft fell 5
1/16, to 93 5/16. And Lucent shed 6 57/64, to 69 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at this time, people were sitting with gains that
many would have considered great for a whole year, only to see them
evaporate in a couple of months,'' said Michael Molnar, a managing
director in retail sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney. ``So
there is an inclination to lock in some profits.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, which was up strongly after it tapped a top
Lucent executive as its chief executive, fell 5 5/8, to 110 5/8.
American Express fell 5 3/8, to 133 13/16. And J.P. Morgan dropped
4, to 134.
</P>
<P>
   A few stocks bucked the trend, most notably Genentech Inc. The
biotechnology stock began trading Tuesday after Roche Holding AG
sold 16 percent of the company at an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which was initially priced at 97, soared 30, to 127.
</P>
<P>
   And the selloff did not seem likely to postpone the pricing of a
number of other widely anticipated initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Tuesday bankers at Credit Suisse First Boston were
moving ahead with plans to price 9 million shares of Mp3.com, a Web
site named for a technology to compress music.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, demand for the stock was strong enough for the
underwriting syndicate to raise the target price range to $24 to
$26 from an earlier range of $16 to $18 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, paper and forest products stocks rallied for the
third time in the last five sessions on hopes that earnings will
surge as inventories drop, providing companies the leeway to raise
prices.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper was the best-performing Dow stock Tuesday,
gaining 1 3/16, to 54 1/16. And Fort James gained 1 1/16, to 41
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco International was another winner. The conglomerate gained 2
3/16 to 103 3/8 after it said its earnings rose 75 percent and
announced a two-for-one stock split.
</P>
<P>
   And Qualcomm bucked the trend on the Nasdaq, rising 4 1/4, to
162 15/16. The developer of the world's second-most-popular
cell-phone technology said earnings and revenues surged in its

JUSTICE OFFICIAL, ASIAN-AMERICANS RENEW CONFIRMATION FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Lann Lee, who has served as acting head of the
Justice Department's civil rights division for the past 20 months,
said Tuesday he still wants to be confirmed by the Senate because
it would bolster the clout of his division.
</P>
<P>
   Official Senate approval would help his team of lawyers ``speak
with a louder voice,'' Lee said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's comments came on the eve of the two-year anniversary of
President Clinton's July 21, 1997, nomination of Lee to be the
assistant attorney general in charge of civil rights, the nation's
top civil rights post.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee's nomination stalled in the Senate after some Republican
senators expressed concerns that he would use his position to
advance quotas for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that the Senate wouldn't vote on the
nomination, Clinton in December 1997 appointed Lee to the job on a
acting basis, which allows him to serve through the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-American groups plan rallies Wednesday on Capitol Hill,
and in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City and Salt Lake City
to press for his confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 50, who oversees 270 government lawyers, said Senate
confirmation is ``not important in a personal sense,'' but that he
could do ``a more effective job if I were confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lawyers need to know that the American people support
their work in every way possible,'' Lee said. ``Sometimes our cases
aren't popular. I think it would help the work of the division if
they had a leader who was confirmed by the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of Chinese immigrants, Lee grew up in New York City and
won a scholarship to Yale University and eventually graduated from
Columbia University Law School. He is a former lawyer for the NAACP
Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Clinton met with Lee in the Oval Office along with
civil rights leaders and supporters to underscore his message that
Lee should be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   During his 20-month tenure at the Justice Department, Lee said
he has focused the attention of his staff on combating hate crimes,
fighting housing discrimination and enforcing the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the 1990 landmark civil rights law for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he has been focusing on hate crimes, the acts of
violence against people because of their race, ethnicity or
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come across these heinous hate crimes that spring up,
it reminds us of how you need stronger civil rights,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said his lawyers have successfully settled many housing
discrimination cases. Housing discrimination is still rampant 31
years after the Fair Housing Act was passed, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of problems with minorities, women and
families being able to buy homes and get loans,'' he said. ``These
are some of the most basic elements of the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee also said his department has succeeded in enforcing civil
rights for 40 million disabled Americans, including enforcing laws
requiring public accommodations for the disabled and adequate
multifamily housing.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, who as chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee has the power to block Lee's confirmation, said
Tuesday he had ``serious questions'' as to whether Lee has misused
the law to promote quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is he has misused the law,'' Hatch said. ``There
are indications he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he was reviewing material compiled by Senate
investigators that indicates Lee ``has been using consent decrees
and litigation to impose unjustified quotas under the law'' on
school districts and churches. Hatch added, ``I like the man very
much. I don't feel good about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, in the interview, said he has ``absolutely not'' used the
law to impose quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quotas are wrong,'' Lee said. ``They are divisive and have not
been used by the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Choy, executive director of the National Asian Pacific
American Bar Association, said Lee has been wrongly labeled as a
``quota king'' by critics.
</P>
<P>
   Lee deserves to be confirmed because ``he is more than well
qualified for the job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an ideologue,'' Choy said. ``He's not radically
enforcing civil rights law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's acting status ``feels kind of second-class'' to Asian-
Americans, Choy said. ``The feeling is that the contributions of
Asian-Pacific Americans to this country are not recognized,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Kwok, who chairs the National Council of Asian Pacific
Americans, a coalition of Asian-American organizations, said Lee's
nomination ``has so much significance to the civil rights community
and the Asian-American community (that) we just cannot cave in and
be defeated on this nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel's office,
said it ``remains a concern of the president'' that Lee's
nomination has not been acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly deserves to have the `acting' title removed so he
has the full-fledged position of assistant attorney general for
civil rights,'' Kennedy said. ``It's important to the president and
to many in the country that he be allowed to be confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the Senate's failure to vote on the nomination was
an ``insult to the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To leave somebody in limbo like this is really unfair to (Lee)
and to the people.''

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS LEAD SELLOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US stock market Tuesday experienced its fifth-biggest point
drop this year as anxious investors cashed in their profits,
especially in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen 22 percent
before Tuesday, lost 191.55 points, or 1.71 percent, closing at
10,996.13. The technology-heavy Nasdaq stock index suffered a worse
drubbing: its 98.11-point plunge amounted to a 3.47 percent loss.
That was the Nasdaq's steepest point loss since April 19, when the
index dropped 138.43.
</P>
<P>
   The decline, oddly, came on the heels of better-than-expected
earnings reports at the nation's dominant computer companies,
Microsoft Corp., IBM Corp. and Lucent Technologies. Wall Street
analysts said some investors are grabbing their gains in those
companies, and Internet and other technology stocks, because they
fear such a spectacular performance may not continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an attack on tech,'' said Marshall Acuff, equity
strategist for Salomon Smith Barney, a New York securities firm.
``It's profit-taking. I don't see any more to it than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, for example, reported on Monday that revenues were 29
percent higher in fiscal 1999 than a year ago, but warned sales
growth would slow in 2000. Investors, sensing Microsoft may be
peaking, pulled the stock down 5 1/16 Tuesday to close at 93 5/16.
IBM fell 6 1/4, closing at 128 3/8; Lucent declined 6 57/64,
closing at 69 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology stocks were taken down with them.
Doubleclick, an Internet advertising company, fell 7 3/16, closing
at 87 5/8. Amazon.com, the on-line bookseller, plunged 11 9/16 to
120 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Riley, chief investment officer for BankBoston Corp.,
attributed Tuesday's drop to a combination of ``a little
profit-taking'' and investors' ``anxiety'' about what Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, may say in
testimony Thursday before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The market also remains jittery about the future direction of
interest rates. The Fed on June 30 raised interest rates a quarter
of a percentage point, to 5 percent, but few investors would like
to see further rate hikes, which could bring an economic slowdown.
``They don't know what he (Greenspan) will say,'' Riley said. But,
he added, ``They're worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley noted the exodus was not limited to technology stocks. The
selloff's impact spread to financial stocks, especially banks, and
health care and oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-5 ratio on
the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume came to 926.13
million shares, compared with 789.81 million the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two weeks have seen a loss of momentum,'' said Ralph
Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates. The
disparity between rising and falling stocks marks ``an extreme
warning time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts were less concerned but hardly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get really excited about the market doing a lot
between now and year-end,'' Acuff of Salomon Smith Barney said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the market's steep losses, some new issues thrived.
Genentech, a biotechnology company partially spun off by Swiss
pharmaceutical Roche, was priced at 97 and ended its first day of
trading on the NNSE at 127. The NYSE Composite index fell 11.30 to
647.27, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 11.76
to 805.90.

SIDES IN ULSTER DEBATE ACCEPT MITCHELL AS `FACILITATOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Seeking to breathe new life into the stalled peace
process in Northern Ireland, the British and Irish governments
Tuesday dusted off a tried and trusted American trouble-shooter:
George J. Mitchell, the former US senator from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting for a little more than an hour at 10 Downing St.,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie
Ahern, emerged with Mitchell to say that the former Senate majority
leader will serve as a ``facilitator'' of their review of the
stalemated process.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing with Blair and Ahern at a brief news conference
at Downing Street, Mitchell left to meet with the Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble, who had met earlier in London with Ahern.
Mitchell is scheduled to meet with other parties Wednesday in
Belfast for an initial round of consultations, take the month of
August off, then resume his shuttle diplomacy in Belfast for
another two or three weeks in September.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the governments hope that Mitchell will have worked
some of the same magic he did in chairing the negotiations that led
to the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998. The peace process has
stalled over the implementation of that agreement, with the Ulster
Unionists demanding that the Irish Republican Army begin disarming
before they will sit in government with Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, whose patience and evenhandedness won over the vast
majority of both Protestant unionists and Catholic nationalists in
Northern Ireland, said he hoped that the parties will ``see the
importance of moving this process forward, see the risk of not
doing so, and come together soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the political parties that supported the agreement, the
major risk has already been taken, in that support, and therefore I
believe it's now time to move forward with implementation,'' he
said, demonstrating the same low-key approach and restrained
language that helped bring about compromise in a bitterly divided
society where compromise is often regarded as treason.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell made it clear that he takes the challenge of reviving
the peace process personally. In his recently published book
``Making Peace,'' Mitchell wrote that he dreams of taking his
18-month-old son Andrew to the Northern Ireland Assembly in a few
years to watch debates on ``the ordinary issues of life in a
peaceful democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like and admire the people of Northern Ireland,'' Mitchell
said Tuesday. ``Having been involved there now for more than four
years, I feel more and more like a member of the community. And I
want to do all I can to be helpful to what I now regard my
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mitchell has told the two governments that he has
obligations to his Washington law firm and his wife and young son,
and that his involvement in trying to revive the process cannot be
open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of fruitless negotiations in Belfast, Mitchell
set a deadline, sequestered the parties, and told the politicians
they would have to reach an agreement or explain to the world why
they failed. A former judge, his jurist tactics paid dividends with
the signing of the agreement. But this time he will seek compromise
away from the glare of publicity and the pressure of deadlines that
accompanied Blair's and Ahern's marathon efforts to secure an
agreement this month.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts collapsed in a sea of recrimination and farce last
week when the Ulster Unionists refused to attend the Northern
Ireland Assembly session at which the 10 cabinet posts were to be
filled for the local government, making the process null and void.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is well-versed in the dilemma over what to do with
paramilitary weapons. Before he chaired the negotiations that led
to the Good Friday Agreement, he chaired the commission that
recommended a compromise to get around a similar dispute that
derailed the peace process in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Mitchell recommended that disarming begin at
the same time as negotiations, but the unionists rejected it,
refusing to talk to Sinn Fein unless the IRA disarmed first.
</P>
<P>
   The then-British government, which had promised all-party talks
if the IRA called a cease-fire but needed the unionists to maintain
its slim parliamentary majority, sided with the unionists. Saying
it had been lied to, the IRA ended its cease-fire in February 1996,
but reinstated it after Blair's landslide election victory in May
1997. Mitchell by then had been made chairman of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political vacuum created by the stalled process,
there are no obvious indications that any of the main paramilitary
groups are prepared to end their cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   In calling on Mitchell yet again, Blair and Ahern are hoping
that he can succeed where they failed. Blair acknowledged that his
high-pressure tactics didn't work, but that he took heart from the
public assertions by all the parties that signed the Good Friday
Agreement that it was the only way forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the parties weren't ready last week to do the
agreement, but I think it's obvious in the aftermath that the
parties want to do an agreement,'' Blair said. ``I think the
aftermath has been positive.''

REPORT QUESTIONS METHOD USED TO MONITOR HOSPITAL QUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a regular hospital inspection, the surveyor from the
national accrediting agency spotted potential trouble in a graph
charting staff performance. But when he got no explanation, he
dropped the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In another hospital, a surveyor expressed surprise that nobody
had pulled the medical records he had requested. But he didn't
insist on getting the requested files.
</P>
<P>
   These and other anecdotes illustrate the ``collegial tone'' and
``nonchallenging manner'' that characterize the nation's principal
mechanism for monitoring hospital quality, federal investigators
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system to control quality in hospitals has some serious
flaws that need to be corrected,'' said George Grob, deputy
inspector general in the US Department of Health and Human
Services. ``If a hospital doesn't want you to find a problem, you
won't find it.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-volume report issued Tuesday by Grob's boss, Inspector
General June Gibbs Brown, is a provocative contribution to an
ongoing national debate about ``collegiality'' versus
``regulation'' as the best way to improve the safety of medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   The movement toward collegiality, which has gathered momentum in
the last several years, adopts an educational approach rather than
a punitive one. It encourages hospitals to report serious errors
with the promise that candor won't result in a black mark on their
public image.
</P>
<P>
   The collegial movement has been led by the Joint Commission on
the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, a 48-year-old
private organization deputized by federal statute to certify that
hospitals and other health institutions meet minimum quality
standards for participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report is a harsh indictment of the
Chicago-based Joint Commission, whose board is dominated by
representatives of hospitals and other health-care groups.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report asserts that the Joint Commission
has tilted too far toward a ``gentler'' approach to hospital
quality control. ``The emerging dominance of the collegial mode may
undermine the existing system of patient protection,'' the
inspector general concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Commission's regular surveys, which Grob called
``tightly scripted,'' are ``unlikely to detect substandard patterns
of care or individual practitioners with questionable skills,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   After accompanying Joint Commission officials on hospital
inspectors, federal investigators noted that surveyors allow the
hospitals themselves to select most medical records for inspection,
``tend to be accepting of information and answers provided by
hospital staff,'' and do ``little probing to determine if surface
appearances describe actual practice.''
</P>
<P>
   They criticized the Joint Commission's reliance on scheduled
surveys that permit hospitals to rehearse and prepare for months in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's emphasis on confidentiality of hospital error
reports comes ``at the expense of public accountability,''
investigators said. ``It leaves the general public with minimal
information about how an incident happened and what, if anything,
is being done to prevent more.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the hard-hitting report sparked objections
from the Joint Commission and the American Hospital Association.
But even they acknowledged the merit of some criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Commission supported the report's call for ``an
appropriate mix'' of scheduled and surprise inspections, timely and
effective responses to complaints and adverse events, better
measures of hospital performance, and more focus on patient safety.
The commission also ``affirms the inspector general's call for
public disclosure'' of hospital performance, noting that it already
makes detailed information available to the public by request and
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly opportunities for improvements in the Joint
Commission's accreditation process,'' said Dr. Dennis S. O'Leary,
the organization's president. In fact, he added, the inspector
general's findings agree in part with ``our own internal
self-assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate written response to the report, however, O'Leary
called its criticism of the collegial approach ``unfounded and
unsubstantiated.'' He said all its suggested reforms are either
already in effect or under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The American Hospital Association, in its written response to
the inspector general, sharply disagreed that ``the oversight
pendulum must swing back towards the punitive mode.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary S. Grealey, the Hospital Association's chief legal
counsel, was more muted in her response Tuesday. ``I think the
question is: What is the value of the collegial approach versus the
`gotcha,' policeman approach?'' she said. ``It's a fine balance,
and we need to collaborate on improving things.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observers agreed that both non-punitive and regulatory
approaches need to be part of the effort to improve hospital
patients' safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that health care organizations and
individuals have to be held accountable and we need regulatory
oversight to do that,'' said Dr. Lucien Leape of the Harvard School
of Public Health, perhaps the most prominent advocate nationally of
a non-punitive approach to quality improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's also no question that you don't get safety by
requiring it,'' Leape said. ``You get safety by creating an
environment in which people work individually and collectively
toward it. And you can't do that in an atmosphere of fear and
distrust. If people are punished then they hide and they're fairly
effective at doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leape said the ``right blend'' involves getting tougher with
institutions while making it safe for individual professionals
within hospitals to report and analyze errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how it can be anything other than some sort of
blend,'' agreed Janet Corrigan, who is directing a two-year Quality
of Care in America Project at the National Institute of Medicine.
``Regulatory approaches put some teeth into the system, but we've
got to have a positive culture within institutions that encourages
and rewards quality improvement.''

A NEW FRANK PERETTI BOOK; NEW DELIRIOUS NOT THE OLD DELIRIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
BOOK REVIEW
``The Visitation'' By Frank Peretti Word Publishing, $24.99
(Reviewed by Simon Gonzalez)
<TEXT>
<P>
   A young Methodist woman encounters a being she supposes is an
angel, seemingly in answer to prayer. A custodian at a Catholic
church is miraculously healed of arthritis by tears from a carved
wooden crucifix. A Pentecostal woman sees an image of Jesus in the
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, a young, bearded man with long hair and a
flowing robe appears in the eastern Washington farming town of
Antioch and begins to perform miracles. He doesn't exactly claim to
be Christ, but neither does he deny it.
</P>
<P>
   The stage is set for author Frank Peretti to launch into his
usual gripping tale of angels battling demons, and wars in the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   But then Peretti does the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   He gets subtle.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told through the eyes of burned-out former pastor
Travis Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's on the outside looking in, Jordan takes a
skeptical if not cynical view toward organized religion. Through
his protagonist, Peretti takes shots at mainstream, liberal
Protestants, at the excesses of Pentacostalism, at megachurches, at
Catholicism, at Christian jargon.
</P>
<P>
   Just about anyone who has set foot inside a church in the past
couple of years is likely to be offended at some point. But then,
the truth often hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Jordan must become involved. He sets out to learn
the truth about the visitor and along the way he learns _ and
teaches the rest of us _ what it truly means to be a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the usual Peretti fare, but he's never been better.

   CD REVIEW
``Mezzamorphis'' Delirious Sparrow Records (Reviewed by Simon
Gonzalez)
</P>
<P>
   A fresh, youth-oriented, praise-and-worship band from England
hit these shores late in 1997 with the release of ``Cutting Edge.''
The band was Delirious, and the album was a compilation of songs
they had been singing to Christian youth, songs that were on the
soundtrack of a revival in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years later, a band calling itself by the same name
is back.
</P>
<P>
   The name, though, is about the only thing that remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   Accelerating the trend that started with ``King of Fools,''
their second album, Delirious has morphed from its
praise-and-worship roots to a thoroughly modern rock band.
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily a bad thing. Their goal is to go from
leading worship for youth in the church to evangelizing youth in
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   They just might do it. The album is being released into the
secular market on Virgin Records, and the sound _ aggressive rock
with pop hooks _ should attract an audience. The lyrics could get
that audience thinking about matters of faith.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good thing. It's not good enough, however, to prevent
some of us from lamenting the passing of that praise-and-worship
band.

PLAYWRIGHT HAS THE `ATTITUDE' FOR A MUSICAL
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: diannetucker is cq) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Who said that somber subjects can't be
turned into a musical?
</P>
<P>
   That person hasn't seen a whole slew of musicals on Broadway
recently, from ``Parade'' to ``Side Show.'' And wait until they get
a load of what Dallas playwright diannetucker has cooked up, with
the help of Joe Rogers, for Fort Worth's Jubilee Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The show's title, ``Attitude, Girlfriend, Attitude,'' hints that
it's a musical full of sass and ``go-on-girl!'' snaps. And it is.
</P>
<P>
   But the premise is one not many people would find humor in. And
the only reason diannetucker saw the sunny side is that it really
happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago, I got a call to come to Parkland
Hospital,'' she says. ``A friend of mine had been in a car accident
and hit her head on the windshield. She had a slight case of
amnesia. She was not living in Dallas anymore, so I was surprised
when I got a call from Parkland.''
</P>
<P>
   The story follows the experience to a T. The victim's three
``best friends'' show up and find that not only is she in town
without telling them, but she is with a man who is not her husband.
To make matters worse, that man has a wife who shows up to check on
his less-severe condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people wouldn't have found this funny,'' the playwright
says. ``And it wasn't, but the way (the hospitalized friend)
responded to us was highly comedic.''
</P>
<P>
   Diannetucker is in the middle of an oral five-year contract with
Jubilee. In the past three years, the company has premiered her
plays, ``Hershey With Almonds,'' ``Daddy's Maybe'' and ``Madam
Queen,'' in that order. All are dramas with nice comic touches
thrown in. Like ``Attitude,'' all center on strong female
characters, the hallmark of diannetucker's work. ``Hershey'' is
about a woman who compares men with chocolate, ``Daddy's'' focuses
on a single mother, and ``Madam'' was based on a true story about a
wealthy black woman in the early 20th century who controlled the
lives of everyone around her, including the men.
</P>
<P>
   When Jubilee executive director Rudy Eastman asked diannetucker
if she had a musical in mind, she responded, ``I've always wanted
to write something about this experience I had in a hospital one
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastman hooked her up with frequent Jubilee collaborator and
musician Rogers, whom she had met a few months before, and they put
the idea in motion. ``I have so much admiration for Joe Rogers,''
she says. ``And we worked remotely so well. I could e-mail him
ideas and suggestions and I had so much trust and confidence. I had
no questions with his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a hilarious and touching musical about the power
of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Diannetucker has used her unusually spelled name for 25 years,
since she pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha at then North Texas State
University. (The members were required to sign their names with
lowercase letters, and she found it easier to write it as one
word.) But she has been doing theater her whole life.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Marshall, Texas, where she would put on plays on
her grandmother's front porch. ``On Saturday mornings, all the
neighborhood women would gather and I'd put on a show. And they'd
give me a quarter or something for my effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, she started the Dallas Drama Company, mainly as a forum
to get her own plays produced. ``I thought, I'll do this and
instantly I'll be famous,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The company folded 10 years later, but she didn't fade from the
scene. She has worked with other organizations, such as the Irving
Arts Council, but is best known for her association with Jubilee.
Many of her shows there received extended runs.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not writing, she's leading ``whole-brain thinking''
seminars and workshops on leadership skills, diversity and
creativity. For research in writing, she attends every local
theater production, from equity houses to community theater. ``For
me, it's like a doctoral program, getting exposed to all this
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   For future projects, she's working on a piece called ``Dear
Crooner'' and has long harbored a fantasy for writing something
about Solomon and Sheba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of ideas all the time. Someone might be talking, and
I'm thinking of something else. I have to race for a pencil. You
can't control the muse.''

SHAKE 'EM UP, RANGERS; BRING IN JUNIOR, AROD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Doug Melvin has become predictably boring.
Every time he's asked, which is daily, he echoes there are no trade
possibilities for the Rangers that] even remotely juice his
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Based on all available current information, Melvin speaks the
truth. But what we also seem to have here is a lack of imagination
from the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin obviously needs help in the Stirring-It-Up Dept., which,
of course, is a personal speciality.
</P>
<P>
   Without even being asked, I volunteered my expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Think big, Doug. Knock 'em on their tails with this deal:
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, Ruben Mateo and Royce Clayton go to Seattle for
Junior Griffey, Alex Rodriguez and outfielder-leadoff man Brian
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible? Absolutely not. In fact, it's doable, and it
addresses certain needs and concerns of both clubs, starting with
the financial hole Safeco Field in Seattle dug for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   It has got to be a first _ brand-new ballpark opens and the
tenant finds itself immediately $100 million in the red due to
construction cost overruns. Nice planning.
</P>
<P>
   But this financial brainlock left Mariners' ownership publicly
wondering how it could afford new contracts for Griffey and Alex
after the 2000 season. Plus, the overall direction of the Mariners
had already touched off speculation about those two moving on
anyway after next season. If so, why not Arlington?
</P>
<P>
   You already know the baseball resume of a Gonzalez, a Junior and
an Alex. You already know what's expected from Mateo. Like the
Seattle twosome, Juan's contract is up after next season. Juan and
Junior will both turn 30 in the fall, meaning prime years are still
ahead. Rodriguez turns 24 next week.
</P>
<P>
   Juan would give the Mariners one big contract to deal with
instead of two. Mateo would mean several seasons of low pay due to
his rookie status. For the Rangers, there would be close to a
contract wash between what Juan will have coming, and what either
Junior or Alex will eventually be paid.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Mariners don't think they can handle the new Gonzalez
contract, how about Rusty Greer, Jeff Zimmerman, Mateo and Clayton
for Griffey, Alex and Hunter. That's even a cheaper financial
option for the Seattles, along with filling critical baseball
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a Rangers' lineup in August with Hunter leading off,
Alex hitting second, Griffey third, Juan fourth, Rafael Palmeiro
fifth, Pudge Rodriguez sixth, Lee Stevens seventh, Todd Zeile in
the eight hole and Mark McLemore ninth. Who needs pitching, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   I ran all this past Melvin yesterday. I'm not sure if he liked
it or not. He said he'd get back to me in a couple of days, once he
stopped laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates wouldn't like the deal, particularly if he has
heard the rumor on Junior Griffey. The one about any free-agent
deal on him for 2001 has to include the stipulation his father, Ken
Sr., would manage the team.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are a few problems attached. If Kevin Brown is
worth $15 million a year, which he's not, Junior Griffey is looking
at a new contract averaging $20 million. And the dreaded Scott
Boras, agent for Alex, is already talking about $20 million for his
man.
</P>
<P>
   Just how deep are Tom Hicks' hip pockets?
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Gonzalez contract with the Rangers includes 10 teams
where he won't accept a trade, but Melvin wasn't saying yesterday
if Seattle was included.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you also noticed there are no pitchers involved for the
Rangers. Seattle, of course, has none of value, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For pitching help, Melvin's only out is either from the minors
or more likely, the free-agent market in the winter. Free-agent
acquisitions for the rotation were already a Rangers objective _
make that the main objective. Seattle has gone nowhere in several
seasons, even with Griffey and Rodriguez. No pitching.
</P>
<P>
   But to add Junior and Alex, plus free-agent pitchers, the
payroll for Hicks goes to ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I can't count that high.
</P>
<P>
   But we are talking here about excited butts cramming ballpark
seats in Arlington. And thus far this summer, I don't know what has
been more low-profile _ the yawns about the opening of Cowboys'
training camp or the Rangers being in first place.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, however, maybe Doug Melvin needed a good laugh
on an otherwise slow day at the office.

SCRAMBLE IS ON TO COME OUT ON TOP IN TAX CUT ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's leaders appear to face the happiest of
conundrums: What to do with a projected $3 trillion windfall over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But they are entangled in a tug-of-war over using the whopping
surplus for tax cuts in ways that could define the guiding
principles of their parties, determine the outcomes of federal
elections for years to come, and help shape President Clinton's
place in history.
</P>
<P>
   With the House poised to vote Wednesday on a Republican plan for
the largest tax cuts in nearly a generation, Clinton and
congressional leaders are scrambling for the political high ground
over an issue that could affect every voter's personal finances.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, GOP leaders in the House and Senate are
struggling to stave off revolts by moderate Republicans that could
doom their plans for massive, across-the-board tax cuts. Both the
House and Senate Republican plans would reduce taxes by $792
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But a band of GOP moderates in the House Tuesday proposed a $514
billion tax cut over the same period, a crucial threat to the
Republican leadership because of the GOP's fragile six-vote
majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, calling the larger Republican measure fiscally
reckless, announced opposition to any tax cut greater than $300
billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't one where you just split the difference,'' said the
White House spokesman, Joseph Lockhart. ``There is a fundamental
economic policy debate that we're engaged in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the unified Democrats in Congress argue that the
surplus should be targeted at shoring up Social Security and
Medicare as well as providing tax cuts. Democrats raised the
possibility of an exorbitant tax cut leading to the kind of
recession that occurred after Congress, at President Ronald
Reagan's urging, cut taxes by $749 billion in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican tax plan threatens to reverse the robust
economic growth and fiscal responsibility of the last seven years
and replay a re-run of the 1980s-style voodoo economics,'' said the
House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the tax cuts are necessary to prevent
Washington politicians from using the surplus to expand the federal
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate is about downsizing the power of Washington,''
said the chief architect of the GOP plan, Representative Bill
Archer of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plans, all income-tax rates would be
reduced by 10 percent over 10 years. Capital-gains taxes would drop
for individuals and businesses. Estate and gift taxes would be
gradually abolished.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to expanding tax credits for education, health and
retirement purposes, the GOP measure would ease the so-called
``marriage penalty'' by raising the standard deduction for couples
who jointly file their income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders, in midday news conferences Tuesday,
tried to persuade their renegade moderate colleagues to abandon
their revolt by predicting the $792 billion plan would be approved
Wednesday. ``We will have the votes by the time we vote,'' said the
House majority leader, Richard K. Armey.
</P>
<P>
   But the moderates, led by Represetantive Michael N. Castle of
Delaware, pressed for the smaller package, which would primarily
target middle- and lower-income families for tax reductions. Castle
described the plan as ``a responsible and reasonable approach
towards handling our nation's good fortunes.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers held a news
conference on Capitol Hill to press a $295 billion Democratic
alternative that is also aimed at reducing taxes for middle- and
lower-income families. Summers warned that the Republican plan
could undo the current economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax cuts that have been put on the table represent a
reversal of course,'' Summers said. ``Confidence is crucial. It is
time for us to make the right and prudent decision.''
</P>
<P>
   With prospects for the House plan growing increasingly
questionable by late afternoon, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert addressed
a closed-door meeting of Republican members and appealed for unity.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from certain whether Hastert and his leadership
team would prevail. And the possibility loomed that GOP leaders
could postpone the debate if they are unable to ensure victory for
the $792 billion plan.

CHICKEN DROPPINGS, TACKLE BOXES AND TAX LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Md., Va., Texas, Ill., Alaska)  (With TAX-CONGRESS) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Buried deep in the giant tax-cut bill the Senate
Finance Committee began debating Tuesday is fine print that could
turn chicken droppings into a tax shelter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives
is planning to vote on Wednesday on a companion bill that includes
a section removing the excise tax on fishing-tackle boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other tax bills before Congress in recent years, the
measures in the Senate and House this year contain dozens of narrow
provisions like these benefiting one particular interest or another
_ or, to put it another way, benefiting one particular constituent
or another of an important senator or representative.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the chicken droppings, the important lawmaker is
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee. The
nugget he inserted in the Senate bill would give tax credits to
companies that convert waste swept from the floor of chicken coops
into electricity.
</P>
<P>
   This has long been a dream on the Delmarva Peninsula _ Delaware
and the eastern shore of Maryland and Virginia _ where chicken
farming is the largest agricultural enterprise and where producers
like Perdue Farms and Tyson Foods have big factories and thousands
of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, chicken manure is used for fertilizer. But this has
become a major source of pollution, and all three states have new
laws that will eventually ban this source of fertilizer. So the
question, said Bill Satterfield, executive director of Delmarva
Poultry Industry Inc., a trade association, is becoming how to
dispose of the 800 tons of chicken droppings produced on the
penninsula every year.
</P>
<P>
   The technology has long existed for producing electricity by
burning chicken manure. The problem is, it has never seemed
profitable. So it has never been tried in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A tax credit might help in this regard. But the chicken farmers
and producers on the Delmarva Penninsula should not get their hopes
up.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, is not wild about the measure, staff assistants said,
and will probably fight it in the conference committee to resolve
differences between the Senate and House tax bills. The reason: The
tax credit could put chicken droppings in competition with oil and
gas as a source of energy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Archer, whose district is in Houston, put into the
House bill several tax breaks for his constituents in the petroleum
industry. One, for example, allows more favorable tax treatment for
income from foreign oil and gas. Another allows new writeoffs for
wells that are marginally productive.
</P>
<P>
   The tackle box provision in the House bill approved last week by
the Ways and Means Committee owes its existence to Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert. One of the largest manufacturers of tackle boxes in
the country, Plano Molding Co. of Plano, Ill., is in Hastert's
district.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the president of the company, Pete Henning, has been
coming to Washington trying to persuade lawmakers to repeal the 10
percent excise tax on tackle boxes. He even hired a lobbyist,
George Mannina.
</P>
<P>
   But Henning and Mannina had no success until this year, when
Hastert became speaker.
</P>
<P>
   This is their argument: A 1984 law placed a 10 percent federal
tax on fishing equipment. The money goes into the Sport Fishing
Account of the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund and is returned to the
states to pay for hatcheries, water-safety measures and other
sport-fishing activities. The program is popular among fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   Plano Molding's problem is that the plastic tackle boxes it
makes are indistinguishable from containers made by other
manufacturers that are called tool boxes or sewing boxes and are
not subject to the tax. Side by side on the shelf of Walmart,
Plano's boxes are more expensive, and the company believes that is
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   This argument may not carry in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hastert's influence, Rep. Gerald Weller, R-Ill.,
who comes from an adjacent district and who has many constituents
who work for Henning, is a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Mannina said he had not been able to get a comparable
provision in the Senate bill. The Finance Committee has no members
from Illinois, and no one on the panel, Mannina said, was prepared
to take on the cause of Plano Molding.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been because they were too busy taking care of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, was able to get
several tax breaks for his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   One would exempt Alaskans from the requirement that dye be put
in diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, all other distributors of diesel fuel must
dye it to distinguish it from home heating oil, which is otherwise
the same product. Diesel fuel is taxed as a motor fuel, and heating
oil is not.
</P>
<P>
   Alaskans argue that it is impractical for remote villages in
Alaska to have two storage tanks, one with diesel fuel and the
other with heating oil. But without the dye, collecting the proper
tax on diesel fuel would be problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Another Murkowski measure would allow Eskimo whaling captains to
claim charitable deductions of up to $7,500 to offset the cost of
whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is that the captains pick up the costs for people
in their villages to go on whale hunts that are allowed under
international whaling agreements. They then divide the whale meat,
called muktuk, among the villagers, who rely on it for subsistence.
Since the captains give the muktuk away, the argument goes, it
should be treated no differently from any other charitable
donation.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure was passed by the Senate in 1994 but died in
the House. Environmentalists maintained that it would encourage
more whaling.

NCAA proposals don't include making freshmen ineligibile 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An NCAA special committee yesterday announced ``practically
idealistic'' reforms for college basketball. Making freshmen men's
basketball players ineligible was not one of its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Formed a year ago, the NCAA Division I Working Group to Study
Basketball Issues met seven times. The results of those meetings
was distilled in 3 1/2 pages of recommendations that dealt with
three topics: the educational experience, recruiting and the
sport's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were able to do was come up with a package \Rof
recommendations\S that will work,'' said Syracuse chancellor
Kenneth Shaw, chairman of the committee. ``This committee was
charged with examining the issues that have a significant impact on
Division I basketball. What it produced has a great deal of
merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, the committee made it known it was considering a
proposal to make freshmen men's basketball players ineligible. NCAA
president Cedric Dempsey yesterday likened the leak to ``running it
up the flag pole.'' The committee could not come to a consensus on
that contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong core of support for \Rfreshmen
ineligibility\S,'' Shaw said. ``But there isn't enough support to
make it become legislation. As a group, we had to temper some of
those enthusiasts and become practical idealists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposals will greatly strengthen the academic
environment.'' Among the committee's proposals:
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging men's and women's basketball players to attend
summer school before their freshmen seasons. The players would
receive financial aid for summer school, and the course work would
be acceptable toward a degree.
</P>
<P>
   Schools' scholarship awards would be based on how they graduate
players and the academic progress of players who leave the program
early. Schools with a 75 percent graduation rate would receive 14
scholarships, one above the current maximum. Schools with
graduation rates below 32 percent would lose a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also made recommendations regarding recruiting, in
particular the summer variety. A common complaint of coaches is
that nonacademic people are involved with the summer camps and
tournaments that showcase players.
</P>
<P>
   To help eliminate that problem, the committee recommended that
10 recruiting days be shifted from the summer to the academic-year
evaluation period and that summer camps and tournaments be
certified, with particular attention paid to financial disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered eliminating summer recruiting entirely,'' Shaw
said. ``The dominant view was that we can reduce the summer-camp
influence in the ways we've recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   In other recommendations, the committee proposed:
</P>
<P>
   The start of the regular season be delayed until the Friday
after Thanksgiving, with practice starting 34 days before that
date. If approved, this would take effect for the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Establish a Division I Basketball Issues committee to continue
the effort of the Working Group. The committee would report
directly to the Men's and Women's Basketball Committees.
</P>
<P>
   Stiffer penalties for players who gamble, including the
permanent loss of all collegiate eligibility for any
student-athlete who attempts to fix the outcome of a game.

AUTHORITIES SEEK MOTIVE AFTER TEENS SUSPECTED OF KILLING COUPLE
FOUND DEAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Authorities were still trying to determine
Tuesday what prompted a 16-year-old boy and his 13-year-old buddy
to apparently kill the older teens' parents, then drive to a remote
area where they both either committed suicide or died in a
murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Mark Miller, 49, and his wife, Linda ``Katy''
Miller, 42, were found Sunday in the Miller's home in southeast
Austin, near the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the bodies of the Millers' 16-year-old son, Shawn,
and their 13-year-old next-door neighbor, Gerald Davis, were
discovered about 50 miles away in neighboring Bastrop County. Both
apparently had been dead since some time Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we have seen is that perhaps we had a situation
of obviously a troubled young man in Shawn Miller,'' said Travis
County Sheriff Margo Frasier. ``Nothing that we have uncovered
would justify or lead to this kind of action.''
</P>
<P>
   Frasier said authorities do not know whether Shawn Miller killed
Davis and then himself or whether both boys committed suicide, but
they believe Davis was shot first.
</P>
<P>
   The Travis County Medical Examiner's office also had not issued
a ruling on the manner of deaths by Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys suffered close-range gunshot wounds to the head. A
.410-gauge shotgun was found on Miller's body and is consistent
with one of the weapons used in murders of Miller's parents, said
Frasier.
</P>
<P>
   A note found on Shawn Miller's body expressed remorse, but
Frasier declined to disclose what it said. She said authorities
have not verified that Shawn wrote the note and don't know whether
both teen-agers were involved in the slaying of Miller's parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to suspect that anyone else was involved''
in the elder Millers' slayings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the elder Millers were killed Sunday morning
after returning home from church. The parents died of multiple
gunshot wounds from a .410 shotgun and a .22-caliber firearm. Mark
Miller was shot in the back and his wife in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Frasier said the boys then took the Miller family's 1989 Volvo
station wagon. It was later found stuck along a rural road in
Bastrop County. Inside were Mrs. Miller's purse, some coins and a
backpack similar to those a lot of teen-agers carry, Frasier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is (the boys) didn't know where they were
going or what they were going to do,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Frasier said authorities are trying to determine where the boys
got the shotgun found on Shawn Miller, although ``it's a pretty
common type gun that people might keep in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Frasier also said neither of the boys had been in trouble with
law enforcement, but that Shawn Miller ``was not the best at
socializing.'' However, he had no history of psychological or
psychiatric treatment, she said.

   Home Wireless Networks seeks to offer next stage of technology
</P>
<P>
   By Ernest Holsendolph
</P>
<P>
   c, 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the hottest areas of communications going into
the next millennium lies within the modest environs of the house _
wireless home networks.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless networks that link home computers, telephones, printers
and fax machines are leading the way in making computers and other
devices within the house work better together and more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of the experts, home networks could become one of
the next gold rushes in technology, all based on a new level of
residential convenience that could prove infectious.
</P>
<P>
   And a hometown company _ Norcross, Ga.-based Home Wireless
Networks _ might become the star of that play.
</P>
<P>
   Home Wireless Networks, in business since 1996, is poised to be
one of the leaders in this service.
</P>
<P>
   Already allied with Lucent Technologies, one of the HWN
investors, Home Wireless' equipment is now being tested by
BellSouth and other regional phone companies for compatibility with
the phone network. If they like it, the phone companies could
decide to market the technology along with their phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   An integral part of the HWN effort is Lucent Technologies, an
early investor in the technology, which stands ready to add its
market muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent already supplies many kinds of equipment to phone
companies, such as its own wired home systems, and already has the
big name, the sales force and the ear of distributors to get the
merchandise moving. If the phone companies give the green light for
accepting home wireless systems, Lucent will be able to add that
equipment to its sales inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we mostly deal in wired systems now, which are being
installed in new subdivisions, the wireless systems will certainly
be important for existing houses and for people who prefer that
system for its flexibility,'' said Jim Messenger, a spokesman for
Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   By adding wireless networks to its catalog of items, Lucent will
be able to cover the market better, he said. The market for
communications equipment for the home is huge. Forrester Research,
which examines many technology issues, says that the home market
amounted to more than $22 billion in 1998 and has plenty of
potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the major phone companies, in their competition with
cable companies and other communications purveyors, will benefit
from carrying systems that make dependable phone lines more
productive.
</P>
<P>
   What home wireless networks do is extend the use of a phone line
dramatically by allowing several computers to get on the Internet
through one line or to use a single printer. Therefore, for
example, instead of using two cheap printers, one for each
computer, wireless interconnection gives the option of buying a
quality printer with access to several computers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the way it works: A base unit, much like the base unit of
a portable phone, is attached to the phone wire where it enters the
house. This unit can send signals with information from the
telephone wire to facsimile machines or from the Internet to
computers and also send fax and data from computers out over the
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The system can also be set up to allow computers to exchange
information within the house, such as swap computer files, or share
a computer game that would be available for several people to play
at once.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that new broadband access, such as cable modems or
DSL (digital subscriber line) technology from the phone company,
means that even more goodies can be brought into the house to be
shared over a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   The technology used by HWN was put together by two friends,
Stuckey McIntosh and Richard Snelling, back in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They adapted it from Digital Wireless Corp., a company that
specialized in cordless phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh, the idea man, became the initial chief executive,
supported by Snelling, a veteran phone industry man from BellSouth.
A bit later, he came aboard to be the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company has just begun to make shipments to smaller vendors
and independent phone companies who have signed contracts to be
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   An average home wireless system by HWN costs about $620, but
more elaborate systems to handle up to five phone lines, go for
$1,100.
</P>
<P>
   HWN is not alone in introducing home wireless-type technology.
</P>
<P>
   Others moving into the field from different market directions
include Tut Systems in Pleasant Hill, Calif., and Epigram in
Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, none of these companies stands to suffer much from
competition because the task at hand is to get this new technology
in front of the public and its market, and the more salesmen the
better,'' said Boyd Peterson of the Boston-based Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   Snelling, one of the home wireless founders, retired as
executive vice president of BellSouth in 1991, after 35 years in
the Bell system. He said the phone company was always searching for
``a sophisticated home gateway'' to the phone network. In many
ways, home wireless fits that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this is a wireless system makes it all the
better,'' said Snelling. ``The rising importance of the Internet as
a source of information makes home networking a convenience people
will want, and the wireless system a product for our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Snelling said he has been a student of home communications
technology ever since he observed the videotext trials conducted
years ago by Knight-Ridder, the media company.
</P>
<P>
   From Home Wireless' perspective, no city is a better home base
for launch than Atlanta, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the marketing tricks is to sell this technology to the
early adopters, the people who like to be seen with the latest Palm
Pilot and other devices,'' he said, ``and I think in that regard
Atlanta, with its growth and vitality, is an excellent place to
launch this new wireless communication.''
</P>
<P>
   And a successful launch could be the start of something really
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market will move very, very quickly, for all the existing
players and more, once the word gets out,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing is really the key,'' said Barbara Stafford, whose
job is to handle residential and business marketing for Home
Wireless Networks. ``We will be really dependent on the phone
companies to assist in the marketing and the distribution of the
wireless systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the phone companies have taken the first
step. BellSouth and the other regional phone companies, notorious
for taking a long time to clear a new technology, have at least
accepted the Home Wireless products for the extended laboratory
testing that could lead to the
</P>
<P>
   phone companies adopting it for sale and promotion to phone
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although BellSouth reserved comment until the tests are
complete, Debbie Locker, a spokeswoman for consumer services at
BellSouth, said, ``We welcome any equipment that can make our
consumers' lives better and that can help the home function as an
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, commercial and business users may lead the way to
popular acceptance of the new technology, much as they did with
wireless phones. In one of the commercial applications of the
technology, teams of consultants and contract employees will be
able show up at the office of a new client with their own
communications system. For instance, a consultant team could get
use of one phone line in the client's office, patch it into a base
unit and create a wireless network for use exclusively by the
visitors while they are there, then dismantle it when their project
is completed.
</P>
<P>
   As was true with early cellular communications, the new
technology in the hands of actual users will spawn new, real world
ideas for its use. And once the convenience is recognized and
becomes a habit, the technology will take off, driving down prices
amid competition, and then spurring still wider popularity and
accessibility.

<P>
   MIAMI _ They used to be called rafters, after the rickety crafts
of plywood, inner tubes and empty oil drums they launched from the
beaches of Cuba, praying that the homemade boats would hold
together long enough to cross the treacherous Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   They struggled ashore in the Florida Keys, at Palm Beach and on
barrier islands in-between, burned by the sun, half-starved,
dehydrated, telling stories of circling sharks and of loved ones
who vanished when their crafts came apart in the waves. In Miami,
there are monuments to the ones who disappeared, their rafts
washing ashore, empty.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Ray Dieppa, piled into fishing boats crowded with
sick, terrified people and sobbing children, and pushed off into
uncertainty. He remembers gazing into the pitch-black night, almost
20 years ago, and wondering if he would ever see the United States.
``I am against the communist regime,'' he said, when asked why he
made that passage.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been that simple for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   In the heaviest exodus since Fidel Castro turned his back and
allowed 33,000 people to exit the island in 1994, more than 1,500
Cubans have made it ashore in South Florida so far this year. But
increasingly, say U.S. Coast Guard officials, the Cubans are making
their passage not on rafts or in fishing vessels but in the boats
of smugglers, who bring them in close enough to swim ashore or
launch a small dinghy. The cost: as much as $8,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than 1,000 Cubans have been stopped at sea and
forced to return to the island in compliance with the so called
``wet-foot, dry-foot'' policy that was put in place by President
Clinton after the 1994 exodus. That policy allows those Cubans who
make it to shore to apply, ultimately, for asylum, but sends those
caught at sea back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, part of an agreement with Castro to halt the 1994
exodus, has led to high drama at sea and on the beaches of South
Florida, as Cubans try almost anything, including threatened
self-immolation and suicide, to hold off the Coast Guard long
enough to put at least a foot on dry sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an incident a month ago in which a woman threatened to
drown her baby if the Coast Gurd crew members came closer,'' said
Glenn Rosenholm, assistant district public affairs officer for the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not normal, not usual,'' he said. ``These are very,
very volatile situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Cuba has become increasingly difficult, say recent
arrivals, so people are ever more desperate to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Martinez, 34, was one of the lucky ones. He reluctantly
conceded that he was smuggled into South Florida in October with
six others, for a per-head price of $8,000 each. But, he does not
apologize for doing anything that he could to leave Cuba. ``We
lived like rats,'' he said of his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   He and his relatives lived in a deteriorating house, without
running water, in a neighborhood where informants turned in people
who spoke against the government, and sometimes even those who did
not, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back'' to life there, ``and I feel like crying,'' said
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder, say he and Cuban Americans here, that people
will do almost anything to leave and cannot meekly accept being
sent back, especially when they are in sight of land.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, confrontations between the Coast Guard,
which stopped 1,047 Cubans in 1998, and the people they interdict _
now more often referred to by the more generic term, ``migrants'' _
have turned ugly and sometimes violent.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a Cuban doused himself, his boat and others in it with
gasoline and threatened to set them all on fire, if the Coast Guard
did not let him continue to shore. Earlier this month, another man
threatened to hurl himself into the propellers of a Coast Guard
cutter.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, two groups of migrants have jumped into
the water, some miles from shore, instead of giving up to the Coast
Guard. On Friday, several men jumped into the water off Islamorada
in the Florida Keys, saying they would rather drown than be sent
back. They had to be rescued by members of the Coast Guard, who
jumped in after them.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a Cuban woman drowned after the small boat she
was on was struck by a Coast Guard boat. That happened after a
Cuban man used a machete to break a tow-line, as others on the boat
waved machetes at Coast Guard sailors, said Rosenholm. When Coast
Guard sailors threw life jackets to people on the boat, some of the
Cubans threw them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they have to make it to land,'' said Cheryl Little,
executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center. ``When
they're getting this close, they're desperate. We can expect
desperate people to do desperate things.''
</P>
<P>
   In just one day recently, 56 Cubans made it safely ashore, some
posing for photographs in front of art deco hotels before going off
to what has been _ more often than not _ a temporary detention with
U.S. immigration. In the same 24-hour period, 24 Cubans were
interdicted and sent home, some in sight of land.
</P>
<P>
   The most publicized landfall came June 29 just off Surfside,
north of Miami Beach, when six Cubans aboard a small boat were
blasted by a Coast Guard water cannon as a news helicopter
thundered overhead, broadcasting live footage of the drama to Miami
television stations, which interrupted afternoon soap operas with
the story.
</P>
<P>
   As the men tried to swim the 200 yards to shore, members of the
Coast Guard shot pepper spray into their faces and hundreds
gathered on the beach, cheering the swimmers on. Two made it
ashore, one of them darting and feinting between police before
diving, as if across a goal line, onto the sand.
</P>
<P>
   A demonstration blocked off a main causeway from Miami to Miami
Beach, and more than 1,000 demonstrators marched on the adjacent
Coast Guard office, chanting ``Assassins.'' As traffic jammed,
Coast Guard officials relented, allowing the other four to come
ashore and seek political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a day later, they were released from immigration
custody and were on the streets of Miami, being feted. On
Independence Day, they shared a seafood dinner with Mayor Joe
Carollo of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   As they were being greeted as heroes against communism, the U.S.
Border Patrol questioned why the men, who said they had rowed all
the way from Cuba on a 14-foot boat, had shown no signs of
dehydration or exposure, and their hands had no splinters or
calluses.
</P>

<P>
   Less than a week later, a Miami artist fashioned a sculpture of
a man diving for the sand and freedom as two police closed in, and
it was erected on the site of that real-life confrontation. A
beach-goer later knocked it over, cracking it.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``People are more sympathetic to the Cubans that arrive by
themselves, struggling with a raft, than Cubans who arrive with a
suntan and well-fed,'' said Jaime Suchlicki, director of the
Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American studies at the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not a major issue in a Cuban American-dominated
Miami, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some _ including a Cuban doctor who recently made it to Florida
grimy and exhausted _ are still coming the old-fashioned way, on
their own boats. But while the ones who pay smugglers to deliver
them are not accorded quite the same hero status, there is little
condemnation of them in the Cuban community, where the hatred of
Castro colors everything.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, immigration officials say, the one-time rafters who
came here years ago are largely financing the new wave of migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Freyre, executive director of the Miami office of the
Cuban Committee for Democracy, said that Cuban-Americans in Miami
are largerly footing the bill for this new migration, paying the
smugglers to bring their relatives in from Cuba. Most of the
smugglers themselves are probably of Cuban descent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And while many Cuban Americans may still refer to them as
balseros _ rafters _ they sometimes do so with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dieppa said it is wrong for the smugglers to make money off that
suffering, but he, like many others here, will accept what they see
as a lesser evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my family could afford it, I would want them to try,'' said
Dieppa, now an editor at a South Florida television station, who
still has family in Cuba. ``Five members of my family live in a
small house infested with flies and bugs. My mother raises a pig,
and she has to bring him in the house and let him stay in the
bathroom sometimes so no one will steal him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because smugglers are bringing them in, it is no guarantee
of a safe trip, said Martinez, who would not speak specifically
about his own journey, saying only that ``we were taking the
biggest risks of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   While some here in Miami wonder if the steady trickle of Cubans
is a sign of another exodus like in 1994, experts on Cuban
immigration say they doubt if it will get that large.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will die,'' said Suchlicki. ``I don't think it's a
permanent situation. It has to do with the toughening political
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The present exodus is not tied to the worsening Cuban economy
alone, say experts on Cuba, but is also attributed to a general
feeling that small freedoms won after Pope John Paul's visit to the
island last year have been taken away. Small business, vendors and
even prostitutes have been forced to close up shop, and every boat
load of refugees brings another story of increasing punishment and
the tightening government control.
</P>
<P>
   Another mass exodus can only come with Castro's blessing, said
Steve Schnably, professor of International Law at the University of
Miami. ``If he makes it clear at anytime that people can just leave
the island, then you will have an exodus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba has already moved to quash the exodus, according to the
state-controlled newspaper, Granma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every desire to leave the country by safe and legal means will
be permitted,'' read an editorial in the newspaper. ``Attempts by
illegal means will categorically not be allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Experts on immigration say the U.S. policy almost guarantees
future altercations at sea, not only with the Cubans but with
Haitians who, in smaller numbers, are also trying to make the
passage. The economy in Haiti is in shambles, and people there are,
if anything, worse off than the Cubans, said Haitian advocates.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cuban advocates in Miami, the once white-hot reaction to
the Coast Guard's actions has cooled over the past few weeks. ``The
Coast Guard is trapped in a difficult situation,'' said Ramon Saul
Sanchez, a delegate with Movimiento Democracia in Miami, an
anti-Castro protest group.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the politics of applying migration laws have to
be revised to become more humane.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Miami, all the blame for most things sad and Cuban
ultimately ends up at Castro's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   As long as he is Cuba's dictator, said Ninoska Perez, a
spokeswoman for the Cuban American National Foundation, the rafters
will keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dictator of 40 years,'' she said, ``does not change.''

<P>
   Jetblue plans to offer its passengers live satellite television
programming, a feature that analysts say could revolutionize
in-flight entertainment throughout the aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
   The new discount airline, which is scheduled to begin flying out
of New York's Kennedy International Airport early next year to
as-yet unspecified destinations, will use special antennas on each
of its Airbus A320 aircraft that was developed by Live TV, a joint
venture between the Harris Corp. and Sextant In-flight Systems. The
antennas will receive programming from three satellites that
broadcast the satellite television service offered in the
continental United States by DirecTV, a unit of Hughes Electronics,
which is itself owned by General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Five-inch, high-resolution television screens will be installed
on the back of each Jetblue A320 seat, while armrests will be
equipped with plugs for headsets as well as volume and channel
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Anderson, Jetblue's director of aircraft programs, said the
carrier will offer 24 channels of live programming from DirecTV,
plus one channel that will track the plane's route and another that
will be used for promotional purposes. With the exception of the
safety briefing, all programs will be available from the minute a
passenger sits down until the plane arrives at its destination
gate.
</P>
<P>
   No decisions have been made yet about what channels Jetblue will
offer; by Federal law, DirecTV can only broadcast cable, not
network, television programming in flight. Anderson also said
Jetblue would not censor programming. For example, if a plane crash
occurs, Jetblue will not suspend news programs about it.
Commercials also will be the same as they are on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Jetblue will charge $3 to $5 for its TV service, depending on
the length of the flight; payment will be by credit card swipe.
</P>
<P>
   Jetblue will be among the first carriers to feature live
satellite television programming. Delta Air Lines used DirecTV on
one flight in October 1996 to broadcast the fourth game of the
World Series between the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees. John
Kennedy, a Delta spokesman, said the airline had no plans to
reintroduce this service. DirecTV also has been selling its service
to private jet owners since last year.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Jetblue's new system would give travelers more
choice in and greater control over entertainment options than they
now have. He also said the system occupied less room in an aircraft
cabin than others, freeing up space both in overhead bins and
beneath seats.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Latta, Live TV's vice president of operations and
corporate development, said his company had signed an agreement
with a second U.S. airline, which he declined to identify, to also
offer 24 channels of programming from DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Wiseman, publisher of Airfax, a Seattle-based newsletter
on in-flight entertainment, suggested Jetblue's service would serve
as a test case for the airline industry for live in-flight TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works in the U.S., you might see it go on international
routings when international satellite systems are put up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted air travelers who track stocks on television
would eventually be able to call from their flight to make a trade.
(Jetblue will not offer in-flight telephone service.) And he said
they even would be able to conduct such transactions on line once
planes are equipped, also by satellite, with e-mail and Internet
capabilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Service to Italy
</P>
<P>
   Air Europe, which is based in Milan, Italy, and headed by a
member of the Agnelli family that is 49.9 percent owned by SAir
Group, the parent of Swissair, will begin service on the
Pisa-Venice-New York (Kennedy International Airport) route on July
26. Flights, which will operate every day but Wednesday, will serve
fresh pasta, espresso, Italian pastries and ice cream in both
economy and business class. The carrier is offering an introductory
round-trip economy-class fare of $425 through Sept. 30. There are
restrictions, including an overnight Saturday stay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book for What Can Ail You
</P>
<P>
   Cadogan Books has published the second edition of ``Bugs, Bites
and Bowels,'' a medical guide for travelers by Dr. Jane
Wilson-Howarth, an expedition doctor and parasitologist. It covers
everything from food-related illnesses to skin infections to motion
sickness, and contains charts on tropical diseases and data on
immunizations. Distributed in the United States by Globe Pequot
Press, it costs $9.95.

SANTA BARBARA AS THE DOWN-HOME NAPA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Food &AMP; Wine's  &UR; Merrill Shindler &LR;  claims that Santa Barbara
County is the up-and-coming, down-and-dirty version of the Napa
Valley, at least when it comes to winemaking. The implication is
that the Napa Valley has become something of a wine Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napa has a lot invested in buildings, lots of nice chateaus.
Here it's just a metal building with barrels inside,'' says  &UR; Jim
Adelman &LR; , general manager of Au Bon Climat wines in Santa Barbara
County. ``A lot is spent on winemaking and a lot less on amenities.
We don't have ornate gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Doug Margerum &LR; , owner of Santa Barbara's Wine Cask, says  &LR; Santa
Barbara  &LR; is like Napa was 25 years ago. ``You go to the winery, and
the guy looks at you mean, maybe he doesn't even come to the door.
If he does, maybe he'll open some wine for you, maybe he won't. But
you're actually talking to the guy who makes the wine. He's the
owner. There are no stewardesses in blue blazers giving standard
tours to groups of 20 at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Barbara has an ``outlaw image,'' says  &UR; Krysten Hommel &LR;  of
Cambria Vineyards. ``It's not a tourist destination.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jamie Davies &LR;  of Schramsberg Vineyards near Calistoga said that
``Santa Barbara County is a tourist destination'' and becoming more
so, but ``obviously Napa has gone further down the path.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the issues of agriculture and tourism are ``always a
concern. Our primary use of the land is to grow grapes to produce
wine. The more we invest in tourist facilities, the more difficult
it is to maintain the balance. It is a concern everybody in Napa
has to deal with in terms of how far we can go and still maintain
what we have.'' The particular dilemma she cited is that ``you have
people coming in at all times along the road, and people see what
they like and want to be part of it, and you can't close the
gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, she said, ``I think Napa has probably the best zoning
to maintain the agricultural preserve of anywhere in the state.''

   &UR; QUEEN TO HAWK VIDEOS TO BUY OATS &LR;
</P>

   &UR; Queen Elizabeth &LR;  plans to release a video she's made about
raising horses, says the Times of London. A hundred thousand of the
videos will be produced in hopes of raising a million pounds
(that's $1.57 million to you) for the upkeep of the royal stables.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said that the queen will make an effort to appear
``warm'' and ``intimate. ... She fed sugar to the horses and
discussed details of their breeding and bloodlines with her
stable.''

the Mexican team were Mexican Americans.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: STARTUP AIRLINE PROPOSES IN-FLIGHT TV; NEW SERVICE

<P>
   Jetblue plans to offer its passengers live satellite television
programming, a feature that analysts say could revolutionize
in-flight entertainment throughout the aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
   The new discount airline, which is scheduled to begin flying out
of New York's Kennedy International Airport early next year to
as-yet unspecified destinations, will use special antennas on each
of its Airbus A320 aircraft that was developed by Live TV, a joint
venture between the Harris Corp. and Sextant In-flight Systems. The
antennas will receive programming from three satellites that
broadcast the satellite television service offered in the
continental United States by DirecTV, a unit of Hughes Electronics,
which is itself owned by General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Five-inch, high-resolution television screens will be installed
on the back of each Jetblue A320 seat, while armrests will be
equipped with plugs for headsets as well as volume and channel
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Anderson, Jetblue's director of aircraft programs, said the
carrier will offer 24 channels of live programming from DirecTV,
plus one channel that will track the plane's route and another that
will be used for promotional purposes. With the exception of the
safety briefing, all programs will be available from the minute a
passenger sits down until the plane arrives at its destination
gate.
</P>
<P>
   No decisions have been made yet about what channels Jetblue will
offer; by Federal law, DirecTV can only broadcast cable, not
network, television programming in flight. Anderson also said
Jetblue would not censor programming. For example, if a plane crash
occurs, Jetblue will not suspend news programs about it.
Commercials also will be the same as they are on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Jetblue will charge $3 to $5 for its TV service, depending on
the length of the flight; payment will be by credit card swipe.
</P>
<P>
   Jetblue will be among the first carriers to feature live
satellite television programming. Delta Air Lines used DirecTV on
one flight in October 1996 to broadcast the fourth game of the
World Series between the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees. John
Kennedy, a Delta spokesman, said the airline had no plans to
reintroduce this service. DirecTV also has been selling its service
to private jet owners since last year.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Jetblue's new system would give travelers more
choice in and greater control over entertainment options than they
now have. He also said the system occupied less room in an aircraft
cabin than others, freeing up space both in overhead bins and
beneath seats.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Latta, Live TV's vice president of operations and
corporate development, said his company had signed an agreement
with a second U.S. airline, which he declined to identify, to also
offer 24 channels of programming from DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Wiseman, publisher of Airfax, a Seattle-based newsletter
on in-flight entertainment, suggested Jetblue's service would serve
as a test case for the airline industry for live in-flight TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works in the U.S., you might see it go on international
routings when international satellite systems are put up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted air travelers who track stocks on television
would eventually be able to call from their flight to make a trade.
(Jetblue will not offer in-flight telephone service.) And he said
they even would be able to conduct such transactions on line once
planes are equipped, also by satellite, with e-mail and Internet
capabilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Service to Italy
</P>
<P>
   Air Europe, which is based in Milan, Italy, and headed by a
member of the Agnelli family that is 49.9 percent owned by SAir
Group, the parent of Swissair, will begin service on the
Pisa-Venice-New York (Kennedy International Airport) route on July
26. Flights, which will operate every day but Wednesday, will serve
fresh pasta, espresso, Italian pastries and ice cream in both
economy and business class. The carrier is offering an introductory
round-trip economy-class fare of $425 through Sept. 30. There are
restrictions, including an overnight Saturday stay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book for What Can Ail You
</P>
<P>
   Cadogan Books has published the second edition of ``Bugs, Bites
and Bowels,'' a medical guide for travelers by Dr. Jane
Wilson-Howarth, an expedition doctor and parasitologist. It covers
everything from food-related illnesses to skin infections to motion
sickness, and contains charts on tropical diseases and data on
immunizations. Distributed in the United States by Globe Pequot
Press, it costs $9.95.

SANTA BARBARA AS THE DOWN-HOME NAPA
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Food &AMP; Wine's  &UR; Merrill Shindler &LR;  claims that Santa Barbara
County is the up-and-coming, down-and-dirty version of the Napa
Valley, at least when it comes to winemaking. The implication is
that the Napa Valley has become something of a wine Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napa has a lot invested in buildings, lots of nice chateaus.
Here it's just a metal building with barrels inside,'' says  &UR; Jim
Adelman &LR; , general manager of Au Bon Climat wines in Santa Barbara
County. ``A lot is spent on winemaking and a lot less on amenities.
We don't have ornate gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Doug Margerum &LR; , owner of Santa Barbara's Wine Cask, says  &LR; Santa
Barbara  &LR; is like Napa was 25 years ago. ``You go to the winery, and
the guy looks at you mean, maybe he doesn't even come to the door.
If he does, maybe he'll open some wine for you, maybe he won't. But
you're actually talking to the guy who makes the wine. He's the
owner. There are no stewardesses in blue blazers giving standard
tours to groups of 20 at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Barbara has an ``outlaw image,'' says  &UR; Krysten Hommel &LR;  of
Cambria Vineyards. ``It's not a tourist destination.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jamie Davies &LR;  of Schramsberg Vineyards near Calistoga said that
``Santa Barbara County is a tourist destination'' and becoming more
so, but ``obviously Napa has gone further down the path.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the issues of agriculture and tourism are ``always a
concern. Our primary use of the land is to grow grapes to produce
wine. The more we invest in tourist facilities, the more difficult
it is to maintain the balance. It is a concern everybody in Napa
has to deal with in terms of how far we can go and still maintain
what we have.'' The particular dilemma she cited is that ``you have
people coming in at all times along the road, and people see what
they like and want to be part of it, and you can't close the
gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, she said, ``I think Napa has probably the best zoning
to maintain the agricultural preserve of anywhere in the state.''

(that's $1.57 million to you) for the upkeep of the royal stables.
</P>

STUDY SUGGESTS WAY TO CUT HOSPITAL PHARMACY ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having a pharmacist accompany physicians as they make the rounds
of critically ill patients may help cut hospital medication errors
by as much as two-thirds, according to a study conducted at
Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that millions of medication errors occur each year,
the study's authors urged hospital officials to consider having a
pharmacist go on medical rounds, in addition to taking other
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common cause of accidental injury to patients in
hospitals is prescribing error,'' said Dr. Lucian L. Leape, adjunct
professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health
and lead author of the study in the current Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say there are millions of medication errors a
year,'' Leape said. While most of the errors are minor, even one
serious injury or death is too many, he added. Some studies,
including an earlier one by Leape and colleagues, have estimated
that between 770,000 and 2 million US hospital patients are injured
each year by medication errors.
</P>
<P>
   The study measured the rates of preventable medication errors at
an intensive-care unit before and after a senior pharmacist was
added to the medical team making the rounds. The rate dropped by 66
percent, from 10.4 such errors for every 1,000 patient days, to 3.5
for every 1,000 patient days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies conducted by Leape and colleagues have found
that more than a quarter of drug-related injuries _ some caused by
errors, some not _ are preventable, and that medication errors can
also be drastically reduced through the use of a computer to take
physician medication orders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the studies, published last year, credited a $1.9 million
computer system at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston with
cutting the medication error rate there by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   But not all hospitals can afford a computer medication
entry-order system like the Brigham's.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggests that a less costly but still effective
alternative is a more intense use of hospital pharmacists, by
either having them accompany physicians on medical rounds or
positioning them on patient floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adequately trained pharmacists on the floor can in fact reduce
the number of preventable drug errors,'' said Harold DeMonaco,
director of drug therapy management at MGH and one of the authors
of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmacists tend to be somewhat expensive personnel, but there
is a very adequate return on investment _ multiples of the
pharmacists' salary,'' said DeMonaco, a pharmacist himself. He
added that he believes a computer has not yet been designed to take
the place of a well-trained pharmacist, in terms of understanding
complex drug interactions, the merits of one drug over another for
certain patients, and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've documented that putting pharmacists on the floor
actually saves money,'' DeMonaco said. ``It's a good thing for
patients and a good thing for hospitals as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My own feeling is that the pharmacist is the most
underutilized resource in the hospital,'' agreed Leape.
</P>
<P>
   Each preventable medication error costs an estimated $4,685,
according to research by Leape and colleagues. At the
intensive-care unit where the study was conducted at MGH, 58 such
errors a year were estimated to have been prevented, for a total
savings of about $270,000, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study have led MGH to add more than a half
dozen more pharmacists to the staff. In addition, the hospital has
installed the same computer medication-order system that its sister
hospital, the Brigham, uses, according to DeMonaco.
</P>
<P>
   While the study at MGH provides strong evidence supporting a
more intense use of pharmacists to reduce medication errors, the
authors cautioned that other hospitals may have different results,
depending on such factors as whether physicians make rounds at a
predictable time, thus allowing pharmacists to accompany them.

 &HT;    Geller reborn with new `Buffy' season
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't real sure where
she's going, but she sure knows where she's been.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the fourth season of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,''
Gellar says she feels as if she's starting a new series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like starting from scratch,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will be profound in Sunnydale, following the season
finale in which most of the cast graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   When the series goes back into production Friday, Buffy Summers
will give up her dream of going away to college and instead stay in
town and attend college there, the better to fight all the undead
and monsters that plague the place. She'll also meet a new
potential romantic interest in psych class. Best buds Xander and
Willow stay in town too.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Giles is gonna become Buffy's love slave!'' Gellar jokes
in her giddy, hyper way.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change will be the departure of Angel (David
Boreanaz), her brooding vampire lover, who's getting a spin-off
series that will follow ``Buffy'' in the fall, also produced by
``Buffy'' creator Joss Whedon. In ``Angel,'' the 244-year-old
vampire, who's ``cursed'' with a conscience, moves to Los Angeles
to help people in need.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-overs are already being planned _ look for Buffy to visit
Angel during November sweeps, but will be kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very daunting,'' Gellar says. ``What if I can't do it on
my own? What if I need David? But it's very exciting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellar, who's 22, is diplomatic about the WB's postponement of
``Buffy's'' finale, which featured violence at a high school, out
of respect for the shootings at Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my place to agree or disagree. I understand it. I
wanted my show to air when it was supposed to air, but God forbid
if anything had happened, I don't see how any of us could have
lived with ourselves,'' she adds, referring to chance that someone
might have tried to copy the final violent scene at the high
school.
</P>
<P>
   She gets even more excited talking about how she spent her
hiatus _ particularly spending a week in the Dominican Republic
building a Habitat for Humanity house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've always wanted to do,'' she says. ``They
didn't know who I was. I made a very good window sill, I laid a lot
of floor, I mixed a ton of cement. I've never had calluses like
that. My fingers were just bloody.''
</P>
<P>
   And for once, it wasn't stage blood.

APPLE'S SUPPORTERS ARE ON TOP OF THE (MAC)WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Normalcy isn't a word commonly associated with Apple
Computer Inc., a firm that prides itself on its eccentricity. And
yet that's exactly the spirit that prevails in the run-up to the
MacWorld trade show in New York. There's the usual anticipation as
people await an electrifying keynote speech from Apple cofounder
Steve Jobs. And speakers at an Apple ``town meeting'' Tuesday
morning warned of open rebellion if Jobs doesn't announce Apple's
long-awaited low-cost portable Macintosh computer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the attitude here is one of confidence that Apple
Computer is firmly set on its new course. Says Apple analyst Tim
Bajarin of Creative Strategies Research: ``Fundamentally, they're
going to make it a love fest. They haven't had a MacWorld with this
much positive news in quite awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of years ago, the cover of Wired magazine urged
readers to pray for Apple's survival, and Dell Computer Corp.
founder Michael Dell suggested that Apple should close up shop. The
pain of those bitter days has been assuaged by seven straight
quarters of profits and a hit product _ the iMac _ that has become
one of the most successful computer models ever. At this MacWorld,
the fear is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that survival is not high on their list of
priorities right now,'' says Apple-watcher Lou Mazzucchelli of the
New York investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison. Instead, he said,
Apple is busy making moves to continue the firm's extraordinary
comeback. ``What they need is a continuing stream of base hits,''
said Mazzucchelli, ``and I think they're doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody foresees a return of the days when Apple contended with
Microsoft for total domination of the personal computer business.
The big money, of course, is in the highest reaches of corporate
America, and Apple's presence there is small, and likely to remain
so. So Jobs has stuck to his strategy of stabilizing Apple's core
markets in graphic arts and education, while also reaching out to
consumers with radically designed Macintosh computers for the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   Once criticized for its one-piece, quirky design, the iMac's
popularity has proven a hit with consumers. Better yet, in a world
in which hit products can fade quickly, the iMac just keeps going.
According to Salomon Smith Barney, Apple sold 487,000 of them
between April and June. In addition, sales of Macs to schools rose
22 percent over the same period last year. That's a sign that Apple
may be reasserting itself in the education market _ a segment the
company once dominated, but where it has lost ground to cheap
machines running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs, who after two years on the job still insists on
being called Apple's ``interim'' CEO, last week reported the
company's seventh straight quarterly profit. Much of the $114
million profit came from continued solid sales of the Apple iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the iMac's success, computer software and accessory
makers are suddenly eager to make products for Macintosh computer
users. According to IDG Expo, the Norwood firm that runs MacWorld,
80 percent of the exhibitors at the show will have new products to
offer. For instance, Microsoft Corp. will display a new version of
its Outlook Express electronic messaging software; LucasArts
Entertainment Co. will be showing off Macintosh versions of its
``Star Wars: Episode I'' computer games; and Bell Atlantic will
offer a version of its Infospeed high-speed Internet access service
for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep the momentum going, Apple must look beyond the iMac.
The most widely rumored next step is the development of a new kind
of laptop. Apple's PowerBook series is well respected for technical
excellence, but they're heavy and expensive machines that don't
appeal to the mass market. In 1996, before Jobs took the helm in a
boardroom coup, Apple produced the eMate, a simple laptop computer
that had no disk drive and a black-and-white screen, but which ran
for days on a battery charge, was easy to use, and cost just $800.
Jobs killed the product after he came to power. But last year he
vowed to get Apple back into the market for low-cost laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Today (July 21) could be the day. Computer mavens expect Jobs to
announce a new Apple laptop that'll probably come down somewhere
between the PowerBook and the eMate. The rumored machine is
expected to cost somewhere around $1,000, but Apple officials are
extremely secretive about the topic, refusing even to say whether
Jobs will announce any new products today. ``If I told you, I'd
have to kill you,'' said Steve Wilhite, Apple's vice president of
marketing. Indeed, it's possible that the notebook still isn't
ready. Predictions of possible delays jolted Apple's stock price
last week.
</P>
<P>
   There's another long-awaited product that'll almost certainly go
missing _ OS X. The Unix-based overhaul of the Macintosh operating
system promises to be dramatically more reliable than Microsoft's
Windows 98, but such promises have been heard for years and Apple
has yet to deliver. The company has produced a version of OS X for
use on server computers linked to networks, but the version for
desktop users is supposed to appear sometime before year's end. A
skeptical Mazzucchelli predicted it won't show up until 2000. ``So
what?'' he added, saying the product has little chance of stealing
market share from Microsoft anyway. If so, a few months' delay will
only matter to hard-core Mac geeks tired of an operating system
that's showing its age.
</P>
<P>
   However, OS X may already be making a mark. Apple recently moved
to provide free access to the underlying source code at the core of
the product _ the OS X ``kernel.'' This ``open source'' approach
imitates the successful strategy of Linux, the most popular open
source operating system. If Apple's open source software, called
Darwin, becomes popular with programmers, Apple could profit by
selling them add-on software, programming tools, and technical
support.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the Darwin strategy raises the prospect of
Mac-based operating systems running on standard PCs. Open source
programmers routinely ``port'' software written for one type of
machine onto another. Linux, for instance, has been modified to run
on practically every type of computer. If a PC version of Darwin
comes along, it could be the first step in creating a PC market for
Mac software _ a back-door tactic that could further ensure the
long-term survival of the Mac.

ANALYSIS: U.S. ROLE IN MIDEAST PEACE EFFORT IS CHANGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-U.S., ISRAEL-SETTLERS) 
(lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the enduring images of the late and
unlamented period in American-Israeli relations that ended with
Ehud Barak's victory over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is that
of a senior State Department envoy with a tape measure marking off
the width of Shuhadah Road in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the depth of U.S. involvement in relations between
Israelis and Palestinians that an official from Washington was
flown in to determine the exact distance, to the inch, that should
separate Jewish settlers from Palestinians in the divided town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   If anything changed as a result of Barak's visit to Washington,
which ended Tuesday, it was this conception of the American role in
Israel's dealings with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   No longer, Barak and President Clinton pledged this week, will
the United States serve as full-time intermediary, referee and
highway engineer in relations between Israel and Syria, the
Palestinians or other Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States _ at least in the early stages of the renewed
peace negotiations _ is prepared to serve the same function as the
father of the bride at a wedding reception: It will provide the
hall, toast the newlyweds and pick up the tab for the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Important roles, to be sure, but far different from the parts
Clinton and his aides played last October at the Wye Plantation
talks, which ranged from drafting language for Israeli-Palestinian
agreements to providing CIA officers to enforce the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement foresees a more active role for the United
States only if the forthcoming talks break down, as they almost
certainly will at some point, administration officials said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States should not come up with its own decisions
how to resolve these issues,'' Vice President Al Gore said Tuesday
after meeting with Barak. ``In terms of trying to spell out the
terms, that is not our role.''
</P>
<P>
   There are risks in this approach, which is not new but rather a
return to the style that guided U.S. efforts at Middle East
peacemaking during the government of Yitzhak Rabin, Barak's mentor
and Clinton's friend, who was assassinated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that Israel can make peace on its own with
Syria _ with which it has technically been at war for more than 30
years _ or with the Palestinians, who have very different views
from most Israelis on sovereignty, Jerusalem and refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the rewards of a less intrusive U.S. role are great as well,
for Israel and its negotiating partners, and for Clinton, too.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has indicated a desire to engage directly with President
Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
without day-to-day U.S. intervention. He said he wants Clinton to
serve as the ``facilitator'' of such talks and not their judge or
enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for his part, says he is happy to serve as host and
caterer, providing the peace table at which the parties can dine
alone. The catering bill will run to hundreds of millions of
dollars _ to finance the prospective Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank and the Golan Heights, to subsidize improvements in
Israel's military capabilities, to build housing, roads and ports
for Palestinians, and perhaps one day to bring Syria into the
21st-century economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic benefits for the United States are
considerable, too. Israel just this week announced its biggest arms
deal ever, a $2.5-billion order for 50 new F-16E fighters and an
option to buy 60 more warplanes for $2 billion more. That will
preserve thousands of jobs at Lockheed Martin's assembly lines and
underwrite refinements in U.S. aircraft development at a time when
the Pentagon is cutting back on its fighter purchases.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that U.S. firms will also participate in the
big-dollar infrastructure improvements in Palestinian territories.
In addition, peace among the hostile parties of the Middle East
could lower the U.S. military costs of monitoring the volatile
region, although Iran and Iraq will continue to pose threats to
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not to mention Clinton's interest in establishing a
legacy as a peacemaker in his remaining months in office and maybe
winning that coveted Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in an interview last week that ``everyone knows
what the big issues are'' in Middle East negotiations. Progress
stalled under Netanyahu, Clinton acknowledged, but he said that the
election of Barak ``gives the United States the opportunity to
facilitate the process, something we've been trying to do for well
over two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he said that any lasting agreement must
come freely from the parties, based on mutual trust and not under
the duress of threats or inducements from an outside power.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official who handles Middle East affairs
said that the U.S. role in regional affairs is ``evolving'' and
will depend on Barak's success in winning the faith of his
negotiating partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key determinant is the amount of trust between the
parties, so that we don't have to do the tedious job of
intermediating between the sides,'' the official said, seeking the
customary anonymity of midlevel aides. ``If they aren't talking,
they'll come to us and say, `We need you.' But our preference is to
encourage them to speak directly, and we are the safety net, to
propose bridging proposals and to provide enormous political,
economic and diplomatic assistance to put the whole process in
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   As eager as Clinton is for a dramatic peace deal, and as
urgently as Barak appears to be to restart the process, it is
unlikely that the coming weeks or months will yield a garlanded
flight of doves.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he'll be able to judge the likelihood of success
15 months from now, just in time for the final lap of the U.S.
presidential campaign. But he cautioned against expectations of a
miracle.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Middle East adviser in the administration said,
``Forget any notion of major breakthroughs in the next few months.
I don't think people should be expecting White House signing
ceremonies any time soon.''

 &HT;    Seattle's Best Coffee opening in Japan
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seattle's Best Coffee Tuesday announced two major
deals to open 167 cafes in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   This is the company's first major entry into the lucrative
Japanese market. The company has sold its coffee in Eddie Bauer
stores in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong and growing familiarity with not only the
brand, but American coffee,'' said President Jim Clarke. ``Right
now we're reviewing a variety of different real estate locations
ranging from department stores to street-side locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Best Coffee is a subsidiary of Atlanta-based AFC
Enterprises, which also owns Churchs Chicken, Popeyes Chicken &AMP;
Biscuits and Cinnabon International.
</P>
<P>
   The development agreements are with Nippon Brunswick Co. Ltd.
and Osaka-based Mifune Corp. Nippon Brunswick is a joint venture
between Tokyo-Mitsui &AMP; Co. Ltd., one of the world's largest trading
companies, and Brunswick Corp. of the United States. The
partnership will develop 100 coffee cafes over five years.
</P>
<P>
   In the other deal, Mifune will open cafes, kiosks and coffee
carts this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has the third-highest coffee consumption in the world,
according to Gary Goldstein, a spokesman for the New York-based
National Coffee Association of the U.S. The United States is first.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second major international deal in recent months.
The company recently announced an agreement with a Saudi Arabian
firm to develop 65 Seattle Best Coffee cafes and Cinnabon bakeries
in the Middle East.

 &HT;    Equifax results in line with expectations
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Equifax reported second-quarter earnings
that would have been flat from the year-earlier results if it were
not for a gain on the sale of a stake in a Brazilian company and
some assets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The results, however, met Wall Street expectations. Also, while
there was an after-tax gain of $2.9 million, or 2 cents per share,
Equifax boosted research and development spending, which affected
earnings. Analyst Gregory E. Gieber of Brown Brothers Harriman
called the latter good for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax, best known for its credit report business, reported net
income of $52.1 million, or 37 cents a share, on revenue of $442.6
million. A year earlier, the company earned $50.6 million, or 35
cents a share, on revenue of $393.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, Equifax said it remains comfortable with Wall
Street's forecast that the company will earn $1.52 to $1.58 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Equifax shares lost 81 1/4 cents to $34.18 3/4
on a down day for the market.

SANTA BARBARA AS THE DOWN-HOME NAPA

   Food &AMP; Wine's  &UR; Merrill Shindler &LR;  claims that Santa Barbara
County is the up-and-coming, down-and-dirty version of the Napa
Valley, at least when it comes to winemaking. The implication is
that the Napa Valley has become something of a wine Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napa has a lot invested in buildings, lots of nice chateaus.
Here it's just a metal building with barrels inside,'' says  &UR; Jim
Adelman &LR; , general manager of Au Bon Climat wines in Santa Barbara
County. ``A lot is spent on winemaking and a lot less on amenities.
We don't have ornate gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Doug Margerum &LR; , owner of Santa Barbara's Wine Cask, says  &LR; Santa
Barbara  &LR; is like Napa was 25 years ago. ``You go to the winery, and
the guy looks at you mean, maybe he doesn't even come to the door.
If he does, maybe he'll open some wine for you, maybe he won't. But
you're actually talking to the guy who makes the wine. He's the
owner. There are no stewardesses in blue blazers giving standard
tours to groups of 20 at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Barbara has an ``outlaw image,'' says  &UR; Krysten Hommel &LR;  of
Cambria Vineyards. ``It's not a tourist destination.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jamie Davies &LR;  of Schramsberg Vineyards near Calistoga said that
``Santa Barbara County is a tourist destination'' and becoming more
so, but ``obviously Napa has gone further down the path.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the issues of agriculture and tourism are ``always a
concern. Our primary use of the land is to grow grapes to produce
wine. The more we invest in tourist facilities, the more difficult
it is to maintain the balance. It is a concern everybody in Napa
has to deal with in terms of how far we can go and still maintain
what we have.'' The particular dilemma she cited is that ``you have
people coming in at all times along the road, and people see what
they like and want to be part of it, and you can't close the
gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, she said, ``I think Napa has probably the best zoning
to maintain the agricultural preserve of anywhere in the state.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A surge of imports driven by the continued strength
of the American economy pushed the U.S. trade deficit to another
record in May _ over $21 billion, a figure fueled by rising oil
prices and growing evidence that China is using exports to support
its lagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   The China deficit comes at a politically inopportune time for
the Clinton administration: Next week the House of Representatives
is expected to vote on a one-year renewal of China's preferential
trade status.
</P>
<P>
   While the House is expected to approve the measure, the rising
deficit with China _ it totaled more than $23 billion in the first
five months of 1999 _ further complicates a relationship already
deeply strained by the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and China's renewed threats to use force if
necessary to keep Taiwan from declaring itself an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit is also one of the few economic indicators
that Republican candidates for the presidential nomination can
seize upon to argue that not all is well with the U.S. economy. But
it is, in fact, a byproduct of American economic health: With
unemployment here at record lows, low-cost imports have helped keep
inflation to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The May trade figures reflect the continuing large gap between
the strong growth in the United States and weaker conditions in
many foreign countries,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley said
Tuesday. He estimated that the deficit was running at an annual
rate of $224.8 billion, which would total nearly 37 percent more
than last year's record of $164.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   China is not the only cause: The trade deficit with Japan
remains large _ though it dropped slightly in May _ and there is a
rising deficit with Canada and Mexico, the two other members of the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the May deficit surprised many economists, and led a
few on Tuesday to lower modestly their predictions for American
economic growth in the second quarter. But perhaps more important,
it was a strong indication that the U.S. consumer spending binge is
moving ahead unabated, which is bound to worry the Federal Reserve
Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago if we had seen numbers like this, what you
would have heard on Capitol Hill was politicians blaming the
Japanese and the Chinese,'' said Richard Medley, who heads Medley
Global Advisors, an international investment firm in New York.
``Now what you hear more often is that this proves we are spending
too much and saving too little.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact a number of economists and U.S. officials are
increasingly concerned that the accumulating current account
deficit could ultimately hurt the value of the dollar _ and that,
in turn, could trigger an international exodus from the stock
market.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS URGE BLACKS TO WEAR SEAT BELTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal transportation and health officials Tuesday
pledged to spearhead a campaign to encourage blacks to wear seat
belts following a report that young blacks are half as likely as
whites to be buckled in and, hence, twice as likely to be killed in
a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Surgeon General David
Satcher called the failure to wear seat belts a public safety and
health problem that will continue unless governmental and community
leaders intervene. Ricardo Martinez, head of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, added that wearing seat belts is a
``simple solution'' to the deaths and injuries in car crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn.,
provided no explanation for the disparity in seat-belt use by
blacks and whites. But the report offered chilling statistics on
the lack of belt use, estimating that 1,300 blacks killed each year
in car crashes would survive if they buckle up.
</P>
<P>
   The study found automobile crashes to be a ``silent epidemic''
among blacks and the leading cause of death among black children up
to age 14. Crashes also are second only to homicide as the chief
cause of death among blacks between ages 15 and 24, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, speaking at a a news conference to announce the study's
findings, urged governmental and community leaders to ``give voice
to that silence'' by alerting blacks to wear seat belts. The
transportation secretary also encouraged police to beef up their
enforcement of state laws requiring motorists to wear the belts
under penalty of fines.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said he anticipates criticism of his call for stricter
enforcement, particularly from some blacks who fear police will use
seat-belt laws as a pretext for pulling over black motorists. Black
leaders in many communities have criticized police for allegedly
targeting and even harassing black motorists, who fit law
enforcement's invidious stereotype of drug dealers, the rights
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   But Slater said the federal government would ensure that police
fairly enforce safety laws while protecting the civil rights of
black motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeatedly, we see that the violence of crashes is color
blind,'' Slater said. ``All of us, our children and families, are
affected by car crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, seat belts saved 65,290 lives between 1982 and 1994,
according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
But, while 62.6 percent of all whites reported wearing seat belts
in 1996, only 51.2 percent of blacks buckled up, NHTSA added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The available data show this problem as particularly acute for
African-American males in the 18 to 29 year age range,'' stated the
report by Meharry, a historically black medical college. ``A (1998)
study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that
seat-belt use has largely `remained stagnant' for African American
males in this age range, while the rest of the population has
experienced an increase in usage rate of about 19 percent from 1987
through 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher, the federal government's top doctor, called the low
rate of belt use among blacks ``a public health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that increasing seat-belt use will save thousands of
young lives each and every year,'' Satcher said. ``The more we know
about the particular needs of diverse populations, the more we are
able to develop sound prevention strategies to produce healthy
communities for Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, an emergency room doctor before being appointed to the
highway-safety agency, said, ``The violence of crashes does not
discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with the three federal officials, Rep. Eddie Bernice
Johnson, D-Dallas and vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus,
praised Texas' seat-belt law for encouraging people to buckle up.
But, she said, greater efforts must be made to educate blacks _ and
particularly black men _ of the danger of not wearing belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the first step in getting the word out to use
seat belts,'' Johnson said. In a message directed at black
teen-agers, she added that refusing to wear a seat belt ``isn't
cool, it's foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is the only state without a law requiring
motorists to wear seat belts.

NOT QUITE OPERA, NOT QUITE ORATORIO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 David Mermelstein writes about music for The New Criterion.  
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The classical-music canon does not lack for oddities. Neither
fish nor fowl, works like Debussy's ``Martyrdom of St. Sebastian,''
Richard Strauss' ``Enoch Arden'' and Schoenberg's ``Survivor From
Warsaw'' entice music lovers through their esthetic merits while
confounding with their unconventional structures.
</P>
<P>
   Schumann's ``Scenes From Goethe's `Faust''' is another example.
Though it has elements of both opera and oratorio, it fails to fit
comfortably into either form. Running two hours and requiring full
orchestra and a large chorus as well as vocal soloists, it demands
much from concert presenters and audiences alike, and is thus
something of a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been performed by the American Symphony and the
Orchestra of St. Luke's in the last decade, it was last presented
by the New York Philharmonic in 1973 and has not been heard at
Carnegie Hall since 1891, when the third and last part was given.
(Schumann himself considered the work more effective in partial
performance.)
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers can hear the work Sunday evening, July 25, at Avery
Fisher Hall, where John Eliot Gardiner and the Orchestre
Revolutionnaire et Romantique conclude their four-night Schumann
celebration as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   For those unable to attend the performance, the Belgian-born
conductor Philippe Herreweghe _ like Gardiner, a stalwart of the
period-instrument school _ has recorded the piece for Harmonia
Mundi France (HMC 901661/2; two CDs).
</P>
<P>
   ``Scenes From Goethe's `Faust''' was first performed in 1862, 6
years after Schumann's death and 30 years after Goethe's. Like
Goethe, who worked on his magnum opus off and on for 60 years,
Schumann labored long over his Faust meditation. Typically a fast
worker, he took nine years to finish this piece, in 1853, a
testimony to the reverence with which he approached the project.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Berlioz, in his grand dramatic legend ``The Damnation of
Faust'' (1846), or Gounod, in his famous opera ``Faust'' (1859),
Schumann found most of his inspiration in the second book of
Goethe's masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than ending with Gretchen's death and ascension to
heaven, his version follows Faust to his death at the hands of
Mephistopheles' minions and into an ethereal plane, where he
encounters angels and spirit forces. It concludes with a moving
chorale, the ``Chorus Mysticus,'' using the eight lines with which
Goethe ended his work.
</P>
<P>
   Schumann wrote the third of his ``Faust'' scenes first, and only
that part of the work was performed publicly during his lifetime.
On the centenary of Goethe's birth, in 1849, it was heard
simultaneously in three German cities: Weimar, with Franz Liszt
conducting, Dresden and Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   The new recording, in which Herreweghe marshals the Orchestre
des Champs-Elysees, the Collegium Vocale, La Chapelle Royale, the
RIAS Chamber Choir and eight vocal soloists, faces relatively
little competition. Though Claudio Abbado recorded the work for
Sony Classical in 1994, the handful of performances on disk are
measured mostly against Benjamin Britten's celebrated 1972 Decca
recording, which is available in America only as a special import.
</P>
<P>
   Herreweghe achieves bolder dynamic contrasts than Britten, and
his textures are leaner, but not everyone will appreciate the more
frenzied character here. (The timpanist is especially aggressive.)
In the overture _ which Schumann tackled last _ Herreweghe
generates real excitement, even if Britten trumps him in its final
pages.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Midnight'' scene, when the crones Want, Guilt, Care and
Distress enter to torment Faust, now blind, Herreweghe summons
palpable drama, and William Dazeley, an English baritone as Faust,
proves particularly rousing. In ``Faust's Death,'' at the end of
Part 2, Herreweghe drives his forces to fierce heights, turning the
high-pitched chorus of Lemurs (``zombies,'' in our parlance) into a
leering assemblage, then finishing the episode with eerie calm.
</P>
<P>
   Herreweghe, an old hand at sacred music, is right at home in the
serene choruses of Part 3, with their theistic overtones.
Especially powerful is the scene in which angels bear Faust's
remains to the heavens (``Gerettet ist das edle Glied'') and
celestial choirs rejoice at the flawed man's transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Chorus Mysticus,'' Herreweghe chooses Schumann's
revised version, which was composed almost immediately after the
original. Less opulent, though longer, than what Schumann first
envisioned, it overflows with empathetic emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Some will undoubtedly prefer the tauter, more highly charged
earlier conception, for which Britten makes a spirited case. But
Herreweghe clearly understands the inspiration Schumann felt in
setting the words ``The eternal feminine/Leads us upward'': for the
composer, a paean to his beloved wife, Clara.
</P>
<P>
   The vocal soloists, though little known, are able. Dazeley sings
Faust earnestly if occasionally dryly. Camilla Nylund proves
dramatically convincing as Gretchen, and Hans-Peter Blochwitz sings
the spirit Ariel with soft-grained tenderness. Kristinn
Sigmundsson, a versatile bass, brings gravity to the role of
Mephistopheles and warmth to Pater Profundus. Simone Nold, a
fresh-voiced soprano, also stands out, as Care and in various
choral solos.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Dazeley is no match for Britten's Faust, Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau in his honeyed prime. Ms. Nylund lacks the shimmer
that Elizabeth Harwood lends the Decca set. And Blochwitz, as good
as he is, can't quite compete with Britten's Ariel, the
incomparable Peter Pears.
</P>
<P>
   Herreweghe's real strength is the choral sound he fuses from the
various forces, crisp, resonant and strong. Though this recording
does not _ cannot _ displace Britten's esteemed account, it offers
its own rewards, including superb sound and exquisite packaging.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it affords the musically curious a chance to
explore afresh a masterpiece that puzzles and dazzles, appealing to
the striver in us all.

PENTAGON OFFICIALS CRITICIZE U.N. EFFORT IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening a new rift between the Pentagon and the
United Nations, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry
Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Tuesday
criticized the United Nations for not moving faster to create a new
police force and civil administration in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we do, the less incentive there is for the U.N. to
come in and assume that burden,'' Cohen said of NATO's peacekeeping
forces, which have been filling all types of roles as 650,000
ethnic Albanians poured back into Kosovo. ``This is a mission that
doesn't belong to NATO forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent civilian police, judges, prosecutors and civilian
administrators, NATO peacekeeping soldiers have reluctantly filled
those roles. NATO's main task is to provide overall security for
Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, but it has always understood that
military commanders would have to serve as de facto mayors, at
least temporarily, until the United Nations could get a civilian
administration up and running.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. official leading the vast civilian operation, Dr.
Bernard Kouchner, France's health minister, has been on the job
less than a week. Only 150 police officers of a projected
3,110-member international force are in Kosovo. And most of the
public servants who did such jobs as collecting garbage and running
the waterworks were Serbs who have fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge in Kosovo is probably the greatest since the
launching of the concept of peacekeeping at the U.N. more than 50
years ago,'' Marie Okabe, a U.N. spokeswoman, said in response to
the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but it did not satisfy Cohen and Shelton, who
offered unusually pointed public criticism of the United Nations
and other international agencies in Kosovo during their appearance
before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put as much pressure as possible on the U.N. to do
more to get in there more quickly to get these institutions up and
running,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks underscore the ambivalence with which the
Pentagon approaches a growing number of peacekeeping operations in
the era after the cold war. Only the military has the ability to
move quickly into a devastated region like Kosovo, providing food,
water, medical care and basic shelter, as well as having the
administrative skills to help govern a troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   The faster civilian experts arrive, the sooner NATO can reduce
its military force, Cohen said. The United States has committed
7,000 troops to the mission, and about 5,300 have arrived so far as
part of a NATO force that now totals 33,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   A speedy transition to civilian political authority is also
important to keep fighters in the Kosovo Liberation Army, now
tapped for jobs in an indigenous police force, from turning against
NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for the U.N. to get involved very early on so
there can be democratic institutions set up, and you don't just
have the military leaders take over and run the country from a
military point of view,'' Cohen said of the rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the Pentagon is complaining of additional
chores, the United Nations has shot back that the allies are
failing to help pay to repatriate refugees and rebuild Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the deputy United Nations high commissioner
for refugees complained that his office had received only $140
million of the $400 million it says it needs to help repatriating
refugees rebuild their homes. Finance ministers from the Group of 7
industrial nations as well as officials from international lending
agencies, who met last week in Brussels, have yet to agree on who
will finance the Balkans reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's complaints found a sympathetic audience in the
Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday. Many senators chimed in
with concerns of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. and allied troops have been called on to fill the
void, acting as mayors, police, judge and jury, as the United
Nations moves very slowly to assume its responsibilities for civil
administration,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators expressed particular concern about the slow
pace of setting up the international police force, which will
consist of volunteers from around the world, including 450 from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sometimes get high-quality police officers, sometimes low
quality,'' said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who recently visited
Kosovo. ``If we cannot establish an effective, tolerant and
objective law-enforcement apparatus in Kosovo, we'll be there a
very long time, and we'll be there with lots of pain and misery.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shelton concurred, saying, ``There is no higher priority right
now than to getting a police force and a justice system
established.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Okabe said the police force would increase by about 100
officers a week starting next week, and officials are set to begin
training an indigenous police force early next month. A traveling
court of judges appointed by the United Nations has heard 90 cases
so far involving 198 people, Ms. Okabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Cohen said the United Nations could do better. ``The U.N.
and associated institutions have been slow off the mark to get the
appropriate trained professional police into both Bosnia and now
Kosovo,'' Cohen said.

REPUBLICAN SCHISM OVER TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Ohio, Texas, N.J., N.Y., Ill.)  (See also TAX-BREAKS) 
(lh) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the House scrambled Tuesday
to head off a revolt by moderates within the party and avert a
humiliating defeat on their signature issue of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   With a vote on the biggest tax cut since 1981 scheduled for
Wednesday on the House floor, Republicans said it was unclear
whether enough of the 20 or so moderates would break with the
leadership to defeat or block passage of the bill, the centerpiece
of the party's domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates have been pressing Speaker Dennis Hastert and his
deputies to scale back the 10-year, $864 billion tax-cutting
package approved last week by the Ways and Means Committee, saying
the bill leaves none of the projected federal budget surplus to
help reduce the national debt or address issues like education.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership agreed to cut the package to $792 billion, the
size of a corresponding bill taken up Tuesday by the Senate Finance
Committee, in part to mollify the moderates and in part to sidestep
a procedural problem. But the Republican moderates, led by Rep.
Michael Castle of Delaware, insisted Tuesday on a package of no
more than $514 billion.
</P>
<P>
   During a lunchtime meeting, the moderates listened to pleas for
support from Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee, and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of
the Budget Committee. But afterwards, Castle reiterated that he
would not vote for the $792 billion package, and that enough other
moderates shared his view to block passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now, clearly they would not be able to pass the
bill,'' Castle said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said a preliminary count Tuesday showed that
the leadership remained short of the 218 votes need to ensure
passage, and that intensive horse trading was under way. But such
jockeying is common before high-stakes votes, and senior
Republicans said they were confident of getting enough votes to
pass the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have the votes,'' said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the
majority leader. ``We're talking with all of our members and
listening to all of our members.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is the latest illustration of the difficulty that
Republicans are having maintaining a working majority in the House,
where the party is tugged constantly between different factions,
each of which is capable of blocking legislation. The leadership's
situation has been made more difficult by the defection from the
party last week of Rep. Michael Forbes of New York, who abruptly
announced on Friday that he was joining the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans currently have 222 members in the House. There are
211 Democrats, plus one independent who almost always votes with
the Democrats. There is one vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the votes of as few as five Republicans can deprive
the party of a majority, assuming all Democrats and the independent
stick together. Castle said there are at least half a dozen
moderates intent on voting against the $792 billion Republican
package.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by projections of rapidly growing federal budget
surpluses, Republican leaders had planned for this year's tax bill
to be the vehicle for an ideologically charged showdown with
Democrats and President Clinton over the size of the federal
government and the nation's priorities in an era of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has signaled a willingness to discuss a
compromise, he sent his top aides to Capitol Hill Tuesday to
underscore his opposition to any plan approaching the size of the
$792 billion package contemplated by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax cuts that have been put on the table will represent a
reversal of course that would put the economic strategy we have
been pursuing and the prosperity it has brought us at risk,'' said
Lawrence Summers, the Treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans reached out to Democrats by writing a
bill that was somewhat more targeted to the middle class than the
House version. Democrats have responded with compromise overtures
of their own, with a few centrist Democrats saying Tuesday that
they would support a tax cut of around $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been no attempt at bipartisanship in the House,
where issues tend to be more polarized. The problem for Republicans
in the House has been almost completely from within their own
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Already Archer has had to rework the bill that passed the Ways
and Means Committee to bring it down to $792 billion over 10 years.
He said Tuesday that he had done so primarily by phasing in the
bill's main components _ its 10 percent reduction in income tax
rates and its repeal of the inheritance tax on large estates _ more
slowly than he had originally contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   But several moderates said the reduction from $864 billion to
$792 billion was not enough to deal with their objections.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the moderates are from the Northeast and from districts
where voters are more centrist than those from Republican districts
in other regions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said she was opposed to the $792
billion tax package because it was too big and because it was based
on projections of federal budget surpluses that are likely to prove
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I strongly recommended is that we postpone action until
we get to a position where we have consensus on this and get a more
realistic bill,'' she said. ``I think the leadership has been
somewhat surprised at the definitive nature of the criticism and
the number of people willing to speak up. I want Denny Hastert and
the Republican leadership to succeed, but we can't have only a
minority from the South and West setting policy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other moderates said they would be willing to vote for the tax
cut if the leadership allowed them time to make their case on the
House floor on Wednesday. Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois said he
currently intended to vote against the bill, but might change his
position if the moderates were given two hours of time on the floor
and the chance to vote for a smaller package.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we got our shot, that would satisfy me,'' LaHood said.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates are not the only headache for the leadership. A
group of social conservatives is pressing for the tax package to be
changed to reflect their No. 1 tax issue, the repeal of the
so-called marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that hurts
many two-income couples. But the conservatives said they are
unlikely to withhold their support for the main Republican bill
over the issue.

REPORT SAYS HOSPITAL INSPECTORS ARE TOO LENIENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal investigators said Tuesday that hospital
inspectors were generally unable to detect substandard care or to
identify incompetent doctors because the inspectors ``strive to
foster a collegial atmosphere'' and do not aggressively scrutinize
practices that could threaten patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, the inspector general of the Department of
Health and Human Services, June Gibbs Brown, said the inspectors
announced their visits in advance and did not examine a random
sample of medical records, but usually relied on hospital employees
to select the records, so clinical problems could easily be
concealed.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving advance notice of inspections, some hospitals
have been found to hire temporary employees or to buy extra
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said researchers had estimated that 18 percent of
hospital patients received inappropriate care that could cause
injuries or other ``serious adverse events,'' like drug overdoses,
the mistaken amputation of a leg or surgery on the wrong side of a
patient's brain.
</P>
<P>
   In her report, the inspector general harshly criticized the
private organization that inspects hospitals for compliance with
federal health and safety standards. The organization, the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, works with
hospitals in a collegial way and has moved away from the idea of
regulation or the aggressive enforcement of federal standards, Ms.
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, the commission's inspectors are unlikely
to identify incompetent doctors or ``substandard patterns of
care.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission plays an important role in the American health
care system, accrediting 80 percent of the nation's 6,200
hospitals. Under federal law, hospitals accredited by the
commission are automatically deemed to meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   The results of commission surveys can mean the difference
between commercial success and failure for a hospital. In an
intensely competitive health care market, hospitals that receive
high scores often advertise that fact, and they have an advantage
in trying to obtain contracts with managed care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dennis O'Leary, president of the joint
commission, said he agreed with much of Ms. Brown's report. But, he
insisted, ``The evaluation of a hospital does not have to be
adversarial.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, O'Leary added, ``there are opportunities for
improvements in the commission's accreditation process.'' He said
he would welcome ``more feedback'' and guidance from the Health
Care Financing Administration, the federal agency that runs
Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general said that federal Medicare officials were
``deferential'' to the commission. For example, she said, the tone
and content of new federal regulations closely follows the approach
favored by the commission, and Medicare officials defer to
commission employees when they visit a hospital at the same time to
investigate problems.
</P>
<P>
   While consumers can learn if a hospital is accredited, Ms. Brown
said, the commission often refuses to disclose the cause or other
details of unexpected deaths and injuries at hospitals. And
Medicare officials provide the public with ``little information''
on the performance of either hospitals or the commission, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown portrayed the commission's surveyors as passive
observers rather than aggressive watchdogs. ``They allow the
hospital to select the majority of records to be reviewed,'' she
said of the inspectors. ``They tend to be accepting of information
and answers provided by the hospital staff, with little probing to
determine if surface appearances describe actual practice. They
seldom reflect any wariness that hospital staff, in their eagerness
to impress surveyors, may exaggerate points or omit information.''
</P>
<P>
   In her report, Ms. Brown also made these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Inspectors from the joint commission do not judge whether the
care given to a specific patient is good or bad, right or wrong.
They are unlikely to detect inappropriate surgery or bad outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Joint commission surveys are unlikely to identify individual
practitioners whose judgment or skills to practice medicine are
questionable.'' Hospital inspectors make ``a preliminary and
superficial assessment'' of the credentials and privileges of the
medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inspectors typically have little information about special
problems at the hospitals they visit.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates and labor unions welcomed Ms. Brown's
findings. Candice Owley, chairwoman of the Federation of Nurses and
Health Professionals, a division of the American Federation of
Teachers, said the report showed that ``the fox is guarding the
chicken coop and placing patients' health and well-being at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Grealy, a lawyer at the American Hospital Association,
said the commission's collegial approach served the interests of
patients because it helped hospitals improve the quality of care.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In an effort to assuage popular
grievances and to stop a wave of protests by unpaid army
reservists, the Yugoslav government will authorize overdue payments
to reservists, pensioners and teachers in a meeting Wednesday,
senior officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The payment plan is an indication of the anxieties of the
government of President Slobodan Milosevic, despite the inability
so far of its political opposition to channel popular anger after
the defeat in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Army reservists, many of whom retain their weapons from their
service in Kosovo, have been protesting in towns across Serbia to
demand their pay for the months spent in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in Krusevac, a town run by the governing coalition
where up to 8,000 men were mobilized for Kosovo, the reservists
blocked main roads and passenger trains and demonstrated in front
of City Hall. The police did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The reservists say each is owed 6,000 dinars for serving in
Kosovo, or $600 at the official exchange rate. Some are also
demanding help to pay electricity and telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal payments are quite likely to increase inflation
in an economy damaged by NATO air strikes and nine years of
international sanctions. Last week, the commander of the 3rd Army,
Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, said that reservists had been paid $80
million and that an additional $120 million was owed to them. The
total amount that the government plans to pay was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Cabinet minister, Goran Matic, said in an interview
that the government would surprise the West and the divided
political opposition by providing sufficient electricity, heat and
food for Serbia's winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war you have an effort at political destabilization,
to try to organize despair and hopelessness in every person,'' said
Matic, a minister without portfolio who often speaks for the
government. ``But it's more propaganda than reality. There will be
enough food and electricity. There was a bridge finished today, and
we have the potential and resources to rebuild. What we need is
political stability for reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic rejected opposition calls for Milosevic's resignation and
early elections, saying federal and local voting will proceed as
scheduled in November 2000, with elections in Serbia and
Montenegro, the two republics that remain in Yugoslavia, in 2001.
Milosevic, elected by Parliament in 1997, has a single five-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Vuk Draskovic, a leading opposition politician who
had joined the government but was ousted in the war, Matic said,
``Draskovic hasn't won national elections, and the opposition
hasn't won, and now they are trying to get what they couldn't get
through the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in a ceremony in the town of Beska, Serbian officials
reopened the first bridge to be repaired after the bombing. It is
on the main highway from Budapest through Belgrade to Nis, and the
destruction has caused significant traffic delays. Milosevic
presided last month over the beginning of the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   At least 59 bridges were destroyed or damaged in the bombing.
This one was fixed with the help of a donor from Switzerland, who
gave $360,000. Hundreds of people were bused in for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In continuing moves against what remains of the independent
press, the government imposed a new license fee of $40,000 on the
Radio Pancevo, which reported carefully but factually in the war.
The courts also issued notices to report to jail for two reporters
for the newspaper Dnevni Telegraf, or The Daily Telegraph, which
was highly critical of Yugoslav authorities and was banned in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters, Srdjan Jankovic and Zoran Lukovic, were sentenced
in March but told to start five months in jail Monday for an
article in December in which they linked a Serbian official from
the party of Milosevic's wife to a killing.
</P>
<P>
   The article did not directly accuse the official, Dr. Milovan
Bojic, a Serbian deputy prime minister, of the killing of a friend
of his, another doctor. the article said only that the dead man had
criticized Bojic but implied his involvement, which turned out to
be untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawyers for the two reporters argued Tuesday that the
case had been brought very quickly under a new information law and
that the outcome was harsh and vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   Branka Prpa, wife of the owner and editor of The Daily
Telegraph, Slavko Curuvija, who was killed in April, during the
war, by two men who shot him in front of his apartment building,
said in an interview Tuesday that the jailing ``shows the fear of
the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper.'' Ms. Prpa added, ``doesn't print any more. The
owner was killed. The journalists are unemployed and have no
influence. It's a continuation of the message and a warning of how
journalists will be treated in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovic, 27, said in an interview that he thought that ``the
case was absolutely over after the murder of Curuvija'' and the
repression of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be in their interest to push aside the
whole thing,'' he said. ``They just want to instill fear in other
journalists and anyone who thinks for himself in Serbia.''

CHINA DETAINS 70 LEADERS OF BUDDHIST LAW MOVEMENT

<P>
   BEIJING _ In what could be the start of a broad crackdown,
dozens of leaders of the Buddhist Law movement were detained by the
police on Tuesday in 14 Chinese cities, according to a Hong
Kong-based human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   At least 70 leaders of the group, which stunned authorities last
April when 10,000 adherents silently materialized in a protest
outside the communist leadership's compound here, were picked up in
the police sweep that began on Monday night, the Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. Arrests were
reported in Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian and 11 other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong organization said that the police searched the
homes of the detainees, confiscating books about the rapidly
growing movement and addresses of people who attended meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The group, widely known by the name Falun Gong, combines
traditional Chinese breathing and meditation exercises with
Buddhism, Taoism and the beliefs of its founder, Li Hongzhi, who
lives in self-imposed exile in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has posed a ticklish problem for Chinese authorities
ever since the demonstration on April 25. The group was protesting
local officials' treatment of its members and demanding official
recognition, which has not been granted.
</P>
<P>
   The government normally keeps a tight leash on mass
organizations. And Falun Gong, whose members are devoted to its
mixture of martial arts and mysticism, could be a potent force in a
country that faces dislocating social and economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a crackdown against the group have circulated widely
in recent weeks, despite assurances by Chinese officials that it
would be left alone. In a meeting with Falun Gong members last
month, a senior government official warned the group not to
``promote superstition'' or ``destroy social order.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing appears to have been laying the groundwork for a
crackdown for some time. Over the last two weeks, state-controlled
newspapers and television have carried a steady stream of
commentaries about the dangers of superstitious beliefs,
particularly among Communist Party members.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page commentary on Monday _ its fifth on the topic
since the April demonstration _ the Communist Party newspaper,
People's Daily, blamed lax officials for the rampant spread of
superstitious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and television reports have also begun celebrating
people who they say overcame ``feudal superstition'' _ for example,
a rural village where the residents gave up rituals like hanging
mirrors over doors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official news media did not report this week's
detentions, officials in Beijing seemed well aware of the possible
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   At Zhongnanhai, the sprawling walled compound where President
Jiang Zemin and other leaders live, a huge police contingent
patrolled the streets on Tuesday night. The western edge of the
compound, where the Falun Gong members massed in April, was closed
to motor traffic.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fears of harassment prompted Li, the founder and leader of Falun
Gong, to move to the United States last year. On June 2, he said in
a letter posted on the Internet that his followers were being
treated unjustly. He also suggested that China was negotiating to
have him extradited, in return for a $500-million reduction in
China's trade surplus with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were no signs of protest in Beijing, in Hong Kong
on Tuesday afternoon about 150 people marched to the local branch
of the official New China News Agency. There they delivered a
letter appealing to the Chinese government to release the detained
Falun Gong leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to express our shock and concern on this matter,''
said Sophie Xiao, a spokeswoman for the group in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xiao said she spoke on Tuesday with Falun Gong members in
Beijing who were worried that the government might declare the
group illegal. While not officially recognized, Falun Gong has
existed in a kind of grey area, as the government has tried to
avoid a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to threaten anybody,'' Ms. Xiao said.
``People who don't understand us may feel threatened because of the
number of people who are doing it and because of how quickly we
have grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from a standing start seven years ago, Falun Gong now
claims 100 million members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Li, 48, a former grain bureau clerk in northeastern China, began
his metamorphosis into a spiritual leader in the late-1980s, when
he discovered the ancient practice of qigong, in which people seek
to channel their vital energies to improve their health and even
heal others.
</P>
<P>
   By combining qigong with Buddhism, Taoism and his own mystical
ideas, Li fashioned an all-embracing philosophy that preaches clean
living. Eschewing politics and even the hint of a religious
identity, followers of Falun Gong work hard to portray themselves
simply as good people.
</P>
<P>
   The detentions, and the heavy police presence in Beijing on
Tuesday night, suggest that the Chinese authorities think
otherwise.

ENGAGE STOCK ZOOMS IN OFFERING

<P>
   Engage Technologies Inc., an Andover, Mass. Internet marketing
firm with ties to CMGI Inc., more than doubled in price on its
first day of trading Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, opening
at 15 and closing at 41.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Engage's relationship to Web venture firm, CMGI,
whose earlier ventures included Lycos Inc., the Internet search
engine and portal site, investors bid up the newcomer to a
midafternoon peak of 47 in a marketplace that, only a few weeks
ago, seemed to be shying away from untested Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   With almost 14.9 million shares traded, Engage was the eighth
most active stock on Nasdaq Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Engage was one of several Internet and technology firms expected
to attract attention during this week's debut of more than 20 IPOs.
The Engage sale, handled by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., raised $90
million for CMGI. At day's end Engage's total market value was
$1.92 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the stock's quick rise to CMGI's reputation.
CMGI, also based in Andover, owned 96 percent of Engage prior to
the offering and will retain 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Lycos, an existing firm in which CMGI invested, Engage
was a CMGI creation. ``This is the first wholly owned CMGI company
to be sold,'' said Michael Graham, an equity analyst at BancBoston
Robertson Stephens in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also another piece of evidence that CMGI has a savvy
management team that has been able to make very good investments.
Eventually, as Engage executes its strategy and grows, it will most
likely raise the value of CMGI stock,'' Graham added.
</P>
<P>
   Ullas Naik at First Albany Corp. in Boston called Engage's first
day of trading a ``huge validator that bodes well for CMGI's
strategy going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Engage Technologies offers products to Internet users that
include software to help corporations serve up on-line ads to an
immense collection of user behavioral data, sorted by race, age,
place of residence, Internet browsing habits, and other purchasing
and demographic characteristics. The company says its database
represents more than 30 million anonymous consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using (Engage's) data base, servers can actually track to see
how people behave on line,'' noted Naik. ``So ads become much more
targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   Engage has reported it will use a portion of the money raised
Tuesday for working capital and product development.
</P>
<P>
   Engage was among several high tech and Internet firms expected
to go public this week.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Art Technology Group Inc., whose software allows
on-line companies to personalize their advertisements, plans to
offer 5 million shares at between $10 to $12 per share, hoping to
raise $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Netsilicon Inc. of Waltham, filed its intentions
with the SEC to to offer 5 million shares at between $8 and $10 per
share at an unspecified future date.

   COMPUTERS (Seattle) _ A small group of subversives who want to
eliminate PCs from every home in America has been meeting quietly
in Seattle this week. ``What we really want to do is get computers
out of people's way,'' said Gaetano Borriello, professor of
computer science and engineering at the University of Washington.
Computers increasingly dictate human behavior, he said: ``It's
totally out of control.'' Borriello and fellow insurgent Turner
Whitted of Microsoft Research are the ringleaders in this movement
to help humans triumph over computers.

Sunday mornings. ``It's uncomfortable when someone from the pulpit
says that homosexuality is a horrible, sinful thing, even though
you have a love of God, a belief in God,'' said Darling, a gay
Seattle man. Somewhere in the gulf between the disparate gay and
Christian communities are scores of believers like Darling. More
than 200 homosexuals will gather in Tacoma this week for the 20th

CATHOLIC FAITH SOURCE OF SOLACE, VEXATION FOR KENNEDYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Kennedy leaned on it during the Cuban missile crisis.
His mother found solace in it after gunshots in Dallas. And now
Kennedys in Hyannis seek its sustenance through a grim vigil on
Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Both lightning rod and source of comfort, their Roman Catholic
faith has been the spiritual fuel that has propelled the Kennedy
family through tragedy and turmoil across generations.
</P>
<P>
   A belief that human destiny is ultimately in God's hand _ that
one's true and eternal reward comes after death _ has influenced
the way many Kennedys have conducted their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know at a deep-heart's level that this life is not the
be-all and the end-all,'' said Thomas Groome, a professor of
theology and religious education at Boston College. ``You would
think that people who have so much money and power and fame would.
But they have this genuine faith that for those who have passed on,
life has changed _ not ended. The Irish wake is as big a
celebration as the Irish wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   As a weekend of celebration became cloaked in despair after the
news that John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law were lost
in a plane crash at sea, the family used a wedding tent as a
makeshift church to celebrate Mass and pray for divine mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that the faith that Rose Kennedy held so intensely is
part of her legacy to her children and her grandchildren,'' said
Bishop Sean P. O'Malley of the Diocese of Fall River, Mass. ``So
I'm not at all surprised that in this moment of crisis they are
turning to their religion as a source of strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a family which has both absorbed criticism for
blurring the lines between church and state and for not strictly
observing church doctrine, religion has been a common thread
through tragedy and triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always come back to that and it seems to give them
strength to go on,'' said the Rev. Gerard P. Walsh, chaplain of the
Massachusetts State Police. ``They don't exactly wear their faith
on their sleeves, but there's no mistaking that it's a central part
of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after John F. Kennedy became the nation's first Catholic
president, he concluded his inaugural address with a promise to
``go forth and lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His
help, but knowing that here on earth, God's work must truly be our
own.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the missile crisis that brought the United
States and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war, Kennedy
slipped out of the White House, pausing to pray at St. Matthew's
Cathedral near the White House. And in November 1963, when he was
murdered by a sniper in Dallas, his mother said the first thing she
thought to do was call a priest and ask that a Mass be said for her
slain son.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the assassination, when talk turned morbid,
Rose Kennedy told a guest: ``I'm sure God wants us to be happy and
take pleasure in life. He doesn't want us to be sad.''
</P>
<P>
   That, observers said, explains the walks on the beach, the
afternoon sailing excursions, and driveway basketball games that
have unfolded in Kennedy homes from Hyannis to Long Island as dive
teams search for JFK Jr.'s airplane at the bottom of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If their religion has been a source of strength, it has also
stirred controversy.
</P>
<P>
   It bedeviled former US Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II in
1997 when his ex-wife criticized the church's decision to annul
their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy was rebuked by Cardinal Bernard Law of
Boston in 1994 when the senator said he favored the ordination of
woman as priests, bucking the Vatican's ban on that practice. And
JFK himself won the presidency in 1960 in the face of considerable
religious bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, the Kennedys maintained close ties to the
church of its matriarch, Rose Kennedy, a daily communicant, whose
family built the altar at St. Francis Xavier Church in Hyannis,
Mass. in memory of Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   News of his death in World War II was delivered by two priests
at the family's Hyannis Port compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see in the Kennedys a Catholic ethos that just bites
deeply into their being,'' said Lawrence Cunningham, a theologian
at the University of Notre Dame. ``If you're going to be a sinner,
you're going to be a Catholic sinner. At the moment of crisis, this
is the way you can best express yourself. It's deeply cultural.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for another Kennedy funeral await word on recovery
efforts. But officials at Arlington National Cemetery have measured
JFK's plot there in case the family were to decide to seek
permission from President Clinton to bury the late president's son
there.
</P>
<P>
   And while the presence of a body is central to the Catholic
funeral rite _ a symbol of the resurrection _ specialists say a
funeral Mass can be celebrated without one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The full funeral rites include the presence of the body at the
Mass and then the burial because we believe in the resurrection of
the body and we have a special reverence for it,'' O'Malley said.
``But if the body is not recovered, then certainly a memorial Mass
will be celebrated.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the Kennedy family is fully expected to emerge from the
church in the spirit that Joseph Kennedy Sr. greeted the news of
his namesake's wartime death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to carry on,'' his wife quoted him as saying in
``Times to Remember,'' her 1974 autobiography. ``We must take care
of the living. There is a lot of work to be done.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ In a corporate dining room at the Procter &AMP; Gamble
Co.'s headquarters two years ago, John E. Pepper, the chief
executive, stabbed his fork, by turns, into salad,
chicken-vegetable stir fry and carrot cake.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch, during which Pepper asked the chef to set aside a
little extra dressing for him to take home, was a carefully
orchestrated attempt to show that he was putting his mouth where
his money was _ in P&AMP;G's much-ballyhooed olestra, a fat substitute.
The salad dressing, stir-fry oil and cake frosting were all made
with olestra.
</P>
<P>
   Though olestra is approved for use only in potato chips and
other salty snacks, the menu made clear that the company's ultimate
goal was to turn olestra into a staple, just as its Crisco was a
generation earlier. It confidently projected nearly $1 billion in
worldwide sales by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Olestra did rack up decent sales last year, but the company
grossly miscalculated the size of the market. Part of the problem
was that regulatory approval was so long in coming that the fickle
cycle of consumer taste had edged away from low-fat food. P&AMP;G never
overcame olestra's image problem _ backed up by numerous complaints
that it causes stomach upset in some people. It did not help that
few companies followed the lead of Frito-Lay, which until recently
had exclusive rights to put olestra in its snacks.
</P>
<P>
   What this adds up to is that with luck, sales may hit half that
$1 billion target. P&AMP;G, under a new chief executive, admits that
olestra, an amber-colored fake fat marketed as Olean, will probably
not be the liquid gold that management once envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acknowledge the current performance isn't what we would
have liked,'' Sydney McHugh, a company spokeswoman, said. Far from
it, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Durk I. Jager, who in January replaced Pepper, now
chairman, stunned analysts and investors by disclosing that olestra
production last year at a new $250 million plant was 30 percent to
40 percent below forecasts. Plans to seek broader regulatory
approval to add olestra to foods like french fries and cookies have
been put on hold. Management simply ``cannot speculate on future
sales projections,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that olestra is a pure flop. ``Consumers have now enjoyed
more than 1.5 billion servings of snacks that are made with
Olean,'' Ms. McHugh said. The company said it remained confident in
olestra's long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay, by adding olestra versions of its already popular
Doritos, Ruffles, Tostitos and Lay's chips and calling them Wow
snacks, pulled in $347 million last year, according to Information
Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's olestra version of Pringles chips added $100
million, the company said. But all this falls far short of what P&AMP;G
dreamed of when it forecast $500 million in domestic revenue and
$400 million in international sales by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There is always the chance that just as Nutrasweet took about a
decade to catch on, olestra may one day truly blossom. ``I think
olestra still has potential, we'll just have to wait and see what
other products they introduce it into,'' said Tony Vento, an
analyst with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the backpedaling from the lofty goals is a a
testament to the struggle P&AMP; G, long known as a marketing
powerhouse, has had in coming up with the next hot brand to rev up
its slowing growth engine.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble has set a highly publicized 10-year goal of
doubling its revenues to about $70 billion by 2005. It said it
would almost certainly miss that target but was confident it would
return soon to its traditional double-digit earnings growth rate.
Analysts say that without large acquisitions, P&AMP;G will be
hard-pressed to move the needle that far.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently restructured its business to speed product
introductions, which should make it more competitive with smaller,
more nimble rivals. It recently introduced several products that
show potential, like Febreze, a spray that removes odors from
fabrics, and Swiffer, an electrostatic mop with a disposable cloth.
</P>
<P>
   With olestra, though, the question is how a company that brought
the world Tide, Pampers and Crest could have invested half a
billion dollars and about 25 years in a product that came up so
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the headline is, `The consumer has spoken,' and it's
like a political campaign that never got off the ground,'' said
Mark Godfrey, a senior analyst with the Invesco Funds Group, which
holds 1.6 million shares of P&AMP;G ``It seemed like people had a
negative perception of it right off the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that it took 15 years to develop and another
decade to gain regulatory approval from the Food and Drug
Administration. Unfortunately for P&AMP;G, by the time olestra chips
and crackers hit grocery shelves nationally in the summer of 1998,
the fat-free fad had begun to wane. In addition, olestra chips are
sold at as much as a 40 percent premium to regular chips.
</P>
<P>
   The appetite for reduced or nonfat foods has steadily fallen in
recent years, with many consumers disappointed not only by the
taste and texture of some products but also by a lack of
significant weight loss from passing up fat-packed snacks, said Tom
Vierhile, general manager of Marketing Intelligence Service,
publisher of Product Alert, a new-product publication. Annual
consumption of low-fat and fat-free snacks peaked in 1997 at 22.6
eatings per person and declined to 19.7 eatings last year,
according to the NPD Group, which tracks consumer consumption.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans have added fat back into their diets, P&AMP;G has
struggled to convince skeptical consumers that olestra snacks are
nothing like the pre-olestra cardboard-like chips and bland
crackers that had turned them off in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is this product was just too late in the
trend,'' Vierhile said. ``The momentum in this just seems to be
going away.''

FOR THE KENNEDYS, FUNERALS HAVE BECOME A POIGNANT ART FORM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the family considers final tributes for John F.
Kennedy Jr., it has a rich legacy of farewells on which to draw.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kennedys, with their stunning string of services for
those who have died too young or very old, funerals have become a
poignant art form that weaves a touch of the patriotic, political
and very personal into the framework of the Roman Catholic Mass.
</P>
<P>
   During the last four decades, members of one of the nation's
most famous dynasties have been remembered in rites marked by
majesty as well as moments of mirth.
</P>
<P>
   Moving rhetoric has stood side by side with singing by the
family's virtual court musician, crooner Andy Williams. And there
have been bits that some might consider mawkish, as in the 1998
funeral of Michael Kennedy, who was killed in a skiing accident,
when a choir sang ``Michael, Row the Boat Ashore.''
</P>
<P>
   The powerful are often present or at least represented. When
matriarch Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy died at age 104 in 1995, Pope
John Paul II sent a telegram of condolences, which was read by
Cardinal Bernard Law during the service at Old St. Stephen's Church
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In planning a service for JFK Jr., for which neither the date
nor place has been announced, the Kennedys also may be considering
the wishes of his wife's family, who lost two daughters in the
crash Friday night off Martha's Vineyard _ Carolyn Bessette Kennedy
and Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Kennedys' penchant for sometimes media-heavy rites
figured in a statement from the Bessette family Monday, which said
in part: ``John and Carolyn were true soul mates, and we hope to
honor them in death in the simple manner in which they chose to
live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' however, is not an adjective always associated with
anything the Kennedys do, be it funerals or less solemn events.
And, anyway, as family friend and columnist Mary McGrory once
wrote: ``The Kennedys have a way of overwhelming their in-laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a search for human remains and wreckage continued
Tuesday, a family source said the Kennedys, many of whom have
remained since the weekend at the family compound at Hyannis Port,
Mass., were discussing arrangements for a memorial service. New
York, where JFK Jr. and his wife lived, is the likeliest venue for
a service, and it would not be held before Friday, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr.'s sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, has generally
shunned high-profile appearances and may favor as low-key a service
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg has remained in New York, at her home near
Bridgehampton on Long Island, since returning quickly Saturday from
an Idaho vacation. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., flew to New
York to visit Schlossberg on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic archdiocese
of New York, said Tuesday afternoon that the church hierarchy had
not been approached by the Kennedy family regarding a service.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said it was ``certainly possible'' for a memorial Mass
to be held without the presence of human remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens literally every day,'' said Zwilling. ``You are
praying for the repose of the soul'' of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Because the graves of President Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy
Onasis are in Arlington National Cemetery, there has been
speculation that whatever remains of JFK Jr. and his wife may be
found could also be buried there.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said he had no comment on the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who is married to
a Kennedy, was acting as unofficial liaison between the government
and Kennedy family on ``a number of matters.'' Those apparently
include arranging whether President Clinton will attend a memorial
service, which depends on how expansive the family decides the rite
will be.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1963, the nation and, in many cases, the world have
witnessed a succession of Kennedy funerals _ from the grand to the
grandmotherly.
</P>
<P>
   For President Kennedy, of course, his funeral was a state
occasion _ with royalty and rulers of more than 100 nations in
attendance at the pontifical low Mass in St. Matthew's Cathedral in
Washington. But there were intensely personal moments, as when
Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston, at the conclusion of the
service, interpolated his own affection for the martyred president
into the final words of the service: ``May the angels, dear Jack,
lead you into Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   The body of the Mass was in the then-traditional liturgical
Latin. Just five years later, the service of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, D-N.Y., in St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue in New
York, marked not only a changed world but also a different Roman
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Second Vatican Council, RFK's funeral Mass
was in English, and the fire and brimstone of the old service _ the
``Dies Irae'' or ``Day of Wrath'' section of the requiem _ was
omitted.
</P>
<P>
   Music for the service included the New York Philharmonic,
conducted by Leonard Bernstein, playing a movement from Gustav
Mahler's ``Fifth Symphony'' and family friend Andy Williams singing
``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, for the funeral of Michael Kennedy, a son of
Robert and Ethel Kennedy, Williams sang ``Ave Maria'' in Our Lady
of Victory Church in Centerville, Mass., near the family's Hyannis
Port compound.
</P>
<P>
   The family also is often participants _ active or inadvertent _
in the obsequies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous picture of JFK Jr. was taken when he was
3 years old and he saluted his father's coffin on that chill
November day in Washington almost 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest national public memories of former Rep.
Joseph Kennedy III, D-Mass., was as a 16-year-old helping to carry
the coffin of his father into St. Patrick's in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years ago, Michael Kennedy's 14-year-old son led
his father's shiny mahogany coffin out of the family's parish
church on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   During Michael Kennedy's funeral, members of the congregation
said, then-Rep. Kennedy provoked laughter with the story of an
impromptu family football game in which the field of play ranged
from inside his apartment and out onto the lawn. On the first down,
a call for a pass sent the ball flying through an unopened window _
and quickly ended the game.
</P>
<P>
   And Kennedys use funerals to shape the historical view of their
family and loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   At RFK's service in 1968, as opposition to the war in Vietnam
intensified and tore apart the family's beloved Democratic Party,
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, by then the only surviving son, eulogized
his brother:
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond
what he was in life: to be remembered simply as a good and decent
man who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to
heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.''

CINCINNATI: going away.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company's other headache is that olestra has a huge image
problem to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Snacks containing it are required to carry what is arguably the
most unappealing food product label in history: ``Olestra may cause
cramping and loose stools.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer has been dogged by a consumer advocacy group,
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, that has
successfully reminded consumers at every turn of the possible ill
effects from munching olestra snacks.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, which as a condition of its approval required P&AMP;G to
track and report consumer reports of adverse reactions to olestra,
says nearly 16,700 complaints have been received by the company and
by the public-interest group, which has been independently
monitoring possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, olestra molecules, made of soybean or cottonseed
oil heated to high temperatures and blended with sugar, are too
large to be broken down in the digestive system. That is why they
add no calories. But the substance inhibits the absorption of
vitamins A, D, E and K, as well as nutrients like carotenoids,
which some researchers say help prevent cancer. Olestra products
are fortified with vitamins but not with carotenoids.
</P>
<P>
   The company contends that olestra causes no more stomach upset
than beans or broccoli. It has sought to position olestra as
natural and healthy, using farmers in ads and showing soy beans to
connote wholesome goodness. But P&AMP;G seems to have fallen short in
persuading enough consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very different to create brand awareness for a product
than it is for just an ingredient,'' said Clive Chajet, president
of Chajet Consultancy in New York, which advises corporations on
brand-building strategies. ``With Tide, P&AMP;G doesn't talk about what
kind of soap it uses in the flakes. They talk about what Tide is as
a brand. P&AMP;G controls every single aspect of the Tide image, but
they do not control the ultimate image of Olean as an ingredient in
someone else's brand.''
</P>
<P>
   While P&AMP;G sells Pringles olestra chips, analysts said
Frito-Lay's Wow snacks were the real yardstick because they
accounted for more than two-thirds of olestra sales. The Wow line,
they say, has already peaked.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of Wow's sales came from consumers trying the
product out. Though Frito-Lay, a unit of Pepsico &UR;  &LR; Inc., says repeat
use remains high, demand is dropping sharply as fewer new consumers
switch to the products, analysts say. Volumes of Wow products
declined 43 percent in the eight weeks ended June 20 from the
period a year earlier, according to a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
analysts' report.
</P>
<P>
   While P&AMP; hoped that other snack makers would rush to add olestra
to their lines, that has not happened. Nabisco Foods, which sold a
version of its Ritz and Wheat Thins crackers containing olestra in
test markets more than a year ago, said it had no current plans to
roll them out nationally. Nabisco declined to give a reason.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G clearly had loftier expectations: the company included a
picture of olestra products, including fat-free Ritz crackers, in
its annual report last year under the heading ``new to the world
brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Another snack maker, General Mills Inc., tested olestra in its
Bugles chips and has not decided whether it will sell them
nationally. Since the deal that granted Frito-Lay exclusive rights
to use olestra expired in May, only two mid-size snack makers, Utz
and Herr's, have added chips containing olestra.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble says more olestra products are in the works.
The company said it had signed contracts with more than a dozen
companies besides Utz and Herr's that were interested in using
olestra. The company declined to name them, however, and said not
all of the interested snack makers were expected to ultimately
introduce additional olestra products.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G is not entirely dependent on competitors to push olestra.
The company said it might add the ingredient to some of its other
food lines, like Eagle snacks. The company has asked the FDA for
approval to extend the salty snack category to microwave popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   But ``that's about as off-trend as you can get,'' said Vierhile
of Marketing Intelligence. ``If you look at the popcorn industry,
the big trend in the past two years has been extra butter. You
can't get enough butter on microwave popcorn.''

STARS MANAGEMENT BANKING ON REVENUE SPIKE FROM STANLEY CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two days after the Stars won the Stanley Cup, delirious hockey
fans so swamped the souvenir shop at the Dr Pepper StarCenter in
Irving that the store's computer suffered a meltdown and orders had
to be taken by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was organized hysteria,'' Stars director of merchandising
Steve Shilts recalled. ``We were going as fast as we could, but
there was still a 2 1/2 wait just to get in the shop.''
</P>
<P>
   The last month of the playoff run accounted for nearly one-third
of all Stars' merchandise sales for the year, Shilts said, one sure
sign of championship frenzy and the cash-register-ringing impact it
has had on the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   There are others.
</P>
<P>
   Stars season-ticket renewals are projected at 95 to 96 percent,
and 800 people are on a priority waiting list for season tickets
for 1999-2000, up from 450 on the list last year. The club's 14,000
season-ticket limit is being pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Stars owner Tom Hicks said the franchise's success on and off
the ice is the culmination of a business plan hatched when he
bought the team nearly four years ago. The plan: Invest now, reap
dividends later.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to win the Cup was millions of dollars in annual
financial losses since Hicks bought the club, largely because of a
player payroll that hit $39.4 million last season. Now, finally,
the reaping has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of dreamed it would work this way,'' Hicks said during
the Finals. ``The reality is, it's a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate financial impact on the Stars came from
playoff-ticket revenues and merchandise sales. That revenue will
cut the club's expected year-end losses, which could have exceeded
$10 million without the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big lift for us,'' Hicks said. ``We'll lose
several million dollars this year, but we could've lost quite a bit
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the team's play, the Stars' financial performance has shown
steady improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said that when he bought the team in 1995, it generated
about $350,000 per game in total revenues from ticket, merchandise
and concession sales. That figure rose to about $800,000 per
regular-season game this year, he added, and increased each round
of the playoffs. Team president Jim Lites said the Stars took in
about $1.8 million per game during the Stanley Cup Finals, although
the team didn't keep all of that revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While Stanley Cup mania has eased somewhat since the frantic
days after the victory against the Buffalo Sabres, the benefits
continue for the Stars franchise as the club looks to move into the
American Airlines Center, where it will have premium seating,
suites and more sponsorships to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Cup, said Stars vice president of marketing and
promotion Jeff Cogen, should help sell premium seats and season
tickets in the new arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good ball rolling down the hill,'' Cogen said,
``but this is an accelerator, a catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said capturing the Cup ``cemented the bond we need to have
with our fans. We'll sell out every game next year, and I think
we'll sell out every game the year after that. By the time we move
into the American Airlines Center, we should have a great tradition
of hockey in Dallas. We ought to be a showcase franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Of greater long-term value, the Stars' playoff success will help
broaden interest in hockey in North Texas through greater
youth-league participation, club officials said. It should also
increase the value of Hicks' planned regional sports TV network.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing interest in hockey in Fort Worth-Dallas was evident from
the Stars' playoff TV ratings, which set records for local
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge. That's the most significant thing that could
happen,'' Lites said. ``People took the time to watch, even if it
was casually, in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The rising fan interest, Hicks said, has helped allow him to
build a championship team. Stars fans, he said, have been willing
to pay the ever-rising ticket prices to attend the team's games,
generating much of the revenue necessary to cover the club's
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, the Stars hope to hold the line on payroll, and
perhaps even reduce it, by shedding some higher-priced veterans and
replacing them on the roster with talented younger players who earn
less.
</P>
<P>
   Like all NHL clubs, the Stars are extremely dependent on ticket
sales for revenue because the league's national TV contract pays
each club only $4 million a year _ a pittance compared with the
rights fees received by teams in other pro sports. Stars
season-ticket prices increased 11.75 percent on average last year
and are going up again next season, with the estimated average hike
only slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the success of the Stars has been a true partnership
between Tom Hicks and the fans because we've both had to pay,''
Hicks said. ``Our payroll when I bought the team was under $20
million, and it's over $40 million today. The prices of our tickets
have gone way up, but not enough to cover the payroll we've got. So
these fans are my partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Stanley Cup has had long-term benefits for other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Avalanche won the Stanley Cup the year they
relocated from Quebec, and that helped spur interest in the Denver
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went all the way that first year, it created new
hockey fans,'' Avalanche spokesman Jean Martineau said. ``We had a
pretty good core of fans before we came here because there had been
an NHL team previously \Rthe Colorado Rockies\S. But winning the
Cup really enlarged our fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks expects interest in the Stars to continue to rise, too, so
long as the team continues to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we disappoint them,'' he said, ``I think they'll stick
with us.

WORLD TRADE GROUP AGREES ON SPLIT TERM FOR DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Members of the World Trade Organization resolved a
prolonged and bitter dispute over who would be their next leader
Tuesday by agreeing that the two finalists will share the job in
consecutive three-year terms, with the New Zealand candidate going
first, followed by his Thai rival.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, which had been gathering support in the last few
weeks, was introduced Tuesday at the organization's decision-making
General Council. It is likely to be formally approved on Friday,
representatives said.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, it would end a struggle that had pitted Mike Moore,
a former New Zealand prime minister, against Supachai Panitchpakdi,
a Thai deputy prime minister, to head the 134-nation organization
that sets the rules of global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And, though the dividing lines were not always neat or clearly
drawn, the leadership struggle also pitted Western economic powers,
many of whom supported Moore, against Asians and others in the
Third World, who saw Supachai's candidacy as a way of gaining some
equality in international councils.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of both candidates agreed that the trade organization
had worked its way out of an embarrassing and potentially crippling
episode in its young history. ``No one pretends that this is an
ideal solution, but it is certainly the most practicable,'' said
Iftekhar Chowdhury, the representative from Bangladesh, which first
proposed the idea of a divided term.
</P>
<P>
   The previous director general, Renato Ruggiero of Italy, who
left the post at the end of April, served a four-year term after an
initial fight over his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which had supported Moore and was privately
accused by some countries of trying to sabotage Supachai's
candidacy, said it was satisfied with the outcome. ``We accept this
knowing that we have to move forward with the trade agenda,'' said
Rita Hayes, the American representative at the trade organization.
``These are two very qualified individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   A formal announcement of the sharing arrangement was partly
dependent on negotiations over who would become the deputy
directors general in various world regions. But even if
disagreements arose over these posts, representatives said, the
split-term arrangement for director general would not be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to fill the top post had been threatening the smooth
functioning of the Geneva-based trade group. The director general
oversees a staff of 500 and has the power to appoint arbitration
panels in trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The main question surrounding the split-term compromise was on
who would go first. Last week, the Thai government helped expedite
a solution by announcing that Supachai could take the second term,
and that broke the last significant obstacle to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted that the meeting today reached a conclusion on
term-sharing,'' Supachai said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, Moore will take over on Sept. 1 and serve
through Aug. 31, 2002. Supachai's term would start the following
day and finish on Aug. 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's first priority will be to guide negotiations for the
coming round of global trade talks scheduled in Seattle at the end
of November.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Moore quipped that his best qualification for
the job ``is that I look like Rocky'' _ the nickname of Ruggiero.
But at 50, Moore is 19 years younger than his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   He has held a number of New Zealand government posts, notably a
brief tenure as prime minister in 1990. ``I was there such a short
time it made Gerald Ford look like Franklin Roosevelt,'' Moore
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on how the deputy director general posts will be
filled remain a potential source of conflict in the trade
organization, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old GATT structure, there were two deputies, one from
the United States and the other from India. Another deputy position
was added and filled by a Latin American _ from Mexico _ in 1993.
Two years later, when Ruggiero was named as director general of the
new World Trade Organization, the number of deputies grew again
when a South Korean was named a deputy.
</P>
<P>
   With the Europeans relinquishing the top slot, which they held
throughout the history of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, they are anxious for a deputy post. But many developing
nations are similarly intent on getting deputy posts for Asia,
Africa and Latin America. The United States also wants a deputy.
</P>
<P>
   The math adds up to five deputies, three more than the trade
organization had planned. For now, the proposed compromise
indicates the need for ``equitable geographical balance'' in the
deputy selection, but interpreting that phrase is certain to lead
to a lot of hard bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how to deal them out,'' Pakistan's trade
envoy, Munir Akram, said. ``They're important because it's like
having a sympathetic ear in the court. It's somebody you can pick
up the phone and talk to if there's a problem.''

WGBH MAY FACE PENALTIES IN DONOR LIST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ WGBH-TV, whose practice of exchanging donor lists
with the Democratic Party prompted a furor over public
broadcasting, could face retroactive penalties, several House
Republicans said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A House Commerce subcommittee addressed the list-swapping
controversy at a hearing, questioning top officials of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting about how widespread the
practice is. Members of both parties demanded strict laws to
prevent similar trading in the future, especially as officials
revealed for the first time that 26 of 75 public television
stations surveyed so far swapped donor lists with politicians or
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Representative W. J. ``Billy'' Tauzin of Louisiana, chairman of
the subcommittee that oversees funding for public broadcasting,
said future violators could be punished with a fine or even jail.
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility of punishing past offenders was also raised.
Representatives Christopher Cox, a Republican from California, and
Barbara Cubin, a Republican from Wyoming, favor investigating WGBH
and issuing sanctions if wrongdoing were found. Tauzin also said he
would not oppose investigating the previous activity at WGBH, even
though the station claims to have implemented tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress may decide to sanction the stations individually, by
witholding federal funds for a period of time,'' said Ken Johnson,
a spokesman for Tauzin.
</P>
<P>
   The statements came as public broadcasting officials revealed
that at least seven public stations _ including New Hampshire
Public Television _ swapped donor names with Republican groups,
including the 1996 presidential campaign of former Senate majority
leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy at first focused on exchanges with Democratic
organizations, as disclosures that WGBH traded donor lists with the
Democratic National Committee fueled Republican suspicions that
public television is biased toward liberals.
</P>
<P>
   But in answering questions from subcommittee members about the
nature of the list-swapping, Robert Coonrod, president of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, was careful to point out the
practice included both sides of the political aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bipartisan nature of these transactions begs the ethical
question: Should public stations that receive federal financial
support deal in this way with any political entity?'' Coonrod said
in his prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, the
top Democrat on the subcommittee, agreed: ``I think it was clear
today that members on both sides understand that both parties
engaged in practices which should not be permitted. The more
extensive the search becomes, the more instances in both parties
will be identified.''
</P>
<P>
   In documents provided to Democrats on the panel, the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting identified seven stations that exchanged
donor lists with Republicans: KCET in Los Angeles, WKNO in Memphis,
KCPT in Kansas City, New Hampshire Public Television and Iowa
Public Television.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Goen, a spokeswoman for KCET, said the Los Angeles
station did purchase names from Republican entities but never sold
its own lists of donors to either political party.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for New Hampshire Public Television could not be
reached Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the controversy is whether public stations
violated their tax-exempt status by making their resources
available to one political party over another. KCET said because it
did not make its lists available to political parties it did not
commit any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But broadcasting officials and subcommittee members Tuesday
clearly were interested more in public perception than the letter
of the law. Ervin Duggan, the chief executive officer of the Public
Broadcasting Service, dismissed the idea that stations were
exonerated if they employed ``list brokers,'' outside companies to
sell and buy their donor lists. And Coonrod said that even if
list-swapping is legal, ``public broadcasting cannot afford, either
in appearance of in fact,'' to undermine the trust of its
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Coonrod apologized repeatedly for the entire imbroglio, saying
list-swapping was ``such a manifestly stupid thing to do.'' At the
same time, both Coonrod and Duggan said the issue of list-swapping
should not jeopardize overall funding for public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Before the controversy erupted last week, Tauzin supported a
significant increase in funding for public broadcasting, including
authorizing money to help public stations make the transition to
digital broadcasting, which they are required by law to do by 2003.
Now, that funding increase appears unlikely, and the $250 million
public broadcasting has received in annual appropriations in recent
years may not increase at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the funding will not be addressed until the hearings have
ended in September at the earliest. In the meantime, aides said the
Internal Revenue Service is expected to investigate the
list-swapping to determine if the stations violated their
tax-exempt status. Cox also requested a report from the General
Accounting Office, although aides in other congressional offices
said such a report could take more than a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Markey said, the question of punishing WGBH and
other public stations would be moot until any investigation had
taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did they do wrong? They didn't break any laws,'' he said.
``I think that would first have to be established before we talked
about the penalites for something that has yet to be determined as
the offense. There isn't any indication at this point that they
did.''

   Chris Rock/``Bigger &AMP; Blacker'' (DreamWorks)
</P>
<P>
   Comedy records are usually good for a single spin before they're
passed to a friend. The widely popular Rock tries to give his third
album, which shares its title and some material with his recent HBO
special, some shelf life by placing his biting urban approach in a
hip-hop context. The often entertaining results include straight
stand-up, sketches and parody songs with cameos from various
musical types such as Ice Cube, Biz Markie and Gerald Levert. With
rap producer Prince Paul, Rock retools the Rolling Stones' ``Brown
Sugar'' while successfully adding his own spin to the recent Baz
Luhrmann hit ``Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen).'' But the
selling point is when Rock takes the gloves off and lands a few
well-placed blows on the topics of race, relationships and even
Social Security (``Black people should get Social Security at 29.
Black people don't live that long _ hypertension, high blood
pressure, NYPD.'') 3 stars

   Benny Green/``These Are Soulful Days'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   Pianist Green helps Blue Note celebrate its 60th anniversary
with this appealing album of songs made famous by the label's
artists. The selections are superb _ two from Horace Silver
(``Virgo,'' ``Come on Home'') and single selections from masters
such as Joe Henderson (``Punjab'') and Lee Morgan
(``Hocus-Pocus''). Green often takes on rhythmic support duties,
allowing former band mate Russell Malone to shine on guitar. Shine
he does _ ``Come on Home'' features what may be his most exciting
playing to date. Christian McBride fills out the trio, anchoring
the grooves with his bright bass playing. This is a joyful session
that begs for repeated playings. 3{ stars

</P>
<P>
   These splendid live recordings _ the first from 1965, the second
from a 1998 concert at Saratoga Performing Arts Center _ are more
than a showcase for Argerich's volcanic power and technical
exactitude, though they most certainly are that. The Argentine
pianist's unbridled joy seems etched in every groove of Chopin's
Polonaises and Mazurkas; like an expert, single-minded marathoner,
she holds back just enough juice to finish these melodic endurance
tests with a powerful kick.
</P>
<P>
   Her duo with Nelson Freire on Liszt's single-movement ``Concerto
pathetique'' shows Argerich's equally formidable tag-team skills,
as the two pianists hammer their way through the harmonic thickets.
Sandwiched between thoughtful, probing performances of Prokofiev's
jaggedly modernist ``Quintet, Op. 39'' and Bartok's aggressively
ethnic ``Contrasts'' for piano, violin and clarinet, Liszt's pushy
virtuosity shows its true 20th-century colors. 3{ stars

influenced by the Velvet Underground, Mazzy Star and the
Tindersticks, the trio touches a hard-to-reach nerve with its
wistful delivery and melancholic mood. Bolstered by such quietly
powerful cuts as ``Every Time I Try'' and ``Nobody Has to Know,''
Spain's marvelous sophomore set seeps under the skin almost before
you realize it. 3{ stars

   Paris Combo/``Paris Combo'' (Tinder)Between the resurgence of
interest in weird French pop geniuses like Serge Gainsbourg and the
rise of Francophile artists Pink Martini and April March, it's been
a good time to sing with a beret and a funny accent. Paris Combo,
though, is the real thing _ French folks singing a croissant-fueled
take on various Europop currents of the past few decades. The more
swinging stuff, with muted trumpet, sounds like a French-fried
Squirrel Nut Zippers, while other songs pull in the gypsy-jazz
influences of Django Reinhardt, cabaret and even the occasional
film noir soundtrack. Fun and entertaining enough, but may remind
some American tastebuds of escargots. 2{ stars

   Various/``More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album''
(Birdman)
</P>
<P>
   The recently unearthed ``Oar'' was the visionary _ and very
strange _ solo work of Skip Spence's final days as part of the
seminal San Francisco band Moby Grape. This definitive reissue
contains the initially overlooked album's dozen tracks plus 10
bonus numbers, including five mostly so-so song fragments seldom
heard. The often sad, disturbing music here, produced and performed
by Spence immediately following a six-month stay in a psychiatric
ward 31 years ago, has earned legendary status among collectors due
to its naked emotional clarity and jarring weirdness. A twisted
lo-fi masterpiece, ``Oar'' often sounds like something excavated
while bizarre standouts like ``Grey/Afro,'' ``Cripple Creek'' and
``War in Peace'' sneak up on the listener with lasting power. {
</P>
<P>
   The tribute album ``More Oar'' accomplishes something rare.
Instead of asking for note-for-note remakes, the inventive producer
Bill Bentley had longtime fans of the late Spence's album,
including Beck, Peter Buck, Robert Plant, Mark Lanegan, Alejandro
Escovedo, Robyn Hitchcock and Greg Dulli, interpret the material,
which is sequenced in the same order as the original disc. Played
side-by-side, ``Oar'' and ``More Oar'' make for a solid,
thought-provoking but always entertaining experience. 3 stars

   Chicago's Verve Pipe emerged from the ether three years ago to
score hits with oddly affecting songs such as ``The Freshmen,''
``Photograph'' and ``Cup of Tea.'' The fine self-titled new disc,
due Tuesday, continues the yearning yet appealing themes of the
quintet's earlier work, put across by Brian Vander Ark's
distinctive vocals and Donny Brown's hard-hitting percussion. If
it's instant pop gratification you're after, songs such as
``Hero,'' ``Headlines'' and ``She Has Faces'' deliver, while other
tracks provide food for thought. 3 stars

 &HT;    Rudolph search still very active, FBI says
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ A year after suspected Atlanta Olympic Park and
Birmingham, Ala. abortion clinic bomber Eric Robert Rudolph came
out of hiding, then quickly disappeared again, the federal task
force searching for him in the rugged Appalachians reiterated its
commitment Tuesday to keeping up the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In their first news conference in more than three months, task
force officials warned Rudolph not to get comfortable, that agents
aren't leaving the area any time soon _ even with the team's top
agent retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Task force chief Woody Enderson, who retires next month after a
28-year career with the FBI, said during the briefing that there
have been Rudolph sightings since last July and that he believes
agents have prevented other bombings by keeping the suspect
cornered in western North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident as long as we maintain the pressure that he
will not be free to commit any more violence,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He declared that ``nothing has changed,'' that the fugitive will
be hunted until he's caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it happens while he is 32 years old or 62, we will be
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson introduced Steven C. McCraw, the man who will replace
him next month as the chief inspector for the task force. McCraw,
45, had FBI tours in Tucson, Ariz., Dallas and Los Angeles before
moving to FBI headquarters in Washington in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7 last year, Rudolph came out of hiding and allegedly
stole food and other supplies from a local resident. Nearly 300
searchers descended on the Nantahala community but failed to corral
the fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains where investigators say they believe Rudolph is
still hiding, life goes on. Pink mimosas bloom in the thick woods,
and rafters ride the nearby Nantahala River. Hikers on the
Appalachian Trail have been warned to be on the lookout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize it's very, very possible that we could have
walked right by him and didn't see him,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is charged with the July 27, 1996, bombing at Atlanta's
Centennial Olympic Park; the 1997 bombing of an Atlanta abortion
clinic; the 1997 bombing of The Otherside Lounge in Atlanta; and
the fatal 1998 bombing at a Birmingham abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said there are more agents attached to the command post
now than a year ago, despite reports that only a dozen or so people
remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about three times the number that we had when he
surfaced here last July,'' Enderson said. ``At that time, we had 20
to 30.'' However, the number of tactical searchers is less than
this time last year.

AT LEAST 28 PBS STATIONS SHARED DONOR LISTS WITH POLITICAL
ORGANIZATIONS

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At least 28 public television stations have
exchanged the names of their donors with political organizations
affiliated with either or both of the major political parties,
according to a partial survey made public Tuesday by officials for
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The practice appears to extend as far back as 1981 and to be
most prevalent in the nation's major markets. And while it may not
be illegal, public television officials acknowledged Tuesday that
it was wrong and undermined their credibility and the public trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew it,'' Robert Coonrod, president of the corporation,
said at a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday as he and other public
broadcast officials were called on the carpet by both Republican
and Democratic members of Congress. Ervin Duggan, president of the
Public Broadcasting Service, admitted the practice was
``inappropriate, embarrassing and downright stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous that the reports of list swapping with political
organizations could endanger their federal funding, the officials
were quick to say that they would cooperate with congressional
calls for an independent review of the fund-raising practices of
the nation's 353 public television stations. The federal government
provides nearly 15 percent of the industry's $2 billion annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they would not punish any of the stations
retroactively. Rather, they said, they would require the stations
to certify from now on that they are not violating the Internal
Revenue Service code that requires nonprofit organizations to make
their donor lists available to all political organizations equally.
</P>
<P>
   That promise was not enough for members of Congress,
particularly Republicans, who said the list-swapping with political
organizations was bad enough to require new controls and to force
the eventual privatization of public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Bird is nearly 30 years old, and it's time to leave the
federal nest,'' said Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla. Rep. Barbara
Cubin, R-Wyo., said that public broadcasting's tax-exempt status
``should be revoked, and Congress should phase out public
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of cases of publicly financed stations giving
their lists of donors to political organizations is probably much
larger than the 28 cited Tuesday because the corporation said it
had surveyed only 75 of the 353 stations. It did not identify the
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Coonrod said that of the 75 surveyed, 53 had used list brokers
as intermediaries to exchange their donor lists with other
non-profit organizations. He said the motive appeared to be to
raise money efficiently, not partisan politics. He also said that
the stations traded names not only with the Democratic National
Committee, as has been reported, but with Republican organizations
too, including Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican organizations with which stations exchanged
lists included the Viguerie Fundraising Superfile, the Conservative
Republican Superfile, Country Club Republicans, Golden Aged
Republicans, Republican Party Builders and Great American Donors.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat-linked organizations, apart from the national
committee, included Handgun Control Inc., Planned Parenthood and
Zero Population Growth.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who is chairman of the subcommittee on
telecommunications, which held Tuesday's hearing, appeared less
eager than some of his colleagues to cut back the funding. But he
said he would introduce legislation to make it illegal for stations
to make their lists available at all, directly or indirectly
through intermediaries, to any political organization or
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move appears to have strong backing from members of both
parties, but Democrats clearly hoped that their support for new
controls would mitigate Republican calls for slashing federal
funding. Tuesday's hearing indicated that next year's allocation,
which is to be set by Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, could
become a major partisan battleground.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The top Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Edward Markey of
Massachusetts, said list-swapping with political organizations was
``inappropriate and should be prohibited.'' But, he said, the
disclosures should not prompt Congress to ``starve'' the public
stations. Doing so, he warned, would force the stations to seek
more commercial support and give more air time to commercial
underwriters, spoiling what he said was ``an electronic oasis in
the vast wasteland of commercial broadcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was prompted by the disclosure last week that four of
the biggest public television stations in the country _ in New
York, Washington, Boston and San Francisco _ had exchanged their
donor lists with the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The swapping was uncovered after the mother of a 4-year-old boy
in Wellesley, Mass., sent a $40 contribution to WGBH in Boston to
support its children's programming. Shortly thereafter, the boy
received a solicitation letter from the Democratic National
Committee, prompting the Boston Globe to investigate the station's
fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the corporation's failure to exact any penalty from
the stations that gave their lists to political organizations,
Coonrod said that public humiliation was enough. ``Public
humiliation, given the fact that we operate on the basis of trust
with our viewers and listeners, is pretty bad,'' he said.

 &HT;    Downloadable music hits high notes at conference
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you can imagine a place where Amazon.com is
considered an established retailer, then you might have some idea
of the uncertainty and opportunity felt by the attendees at Jupiter
Communications' fourth annual Plug.In conference going on this week
here.
</P>
<P>
   This is where 1,300 Internet-hungry music mavens have gathered
to discuss the intensifying buzz over digital downloading of music
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The very idea has some music industry executives quaking in fear
of piracy, but others are pouring money into the concept, including
Atlanta-based Cox Interactive Media, which recently bought a 10
percent stake in MP3.com, the Website in the center of the vortex.
</P>
<P>
   As the record industry tries to make order out of chaos, MP3.com
prepares to launch its initial public offering as early as today,
expecting to collect around $300 million on its 12.3 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com is one of the most popular sources of news, information
and free digital music downloads available on the Web. It has the
audience the record companies look for, although it hasn't turned a
profit yet. Cox Interactive Media, a unit of Cox Enterprises,
pumped $45 million into it, believing it would be the business
center where profits begin as the digital music download gold rush
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's investment in MP3.com comes at a time when the music
industry is looking for established media partners to lend their
experience as well as their databases of users and customers to
help it identify and market to potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of merging databases of music lovers with databases
of online shoppers is something the record industry is eager to
experiment with. Cox and MP3.com have said they plan to build new,
independent sites, which may well incorporate some of the
strategies as well as the security and copyright protection devices
being discussed and displayed at this conference and touted as the
keys to online success.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Internet was invented, its creators were not thinking
about e-commerce,'' said Francois Xavier Nuttall, founder and chief
executive officer of AudioSoft, ``and especially not music
commerce. It's very sophisticated and you need an international
framework and technical devices to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly twice as many music industry executives as last year are
attending this conference. They want to find out how to make music
merchandizing on the Web profitiable for themselves and fun for
their customers without cutting into the business of music stores
or deprive artists of royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Dowloadable digital music is the final frontier in the world of
electronic commerce. Part of the reason it's been so late in coming
is not just security and copyright issues, but the sheer number of
parties involved who all want to profit: retailers, record
companies, musicians and consumers, who want still more ways to buy
music in a way that's quick, inexpensive and fun.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout at conferences such as this one seems to indicate
the recording industry wants to adapt, or as analyst Mark Mooridian
put it, ``to stop worrying and learn to love MP3.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3 demonization obscures the greater marketing profits and
start-up initiaves,'' Mooridian told the standing-room only
audience. He said today's market was for ``physical online sales''
of prerecorded material, but he said the industry will eventually
move toward digital downloads as a source of online sales. ``It's
more efficient and will make people more money.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to find anyone here who doesn't want to make
money from digital music downloads. The debates and the arguments
arise over how to do it without compromising any aspect of the
industry as it now exists.
</P>
<P>
   BMG CEO Strauss Zelnick said in his keynote address, ``It will
create new products.Hopefully, a standard recording device will
emerge. We love this. It creates a new demand for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick said it was time for the music industry to seriously
consider the best ways to sell downloadable music on the Web. He
also dismissed the notion that piracy would eat into any potential
online profits. ``Even with the piracy we have now, we are still a
billion-dollar industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He told the crowd change was invevitable, but the industry would
certainly not be destroyed by MP3 or any other digital download
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment is going to change. New technology will vastly
improve our products. The Internet is an amazing tool for
communication,'' Zelnick said. ``It can enhance our creativity, but
it cannot replace it.''

<P>
   Hoover's Inc. has seen its main business grow 145 percent a year
since 1995 and has been in existence for almost a decade. It has
little debt and nearly turned a profit last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it's an Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which sells data on more than 14,000 public and
private businesses and institutions, priced its shares at $14
apiece on Tuesday night, raising over $40 million in its initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   While the offering did not generate the buzz that many Internet
companies have created lately, financial analysts say Hoover's may
be around long after the high fliers fall back to earth. They note
that along with its strong record of producing Hoover's Handbook, a
staple of libraries, and a CD-ROM, the company has moved
aggressively to deliver information over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock begins trading on Wednesday, investors will have
a chance to determine how valuable that information is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm for the stock is not the same tone'' as that of
some recent initial offerings, said John Fitzgibbon, a stock
analyst at Redherring.com who says he uses Hoover's frequently.
Shares of Gadzoox Networks Inc., for example, more than tripled on
Tuesday in their first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's sold 3.25 million shares, giving the company a market
value of $160 million. That valuation does not count 6.9 million
more shares that can be issued through stock plans or outstanding
warrants.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Austin, Texas, already had some weighty
investors. Among its largest stockholders are a Time Warner
subsidiary, and a company backed by Michael Milken, the former
Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond chief, which just bought a 9
percent stake for about $7.25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's now gets more than 80 percent of its revenue from
Hoover's Online, its Internet Web site (www.hoovers.com). The
company estimated that it had 30 million page views by 2 million
different people in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those used Hoover's free services. But the company says
it has 29,000 individual subscribers and 1,300 more corporate and
academic accounts. They pay fees ranging from $109.95 a year for
individuals to between $1,500 and $30,000 for institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's Internet sales soared to $7.7 million in the fiscal
year ended March 31, nearly double the level of the previous year.
Total sales were $9.2 million in the most recent fiscal year, with
the balance coming from CD-ROMs and publications. Though Hoover's
posted a $2.2 million net loss for the fiscal year, up from $1.8
million the year before, losses for the two most recent quarters
narrowed from year-earlier periods.
</P>
<P>
   Not that valuation comparisons mean much for Internet stocks,
but the company's numbers stack up well against those of some
competitors. Marketwatch.com, which has a market value of $600
million, had sales of $7 million last year, but a $12.4 million
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's plans to use $10 million from the offering for
marketing purposes. The remaining $30 million will be used to
expand its online products and for general corporate purposes. The
marketing and online expenses will cause operating losses and
negative cash flow ``for the foreseeable future,'' the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Fleming, an analyst with Renaissance Capital, in Greenwich,
Conn., likes the company but notes that it will have to fight to
get the attention of institutional buyers. ``Lots of Web companies
are coming public and competing for attention with other web
startups,'' Fleming said. ``That's been the main concern about
Internet IPOs; there are a lot of them, potentially too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's warnings about future losses, Hoover's
would have turned a profit in the quarter ended in March if it had
not expensed certain noncash stock compensation. The marketing
campaign ``more than likely means losses for the next few
quarters,'' Fleming said. ``Right right now, it is about building
brand equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge Universe LLC, whose primary investors include Milken,
his brother Lowell, and Oracle Corp. chief executive Lawrence
Ellison, has agreed to spend $2 million on Hoover's services, along
with taking a stake in the company. Geoffrey Moore, a senior vice
president at Knowledge Universe, said, ``We don't make short-term
investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's also sold a 2 percent stake last month to NBC, a unit
of General Electric Co., for $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Books Inc., a Time Warner unit, owns 22 percent of
Hoover's, while Media General Inc., the Richmond, Va., newspaper
publisher, owns 19.7 percent. Directors and executive officers hold
11.1 percent. All of the insiders are generally prohibited by the
lead underwriter, J.P. Morgan, from selling their shares for 150
days.

MCCAIN GETS PLEDGE OF FALL DEBATE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Miss., Wisc., Vt., S.D., Ky.)  (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Tuesday dropped his
threats to force an immediate Senate confrontation over campaign
finance legislation after winning a commitment from Senate leaders
to hold a full debate no later than mid-October on an overhaul of
the law governing campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   After originally pressing for the debate this week, McCain
called the plan a ``reasonable compromise'' under which Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, would allow for the first time
a full-scale debate on the issue across five days with amendments
to be voted on freely.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wisc., said they were hoping
that an unfettered amendment process would allow them to build
support and gain the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster against
their bipartisan legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, for his part, by promising a debate no later than Oct. 12,
avoided an immediate clash that could tie the Senate up in knots
for days when it is trying to pass the annual spending bills. And
he secured a commitment from the two men that they would bring the
issue up only that one time this year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation sponsored by McCain and Feingold would ban the
unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties known as
soft money. It would also put some restraints on issue advocacy ads
that are thinly veiled commercials designed to support or oppose a
particular federal candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill won a majority vote in both the House and
Senate last year, its sponsors had only 52 supporters in the
Senate, eight short of the 60 needed to break a filibuster. McCain
said he thought he now had 54 votes, ``but we are still not at 60
and I have no illusions about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact it was unclear how many of McCain's allies would have
supported him if he had moved ahead with his threats to tie up the
floor. Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., said Tuesday that he had agreed
to work with McCain but added, ``to try to get it done these next
two weeks would not be a productive move.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have staunchly opposed McCain's bill, saying
it violates constitutional guarantees of free speech. Republicans
also traditionally raise more in soft money than Democrats do.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold said they had not yet decided whether to
begin the autumn debate with the same bill as last year or whether
to strip the legislation down to a core that would ban soft money
and see what other provisions could be added through amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy could prove risky. Ranit Schmelzer, a
spokeswoman for Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, said
he considered the McCain-Feingold bill ``the bare minimum. If they
start talking about taking apart the pieces that becomes a problem
for us.'' Democrats have provided the vast majority of the votes
for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   And while McCain said an amendment to raise the current $1,000
limit on individual donations to federal candidates might draw more
Republican votes, Feingold said he would oppose such a provision.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has led the opposition to the
bill, said that it was ``reasonable to assume'' that he would
launch a filibuster against the legislation again ``if the bill
resembles the form it has been in the past.''

   Chris Rock/``Bigger &AMP; Blacker'' (DreamWorks)
</P>
<P>
   Comedy records are usually good for a single spin before they're
passed to a friend. The widely popular Rock tries to give his third
album, which shares its title and some material with his recent HBO
special, some shelf life by placing his biting urban approach in a
hip-hop context. The often entertaining results include straight
stand-up, sketches and parody songs with cameos from various
musical types such as Ice Cube, Biz Markie and Gerald Levert. With
rap producer Prince Paul, Rock retools the Rolling Stones' ``Brown
Sugar'' while successfully adding his own spin to the recent Baz
Luhrmann hit ``Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen).'' But the
selling point is when Rock takes the gloves off and lands a few
well-placed blows on the topics of race, relationships and even
Social Security (``Black people should get Social Security at 29.
Black people don't live that long _ hypertension, high blood
pressure, NYPD.'') 3 stars

</P>
<P>
   Pianist Green helps Blue Note celebrate its 60th anniversary
with this appealing album of songs made famous by the label's
artists. The selections are superb _ two from Horace Silver
(``Virgo,'' ``Come on Home'') and single selections from masters
such as Joe Henderson (``Punjab'') and Lee Morgan
(``Hocus-Pocus''). Green often takes on rhythmic support duties,
allowing former band mate Russell Malone to shine on guitar. Shine
he does _ ``Come on Home'' features what may be his most exciting
playing to date. Christian McBride fills out the trio, anchoring
the grooves with his bright bass playing. This is a joyful session
that begs for repeated playings. 3{ stars

   Martha Argerich/``Chopin: Piano Works: The Legendary 1965

</P>
<P>
   These splendid live recordings _ the first from 1965, the second
from a 1998 concert at Saratoga Performing Arts Center _ are more
than a showcase for Argerich's volcanic power and technical
exactitude, though they most certainly are that. The Argentine
pianist's unbridled joy seems etched in every groove of Chopin's
Polonaises and Mazurkas; like an expert, single-minded marathoner,
she holds back just enough juice to finish these melodic endurance
tests with a powerful kick.
</P>
<P>
   Her duo with Nelson Freire on Liszt's single-movement ``Concerto
pathetique'' shows Argerich's equally formidable tag-team skills,
as the two pianists hammer their way through the harmonic thickets.
Sandwiched between thoughtful, probing performances of Prokofiev's
jaggedly modernist ``Quintet, Op. 39'' and Bartok's aggressively
ethnic ``Contrasts'' for piano, violin and clarinet, Liszt's pushy
virtuosity shows its true 20th-century colors. 3{ stars

influenced by the Velvet Underground, Mazzy Star and the
Tindersticks, the trio touches a hard-to-reach nerve with its
wistful delivery and melancholic mood. Bolstered by such quietly
powerful cuts as ``Every Time I Try'' and ``Nobody Has to Know,''
Spain's marvelous sophomore set seeps under the skin almost before
you realize it. 3{ stars

   Paris Combo/``Paris Combo'' (Tinder)Between the resurgence of
interest in weird French pop geniuses like Serge Gainsbourg and the
rise of Francophile artists Pink Martini and April March, it's been
a good time to sing with a beret and a funny accent. Paris Combo,
though, is the real thing _ French folks singing a croissant-fueled
take on various Europop currents of the past few decades. The more
swinging stuff, with muted trumpet, sounds like a French-fried
Squirrel Nut Zippers, while other songs pull in the gypsy-jazz
influences of Django Reinhardt, cabaret and even the occasional
film noir soundtrack. Fun and entertaining enough, but may remind
some American tastebuds of escargots. 2{ stars

   Various/``More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album''
(Birdman)
</P>
<P>
   The recently unearthed ``Oar'' was the visionary _ and very
strange _ solo work of Skip Spence's final days as part of the
seminal San Francisco band Moby Grape. This definitive reissue
contains the initially overlooked album's dozen tracks plus 10
bonus numbers, including five mostly so-so song fragments seldom
heard. The often sad, disturbing music here, produced and performed
by Spence immediately following a six-month stay in a psychiatric
ward 31 years ago, has earned legendary status among collectors due
to its naked emotional clarity and jarring weirdness. A twisted
lo-fi masterpiece, ``Oar'' often sounds like something excavated
while bizarre standouts like ``Grey/Afro,'' ``Cripple Creek'' and
``War in Peace'' sneak up on the listener with lasting power. {
</P>
<P>
   The tribute album ``More Oar'' accomplishes something rare.
Instead of asking for note-for-note remakes, the inventive producer
Bill Bentley had longtime fans of the late Spence's album,
including Beck, Peter Buck, Robert Plant, Mark Lanegan, Alejandro
Escovedo, Robyn Hitchcock and Greg Dulli, interpret the material,
which is sequenced in the same order as the original disc. Played
side-by-side, ``Oar'' and ``More Oar'' make for a solid,
thought-provoking but always entertaining experience. 3 stars

   Chicago's Verve Pipe emerged from the ether three years ago to
score hits with oddly affecting songs such as ``The Freshmen,''
``Photograph'' and ``Cup of Tea.'' The fine self-titled new disc,
due Tuesday, continues the yearning yet appealing themes of the
quintet's earlier work, put across by Brian Vander Ark's
distinctive vocals and Donny Brown's hard-hitting percussion. If
it's instant pop gratification you're after, songs such as
``Hero,'' ``Headlines'' and ``She Has Faces'' deliver, while other
tracks provide food for thought. 3 stars

 &HT;    NetBank down 12%; earnings fail to hit target
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Net.Bank failed to meet analysts' expectations in its
quarterly earnings report Tuesday. Its shares dropped 12 percent,
closing at $27.06 1/4, down $3.68 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The company said a weak market for technology stocks hurt its
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Alpharetta-based Net.Bank earned $768,000, or 3 cents per share.
Analysts had expected 4 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank's net interest income for the three months ending June
30 was $4.7 million, an increase of 204 percent over the year-ago
period. Net.Bank said its non-interest income was $232,000, up 123
percent from the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank said it had 39,000 accounts, an increase of 114 percent
since Jan. 1 and 11 percent since June 9.
</P>
<P>
   D.R. Grimes, Net.Bank chief executive, said, ``The market, and
Internet stocks in particular, were down, and we're an Internet
stock. It doesn't have a lot to do with performance.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Keane, who covers Net.Bank for BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, said the stock dropped because the company did not meet
analysts' published expectations. Still, Keane maintains a ``buy''
rating on Net.Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Keane said the company's interest income was less than what he
expected, but accounts grew by $15 million more than Keane had
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Norcross-based CheckFree, which took a 23.7 percent
hit in June when three large banks announced they were forming a
competing company, have started a slow climb back to
pre-announcement levels.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree, which processes electronic payments, closed at $31.37
1/2, down 75 cents. But shares are up 9 percent since falling from
$37.68 3/4 to $28.75 June 23. CheckFree shares are up 34 percent
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Craft, an analyst with EOffering, maintained a
``hold/sell'' rating on CheckFree.

 &HT;    Safety program takes aim at Ohio employers
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ At Hohman Plating &AMP; Mfg., a metal treating
company in Dayton, Ohio, officials constantly look for better ways
to insure the safety of workers who coat products for automotive
and aerospace companies and other customers.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Art Hattan, Hohman sales manager and spokesman, said
the ``Safety Works for You!'' program announced Tuesday in Columbus
by the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation might have something to
offer the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly worth taking a look at,''Hattan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company expects to send a representative to an Aug.
10 town meeting at the Dayton Convention Center to be hosted by the
bureau. The meeting, which will go from 8 a.m. to noon, is one of
12 being held around the state. It is geared toward employers but
is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Through $4 million in grants, low-interest loans of up to
$50,000 and other ingredients, the safety program is aimed at
reducing workplace injuries that cost Ohio employers $1 billion
annually, said James Conrad, bureau administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau usually aids workers after they're injured on the
job. The safety program is an effort to stop injuries before they
happen, Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . We're so sure that safety works for you that we're
putting our money where our mouth is,'' Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are for employers who participate in the bureau's
Drug-Free Workplace program and for employers who want to prevent
``cumulative trauma disorders'' such as back pain, tendinitis and
carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In the drug program, private sector employers are eligible for
2-1 matching grants up to a maximum of $5,000 from the state. With
the employer's $2,500 share, this would mean a total of $7,500.
Public employers are eligible for 2-1 matching grants up to $10,000
from the state _ which means a total of $15,000 with the employer's
$5,000 contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau will award private and public employers 4-1 matching
grants of up to $40,000 to study and prevent cumulative trauma
disorders. With $10,000 from the employers, this could total
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hattan said Hohman, at 814 Hillrose Ave., might be interested in
applying for the grants but also could seek help with another issue
_ the full face shields that workers are required to wear to comply
with requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   While the shields are supposed to protect the workers, they're
not comfortable and it's a continuing struggle to persuade
employees not to take them off, Hattan said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety program's loan grants could not be used to find a
solution to this issue, but the company might qualify for one of
the loans, said J.C. Benton, a bureau spokesman. The bureau also
will provide consultants to help employers with concerns such as
the face shields, Benton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton area, the bureau program will help efforts already
under way by the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, said John Husted,
chamber vice president for business and economic development. The
Dayton-Miami Valley Safety Council, an affiliate of the National
Safety Council, is housed in the chamber, Husted said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help what we're already doing,'' Husted said. ``We
are, on a continuing basis, trying to help businesses tap into
safety resources and understand how a good, strong safety campaign
within an organization is a cost-saving investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is spending $250,000 on television and newspaper
advertising and brochures to promote the program, bureau officials
said.

PANEL RECOMMENDS NEW ALLOCATION SYSTEM FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an attempt to settle a bitter economic and
scientific feud over who should get donated organs, a panel of
independent experts on Tuesday recommended that scarce livers be
distributed across broad geographic areas so that the sickest
patients receive them first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current system of organ procurement and allocation works
reasonably well,'' Dr. Edward Penhoet, who chaired the panel at the
Institute of Medicine that drafted the report, said in a prepared
statement. ``But significant improvements in both its fairness and
effectiveness could be made.''
</P>
<P>
   The report comes 15 months after the Clinton administration
ordered the United Network for Organ Sharing, the private
organization that runs the allocation system, to revamp its system
so that organs are shared more broadly across city and state lines.
But the network complained so vigorously that Congress delayed the
regulation until Oct. 21 and asked the Institute of Medicine, an
arm of the National Academy of Sciences, to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   With the long-awaited report now in hand, Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services, said on Tuesday that she
would revise the regulation so that the rule can quickly be put
into effect. ``The bottom line is clear,'' Shalala said in a
statement. ``Changes are needed to better serve patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, Congress will have the final say. If the
moratorium is not lifted by Congress by Oct. 21, Shalala can put
the rule into place. But already, Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.,
has introduced legislation that would give the organ sharing
network, not the government, control over allocation policies.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's report, a carefully-worded 210-page document, is
as Solomon-like as the dispute it is intended to resolve. It looked
at the use of donated livers _ as opposed to hearts, lungs, kidneys
or pancreases _ because that is where the shortage is most severe,
and found that the current system is ``reasonably equitable for the
most severely ill.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the authors noted, the severely ill make up only 20 percent
of those on the liver transplant waiting list. And at the same
time, the report said Shalala is justified in demanding more
widespread organ sharing. Specifically, it called for the nation to
be broken up into regions of about nine million people each, with
organs distributed to the sickest patients first within each
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the net result of this will mean that more
transplantation will occur in the most medically urgent
situations,'' Penhoet said to reporters in making the report
public. While patients who are less sick will inevitably have to
wait longer, the panel said its proposal would not adversely affect
them.
</P>
<P>
   The institute initially intended to release the report on
Thursday. But with so much interest in its findings, several news
organizations, including the New York Times, obtained draft copies
of the report independently. That prompted the institute to make
the study public on Tuesday. Within hours after the study was made
public, both sides pronounced themselves vindicated. ``The system
is fair,'' said Margo Akerman, a kidney transplant recipient and
vice president of the organ sharing network. ``It is time to
withdraw the regulation, rethink it and rewrite it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shalala countered that the panel's findings ``strongly
validate the concerns which HHS has had about the present system,
and they support the approach we have put forward for improving
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Human organs are the nation's scarcest medical resource. An
estimated 62,000 Americans are currently waiting for a heart, lung,
liver, kidney or pancreas, and 4,000 people died last year before
they could get one. So intense is the fight for access to organs
that last year, when Shalala announced her plan, some states
responded by passing laws that prohibited organs from being shipped
to hospitals in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, which has been in place since Congress
passed the National Organ Transplant Act in 1984, patients are
ranked according to the severity of their sickness. The nation is
divided into 62 local areas, which range in size from a few
counties, to entire states, to several states, and range in
population from 1 million to 12 million. Those 62 areas are lumped
into 11 regions. When an organ becomes available, it is offered
locally first. If a matching patient is not found, it is then
offered regionally.
</P>
<P>
   But the waiting time varies greatly from area to area and region
to region. In announcing the new rule last year, the government
noted that a patient with Type O blood in need of a liver
transplant in New York City might wait 511 days for a transplant,
while a patient in the same category might wait only 56 days in
nearby Newark, N.J. Shalala said her goal was to even out those
waiting times.
</P>
<P>
   But the 16-member panel of scientific experts, which did not
include transplant surgeons because the institute did not believe
they could be objective, found that the discussion of waiting time,
``which has dominated the policy debate, is a poor measure of
differences in access to transplantation.''
</P>
<P>
   In analyzing records of 68,000 liver patients who were on
waiting lists between 1995 and the beginning of this year, it found
that the times were relatively even, about three or four days, for
the sickest patients. The authors recommended that decisions about
whether less urgent patients should receive organs be based soley
on medical criteria, as opposed to how long they have been waiting.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the panel concluded that the network needs to
make better information available to the public so that the system,
in Penhoet's words, can become ``much more transparent.'' The
current perception, he said in an interview, is that organs are not
distributed fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The authors also urged the government to create an independent
panel to exercise greater authority over the organ sharing network,
which is run primarily by transplant surgeons who have vigorously
opposed any changes to the current system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of transplant surgeons running their own
business out there,'' said Nancy Neveloff Dubler, a bioethicist at
Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx who served on the committee.
``It's the chicken coop theory of oversight.''

   NEW DELHI, India _ Twenty Hindus were killed in three incidents
before dawn on Tuesday in what is feared to be a stepped-up
campaign of hit-and-run tactics by Muslim insurgents in remote
areas of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst attack left 15 dead in Lihota, a village in the
forested Himalayan foothills of Doda District 90 miles northeast of
the Kashmiri winter capital of Jammu.
</P>
<P>
   Five of those killed were members of a village defense committee
that was armed, the police said. The authorities have set up dozens
of such militia groups to prevent raids in vulnerable areas, but
the brigades may themselves now be targets. The other 10 victims,
including eight women, were believed to be committee members'
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   India has been bracing for a violent backlash by militants after
two months of furious fighting along the northern frontier of
Kashmir between Indian armed forces and hundreds of infiltrators
who had built bunkers in mountaintop positions above a strategic
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Those infiltrators, which India believes to be a combination of
Pakistani army regulars and Muslim guerrillas, have been defeated,
although sporadic fighting continues.
</P>
<P>
   That ``humiliation'' is now driving the Pakistani-backed
fighters to mount new attacks, said the chief minister of Jammu and
Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah. The killings in Lihota ``demonstrate the
level of frustration among militant ranks and expose their sinister
designs to curb peace and tranquillity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the two other incidents, heavily armed guerrillas attacked a
labor camp in Poonch District and killed four men, the police said.
An Indian soldier also died in a rocket attack on an army post in
Poonch.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, an Indian news agency reported that government
forces in Poonch had retaliated against the militants, killing
five. That could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Violence again seems to be increasing in Kashmir, where, by
conservative estimates, 24,000 people _ half civilians _ have died
in a decadelong insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in Lihota represent the fourth mass killing in three
weeks. On July 1, nine Hindus, including a 100-year-old and his
90-year-old wife, were killed in the village of Ari. Two days
before, 15 Hindu laborers were killed in the village of Sandhu. The
police said Muslim militants were responsible in the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, however, 15 Muslims were killed in Poonch. The
police said those deaths were a result of infighting among militant
factions.
</P>
<P>
   Several militant groups operate in Kashmir. They do not always
agree on religious beliefs or military tactics, and there are
rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   According to Indian authorities, a majority of the insurgents
are no longer native to Kashmir. They are said to come from
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt and other Islamic nations.
The fight for Kashmir, in dispute by overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan
and predominantly Hindu India for 52 years, is viewed as a jihad by
the so-called mujahadeen, or holy warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The militants and Indian authorities have repeatedly been
accused of human rights violations. Scores of well-documented cases
are in the record.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch has in the last week issued a report that
criticizes both sides, but especially focuses on the Indian army.
The rights group accuses the army of continued abuses, summary
executions of suspects, indiscriminate shootings, rapes and arsons.
The report notes that the army has consolidated its control over
the Kashmir Valley and says the ``brutal tactics'' used there in
the early 1990s were being instituted in areas like Poonch and
Doda, where the militants operate with more frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggravating the situation, the army has recruited
ex-servicemen, who for historical reasons are almost exclusively
Hindu, to serve in village defense committees that assist the army
in military operations,'' the report said. ``In Doda and the border
districts, where the population is nearly evenly divided between
Hindus and Muslims, there is a growing concern that tensions
between the two communities might ignite a wider communal
conflict.''

   Smoking settlement spending stirs debate
</P>
<P>

   C. 1999 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Renovating the state morgue in North Dakota.
Repaving sidewalks in California. Bailing out states' debt in New
York and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas on how states should spend their share of $206 billion
from a federal settlement with tobacco companies range from the
bizarre to the expected. And many have little to do with tobacco
prevention or anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio will soon unveil its recommendations on how to spend nearly
$10 billion from the settlement. The state, which will get the
money over the next 25 years, expects receive its first check _
$120 million _ next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio will likely spend its money in more conventional ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggestions: Repair Ohio's aging school buildings, finance
health care for the working poor, provide tax cuts, increase
technology at universities and fund anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco prevention experts on Tuesday at the Midwestern
Legislative Conference told lawmakers and officials from 11 states
that they should spend large chunks of their money to keep kids
away from cigarettes and other tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the opportunity exists for you to attack the Number
One preventable cause of death in this country,'' said Peter
Fisher, of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids. ``The
opportunity is in your hands I just hope you seize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio lawmakers will decide how to spend annual payments ranging
from $323 million to $422 million. A task force assembled by Gov.
Bob Taft is close to recommending how to spend the money. Groups'
requests are expected to exceed the $10 billion Ohio will receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of suggestions and it's important we
listen to all of the ideas,'' said Ohio House Speaker Jo Ann
Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Major tobacco companies agreed to a ``master settlement
agreement'' last November and experts say the amount could grow
beyond $206 billion.
</P>
<P>
   State governments then had to fight Washington for the money.
U.S. Sen. George Voinovich, Ohio's former governor, led an effort
in Congress to block the Clinton administration from using any of
the tobacco money to support Medicaid and other health care
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The states won that battle, but some officials say federal
lawmakers will still try to keep money from state governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sentiment in Washington that `we let the states
have $206 billion so now we can take away some of their welfare
money, we can take away some of their Medicaid money,''' said Mike
Dawson, Voinovich's press secretary. ``This fight is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Spending the money on anti-smoking programs is especially
important in Ohio, which leads the nation in smoking among males
and is third among all adult smokers, according to a 1996 Centers
for Disease Control study. Nearly 20,000 people die in Ohio each
year from smoking-related illnesses such as heart attacks and lung
cancer, according to the Ohio Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy of ideas on how to spend the money reaches far beyond
the Midwest. Many states plan to use large portions on projects
other than anti-tobacco programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles mayor has proposed using some money to repave
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island's governor wants to use the money to help eliminate
a car tax.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana, Idaho and New York may use tobacco settlement funds
to reduce state debts.
</P>
<P>
   And in North Dakota, the governor has talked about using part of
the proceeds to renovate the state's morgue.
</P>
<P>
   A few states _ Maryland, Virginia, Florida, Montana, Maine,
Arizona, Minnesota and Washington _ have agreed to use large
portions of their settlement funds for anti-tobacco efforts,
according to a survey by the American Heart Association and the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe morgue construction is the best way to spend the
money,'' said M. Cass Wheeler, chief executive officer of the
American Heart Association, ``because approximately 1.2 million
kids start smoking each year.''

 &HT;    Jackets eager to challenge 'Noles
 &HT;    By J. C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The conversation seems to come up every year.
Each season that Florida State has ruled the ACC, it seems some
team gets the, uh, honor of being tabbed to make a charge at the
Seminoles' dominance.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Georgia Tech, 10-2 a year ago, gets the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Yellow Jackets quarterback Joe Hamilton said
Tuesday at the ACC Kickoff. ``They're no Goliath. ... But you have
to understand, just being picked to challenge them doesn't mean you
will beat them. You have to go out there and beat them yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto, adds Tech coach George O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity down there,'' the fifth-year Jackets
coach, who is 0-4 against FSU, says of the Sept. 11 game at
Tallahassee. ``But it's funny, our kids really love playing that
game. They really love getting after that type of team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think you sneak up on them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for certain.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Virginia have taken more stabs at being the
designated Seminoles slayer. Albeit, not with any success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've haven't been able to pull the trigger,'' coach Carl
Torbush laments about the Tar Heels, who are 0-7 against FSU in
conference play, and three times have finished as ACC bridesmaids
to the 'Noles.
</P>
<P>
   The Heels are not alone in their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the ACC in 1992, FSU is 54-2, with five outright,
unbeaten league titles, and twice has shared the trophy with a
single loss.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia did stop the Seminoles' 31-0 ACC start with a 33-28
upset in 1995, and North Carolina State stunned FSU 24-7 last
season. But with the Seminoles returning 16 starters from a team
which played for the national championship, there's little wonder
Tech's chances of reversing the ACC's fortunes are not deemed good
by most.
</P>
<P>
   In a preseason media poll, FSU received 84 of 87 first-place
votes with Tech receiving the other three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until somebody is able to do it, they're still who they are,''
Torbush said. ``I've said it time and time again: `It's not like
they're going to get worse. Everybody has to get better, or get
whipped.'''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, this will be the best Georgia Tech team since 1990
when the Jackets won a share of the national championship.
Hamilton, a contender for the Heisman Trophy, is a proven winner
who commands an impressive, diversified offense (2,255 yards
passing, 2,021 rushing yards in `98), with a strong stable of
running backs and talented, speedy receivers.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Tech surrendered a lot of yards last season (397 per
game), but played many younger players during second-half blowouts.
The added experience should mean improved depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can compete with everybody I've seen in the Top
10,'' O'Leary said. ``Now, whether you can beat them or not, that's
the difference. (But) right now we're very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   To topple FSU, however, the Jackets, who played the `Noles close
for three quarters but lost 34-7 last season after Hamilton was
injured, will have to overcome two hurdles _ one mental, the other
physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just believing you can win, that's the biggest thing about
playing Florida State,'' Hamilton said. ``You just have to be the
one (team) on that given day to go down there and do it. That's the
bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the other part of the beat-FSU-equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play them because its a contact game,'' O'Leary
said. ``They play it the way it's supposed to be played and I enjoy
playing football that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better go in ready to play: Tape 'em tight, buckle your
chin straps. That's the way you beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, O'Leary put his team through a physical spring
practice. All designed for one purpose _ to beat Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach O'Leary doesn't do things without letting you know
why,'' Hamilton said. ``He told us we needed to be a more physical
team.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They came with votive candles, handwritten poems,
American flags and video cameras. Since last Saturday, when the
news broke that John F. Kennedy Jr. was missing over the sea off
Martha's Vineyard, people have been flocking to this cobblestone
street in lower Manhattan where Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, lived during their three years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, the sidewalk in front of 20 N. Moore St. had
become so clogged with visitors that more than a dozen police
officers were called in to control the flow of the mourners and the
merely curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep it moving, folks,'' an officer kept yelling to the crowd.
``Limit yourself to one picture and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   A ring of wooden barricades hemmed in the throngs as well as the
phalanx of television reporters from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those in the crowd, like Leslie Hogan, 57, discreetly
wept as she laid a bouquet of roses on the growing floral shrine.
Although she never met him, Ms. Hogan, a flight attendant for Delta
Airlines, said she felt an indescribable kinship with Kennedy. ``I
was 27 when he was born, and I remember everything about his
life,'' she said. ``His life is interwoven with the fabric of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Raisa Mammon, 60, an immigrant from Russia, said she came out
from Brooklyn to pay her respects to the son of a president who
meant so much to her. ``Kennedy was such a good man,'' she said in
halting English. ``When he died, all the workers cried. I feel so
sad for this boy, so, so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who stopped to read the handwritten tributes or
pose for a snapshot in front of the shrine were tourists excited by
the scene; others simply wanted to witness a bit of history.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Cerbo drove in from New Jersey with her daughter after
spending the last three days watching television coverage about the
Kennedy plane crash. ``I just wanted to be here,'' she said after
asking a stranger to take a picture of her and her 15-month-old
daughter, Gianna Marie. She laid three white carnations on the
pile, and released a white balloon.
</P>
<P>
   A single mother who is studying computers, Ms. Cerbo, 29, said
she believed her generation had missed out on the excitement and
the momentous tragedies of the 1960s. ``Until now, I felt that
nothing major had happened in my lifetime,'' she said. ``This is
really history in the making, and I want me and my daughter to be
part of it.''

A FRATERNITY OF PILOTS MOURNS A COLLEAGUE

<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, N.J. _ At the Essex County Airport, the last spot on
earth that John F. Kennedy Jr. walked, well-wishers brought flowers
and hand-penned messages over the last couple of days, and pilots
talked of him as if he was one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief time, Kennedy was a member of an exclusive club of
those for whom the romance of flying is bound up tightly with all
the precision and paperwork that taking to the skies demands. It
was from this airport that Kennedy took off on Friday evening, as
he had many times since he bought his six-seat Piper Saratoga II HP
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, his plane plunged into the waters off Martha's
Vineyard, presumably ending his life and that of his wife Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy and sister-in-law, Lauren G. Bessette, who were
flying with him. But here at the airport, where everyone shares the
love of flight, it was difficult to find critics of Kennedy's
decision to take off after sundown, even though he had limited
experience flying at night, when a dependence on instrument
readings is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was inexperienced,'' said Richard Duffy, 51,
a court clerk who drove in the middle of the day to the Essex
Airport, where he took flying lessons several years ago, because he
felt some affinity with the fellow pilot. ``How do you get
experience except by flying?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying at night is very different from flying in the daytime,
but I don't know what happened up there,'' he said. ``Accidents
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators continue to try to find out whether Kennedy's
plane went down because of equipment failure or pilot
disorientation or other problems. But at the airport, which has
been besieged by journalists looking for scraps of evidence about
the plane crash, the members of the flying fraternity were more
prone to judge him as a member of their group _ one who constantly
has to make split-second decisions thousands of feet up in the air
_ rather than as the only son of a slain president who may have
been caught up in the family curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody makes mistakes,'' said Mark Schachtel, 40, a pilot
for Executive Jet, a charter jet company out of Columbus, Ohio, who
had just flown a corporate jet into Essex County Airport. ``That
doesn't mean you're a bad pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Schachtel, who said he flew into Martha's Vineyard the following
Saturday, refused to criticize Kennedy, even though he said he
himself would not have flown that route at night if he had little
training in instrument reading.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County Airport, about a 20-mile drive west of Manhattan
straight out of the George Washington Bridge, is home to about 350
planes, most of them small private ones like Kennedy's. Owned by
the Essex County Improvement Authority, the airport is spread over
278 acres and dotted with buff-colored hangars housing several
aviation companies that offer flight lessons, rent spaces for
planes and provide maintenance and charters. Every year, officials
said, 251,000 planes take off and land here.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who work at the airport knew Kennedy well enough
to nod hello, as they saw him coming and going or stopping by the
pilot shops. They bristled at the rush to judgment about Kennedy's
decision to fly at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people haven't flown with him, they don't know his skill
level,'' said Edward Gacio, a pilot who was behind the counter at
Caldwell Air Service. ``They didn't see his logbook. That's like
someone saying you're a horrible driver because you're a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy kept his single-engine, six-seat Piper at the southern
end of the airport, a nook protected from the west by a grove of
trees, in an area operated by Airbound Aviation. Tuesday,
Airbound's owner emerged from his office to put a letter in the
mailbox, and politely declined to discuss the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not, out of respect for the family,'' he said,
before going back behind a padlocked chain-link fence. ``John was a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   In an area near the Air Traffic Control tower at the airport,
well-wishers had set up a makeshift memorial.
</P>
<P>
   One sign read: ``John John, Carolyn and Lauren: You were here
last. Now you join JFK with our Almighty Father in the skies
above.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose someone from your community, it's sad,'' Gacio
said. ``People here knew him. He was a pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   But should this accident serve as a reminder about the hazards
of piloting a small plane? Gacio took umbrage at the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Rollerblading in the streets of Manhattan safe?'' he said.
``Probably not, but people do it. It's no more hazardous than
anything else you do in life. As long as you stay within the
confines of the envelope, you're fine. If you don't ... well, we
still don't know what happened.''

<P>
   In the minds of the experts, home networks could become one of
the next gold rushes in technology, all based on a new level of
residential convenience that could prove infectious.
</P>
<P>
   And a hometown company _ Norcross, Ga.-based Home Wireless
Networks _ might become the star of that play.
</P>
<P>
   Home Wireless Networks, in business since 1996, is poised to be
one of the leaders in this service.
</P>
<P>
   Already allied with Lucent Technologies, one of the HWN
investors, Home Wireless' equipment is now being tested by
BellSouth and other regional phone companies for compatibility with
the phone network. If they like it, the phone companies could
decide to market the technology along with their phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   An integral part of the HWN effort is Lucent Technologies, an
early investor in the technology, which stands ready to add its
market muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent already supplies many kinds of equipment to phone
companies, such as its own wired home systems, and already has the
big name, the sales force and the ear of distributors to get the
merchandise moving. If the phone companies give the green light for
accepting home wireless systems, Lucent will be able to add that
equipment to its sales inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we mostly deal in wired systems now, which are being
installed in new subdivisions, the wireless systems will certainly
be important for existing houses and for people who prefer that
system for its flexibility,'' said Jim Messenger, a spokesman for
Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   By adding wireless networks to its catalog of items, Lucent will
be able to cover the market better, he said. The market for
communications equipment for the home is huge. Forrester Research,
which examines many technology issues, says that the home market
amounted to more than $22 billion in 1998 and has plenty of
potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the major phone companies, in their competition with
cable companies and other communications purveyors, will benefit
from carrying systems that make dependable phone lines more
productive.
</P>
<P>
   What home wireless networks do is extend the use of a phone line
dramatically by allowing several computers to get on the Internet
through one line or to use a single printer. Therefore, for
example, instead of using two cheap printers, one for each
computer, wireless interconnection gives the option of buying a
quality printer with access to several computers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the way it works: A base unit, much like the base unit of
a portable phone, is attached to the phone wire where it enters the
house. This unit can send signals with information from the
telephone wire to facsimile machines or from the Internet to
computers and also send fax and data from computers out over the
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The system can also be set up to allow computers to exchange
information within the house, such as swap computer files, or share
a computer game that would be available for several people to play
at once.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that new broadband access, such as cable modems or
DSL (digital subscriber line) technology from the phone company,
means that even more goodies can be brought into the house to be
shared over a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   The technology used by HWN was put together by two friends,
Stuckey McIntosh and Richard Snelling, back in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They adapted it from Digital Wireless Corp., a company that
specialized in cordless phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh, the idea man, became the initial chief executive,
supported by Snelling, a veteran phone industry man from BellSouth.
A bit later, he came aboard to be the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company has just begun to make shipments to smaller vendors
and independent phone companies who have signed contracts to be
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   An average home wireless system by HWN costs about $620, but
more elaborate systems to handle up to five phone lines, go for
$1,100.
</P>
<P>
   HWN is not alone in introducing home wireless-type technology.
</P>
<P>
   Others moving into the field from different market directions
include Tut Systems in Pleasant Hill, Calif., and Epigram in
Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, none of these companies stands to suffer much from
competition because the task at hand is to get this new technology
in front of the public and its market, and the more salesmen the
better,'' said Boyd Peterson of the Boston-based Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   Snelling, one of the home wireless founders, retired as
executive vice president of BellSouth in 1991, after 35 years in
the Bell system. He said the phone company was always searching for
``a sophisticated home gateway'' to the phone network. In many
ways, home wireless fits that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this is a wireless system makes it all the
better,'' said Snelling. ``The rising importance of the Internet as
a source of information makes home networking a convenience people
will want, and the wireless system a product for our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Snelling said he has been a student of home communications
technology ever since he observed the videotext trials conducted
years ago by Knight-Ridder, the media company.
</P>
<P>
   From Home Wireless' perspective, no city is a better home base
for launch than Atlanta, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the marketing tricks is to sell this technology to the
early adopters, the people who like to be seen with the latest Palm
Pilot and other devices,'' he said, ``and I think in that regard
Atlanta, with its growth and vitality, is an excellent place to
launch this new wireless communication.''
</P>
<P>
   And a successful launch could be the start of something really
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market will move very, very quickly, for all the existing
players and more, once the word gets out,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing is really the key,'' said Barbara Stafford, whose
job is to handle residential and business marketing for Home
Wireless Networks. ``We will be really dependent on the phone
companies to assist in the marketing and the distribution of the
wireless systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the phone companies have taken the first
step. BellSouth and the other regional phone companies, notorious
for taking a long time to clear a new technology, have at least
accepted the Home Wireless products for the extended laboratory
testing that could lead to the
</P>
<P>
   phone companies adopting it for sale and promotion to phone
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although BellSouth reserved comment until the tests are
complete, Debbie Locker, a spokeswoman for consumer services at
BellSouth, said, ``We welcome any equipment that can make our
consumers' lives better and that can help the home function as an
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, commercial and business users may lead the way to
popular acceptance of the new technology, much as they did with
wireless phones. In one of the commercial applications of the
technology, teams of consultants and contract employees will be
able show up at the office of a new client with their own
communications system. For instance, a consultant team could get
use of one phone line in the client's office, patch it into a base
unit and create a wireless network for use exclusively by the
visitors while they are there, then dismantle it when their project
is completed.
</P>
<P>
   As was true with early cellular communications, the new
technology in the hands of actual users will spawn new, real world
ideas for its use. And once the convenience is recognized and
becomes a habit, the technology will take off, driving down prices
amid competition, and then spurring still wider popularity and
accessibility.

 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak tried to reassure Yasser
Arafat on Tuesday that Israel would move to complete withdrawals
from the West Bank sooner than the 15-month target he had set for
an overall Middle East peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of his maiden voyage to Washington as the
Israeli leader, Barak was replying to complaints on Tuesday by
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, that the 15-month timetable was
unacceptable for carrying out the accords signed in Wye, Md., last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully agree with him,'' Barak said. ``There is no reason to
wait. We do intend to implement the Wye accords. I will check with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wye accords called for Israel to withdraw from another 13.1
percent of the West Bank. But that was stalled under the last prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and it has been a major concern of
the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the pressure on Arafat to get Israel to complete
the withdrawals, the Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive
Council said in Ramallah on Sunday night that the Wye accords
should be carried out in their entirety before negotiations begin
on so-called final-status talks. Those talks will address the
boundaries of a Palestinian entity, the disposition of Jerusalem
and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Barak spent most of Tuesday visiting members of Congress, where
he delivered one of the messages of his visit: that he intends to
stand firm in negotiations that he hopes to have with the
Palestinians and Syrians on not returning to the borders that
existed before the 1967 war, and that Jerusalem will remain the
capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in Congress, who were a bulwark of support for
Netanyahu, are key to the passage of the administration's requests
for financial aid to Israel _ including $1.2 billion tied to the
Wye accords that President Clinton said this week he wanted
expedited.
</P>
<P>
   Some outspoken supporters of Netanyahu said Tuesday that they
were impressed with the new Israeli leader. Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, the majority whip, said after meeting Barak that he liked
what he heard.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the House, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., released
a statement that echoed some of Barak's recent remarks, saying that
Israel _ not the United States _ should be the final decision-maker
about its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you pursue your policies of economic and political security
for Israel, we in Congress firmly believe that in the final
analysis, Israel must determine its own destiny,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's first encounter on Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning was
with 30 Jewish members of Congress, many of whom support
legislation that calls for moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem soon. Congress enacted a law in 1995 that
called on the administration to move the embassy by May 31 of this
year, but President Clinton used a waiver provision in the law to
delay the move.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress support legislation that would repeal
Clinton's waiver. But at his meeting with congressmen on Tuesday,
Barak gave a muted response to a question about the proposal, a
participant said. The prime minister said the legislation should
not be pushed now, but he added that he would not openly oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have said that mandating the move of the
embassy before negotiations are completed with the Palestinians on
the final status of Jerusalem would make the negotiations almost
impossible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak was also asked about the transfer of nuclear technology
from Russia to Iran, a congressman said. The prime minister, a
former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, gave a detailed
analysis of the seriousness of the problem and was supportive of
the Clinton administration's efforts to discourage the Russians,
the congressman said.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Barak met with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for the second time during his visit. They
discussed her scheduled trip to the Middle East, which is expected
to help set the stage for the opening of negotiations between
Israel and President Hafez Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's trip, originally scheduled for the first week of
August, was moved back to the middle of the month to give the
Israelis more time to consult with the Palestinians and the Syrians
and among themselves on how negotiations on an overall settlement
might proceed, administration officials said.

FAA WORKER'S RESPONSE PROPER, OFFICIALS, PILOTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials _ and some pilots _
Tuesday defended the actions of an FAA flight service specialist
who seemed to ignore a Friday night call from a worker at Martha's
Vineyard Airport asking about the status of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
overdue flight.
</P>
<P>
   Airport worker Adam Budd &UR;  &LR; called the Bridgeport Flight Services
Station at 10:05 p.m. about 10 or 15 minutes after the plane
piloted by Kennedy _ with his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her
sister Lauren Bessette aboard _ was due to land at Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In a transcript of the call obtained by the Globe and published
Tuesday, Budd, 21, told an unidentified FAA employee that ``Kennedy
Jr.'' was on board the flight headed to the Vineyard and that there
were people at the airport trying to find out where the plane was.
</P>
<P>
   The air traffic control specialist who took the call did not ask
whether Budd thought the flight was overdue _ a key phrase in the
precise language of aviation _ but instead told Budd that the FAA
does not give out information over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the FAA's handling of Budd's call, made 25 minutes
after Kennedy's plane disappeared from radar, might have seemed
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the country's largest general aviation
association agreed with the FAA's explanation that the call was
ignored because Budd never used the appropriate words to convey
that anything was unusual with the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The specialist who took the call ``is probably hearing someone
wanting to know where this airplane is,'' said Warren Morningstar,
director of media relations for the Aircraft Owner and Pilots
Association, an advocacy group with more than 340,000 members.
``The caller did not say the words, `There is an aircraft overdue,'
or, `It should have been here at this time.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was asking the specialist to read someone's mind and read
between the lines,'' Morningstar said. ``In the world of aviation
we deal with prescribed phrases that have specific meanings and
trigger certain responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a pilot or air traffic or flight services are up to their
eyeballs doing their jobs, it is the phraseology that jumps through
the noise and says, `Quick! Pay attention!' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under FAA training procedures, flight station service personnel
are instructed not to consider as overdue a plane that has not
filed a flight plan ``until a reliable source reports it to be at
least one hour late at its destination.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, then the FAA employee is supposed to issue an alert to
every airport within 50 miles of the plane's flight path to check
its airfield for a plane with a specific tail number. If that
search fails _ or an hour passes without all the airfields
responding to the notice _ then FAA personnel are supposed to alert
a rescue coordination center.
</P>
<P>
   Sources within the FAA say that officials want to talk to the
specialist who took the call to get his side of story, but that
they have not ruled out disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   While defending his behavior, FAA officials are upset that the
specialist did not tell his superiors about the call when it became
clear that Kennedy's plane was missing.
</P>
<P>
   High-ranking FAA officials, however, believe that the individual
followed correct procedures, particularly because Budd gave no
clear indication that the plane was overdue or in trouble and
because there was not much urgency in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   FAA policy prohibits the release of information over the
telephone unless the caller is in a position of authority _ such as
an airport manager _ or is a family member or is known to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a celebrity like Kennedy, officials might be even
more circumspect with flight information, out of concern that the
caller could be ``a nutcase or paparazzi'' or a journalist, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   FAA policy also dictates that, if the missing pilot has filed a
flight plan, a search would begin if that plan is not closed within
30 minutes of the plane's scheduled arrival time. A call to flight
services would prompt action after 30 minutes, said an FAA
official.
</P>
<P>
   If no flight plan is filed, the official said, the FAA would not
take any action for at least one hour.

AMWEST PROFITS UP 2%  
 GAINS DESPITE RISING FUEL COSTS, Y2K READINESS EXPENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
AMWEST AmWest profits up 
2% in 2nd quarter 
AMWEST By PETER CORBETT(at) 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Higher fuel prices and a $9.7 million Y2K-readiness expense
increased operating costs at America West Holdings Corp. in the
second quarter, but the carrier managed to increase profits 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe-based holding company for America West Airlines
reported earnings Tuesday of $42.2 million, or a record $1.06 per
share, a 23.3 percent increase from the second quarter of 1998. The
earnings per share are much higher than profit gains because the
company has been aggressively buying back shares of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   America West has purchased $35.8 million of its stock since it
reported first-quarter earnings in April.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted per-share earnings
of 90 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the results for the quarter ending June 30 was a
$2.7 million pretax gain on the sale of stock for Priceline.com
Inc., an Internet site for purchasing airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for America West, the ninth-largest U.S. carrier,
increased to $554.2 million from $519.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Operating costs per available seat mile increased 1 percent, due
in part to the Y2K expense and an 11 percent jump in fuel costs to
$53.1 mil lion.
</P>
<P>
   The company spent only $1.2 million in the second quarter of
1998 on preparing for the year 2000, which could affect operation
of some computers.
</P>
<P>
   A fuel-hedging program managed to save the company $1.3 million,
according to Doug Parker, America West executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost per gallon was 51.08 cents, up 3.8 percent from
a year ago. Each penny increase over a year's time costs America
West about $1 million, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Average fuel prices should increase to 55 cents per gallon in
the third quarter and 56 cents in the final quarter of 1999, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger traffic also increased in the second quarter. Revenue
passenger miles were up 4.4 percent. Revenue per available seat
mile was up 0.1 percent to 8.08 cents.
</P>
<P>
   That's despite a 4.8 percent increase in the average length of
the company's flights from 819 miles to 858 miles. America West has
been adding additional long-haul flights to key business markets.
</P>
<P>
   America West reported that the number of employees is up 6.2 per
cent from the second quarter of 1998 and salaries and related costs
increased 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other major carriers also reported profitable second-quarter
results Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, the sixth-largest carrier in terms of passengers
carried, reported earnings of $120 million, or $1.29 per share.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Southwest said it earned $157.8 million, or 29 cents per
share. &QL;

 &HT;    Teacher who traded toys faces transfer
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Cobb County school board will render a decision
this week regarding a Campbell High School teacher who traded bonus
points for Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Richard Benjamin recommended teacher Carol
Penland be transferred and suspended for 60 days after the
arrangement came to light this spring, and a tribunal of three
board members agreed with his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Penland requested the tribunal, said Betty Gray, a board member
who served on the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The full board will discuss the matter Thursday during an
executive session and take a vote later that evening, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not prepared to give up,'' said Terry Thomas, the Georgia
Association of Educators attorney who is representing Penland, who
he said has taught for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Beanie swap taught both economics and charity.
Penland, who has given extra credit to students who participated in
food or blood drives, meant to give the Beanies to foster children,
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very upset about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Penland was awarding 3 points of extra credit to students who
brought her money to buy McDonald's Happy Meals and let her keep
the Ty toys the restaurant included as part of a promotion, Gray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Students who brought in a Beanie Baby got 5 points, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The district likely will work on guidelines for extra credit,
Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a difficult decision when you want to be fair to
children and employees,'' she said.

SCENIC TOURIST TRAINS RETURN TO THE ROCKIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANON CITY, Colo. _ A century ago, it was the busiest train
route through the Rockies: a ribbon of rail down a 1,000-foot-deep
canyon, a granite gorge so narrow that at one point, engineers hung
a bridge from the walls to suspend the rails over the rushing
waters of the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   This May, for the first time since 1967, passenger trains
started running again through the ``the Grand Canyon of the
Arkansas,'' a route described by one rail buff and author, David P.
Morgan, in 1960 as ``the most arresting single scenic site in all
of American railroading.''
</P>
<P>
   With air horns echoing off the hard rock walls, the
orange-and-blue streamlined locomotives of the Royal Gorge Route
Railroad now pass through the gorge three times a day, making
24-mile round trips in two hours, with a pause on each run on the
Hanging Bridge. Looking down about 20 feet, passengers can watch
boatloads of rafters battle roiling rapids. Squinting to the sky,
passengers can spy the silvery underbelly of the Royal Gorge
Bridge, the world's highest suspension bridge, strung almost a
quarter-mile overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The return of train whistles to the Royal Gorge is part of a
nationwide renaissance in tourist railroads. Over the last 25
years, the number of tourist trains has roughly doubled, to about
200 today.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the annual peak season for railroading, as many as
five million passengers may travel on tourist trains, according to
Steve Shoe, a former director of the Tourist Railway Association, a
museum and train group.
</P>
<P>
   The leading states are California, with 19 railroads;
Pennsylvania, with 15; and Colorado, with 11. In Colorado, where
2,000 miles of track once penetrated the mineral-rich mountains,
some of the most scenic snippets survive as tourist railroads.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgetown Loop Railroad, (888) 724-5748, leaves Georgetown,
45 minutes west of Denver, and climbs through a series of loops to
Silver Plume. The Ski Train, (303) 296-4754, runs on selected dates
in late summer from Union Station in Denver through the Continental
Divide to Winter Park.
</P>
<P>
   The California Zephyr, an Amtrak train, (800) 872-7245, follows
the same route, attracting a good number of tourists. It leaves
Denver every morning in the summer at 9:20 for Utah, Nevada and
California.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the Continental Divide, the Leadville,
Colorado &AMP; Southern Railroad, (719) 486-3936, leaves Leadville, the
nation's highest incorporated town (10,152 feet), for a
high-altitude ride that affords stunning views of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Near Colorado Springs, the Cripple Creek &AMP; Victor Narrow Gauge
Railroad, (719) 689-2640, goes to the ghost town Anaconda. Also in
that area, the Manitou &AMP; Pikes Peak Railway Co., (719) 685-5401,
climbs to the 14,110-foot summit of Pikes Peak, making it the
world's highest cog railway.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Colorado, the Durango &AMP; Silverton Narrow Gauge
Railroad, (970) 247-2733, used in the filming of ``Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid,'' travels through remote areas of the San
Juan Mountains reachable only by train. Another stretch of that
historic railroad lives on today as the Cumbres &AMP; Toltec Scenic
Railroad, (719) 376-5483. Covering 64 miles and climbing to 10,015
feet, it is the nation's longest and highest narrow-gauge steam
railroad.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, a tourist-train operator hopes to restore service to a
third mountain section of the old Denver &AMP; Rio Grande Western, a
22-mile stretch between Creede and South Fork.
</P>
<P>
   With 800,000 people expected to ride tourist trains in Colorado
this summer, it is clear that these excursions attract a wider
audience than rail buffs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition, the Royal Gorge Route train, leaves at 9
a.m., noon and 3 p.m. daily from the newly restored 1913 depot in
Canon City, (888) 724-5748, an hour's drive from Colorado Springs.
As the train progresses up the standard-gauge track, the gorge
narrows and evidence appears of the Royal Gorge War of 1877, a
fierce competition between two railroad companies to get through
the gorge, a natural bottleneck, to reach the rich silver mines of
Leadville.
</P>
<P>
   On the south bank, a rail bed graded by the losing company was
later used for a wooden water pipe, which brought drinking water to
Canon City until it was abandoned in 1974. Rail workers traded
potshots from stone forts, remnants of which are visible to the
riders.
</P>
<P>
   Today's passengers, needing protection only from the sun, can
watch the passing scenery from a roofless observation car. Moving
slowly through the gorge, the train, pulled by diesel electric
locomotives, offers views of rafters fighting Class 5 rapids, one
grade below impassable. On one June Sunday, the noon train
evacuated the casualties of the rocks: two injured and one dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp-eyed riders often spy wildlife: ducklings on the river's
quieter stretches, mule deer on far meadows and, occasionally,
Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. For comfort, the train also offers
five enclosed passenger cars and, at the end of the two-hour ride,
an Italian restaurant awaits at the red-roofed Mediterranean-style
Canon City station.

<P>
   BC-OBIT-FARMER-NYT (moved on Friday, July 9)
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of James Farmer sent by the New York Times News
Service on Friday, July 9, referred incorrectly to the locations of
school closings that resulted in a protest march he led in 1959.
The march was called after schools in several Virginia communities
were closed to avoid court-ordered integration. Schools in Richmond
were not closed.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misidentified the protester who was seriously
injured by a mob in Birmingham, Ala., while trying to integrate
interstate buses. He was Walter Bergman, not William Barbee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the article misstated the affiliation of one of
three civil rights workers who were killed in Mississippi in 1964.
While Michael Schwerner and James Chaney worked with Mr. Farmer's
organization, the Congress of Racial Equality, Andrew Goodman did
not.
</P>
<P>
   The obituary also misidentified a civil rights figure who
refrained from criticizing Mr. Farmer's acceptance of a position in
the Nixon Administration. It was Roy Wilkins, executive director of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
(Roger Wilkins, a journalist and scholar, is his nephew.)

   BC-COLOMBIA-REBEL-PROFILE-NYT (moved on Sunday, July 18)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, July 18,

</P>
<P>
   The obituary of Aaron S. Lapin, sent by the New York Times News

TWO GUN MAKERS IN TALKS WITH NEW YORK'S ATTORNEY GENERAL

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a move that would represent a major break in
the solidarity of the gun industry, two major gun makers are
negotiating with New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, over a
lawsuit that Spitzer plans to file against gun manufacturers,
according to people involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has repeatedly accused the gun industry of irresponsible
marketing that has allowed firearms to fall into the hands of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations center on whether the gun maker will agree to
several far-reaching concessions, including better supervision of
how its guns are marketed and sold, according to participants in
the talks. In exchange, Spitzer would agree to exclude the
companies from the lawsuit, the participants said. The talks
involve Colt's Manufacturing of West Hartford, Conn., one of the
nation's oldest and best-known gun makers, and a second company
that was not identified, according to the participants.
</P>
<P>
   New York would be the first state to sue gun manufacturers, but
23 cities and counties have already done so.
</P>
<P>
   If either of the gun companies agrees to the demands, it would
be the first time a gun maker has made a concession to gun control
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   A voluntary settlement by Colt or the other company could act in
much the same way as the agreement by Liggett Group, a tobacco
company that broke ranks and reached a settlement in suits filed by
the state attorneys general against the tobacco industry. It was a
major breakthrough that shattered decades of unanimous resistance
by cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's negotiations, if successful, could also result in a
national model for other state and local governments in pursuing
gun makers, wholesalers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   In another move with significant implications, people close to
the talks said that Spitzer has also begun secret discussions with
Robert Delfay, the president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the largest gun industry trade association, which has
close ties to the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, a rival trade organization, the American
Shooting Sports Council was abolished, and its two chief officers
lost their jobs after reports that they were meeting with a lawyer
for several of the cities that have filed suit. The ouster was
orchestrated by the NRA and hard-liners in the industry who opposed
making concessions to settle the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions between Spitzer and Delfay involve establishing
what one person knowledgeable about the negotiations described as
``a code of conduct'' for the gun industry. The talks with Delfay
appear to focus on how to make companies more responsible in their
marketing and distribution of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer declined to comment on the issue in an interview Tuesday
afternoon, saying that he could not discuss any matter that might
be the subject of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's focus on trying to make the gun industry more
responsible for how guns are sold grows out of a new understanding
by law enforcement officials that a large number of criminals are
able to buy guns from corrupt firearms dealers or gun traffickers
buying on their behalf. Data compiled by the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has found that more than half of all
guns used in crimes that can be traced to their point of sale were
sold by less than 1 percent of licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers have long maintained that they have no knowledge of
what happens to their products after they leave the factory because
they sell only to distributors, or wholesalers, who in turn sell to
individual dealers, like gun shops or sports stores. But gun
control advocates and some law enforcement officials have become
increasingly skeptical of this claim as the firearms agency has
begun tracing more and more crime guns in the past five years and
found that certain brands move very quickly from manufacture to use
in crime, often in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately, executives at several handgun manufacturing
companies have said they would like to find ways to monitor their
sales better, but such steps could also lead to their being more
vulnerable to lawsuits. People close to Spitzer say that he would
prefer to avoid protracted and costly litigation with the gun
industry in favor of a quick settlement that would ultimately keep
guns out of the hands of criminals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the discussions say that Spitzer has given
Colt until Wednesday to respond to his demands, but company
officials have asked for an extension of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Colt executives have said they are prepared to get out of the
consumer handgun business if it cannot be made profitable. They
have focused much of their effort on expanding their military
small-arms business and on lobbying Washington for help financing
research on a smart gun, a new class of gun that can be fired only
by its owner.
</P>
<P>
   While the Colt name is prestigious, a New York banker, Donald
Zilkha, bought 85 percent of the company in 1994 for only $12
million, and in 1997, the last year for which numbers are
available, Colt earned only $2 million on $96 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Colt was one of several gun makers found liable for negligence
this year in a Brooklyn lawsuit on behalf of three people shot by
stolen guns.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between Spitzer and the gun makers has also
focused on other key areas, according to participants in the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has asked that gun makers participate in a new system in
which the companies would give the main federal firearms agency
bullets that have been fired during the testing of new guns. Each
bullet has distinctive grooves and other markings, which would
identify the guns from which they were fired. The agency has the
technology to convert these markings into a database of digital gun
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system would enable law enforcement officials to quickly
identify a gun when a bullet is recovered from a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has also asked that payments be made to a state panel
that provides monetary compensation to victims of crimes for any
losses they have suffered. It is not clear how much money Spitzer
is seeking for the panel, known as the Crime Victims Board, but
people involved in the talks say it is an important symbolic step.
</P>
<P>
   Delfay said Tuesday that he could neither confirm nor deny that
he had met with Spitzer. Only last month Delfay had been critical
of a rival gun industry group, the American Shooting Sports
Council, for engaging in preliminary talks with lawyers for New
Orleans and several of the other cities that are suing the gun
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounted to a hostile takeover, Delfay's group
orchestrated the dissolution of its rival, with Delfay being named
to coordinate further responses by the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Delfay has close ties to the NRA, and its chief lobbyist, James
Baker, formerly worked for Delfay. In an interview last month,
Delfay said he would seek to build a consensus from all the gun
companies as well as the NRA before undertaking any talks about a
settlement of the lawsuits.

EURO AND YEN MOVE _ IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS _ AGAINST THE DOLLAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Europe's single currency rallied sharply against the
dollar Tuesday after a key economic report showed business
confidence in Germany growing much more than expected. In contrast,
the dollar climbed against the Japanese yen after the Bank of Japan
sold yen for dollars through the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   For the beleaguered euro, the new currency that had dropped as
much as 13 percent since its introduction in January, the rally may
signal that it has reached a bottom. But what kind of rebound may
be ahead is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   For the yen, the Japanese intervention was aimed at preventing
the currency's value from rising too quickly. This year's rally in
the Japanese stock market, and signs that the economy may be
turning around, have led many investors to jump back into stocks
and into the yen needed to buy them. But a big rally in the yen
would make Japanese exporters less competitive abroad and put a
drag on an economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, in trading Tuesday, was worth $1.04130, up from
$1.02940 Monday. Its low for the year was $1.0136 last Wednesday.
Against the yen, the dollar climbed to 118.95 yen, from 117.80 on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The spark for Tuesday's rally by the euro, which represents the
currencies of 11 nations, was a report by the Ifo economic research
institute of Munich that put its business confidence index for
Germany, the largest economy in Europe, at 92.9 in June, up from a
revised 90.5 in May. The rise was much sharper than analysts
expected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, interest rates in Europe have recently been rising.
While interest rates are still higher in the United States, the
narrowing of the gap increases the euro's attractiveness to
investors. In recent comments, leaders of the European Central Bank
have hinted that their next move will be to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take further confirmation that the economies of
Germany and other European nations are turning around before many
analysts will be ready to declare that the euro can climb back to
its January level of $1.17, and higher.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at
BankBoston, said that he expected that the euro would rally in the
short term. But he has not changed his long-term outlook. In fact,
BankBoston is still predicting that the euro will drop below $1.00
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention to weaken the yen against the dollar Tuesday
was prompted in part by the yen's sharp rise on Monday, when it
jumped 2.3 percent against the dollar. That rally, analysts said,
was started by speculation, which no official confirmed, that
American officials had told the Japanese that the United States
would not help them slow the appreciation of their currency.
</P>
<P>
   To some that meant that the new Treasury secretary, Lawrence
Summers, did not support the strong-dollar policy of his
predecessor, Robert Rubin. After the intervention Tuesday, Summers
said the U.S.' policy favoring a strong dollar had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts do not think that the intervention by the Bank of
Japan alone can keep the yen from getting stronger. Tuesday's yen
selling was the sixth time that Japan has intervened since June 10,
when the yen was 118.96 to the dollar, according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``This slows down the recovery of the yen against the dollar,''
said Karen E. Parker, currency strategist at the Chase Manhattan
Bank. She predicts that the yen will rally to a range of 110 to 115
to the dollar in the next 6 to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for one central bank to intervene in the
currency markets on behalf of another central bank, and usually
such a move does not signal any policy change by the central bank
that is asked to intervene. The Bank of Japan probably used the
Federal Reserve Tuesday because Japanese markets were closed for a
holiday and on Monday the yen jumped back to the 118 level, where
the intervention process began on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention would have been more significant if the Fed
were doing it for its own policy reasons in conjunction with the
Bank of Japan, as it had in June 1998. Then, the Fed joined the
Japanese by intervening to support the yen when it was falling
sharply, threatening to worsen a global economic crisis.

TEJON RANCH COULD SEE FIRST DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEJON RANCH _ This home of cattle pastures and rolling hills may
soon see its first strip malls and housing tracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Tejon Ranch Co., owner of the 270,000-acre ranch that
straddles the Los Angeles-Kern county line, announced it has signed
a letter of intent with three developers to build a 4,000-acre
planned community on the southern end of the property.
</P>
<P>
   The site would be near the intersection of Interstate 5 and
Highway 138, within Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the next pioneering area for growth,'' said
Robert A. Stine, president and chief executive officer of Tejon
Ranch Co., on Tuesday. ``We and the home builders think the
prospects are excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Stine said that Tejon and the three builders _ Pardee
Construction Co., Lewis Investment Co. LLC, and W.L. Homes LLC _
have not decided how many homes would be built on the 4,000-acre
site. Actual groundbreaking is still two or three years away, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of size, there could be some major hurdles for Tejon
Ranch's first residential development.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the project's biggest problems involve its relative
isolation from existing metro areas and services, said Dave
Vannatta, planning deputy for Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael
D. Antonovich, whose district includes the Tejon Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different kind of a proposal from almost
anything we've ever looked at,'' Vannatta said. ``They're basically
starting from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   The county would be hard-pressed to extend services such as
schools, fire and police protection and libraries to the area, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are going to have to be provided by somebody, and we
told them it wasn't going to be the county,'' he said. ``It's going
to have to be them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stine, the Tejon Ranch Co. CEO, said the company is studying its
options, including the possibility of incorporating the area as its
own city.
</P>
<P>
   But isolation from major urban areas may be part of the
development's appeal, Stine said. And despite its rural character,
the area is close to job markets in the Santa Clarita, Antelope,
San Joaquin and San Fernando valleys, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A large, master-planned community would be attractive for the
area, said Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles
Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit business booster
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But road access during cold, snowy weather and the availability
of services and jobs could be major issues, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a demand for housing,'' Kyser said. ``But
the key questions will be access and where will the jobs for
residents be?''
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the project would be the first residential
development in Tejon Ranch. But for the Tejon Ranch Co., the
announcement Tuesday was just the latest in a string of
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The company's recently built industrial center, the 350-acre
Tejon Industrial Complex, moved in its first tenant last month. And
the company recently signed an agreement with Enron Capital &AMP; Trade
Resources Corp., a subsidiary of energy giant Enron Corp., to build
a $500 million power plant on the property.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also working toward a listing on the New York
Stock Exchange, a move that would give it far broader exposure than
its current listing on the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's announcement, Tejon Ranch Co. stock rose
$2.8125, or 11.2 percent, to $27.875 on trading of 30,900 shares,
five times more than the 30-day average volume.

   AQUINNAH, Mass. _ The underwater recovery team assigned to
retrieve the bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette are focused on
five square miles of unpredictable seas off Gay Head Light.
</P>
<P>
   The waters can be foreboding even on tranquil days, but now they
seem even more eerily mysterious because they contain the clues to
a tragedy that has captured the world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   And on Martha's Vineyard itself, the search has cast a grim
shadow over the Aquinnah estate that Jacqueline Onassis Kennedy
treasured and the island where neighbors knew John Jr. since he was
a boy.
</P>
<P>
   As the National Transportation Safety Board directs the
underwater investigation by U.S. Navy and State Police divers,
local sea captains also scanned the Atlantic Ocean for any traces
of debris, and dozens of local volunteers combed the shore for
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The crash has many islanders saying they will never again enjoy
the view from the striking cliffs of Gay Head as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anyone could go in those waters now,'' said
Anne Vanderhoop, owner of the landmark Aquinnah restaurant where
the Kennedys often dined. ``I don't think I will ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, divers crossed yet another potential target off the
list of those within the possible debris fields. However, officials
said there are at least four others, identified by underwater sonar
equipment, which fit the characteristics of airplane wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of Navy and State Police divers recovering the
bodies will depend on how much of Kennedy's Piper Saratoga HP II
stayed intact when the powerful, single-engine plane smashed into
the ocean, officals said.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to any recovery effort, officials said, is how well
divers can see underwater. And others are mindful that the waters
this time of year attract plenty of sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you don't want to think about,'' said captain
Everett ``Porky'' Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's seas were as flat as they have been for days, and
Francis stood on the tower of his fishing vessel, scanning the
water for evidence of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not hoping to find anything but I feel like I have to
look,'' Francis said, ``because I know those families must be
devastated, not to be able to have a burial.''
</P>
<P>
   While the investigation continues on the ocean, searchers who
have spent days along the pristine southern beaches of Martha's
Vineyard Tuesday ended their quest for clues.
</P>
<P>
   From Tisbury Great Pond eastward to Wasque Point on the tip of
Chappaquiddick Island, three dozen walkers and support personnel,
working in teams, scanned scattered clumps of seaweed and man-made
debris that the surf had cast up on 12 miles of shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The search concentrated on beaches that had not yet been
examined for evidence of the crash. By now, the entire southern
coast of the island has been covered.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's yield: a headrest believed to be from Kennedy's plane,
and various pieces of shattered plastic that also might have been
ripped from the aircraft on impact, search coordinators said.
</P>
<P>
   Each item _ even sightings of unidentifiable objects at sea _
were reported to the Dukes County search-and-rescue command center
at South Beach in Edgartown. Satellite readings were used to log
the precise location of each artifact.
</P>
<P>
   For Paul ``Zeke'' Wilkins, an Oak Bluffs resident who led one of
the teams, his three-mile trek westward from South Beach might have
been the last of a volunteer effort that began Saturday. No
additional searches are scheduled; ``The manpower resources have
run out,'' said William Searle, search-and-rescue coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us want to have closure to this,'' said Wilkins, a
41-year-old carpenter who sacrificed a couple of paydays to scour
the beaches. ``It's not just because it's a Kennedy and a Bessette.
We would go out there for the likes of you and I. At least I hope
they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem a little trivial, but at this point of the search,
anything is worth investigating,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers, whose idea of civic service includes trudging
through shifting beach sand in hot, heavy boots, do not boast. They
speak economically and good-naturedly, and they have an awed
respect for the power of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean doesn't give up its secrets. That's my personal
opinion,'' Wilkins said. ``The ocean just seems to swallow them
up.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the intense shoreline search, the investigation
now centers soley on a six-mile section of the sea. As the nation
waits for recovery of the wreckage that could explain the crash,
some who knew John Kennedy Jr. and remember him walking hand in
hand along the beach said they do not need to suffer the sight of
the recovery of his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's better to have a watery grave,'' Vanderhoop said.
``Maybe it's just better to let him rest here.''
</P>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Nearly a week after John F. Kennedy Jr.'s single-engine
plane plunged into the Atlantic, it remains uncertain whether the
reason was mechanical failure, his own inexperience or something
still unimagined.
</P>
<P>
   But there is at least one certainty: Everything that is known
about the conditions he encountered on Friday night is anticipated
by the flight instructors who train ten of thousands of Americans
for private pilot's licenses every year.
</P>
<P>
   The instructors know that many of the pilots they train will
almost surely someday fly into conditions like those that
apparently faced Kennedy: few visible landmarks or lights, a dark
sea merging into a blackening sky, a horizon made smudgy by haze.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors, and all but the most novice of student pilots, also
know that such conditions pose two major challenges: first, simply
flying straight and level, and second, recognizing when the plane,
against the pilot's intentions, is turning, descending or climbing.
</P>
<P>
   At three miles a minute, the cruising speed of Kennedy's Piper
Saratoga and of similar high-powered single-engine light planes,
even a small deviation can quickly become a huge problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying isn't inherently dangerous,'' said Ron Godin, chief
flight instructor at Fitchburg Airport, just northwest of Boston.
``It's just terribly unforgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that can mean a third challenge: the need to regain
control when the plane tilts in the sky and the pilot has no visual
cues outside the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Many nonpilots call this ``flying blind.'' To aviators, it is
instrument flying. No one knows whether Kennedy resorted to relying
solely on his instruments or, if he did, whether that was a factor
in the crash. A variety of causes, mechanical or otherwise, may
have played a role. But if visibility was an issue, Kennedy would
join a long list of pilots who lacked the proficiency to fly in
instrument conditions but found themselves forced to do so,
disoriented in low visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had no ``instrument rating'' _ certification, which
requires 40 hours of training, that a pilot is qualified to fly by
referring only to his airplane's instruments when visibility is
low.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of qualifying for a private pilot's license, he
would have had to take only three hours of instruction devoted to
flying with no visual reference points. The training is basic,
showing the pilot how to ``control the aircraft, to turn around and
get back to visible conditions,'' said Warren Morningstar, a
spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a
lobbying and education group.
</P>
<P>
   In that training, Godin and other instructors teach pilots to
recover from unusual situations. They mimic instrument conditions _
generally those in which visibility is less than three miles _ by
placing over the student's head a set of visors that act like
blinders, allowing for a view of the cockpit instruments but not of
the scene that fills the window.
</P>
<P>
   The first precept in instrument flying is to ignore the body's
sensations. The delicate mechanism of the inner ear that provides a
sense of balance can also provide false cues. A pilot who feels
that the plane is level, for example, may in fact be diving to the
left.
</P>
<P>
   In the cockpit, one instrument is the leading guide: the
artificial horizon, or attitude indicator. It displays a tiny
silhouette of an airplane against a horizontal line. Based on a
gyroscope, the position of the silhouette mimics the position of
the airplane. If the left wing is below the horizon, for example,
the pilot is turning left.
</P>
<P>
   Other instruments provide backup information that validates the
artificial horizon. With a left wing low, for instance, the turn
and bank indicator will show a left bank, and the compass will show
a heading change to the left. A nose below the horizon means the
plane will pick up speed and lose altitude, and the altitude and
speed indicators will confirm such a descent.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot who pays attention to the instruments, checks them
regularly and cross-checks the information each one provides will
have a clear picture of what is happening to the plane.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes distractions overwhelm even the most experienced
pilot. Safety experts speak of the pilot's workload, and point out
that most errors occur around takeoff or landing, when a pilot is
busy, and not during cruise, a simpler phase of flight.
</P>
<P>
   Many instructors drill their students with a maxim: aviate,
navigate, communicate. The message: No matter what else is going
on, first remain in control of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   There are drills, too, for pilots who recognize that things are
headed out of control. The situation is a demanding one, and
mistakes can be deadly. A pilot who, for example, suddenly
recognizes that both the left wing and the nose are down is trained
to reduce power first to slow the descent, then level the wings and
finally raise the nose back to the horizon. The pilot who
mistakenly raises the nose first will tighten the turn, which will
lead to a faster descent and could start a spin. That is even more
difficult to manage.

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT BREAKS ANOTHER RECORD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A surge of imports driven by the continued strength
of the American economy pushed the U.S. trade deficit to another
record in May _ over $21 billion, a figure fueled by rising oil
prices and growing evidence that China is using exports to support
its lagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   The China deficit comes at a politically inopportune time for
the Clinton administration: Next week the House of Representatives
is expected to vote on a one-year renewal of China's preferential
trade status.
</P>
<P>
   While the House is expected to approve the measure, the rising
deficit with China _ it totaled more than $23 billion in the first
five months of 1999 _ further complicates a relationship already
deeply strained by the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and China's renewed threats to use force if
necessary to keep Taiwan from declaring itself an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit is also one of the few economic indicators
that Republican candidates for the presidential nomination can
seize upon to argue that not all is well with the U.S. economy. But
it is, in fact, a byproduct of American economic health: With
unemployment here at record lows, low-cost imports have helped keep
inflation to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The May trade figures reflect the continuing large gap between
the strong growth in the United States and weaker conditions in
many foreign countries,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley said
Tuesday. He estimated that the deficit was running at an annual
rate of $224.8 billion, which would total nearly 37 percent more
than last year's record of $164.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   China is not the only cause: The trade deficit with Japan
remains large _ though it dropped slightly in May _ and there is a
rising deficit with Canada and Mexico, the two other members of the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the May deficit surprised many economists, and led a
few on Tuesday to lower modestly their predictions for American
economic growth in the second quarter. But perhaps more important,
it was a strong indication that the U.S. consumer spending binge is
moving ahead unabated, which is bound to worry the Federal Reserve
Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago if we had seen numbers like this, what you
would have heard on Capitol Hill was politicians blaming the
Japanese and the Chinese,'' said Richard Medley, who heads Medley
Global Advisors, an international investment firm in New York.
``Now what you hear more often is that this proves we are spending
too much and saving too little.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact a number of economists and U.S. officials are
increasingly concerned that the accumulating current account
deficit could ultimately hurt the value of the dollar _ and that,
in turn, could trigger an international exodus from the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, meanwhile, are clearly worried about the effects
of a weakening dollar _ not on the United States but on their own
hobbled economy. They intervened Monday night to weaken the yen and
prop up the dollar, in hopes of making their own exports cheaper on
world markets.
</P>
<P>
   While the purchase was carried out through the New York Federal
Reserve, acting as Japan's agent, there are increasing signs that
the United States and Japan are at odds on exchange-rate policy. A
stronger dollar would further hurt declining U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report suggested that the decline is modest but is
made worse by the growing demand for foreign-made cars, crude oil
and medium-technology electronics. Oil prices increased in May to
an average of $14.54 a barrel, the Commerce Department said, from
$12.71 a barrel in April.
</P>
<P>
   Exports decreased to $77.6 billion from $78.2 billion in April,
but they were up fractionally from May 1998. Imports increased to
$98.9 billion from $96.8 billion in April and $92 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures suggest that some of the areas that the
Clinton administration concentrated hardest on bolstering during
President Clinton's first term in office _ autos, auto parts and
machinery _ are the exports now in greatest decline. They are also
the products that are being imported in increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials who once boasted of the auto and
auto-parts agreement they reached with Japan in 1995, after a trade
dispute that nearly resulted in an embargo on Japanese luxury cars,
now rarely discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much discussion from the White House about how to
deal with the complex trade problems with China. Overall, Chinese
exports to the world are in decline. But their continued rise here
suggests that the United States, now more than ever, has become the
market of last resort for the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the trade deficit with China are messy.
Opponents of Clinton's China policy _ on both the left and the
right _ say the trade figures show that the president's decision to
delink human rights and the annual renewal of China's trade status
has helped neither dissidents nor American companies. Arrests by
Chinese authorities continue _ there was a major crackdown on
Tuesday _ and exports to China are clearly not increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there has been little real resistance to the renewal of what
was once called ``most favored nation'' trade status, which has
been delicately renamed ``normal trade relations.'' U.S. companies
have argued annually on Capitol Hill that unless China has the
benefit of low tariffs on their imports here, the Chinese market
will gradually be shut down for them.
</P>
<P>
   If China and the United States reach an agreement this year on
Beijing's entry to the World Trade Organization, the terms of its
move to join the group should, in theory at least, open more
markets to U.S. goods.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents on Capitol Hill, both those on the left who are
concerned with China's human rights record and those on the right
who see the country as a growing threat, view WTO admission as a
favor to the Chinese, and not one that will necessarily benefit
American workers.

<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ John F. Kennedy Jr. turned sharply away from
Martha's Vineyard before his plane began plunging toward the sea,
federal investigators said Tuesday, leading several authorities on
aviation to conclude that he had become lost or disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came on the fourth day of an around-the-clock
search for the wrecked plane and the remains of Kennedy and his two
passengers, and investigators warned that they might never find any
large pieces of the plane. The six-seat Piper Saratoga hit the
Atlantic Ocean at a speed that ``might be more than 5,000 feet per
minute,'' according to Robert Pearce, who is leading the
investigation for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, had been heading for a family wedding on Friday
night with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and his
sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, 34. Radar records are beginning to
fill in the harrowing details of their last seven minutes. At a
news conference Tuesday evening, Pearce said that Kennedy had been
headed straight toward Martha's Vineyard, about 34 miles out and
traveling at 5,600 feet, when the plane began to descend at about
700 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The descent continued for about five minutes to 2,300 feet,
when the airplane was about 20 miles from the airport,'' Pearce
said. ``The airplane started a turn to the right and climbed back
to 2,600 feet. It remained at that altitude for about one minute on
a southeasterly heading. Thirty seconds into the maneuver, the
airplane started a turn to the right and descended at a rapid rate
of descent. The rate of descent may have been greater than 5,000
feet per minute. The last radar return was about 16 miles from the
airport and the altitude indicated 1,100 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Kennedy was headed away from the airport when
the plunge began. Pearce would not characterize the information
beyond saying that Kennedy had been on the right path before he
began turning. ``Anything from that would not go to Martha's
Vineyard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barr, the director of the Aviation Safety Program at the
University of Southern California, a leading training center for
accident investigators, said Kennedy apparently lost his way after
making the first turn, then went into a dive as he tried to right
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this getting yourself in a square corner, when you run
out of ideas and experience at the same time,'' said Barr, who was
a fighter pilot during the Vietnam War. ``He would have been
looking straight out at the dark ocean on a nearly moonless night.
He probably looked over his right shoulder for lights, then when he
started to sink, he would have been trying to get the nose back to
the horizon, get the wings level and find where he was, all at the
same time. Even for a good pilot, that could produce a death
spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   An armada of search and salvage vessels planned to work all
night as officials here on Cape Cod and in Washington were peppered
with questions about the propriety of continuing what could be a
fruitless search. President Clinton, who has continued to talk with
the Kennedy family since the crash, said Monday that he believed
the search should continue. A White House official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, acknowledged that the recovery effort had
reached the point that it ordinarily would be called off. But the
official said the government does not want to leave any wreckage
that private salvage firms or curiosity-seekers might try to
retrieve.
</P>
<P>
   The president's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Clinton had not
given any specific order to federal agencies to go all out in the
search. ``But given the national interest in this and extraordinary
contributions that the Kennedy family has made to the country and
the pain they've gone through, he believes we should see this
through to resolution,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference here, Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee of the
Coast Guard was asked how long he would continue what could be a
fruitless search. ``You know, that's a question that I think we
have been pondering and certainly I have been pondering,'' he said.
``We've used the word `a reasonable amount of time.''' He went on,
``When we get to the point where we believe that we're no longer
effectively doing something out there, we will get to that point
and conclude this phase.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay in finding bodies poses an awkward dilemma as Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and other family members try to plan a
funeral or memorial service. The Kennedy family has not requested
that Kennedy be buried with his parents, at the eternal flame in
Arlington National Cemetery, a White House official said Tuesday
afternoon. ``We don't think they are going to ask,'' the official
added, citing informal contacts with members of the family. Because
Kennedy does not qualify for burial in the military cemetery,
interment there would require a presidential waiver.
</P>
<P>
   As the family waits in seclusion at Hyannis Port, two Navy
ships, two Coast Guard cutters and two research vessels from the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration are being
used in the effort to map the sea off of Martha's Vineyard, using
high-resolution sonar to detect objects with straight edges,
indicating they are manmade. Then 10 divers from the Massachusetts
State Police and 20 from the Navy use those maps to look for
wreckage. But many of the seemingly promising targets turn out to
be things like barrels or fishnets.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, investigators zeroed in on an area that is
described as a few hundred yards in diameter. Sonar images
suggested it could contain pieces of plane, and it was close to the
theoretical ``splash point,'' or crash site, that investigators had
determined using computer models. Nothing had been determined by
nightfall.

WHERE WERE YOU?

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the stunning display of media attention might suggest
otherwise, the crash deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and
sister-in-law probably will never in the future register as a
``where-were-you-when'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   These are the moments that so often define who we are as much as
where we were. Every generation has its own litany of traumatic
moments, but the ones that last as cultural signposts are the ones
that cut us most deeply to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more rarely, those things that uplifted us beyond our own
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The defining traumatic event for anyone in their mid-40s or
older is the assasination of JFK. It would be a tough challenge to
find any lucid person in that age group who doesn't remember that
moment on a Friday afternoon in 1963 when that horrifying piece of
news was first heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment is frozen in time, and we remember how we felt and
what we were thinking,'' said Gloria Malone, a Paradise Valley
psychologist. ``Where you were and who told you, you remember these
things because of the shock and the sadness that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These memories that shock, that trauma is formed in your mind
for all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shock, disbelief, denial and grief. The stronger these emotions
are, the more likely a moment will become etched in our memories.
Personal losses and tragedies that touch close to home have all
these ingredients, naturally, and remain with us always.
</P>
<P>
   But public, widely acknowledged traumas that today are closely
linked with the news media also register personally while becoming
part of the collective memory. Remembering the assassinations of
Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, the plane crash that killed
Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and J.P. ``The Big Bopper'' Richardson,
the death of Elvis Presley, and murder of ex-Beatle John Lennon all
produce that time-freezing recollection of where you were, what you
were doing and who told you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When JFK was killed, I was at an awards ceremony in high
school,'' Malone said. ``When RFK was killed, I heard about it when
I was coming home from a date.''
</P>
<P>
   For a generation that has passed, the sinking of the Titanic or
the traumas of World War I would have had that effect. For senior
citizens today, it would be those events surrounding World War II,
the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the death of President Roosevelt and
the atomic bombs over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And younger people have their own traumas to mull over. The
Challenger disaster, the Oklahoma City bombing, the deaths of
grunge-rock pioneer Kurt Cobain and Princess Diana. Or even the
bizarre televised coverage of the O.J. Simpson ``slow-speed
chase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John Lennon would be my first memory,'' said Nina Moore, a
36-year-old Phoenix mother. ``I had just moved out here, and I was
living in my apartment at ASU. I was 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from New York City, plus I have two older brothers, and
one was a major Beatles freak. And I had seen John Lennon in
Central Park many times.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the collective memories are bad. There are those
splendid moments that so uplift that they can never be forgotten.
Just 30 years ago, the first Apollo moon landing became permanently
ingrained in everyone's mind. Some historians believe that far into
the future, that will be the defining moment of our time.
</P>
<P>
   And there are others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I recall was Lindbergh,'' said Lloyd Clark,
76, speaking of the stunning solo crossing in 1927 of the Atlantic
Ocean by Charles Lindbergh. ``I was a tot, 4 or 5 at the time. My
dad and mom took me down to the ``Houston Chronicle'' to pick up
the first edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a Sun City historian and journalist, said that although
he is a lifelong newspaper man, many of his memories of great
events of the day surround the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was listening when the Hindenberg crashed, and I can
remember the announcer crying,'' said Clark, speaking of the famous
1937 broadcast from Lakehurst, New Jersey, that culminated with,
``Oh, the humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Another frozen-in-time memory, Clark said, was when he and his
family were transfixed by a broadcast from Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Hitler berating the Germans, and they were giving the
sieg heils,'' he said. ``I could hear them over the radio set we
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chilling. He was ranting. He was getting them to a
fever pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pearl Harbor attack is another powerful memory, he added,
recalling how he was in the ROTC in high school, marching out on
the field with his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we began to parade out, we saw people gathering in two
clusters, one around a car that had a radio, and the other around a
portable radio in the stands,'' Clark said. ``They were listening
to accounts of Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard planes flying overhead, and they were two P-38s
racing toward the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that one monumental event that is only dimly recalled
today is the ``greatest industrial disaster that ever happened in
the United States,'' the horrendous harbor explosion in 1946 in
Texas City, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Another event that made a big impact in its day, he added, was
the 1945 crash of a B-25 into the Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   But the tragedies of the Kennedys keep coming back to haunt us
all. It's one reason why the death of the man whom so many people
remember as a toddler saluting his father's casket should touch us
deeply. Deep enough for now to have meaning for all, but most
likely not deep enough to register as one of the permanent cultural
scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following President Kennedy's death, we began following the
entire family,'' Malone noted. `'There's a lot of disbelief with
such tragic losses, sadness and tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grieve for ourselves as well as for them and their
families. Sudden deaths are very difficult grief losses to
resolve.'' &QL;

WALTZ POWER STILL LEAVES HIGHBROWS A BIT DIZZY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Waelzen,'' as any bibulous Viennese will tell you, is ``to
twirl.'' The word means more than ``rotate,'' less than ``wanken,''
or downright stagger. Drop the umlaut, and we have what Johann
Strauss the Younger and his father had Europe doing for a good part
of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Waltzes had existed under other names during the century before.
Mozart might call them ``Laendler''; Schubert gave waltzes their
proper name and created a body of piano music stunning both for its
simplicity and for its subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   Weber, Liszt and Berlioz raised them to the title of high art.
Tchaikovsky and another Strauss, Richard, made a twirling, almost
staggering, three-in-a-bar ballroom dance a form to set next to the
rondo or the passacaglia.
</P>
<P>
   The power of categories is endlessly fascinating. The
wonderfully inventive ``Blue Danube'' and ``Emperor Waltz'' are
heaped with love and yet gingerly segregated from the mainstream of
concert music. The Vienna Philharmonic gathers them together for
its famous New Year's concerts. Pops concerts schedule them next to
``Autumn Leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   They also pop up as encores at symphonic concerts, after the
serious business of the evening is over.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tchaikovsky's waltzes from ``Sleeping Beauty'' or the
Serenade for Strings, wonderful pieces but certainly no more so
than ``Vienna Blood,'' are raised to the status of ``serious''
classical music, and are there, I suggest, by virtue of their
placement. Setting has more to do with our perception of art than
you might think.
</P>
<P>
   Take Duke Ellington out of a smoky bar or a college dance, put
him in a symphony hall, and suddenly we hear a sophisticated
modernist rivaling a Dutilleux or a Ligeti. I suspect that Ravel's
``Gaspard de la Nuit'' in late-hour performances at Tramps would
create the same effect in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   We are in the centennial year of Strauss Jr.'s death in 1899. A
famous photograph taken some years before pictures him and Brahms
standing cordially together on some leafy veranda. Is the operative
caption (from left to right) ``ridiculous meets sublime''? I think
not.
</P>
<P>
   One time-capsule game often played is to choose the handful of
pieces that would best tell listeners in some distant future what
19th-century music was all about. These might not be the best
pieces; more important would be the character and flavor in the
message conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   There would necessarily be Beethoven and Schubert, and leaving
out Wagner and Chopin would be difficult indeed. My mind keeps
coming back to the overture Strauss wrote for ``Die Fledermaus,''
the most durable and ubiquitous of his stage pieces. Housed in this
music are generosity, elegance and unfettered freedom of spirit,
all shaped with exquisite technique.
</P>
<P>
   As the waltz form grew, it developed into sequences of dances,
and in the ``Fledermaus'' music, which is not all waltz-time by any
means, the transition from one idea to the next is calculated with
a naturalness few other composers have come close to. We must have
our ``Tristan und Isolde'' to represent the dark basement of the
Romantic and post-Romantic soul, but for an era's exuberance and
originality we could do worse than Johann Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   If we hold popular music to its literal meaning, we define it
according to its impact on large numbers of people. A subtheme of
this definition is the inherent power to affect what these large
numbers of people do and think. It also leads to another theorem:
that anything appealing to so many must be of questionable quality.
</P>
<P>
   There is an element of political fear in the dismissal of
popular music, because what moves the minds and hearts of the
majority threatens the balance of society.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, polite society's response to the waltz craze in the
early 1800s sounds suspiciously similar to the Bible-quoting cries
of horror against the rotating (waelzend, wankend) hips of a
certain Elvis Presley 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss and Presley got young people going in a way that scared
the pants off their elders. Strauss' contemporaries didn't like the
fact that waltzes legitimized young people's touching each other in
public. But I wonder whether the whirling, barely controlled
movement of the waltz, with its eccentrically and perhaps
suggestively accented second beat, made them even more
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Look up some of the comments of the time. One pamphlet proved
that waltzing was the culprit in a generation's weakness of body
and mind.
</P>
<P>
   Found in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians is a
1799 account of the waltz at its loosest: ``The dancers grasped the
long dress of their partners so that it would not drag and be
trodden upon, and lifted it high, holding them in this cloak which
brought both bodies under one cover, as closely as possible against
them and in this way the whirling continued in the most indecent
positions; the supporting hand lay firmly on the breasts, at each
movement making little lustful pressures; the girls went wild and
looked as if they would drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that was dirty dancing, making the solo gyrations of the
rock-and-roll era look mildly autoerotic. Strauss and Presley were
wildly different: the first a cultured harmonist who grew along
with his fame. ``Jailhouse Rock,'' ``That's All Right'' and ``All
Shook Up'' had an astonishing introductory force, later dissipated
in maundering, off-key renditions of ``Love Me Tender.''
</P>
<P>
   What Strauss and Presley shared was an uncommon hold on the
public, and music so unsettling to the populace is to be kept as
far from high art as possible.

   KENNEDY-COMMENTARY (Undated) _ Moments after early reports of
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s missing single-engine plane hit the
television airwaves, I began getting telephone calls from friends,
relatives and former colleagues. They all knew that I had commuted
on summer weekends from New York City to Martha's Vineyard,
piloting a single-engine airplane, for the past seven years. They
wanted my ``take'' on what might have happened to Kennedy.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ A decade ago, when the first Dream Team was
still just a dream, Jason Kidd made his way from ``the hills'' to
``the flats'' and did some fantasizing of his own.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were likely times when he indulged in the usual fantasies
_ last-second shots, championships and All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   But when Kidd played at Rainbow Center, the home of the best
competition the East Bay of Oakland could offer, he thought of the
local hero and dreamed of the day he would share a backcourt with
Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always came down to the flats to play with him,'' Kidd said.
``That's where the best basketball was. Wherever Gary was, that's
where there was the best talent. And I always imagined playing with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   As things worked out, Kidd became too great a player himself to
have much of a chance of being paired in an NBA backcourt with
Payton. Players of that level _ to say nothing of the endangered
species of true point guards _ are spread thin.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, however, they are finally running and trapping
together. They have led the almost-cruel defense of the United
States team in its 5-0 start in the Americas Olympic Qualifying
Tournament. They have been the most dominant part of a thoroughly
masterful team. And along the way, they've gotten to live a dream
almost forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the name of this team, the Dream Team,'' Kidd
said. ``This is a dream opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Back when Kidd first imagined himself running alongside Payton,
the notion of putting NBA superstars together began gaining steam.
By 1992, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Larry Bird and Magic
Johnson headed the first Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   As a part of that squad's latest descendants, Kidd and Payton
are playing together just as they always imagined. They have
combined to torment opposing ball-handlers. They pass with a flair
and precision that produce too many layups to allow even a thought
of an upset. And when they need to, they score with ease, usually
with layups set up by the other.
</P>
<P>
   Through five tournament games, Kidd is averaging 8.6 points and
8.8 assists. Payton has made 78.3 percent of his shots, averaging
17 points to lead the United States. He is averaging five assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like playing in our pickup games back in the Bay
Area,'' Kidd said. ``It would be a lot of fun to see that 82 games
a year. We could cause a lot of problems picking up full-court. You
know you're really going to have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   On one Dominican Republic possession Monday, Kidd and Payton
trapped Felipe Lopez until Kidd smacked the ball free. Payton began
the break before flipping a no-look, underhanded pass off the
backboard, setting up a Kevin Garnett dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to get the ball,'' Kidd said. ``That's the way we
love to play. We thrive on trying to get the ball from our
opponent. We have fun doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd says that teaming a pair of pressing, ballhawking point
guards in the same backcourt has always been his idea of a
basketball dream, even as he moved on to the NBA and gave it up as
too much to ask for.
</P>
<P>
   The sticky-fingered hunger of the United States backcourt is a
Payton trademark; it gave him the nickname ``The Glove.'' Kidd
emulates that approach, making the Kidd-Glove backcourt perhaps the
greatest nightmare posed by the Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is our offense,'' Kidd said. ``The biggest key for
us is we thrive on playing defense. Everything else is second.
Being able to pass, knocking down a shot, taking the ball to the
basket _ that's secondary for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just overmatched guards in this tournament who are a
poor match for a Payton-Kidd backcourt. Asked if they could
similarly harass NBA guards, Payton said facing him and Kidd
together ``would be hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've both been first-team all-defense,'' Payton said. ``We
both like to cause havoc, get steals. If we played in the NBA
together, that would be crazy to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both trying to cause havoc and trying to get steals and
to get baskets for our teammates. That's what we do. We just play
like each other.''
</P>
<P>
   On the offensive end, Kidd is a little bit more of a playmaker.
Payton is the better shooter. But this, too, seems to serve the
United States team well. Determined to ``show the right way to
play,'' U.S. coach Larry Brown said his players have been
``unselfish almost to a fault.''
</P>
<P>
   On a team lacking a player with the one-on-one explosiveness of
an Allen Iverson or Stephon Marbury, Payton might be the most
irrepressible offensive talent and thus has been an off guard when
he and Kidd share the court. Against the Dominican Republic, Payton
had 25 points, making 11 of 11 shots inside the 3-point arc, all on
layups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason wants to do more things _ be a rebounder, the assist man
and to get his points when he has to,'' Payton said. ``Right now,
they've got me as a two where they want me to score all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Payton's successful transition to scorer is that he
considered himself unfairly maligned for assuming a greater scoring
load with the SuperSonics in 1999. Payton said his place on the
Dream Team has been an escape from the disappointment and criticism
of this past season. But scars clearly remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't shoot the ball on our team, we wouldn't have won
25 games,'' Payton said. ``If I didn't score, we probably would
have been 10-40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what they say. If you have talent around you, and
I can go to the basket, I don't have to score 20 and 25 points a
night. (But) nobody else on my team was scoring more than 12, 13
points. And we struggled. We barely won 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a proud man. Every time I go out on the floor, I want to
win. And if it takes me taking the ball and shooting the ball all
the time on the Seattle SuperSonics, I'm going to do it. And if
they don't like it, tell them to go get another team and trade
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has joked about playing with Kidd again, Payton said
he has not asked to be dealt. He would prefer that the Sonics work
to upgrade the talent around him. If that happens, he said, he
would assume the responsibility to lead it and would accept
criticism if he cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle, but I had to deal with it,'' Payton said of
last season. ``I had to try to bring my play up to another level.
Then I was criticized. They would have criticized me for not doing
it. Then they criticized me for doing it. So what can I do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the hole. If something happens to the team, it's always
the best player on the team's fault. So I take it. I'll take the
blame.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there are no critics, no losses to explain. And for
Payton, there is a specific dream to live on the Dream Team. A
breath after he lamented the toughest of his 10 NBA seasons,
Payton's mind turned to the sort of daydreaming Kidd enjoyed back
in Oakland. It is still a comforting thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a guard like Jason playing with me, and I could be
on the two, and I could score when I want to score and pass the
ball and know I'm going to get the ball back to a point guard that
is going to do good things with it, yeah, I'd be happy with that,''
Payton said. ``I don't care. I could score 10 points or whatever.
If I can have fun like this, I'm going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm having a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd always expected as much. Living the dream of youth should
be, at the very least, fun.

PROBABLE SITE OF KENNEDY CRASH LOCATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENEMSHA, Mass. _ Investigators located what they believe was
the ``splash point'' where John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane plunged into
the ocean, but a rapid deployment of divers Tuesday to two nearby
targets failed to turn up bodies or wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The site 7 1/2 miles southwest of Aquinnah, or Gay Head, on
Martha's Vineyard was pinpointed using a new and more chilling
account of the plane's final moments. As he navigated through the
inky night, Kennedy began an unexplained right turn, then suddenly
dived toward the water at roughly 10 times the normal rate of
descent, even faster than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   Some aeronautics authorities said the new information suggests
Kennedy's plane corkscrewed into a ``graveyard spiral,'' but
investigators declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also declined to speculate on the force of the
impact or its effect on the plane or its passengers. However, chief
investigator Robert Pearce of the National Transportation Safety
Board said: ``I'm sure you can draw a conclusion by the debris
we've been bringing in, which is fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   A highly placed source familiar with the investigation said
searchers ``are not very hopeful about the condition of the
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials said the two target areas were 115 feet
below the ocean surface, but the search was complicated by
52-degree water at the bottom, strong currents, and visibility of
less than eight feet. Divers earlier Tuesday ruled out four other
targets identified by sophisticated sonar vessels, leaving 13 or 14
potential debris sites to be examined during the around-the-clock
effort to find the plane and the remains of Kennedy, his wife
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a Federal Aviation Administration source said the
agency was considering disciplining an employee who failed to
follow up on a telephone inquiry about Kennedy's plane 25 minutes
after it fell off radar screens Friday night. The source said FAA
officials planned to interview the unidentified employee before
deciding what action, if any, to take.
</P>
<P>
   The call, a transcript of which was published Tuesday by the
Globe, was made by a Martha's Vineyard Airport employee, Adam Budd,
on behalf of a couple who had come to the airport to meet Lauren
Bessette. Budd called an FAA outpost in Bridgeport, Conn.,
mentioning Kennedy by name, offering two possible identification
numbers for his plane, and asking whether it was possible to track
the airplane because ``they wanna know, uh, where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   As the search dragged through a fourth unproductive day,
Kennedy's sister Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg emerged from
seclusion Tuesday. First, she and her husband went on an hour-long
bicycle ride near their Bridgehampton, N.Y., summer home, where a
flag flew at half-staff. Later she went for a drive with an
entourage that included two cousins, television newswoman Maria
Shriver and William Kennedy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of memorial services also began in earnest, and there were
reports that the Kennedy family is considering marking their losses
Thursday or Friday at the Church of St. Thomas More in Manhattan,
where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis sometimes worshipped.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official word where Kennedy and his wife might be
buried, but workers at Arlington National Cemetery apparently took
it upon themselves to measure the plot where Kennedy's parents,
infant brother Patrick, and a stillborn sister are buried. Sources
close to the family, however, said there are no plans to seek
permission for burials at Arlington. The Bessette family released
no information on memorial plans for Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   At a late afternoon briefing, Pearce, the chief crash
investigator, added grim new details to the final minutes of the
tragic flight.
</P>
<P>
   About seven minutes before the plane crashed, Kennedy was flying
_ apparently uneventfully _ at 5,600 feet. He was 34 miles from
Martha's Vineyard Airport.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Kennedy was heading in an easterly direction and
traveling at about 160 knots, which translates into a ground speed
of 184 miles per hour. He then began descending at a rate of about
700 feet per minute. Pilots familiar with Kennedy's Piper Saratoga
II HP said that was a normal, if somewhat rapid, rate of descent.
</P>
<P>
   That initial descent continued for about five minutes, at which
point he was 20 miles from the airport at an altitude of 2,300
feet. He then started to turn to the right, off course from
Martha's Vineyard. The plane rose to 2,600 feet at the start of the
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy remained at that altitude for one minute, on a
southeasterly heading, putting him about 18 miles from the airport.
Kennedy then began another descent at a rate of 700 feet per
minute, and started a turn back to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, 30 seconds into that maneuver, the airplane started a
turn to the right and a rapid descent,'' Pearce said. He said an
NTSB computer analysis determined the plane was racing downard in
excess of 5,000 feet per minute. A day earlier, NTSB officials
estimated the descent at 4,700 feet per minute. The descent gauge
on Kennedy's type of plane goes only to 2,000 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran pilots say a descent of 5,000 feet per minute at that
altitude would be nearly impossible for someone with Kennedy's
experience _ or even considerably more _ to regain control.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators declined to say why Kennedy might have undertaken
the previously undisclosed maneuvers. But pilots and aeronautics
authorities speculated he might have become disoriented on a night
with heavy haze and little moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee said sonar scans by
two boats from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration, the Rude and the Whiting, and the Coast Guard
cutter Willow had identified two clusters of dive targets five
miles apart off the Martha's Vineyard coast.
</P>
<P>
   Divers from the Massachusetts State Police and the Navy vessel
USS Grasp ruled out four targets from an original group of 10,
while the sonar boats added seven or eight more targets that will
be searched in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, FAA officials continued their public defense of
the employee who received the phone inquiry about Kennedy's plane,
saying the 10:05 p.m. Friday call was not specific enough to prompt
a response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish very much that we'd had more information, but we had
no information that the plane was in trouble or overdue,'' said FAA
spokesman Eliot Brenner. ``We do not provide information on private
citizens or private aircraft over the telephone. Again, we wish
we'd gotten more information.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA source said that although they do not believe the
employee acted improperly, officials are upset that the man did not
come forward to tell superiors about the call when it became clear
the plane was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Under FAA policy, if a pilot files a flight plan, no action
would be taken on such a call until a plane was at least 30 minutes
overdue. In cases such as Kennedy's, where no flight plane was
filed, the FAA takes no action until a plane is an hour overdue and
reported so by ``a reliable source.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, FAA policy is not to release information over the
telephone unless the caller is known to the FAA. In the case of a
plane involving a Kennedy, the FAA source said, officials might be
even more reluctant to release information out of fear that the
caller could be ``a nutcase or paparazzi.''
</P>
<P>
   A second FAA source would not even discuss the possibility of
discipline, saying, ``He did the right thing. He did not release
private information. But in retrospect, it might have been useful
to ask some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, no action was taken until more than four hours
after Budd's call. The first response resulted from a 2:15 a.m.
Saturday call to the Coast Guard by a Kennedy friend identified as
Carol Ratowell. An official search and rescue mission began just
over an hour later, at 3:28 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Until the plane is found, there is no way to know whether a
quicker response time might have made a difference in the survival
of Kennedy and the Bessette sisters. Based on radar readings, the
plane made a sharp plunge into the ocean, and aeronautics
authorities said there was a low chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the country's largest general aviation
association said he agreed with the FAA's explanation that the call
was ignored because Budd never used the precise language required
in such a situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was asking the specialist to read someone's mind and read
between the lines,'' said Warren Morningstar, director of media
relations for the Aircraft Owner and Pilots Association, a lobbying
group with 340,000 members. ``Their primary job is pilot briefings,
and I would have a hard time throwing stones at them for this.''
</P>
<P>
   While Menemsha played host to a media encampment as the launch
site for divers _ with satellite trucks lining the shore _ about 15
miles away, tourists in Oak Bluffs ambled oblivious to the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've been here we haven't heard a thing about it,''
said Dave Thomassen, a day-tripper from Plymouth. ``What else can
you do? You just have to wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Fischer, a parking and traffic enforcement officer, said,
``It was just another day at the beach. It's pretty quiet today, I
don't know why,'' she said while directing traffic along Oak Bluffs
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Martha's Vineyard, the commercialization of the tragedy
moved into high gear. Just one indication was the activity at the
online auction house eBay.com. By late afternoon, there were 289
items for sale linked to John F. Kennedy Jr., including a signed
credit card slip that had attracted 17 bids, the last one for $635.
Someone also was offering the internet domain name
carolyn-bessette.com for $35,000. There were no bidders.

ARMSTRONG, USING HEAD AND FEET, NEARS FINAL VICTORY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain, Belgian, Switzerland)   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIAU-ENGALY, France _ Lance Armstrong rode a brilliant tactical
race in the Tour de France Tuesday, then turned on the afterburners
and showed that he remains powerful as well as brainy. The American
leader of the U.S. Postal Service team did not win the daily stage
but, barring injury or illness, he sewed up the overall victory
when the three-week Tour finishes in Paris on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With a sly smile afterward, he tried to disagree with that
judgment. ``The stage tomorrow is long and hard,'' he said, trying
to find reasons not to claim victory. But when asked if he was
optimistic, he replied, ``I'm always optimistic,'' and looked like
a man without a doubt in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to contest the final sprint for second place,
Armstrong finished fourth behind Fernando Escartin, a Spaniard with
Kelme; Alex Zulle, a Swiss with Banesto, and Richard Virenque, a
Frenchman with Polti. In the lordly manner of Miguel Indurain, a
five-time winner of the Tour and Armstrong's idol, the American
dropped back in the last 500 meters and let Zulle and Virenque
battle it out.
</P>
<P>
   Escartin had crossed the line 2 minutes 1 second earlier for his
victory. The Spaniard is a strong climber who usually finishes in
the top 10 in any mountain stage but who had never before won one
in seven previous Tours. He was timed in 5 hours 19 minutes 49
seconds, a speed of 32 kilometers an hour (20 miles an hour) on a
sweltering trek over six climbs and 173 kilometers (107 miles) from
St. Gaudens to the barren resort of Piau-Engaly in the Pyrenees.
Crowds were small most of the way along the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've dreamed of this day,'' Escartin said. ``I've won stages
in every other big race, but never the Tour. Is this really my
eighth Tour?''
</P>
<P>
   He also vaulted from fifth place over all to second, 6:19 behind
Armstrong. Zulle remained third, 7:26 behind, as Abraham Olano, the
Spanish leader of ONCE, dropped from second to eighth by losing
more than seven minutes to the winner and five minutes to most of
the other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the day really belonged to Armstrong, who used his team and
his rivals to perfection. Other Postal Service riders, especially
Kevin Livingston and Tyler Hamilton, gave Armstrong strong support,
while his rivals seemed flummoxed by his coolness and control.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the yellow jersey knew this stage from a
reconnaissance ride he did in May over its six peaks, five of them
rated first category and one second in an ascending scale of four
to one in difficulty. None of the climbs was rated beyond category,
the most-demanding class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We previewed the stage and at the time decided it would be the
hardest day of the race,'' he said Monday at a news conference.
``It's not as long as Sestriere or Alpe d'Huez,'' he added,
referring to the two Alpine stages, ``but with six climbs, it
should be decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   That it was, or at least tantalizingly close to decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, Armstrong replied to cycling attacks by his
opponents, including Escartin, by accelerating after and joining
them. He rode stony-faced, giving away nothing of his physical
state. Despite the sweat dripping constantly from his chin, he
barely opened his jersey _ others rode with theirs unzipped to
their hips _ and did not pour water over his head although he must
have drunk a lake.
</P>
<P>
   He was playing a waiting game, forcing his rivals to choose
whether they should do the work of chasing Escartin and Laurent
Dufaux, a Swiss with Saeco, who had opened a lead that, at least on
the road, allowed them to overhaul Olano and Zulle in the
standings.
</P>
<P>
   If those two speeded up, Armstrong would have a free ride behind
them; if they stayed put, he would lose no time to them.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth climb, the American began accelerating, leaving
most of his group behind except for Zulle. When the Swiss faded,
Armstrong waited for him, knowing that two men working together use
less energy each than one man does alone.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the final 13-kilometer climb to the finish, Armstrong
began riding like a man looking for victory. But it was too late to
overtake Escartin and Armstrong was content to ride in with Zulle
and Virenque and then allow them free passage.
</P>
<P>
   The last test he faces in the Pyrenees is made up of four major
climbs on Wednesday followed by a 60-kilometer (37-mile) descent in
which riders left behind on the peaks usually catch most of the
first men over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had to deal with one other matter Tuesday, a report in
the French newspaper Le Monde that said a number of riders,
including Armstrong, had small traces of certain anti-inflammatory
drugs known as corticosteroids in their urine when tested earlier
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Corticosteroids are banned except when used for medical
purposes. A Belgian rider, Ludo Dierckxsens, was kicked off his
team on Monday, with the team alleging that Dierckxsens had told a
race doctor, but not the team doctor, that he had used a
corticosteroid to treat a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Le Monde report said the traces in Armstrong's sample were
too small to be classified as positive and Armstrong, when asked
for a response, said, ``This is the first I know of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Blanc, director of the Tour de France, said: ``We're
not scientists, but as far as I can see from the article, the
riders have a trace, 0.2 percent, of the corticosteroid.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Blanc said, seemed to be less than the amount in an
average person.

 WHOPPING LEAP FOR BAY AREA GAS PRICES  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Bay Area gasoline prices have soared in the past
month to an average $1.61 a gallon, or 44 cents more than the
national average, the California State Automobile Association said
Tuesday.
<P>
   This is a full dime more than four weeks ago, the association
reported, attributing the increase mainly to production cutbacks
resulting from fires and an explosion at local refineries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices will continue to creep up or may level off, but we
won't see any relief any time soon,'' said &UR;  &LR; Paul Moreno, spokesman
for the state chapter of the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chevron Corp. was granted permission to sell
``dirty'' gasoline that violates California's stringent
environmental standards. The company said its gas stations might
otherwise run out of fuel following a blast at Chevron's Richmond,
Calif., refinery on July 10, which has left the facility running at
only 30 percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not dirty,'' insisted Mike Libbey, a Chevron spokesman.
``It's less clean.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said the company has not yet brought in any
untreated fuel because additional supplies of environmentally
friendly gas have been found within the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making ends meet right now,'' Libbey said. ``We've found
enough supplies to last the next few days. As for next week, we
don't yet know.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chevron alone is not to blame for the recent increase in
gas prices, its difficulties have exacerbated an already tough
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's Law has been solidly in effect as minor mishaps at
refineries throughout the state have combined with a recent
explosion at a pipeline in Washington State to hamper shipments up
and down the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shortage of gasoline,'' said Rob Schlichting, a
spokesman for the California Energy Commission in Sacramento,
Calif. ``People are having to pay a high price to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the statewide average jumped 8 cents in the last week
to $1.46 a gallon, according to energy commission figures, while
the AAA said the Northern California average has reached $1.59.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be outraged,'' said Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman
for Consumer Action, a San Francisco consumer-advocacy group.
``Even with all the problems, we're still paying much more than we
should.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average consumer feels like he or she is being gouged,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry said past efforts to organize gas boycotts and promote
alternative modes of transportation have pretty much fallen flat.
``People are married to their vehicles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true in the summer, when millions of
Americans take to the road. The AAA estimates that a record number
of motorists will hit the highway before Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   This year, high demand for fuel and assorted snafus at
refineries have gone hand in hand with a run-up in crude oil
prices, which have climbed about $2 in the past two weeks alone.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA's Moreno said all these factors have made for
particularly turbulent prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GAS21 (4519 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In the Bay Area, gas prices typically rise or fall a few cents
from month to month. ``But when we get into double digits _ that's
unusual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   California's high gas prices stem in large part from the strict
rules requiring refineries to produce a cleaner-burning formula.
</P>
<P>
   But Moreno also said competition in the state is limited by ``a
gas and oil market that is dominated by vertically integrated
companies that are involved in everything from exploration to
pumping gas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no competition,'' said Will Woods, executive director
of the Automotive Trade Organizations, a nonprofit group
representing about 900 independent service station and repair-shop
owners statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil companies are making life miserable for our members,''
he said. ``They have total control, and nobody does anything about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California
Energy Institute in Berkeley, Calif., said a key reason for the
state's high gas prices is that the environmental restrictions
``cut off California from the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that competition is lacking, and that this is
especially the case in the Bay Area, where fewer off-brand gas
stations can be found compared to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the simple fact, Borenstein stressed, is that the typical
two-car family uses about 80 gallons of gas per month. A 10-cent
increase at the pump means an overall rise of only about $8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people can afford that,'' Borenstein said. ``Drivers are
incredibly insensitive to gasoline prices.''

KEEPING THEM TOGETHER

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   olice found the 10 children hungry and covered with lice in a
trash-strewn house in downtown Phoenix, cockroaches scurrying
across the babies asleep on the soiled floor.
</P>
<P>
   The kids were taken in by child welfare officials, thrust into
different foster homes, shelters and group homes and kept apart for
years.
</P>
<P>
   It will never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, Shirley and Van Hughes of Mesa will be named the
children's legal parents, their adoptions final. It is the largest
adoption of a group of siblings that experts _ local and national _
can recall.
</P>
<P>
   But Shirley and Van have been Mom and Dad to &UR; these kids for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love us,'' says Maria, now 8, the first to arrive on the
Hughes' doorstep as a foster child at 3, the rest following over
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank. Teresa. Asucena. Steven. Agustino. Juan. Enrique. Maria.
Veronica. Doni.
</P>
<P>
   Torn from each other when their mother could no longer care for
them, they are a family again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the last day in April in 1995 when police found the 10
children, along with five of their cousins, fending for themselves
in a house near 10th and East Roosevelt streets. Their mother and
her sister, the mother of the other children, had been gone for
days, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, according to court records, had a history of
drunken driving and had spent time in jail. She was unreachable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest boy, Frank, was 14 at the time and sometimes stole
food for his brothers and sisters. Teresa, then just 13, was the
closest thing they had to a mother.
</P>
<P>
   The children have four, maybe five different fathers, Shirley
says. No one knows for sure. Anyway, none of them are around.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At about the same time police discovered the siblings, Van and
Shirley decided to take in foster children. The last of their own
two sons, both now grown with children of their own, had moved out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too quiet,'' Van says.
</P>
<P>
   So, in June of 1995, Maria, then just 3, arrived. She said
little more than ``yes'' or ``no'' for the first six months. She
did everything she was told though _ and quickly, obviously afraid,
Shirley says, of what would happen if she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Maria talks a lot _ and happily _ about living here. She
likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to have a big house. My Dad makes a lot of stuff new,
like that,'' she says, pointing to the recently enclosed back
porch. ``He also made us a new air conditioner.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after Maria arrived, state caseworkers asked the Hughes
to take in Enrique, then 5, and Juan, who was 6. They were living
in separate shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique had hair to his shoulders and was mad. He pitched fits
and kicked. Now 9, he's learning to control his temper. He has deep
dimples and plays basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Juan had been told that he was stupid so many times that he
believed it. Now 10, he is his teachers' favorite, Shirley says. He
is a natural soccer player, named the best on his team two years
running.
</P>
<P>
   Then came two more _ 2-year-old Doni and 3-year-old Veronica,
the youngest of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica, now 6, has a loose tooth. She'll have to repeat
kindergarten because her mother's drinking while she was pregnant
has made it hard for the tiny girl to remember things, like numbers
and letters. &UR; Doctors diagnosed her as being fetal alcohol affected.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Four-year-old Doni suffers because of his mother's drinking,
too, diagnosed as having fetal alcohol syndrome. Like his sister,
he has trouble remembering things. Doni was just 6 months old when
the police found him dirty, congested and running a fever with only
a bottle of spoiled milk in his crib.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy's hearing is bad. He often asks Shirley to repeat
what she says. Still, no matter where he is in the house, he can
hear Shirley pick up the keys to the van.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you goin'?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going crazy,'' Shirley tells him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I go?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're driving me there,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Doni follows Shirley everywhere, even camping outside the
bathroom door while she is in there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, with the five youngest children already in the
Hughes' home, state caseworkers asked them to take the older five
as well. Van and Shirley balked. They were 50 and should be
planning their retirement, not another family.
</P>
<P>
   But if they didn't take the remaining five, Shirley says, they
would have been sent to different adoptive homes out of state and
likely never see their siblings again. The kids had been visiting
their brothers and sisters living with the Hughes for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything they have gone through, we couldn't let them
be split up,'' says Shirley, who wears a gold charm on a necklace
that says ``I love Mom,'' a birthday present from the kids.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; So, Shirley ordered pizza and invited the older children over.
She and Van asked them if they wanted to live with them, if they
wanted to live there permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The children voted to stay and moved in in May 1997. Van and
Shirley told the kids that they could call them by their names or
``Mom'' and ``Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   All chose to call them Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   So do their friends. Often, Shirley looks up after hearing
someone say, ``Mom, can I talk to you about something?'' only to
discover that it isn't even one of her own kids.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa, Asucena, Steven and Agustino arrived at the Hughes'
together.
</P>
<P>
   Now 16, Teresa, the little mother, wants to work in child care.
Asucena, 14, wants to be a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The boys are heavy into video games. Agustino, 12, saved his
money and bought a Nintendo 64. Steven, 13, and Enrique pooled
their money for one.
</P>
<P>
   Frank bought his own.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost 16 when he came to live with the Hughes, the last
to arrive. Caseworkers warned the couple that he was a tough kid.
</P>
<P>
   Frank was in four different foster homes and shelters. He talked
mean and sometimes stayed out all night. During a heated argument,
Frank told Van: ``What are you going to do? Beat me like my other
Dad did?''
</P>
<P>
   Van hugged him instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best Dad in the world,'' Frank, now 17, says. ``It's
pretty cool here. I don't got to worry about nothing, like I did
before. I'm glad that we're together. That's what I'm grateful for,
everyone sticking together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every Friday night, Shirley orders six large pizzas _ for a tab
of $55.
</P>
<P>
   ``First few times I called, they thought I had a party every
Friday night,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   They do have a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Their Mesa home is surprisingly quiet for the number of kids
inside. It's never just the Hughes' 10. Friends come for dinner and
stay the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's one more kid?'' Van asks.
</P>
<P>
   In the driveway is a 1991 gray second-hand, 15-passenger van
with 401,000 miles. Six kids are in braces; four wear glasses.
</P>
<P>
   At Calvary Southern Baptist Church in Mesa, the family fills the
front two pews. At breakfast, the kids put away two or three boxes
of cereal and two gallons of milk.
</P>
<P>
   The washer and dryer run all day. The kitchen floor gets mopped
twice a day. And the monthly grocery tab is about $1,500. Some
days, Shirley has to go to the supermarket twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids eat it all on the way home,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Three cats and two dogs live here, along with a variety of
rabbits and turtles that come and, well, go, may they rest in
peace, Shirley says.
</P>
<P>
   A converted garage and dining room make this a six-bedroom house
with three bathrooms. Little kids bathe at night, big ones in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Van is retired from the Navy and works nights as a security
guard at Phoenix City Hall. Shirley stays at home with the kids.
They receive $6,600 a month from the state for the children's care
that they'll continue to get after the adoption.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy evening, they eat dinner next door at the home of
Shirley's parents, Larry and Vera Russo. The kids swim there most
afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday, Larry cooks something on the barbecue and
everyone troops next door to eat. This week, he is wearing a
T-shirt that says, ``Dad knows a lot but Grandpa knows
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who agrees that Dad knows more than Grandpa?'' Van asks over
the chicken, steak, chili and salad. His query is met with a rare
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who agrees that Grandpa knows more than Dad?'' he asks. Ten
hands shoot into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bunch of little suck ups,'' Van mutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Dad, the light is reflecting off of your head,'' Teresa,
16, says, eliciting hoots of laughter from her brothers and
sisters. ``I'm going to smack you!'' Van warns, running his head
over his balding head.
</P>
<P>
   They know he is kidding, of course. These children have had
enough of that. What they get here is love, lots of hugs and
kisses. No one goes to bed without at least one of each.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show them love,'' Shirley says. ``How else are
they going to learn to love?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children set the rules of the house. No running. Bed at 8:30
p.m. for the little kids, 10 p.m. for the teenagers. Curfew.
Chores. Homework before television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, ``You have to be able to walk out of this door
one day and stand on your own two feet,'' Shirley says. ``And the
only way they are going to do that is to get a good education.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no place for a dictatorship, Van says. Start barking
orders, and there would be mutiny. And Van and Shirley would be
outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this home, God is the foundation. These four adults,''
Shirley says, pointing to herself, Van and her parents, ``are the
pillars, and every child is a building block.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems get hammered out at family meetings, which anyone _
even the 4-year-old _ can call. Attendance is mandatory. Shirley
called one recently to complain that the children were slow to do
their chores but quick to ask for their allowances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing we cannot sit down and talk about,'' Shirley
says. ``There are no mistakes that cannot be rectified, nothing
that cannot be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Shirley and Van don't have a solution to a problem,
they turn to the big Bible that lays open on a shelf near the front
door.
</P>
<P>
   With the teenagers, they talk openly about sex. Teresa and
Asucena wear gold promise rings that signify they will not have sex
until they are married. They can date but only with other couples
until they are 17 and ``no smooching all over each other,'' Shirley
says. She tells their dates: ``You toucha my girl, I toucha you
face.'' The girls laugh. Frank gets the same lecture.
</P>
<P>
   They keep no secrets. Some of the children talk to their mother
by telephone. The others are still angry. Shirley sends the woman
the kids' school pictures every year.
</P>
<P>
   That is a different life than the one they are living now. They
laugh here and play sports _ soccer, baseball, swimming,
cheerleading _ with parents cheering from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   They wear new clothes, paid for over time on lay-a-way, the same
way the computer, kitchen table and bunk beds for the girls were
paid for. There's plenty to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always someone here,'' Asucena says. ``And you know
they care.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, after the kitchen _ and the kids _ are clean, prayers
have been said _ and hopefully heard _ the house is quiet. Van
comes home from work at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Both are 52, married for 32 years. Van puts his arm around his
wife, as he does every night, kisses her and says, ``These are
happy times, Shirl, you know that?''
</P>

IRAN'S GORBACHEV 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The tear gas no longer floats over Tehran's streets, the
protesters are gone, and so are the paramilitary thugs enforcing
the will of the clerical ultras who wield power in Iran and don't
want to give it up. After last week's scenes of protest and
repression, Iranians and the rest of the world are wondering
whether the hard-liners came out the winners or whether the first
phase of a new Iranian revolution has begun, one rooted in an
awakening and coalescing of civil society.
</P>
<P>
   Historical analogies are rarely exact, but there is a
tantalizing clue to what Iranian intellectuals anticipate in their
nickname for Iran's reformist president, Mohammad Khatami. They
call him Ayatollah Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Like the last Soviet leader, Khatami plainly wishes to save a
faltering political order by reforming it. Just as Gorbachev tried
to substitute glasnost, with its experiment in free speech, for a
complete jettisoning of the rotted Soviet system, Khatami has
lightened slightly the heavy hand of the theocratic censor while
demanding allegiance to the theocratic principle of
``velayat-e-faqih'' _ the rule of the supreme religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, however, is more than 30 percent in Iran _ a
country rich not only in oil but in educated and skilled people,
many of whom have either fled the dictatorship or languish
unproductively under its boot. Each year 840,000 people enter the
labor market, and the regime cannot provide jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
   These were the underlying realities behind the student protests
in Tehran and other cities. Khatami, who does have considerable
control over the regime's economic policy, is not able to satisfy
the needs of Iran's people. The system is rife with statism and the
inefficiencies of a kleptocracy. Expressing the attitude of the
clerical rulers toward this chronic failure, the Ayatollah Khomeini
famously said economics is for donkeys.
</P>
<P>
   As Gorbachev discovered, however, no amount of ingenious
political juggling can save from extinction a political elite that
is incapable of preventing bankruptcy. In the Soviet Union, the
enlightened reformer Gorbachev was no better suited to reverse the
system's ineluctable impoverishment than were the old Communist
troglodytes, whom the West took to calling conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Khatami has shown no more capability for economic
management than his rivals, the clerical hard-liners who are also
called conservatives in the West. Iran today is drowning in foreign
debt and desperately needs foreign investment. But its many heavy
layers of bureacracy and corruption make the Islamic Republic an
uncertain place to invest money. Despite its great energy
resources, Iran does not offer the investor the transparency and
predictability required for sound investments.
</P>
<P>
   To make Iran a more attractive country to foreign investors and
lenders, Khatami would also have to improve the regime's relations
with Western democracies. The Islamic Republic, however, still
founds its legitimizing ideology on the bedrock of
anti-Americanism. At the counterdemonstrations organized last week
by the government to prove that the protesting students were a
marginal fringe of society infiltrated by provocateurs from the
imperialist (American) and Zionist (Israeli) enemies, the bused-in
civil servants and other dutiful demonstrators were made to shout
the old revolutionary slogan ``Death to America!''
</P>
<P>
   For the students who thought they were backing Khatami's
glasnost by protesting the closing of a reformist newspaper and
then were beaten and thrown out of dormitory windows by
paramilitary thugs, the political revelation of this month's
turmoil was that when the chips were down, Khatami sided with the
other theocrats _ and against civil society's demand for a modicum
of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   At certain key moments during his six-year reign, Gorbachev,
too, was obliged to side with repressive conservatives, notably
after violent episodes in Lithuania and Georgia. In the long run,
the phony distinction between reformer and conservative did not
fool Russians aspiring to self-government. Gorbachev followed his
hard-line rivals into the dustbin of history. And if Iranians have
the good fortune to throw off the misrule of the mullahs and govern
themselves, they will likely remember Khatami the way Russians
remember Gorbachev, as the pretender who tried to save an
unredeemable system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bucking President Clinton's angry protests and
threat of a veto, the House on Tuesday night approved a $2 billion
bill for teacher training and recruitment that did not require, as
the president wished, that over $1 billion be devoted to his
initiative to reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 additional
teachers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal would instead permit states to decide
how much of the federal money they receive to use for hiring new
teachers and how much to use for the professional development of
existing ones. The bill passed by a mostly party-line vote of
239-185, with 24 Democrats joining 215 Republicans to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's advocates said the flexibility it would give both
states and local school districts was the only way to make sure
that schools did not find themselves forced to hire teachers simply
to fulfill a mandatory body count.
</P>
<P>
   ``After teaching high school for more than 16 years, I know
firsthand that it isn't necessarily the quantity of teachers that
makes a difference, but the quality of teachers you put in the
classroom,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic opponents said that Republicans were setting up a
false choice, and that parents could have it all: small classes led
by excellent teachers.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats, along with President Clinton, pleaded for a
Democratic alternative that called for $3 billion in federal
spending on teachers next year, $1.5 billion of which would be
dedicated to the hiring of additional teachers who had certain
basic qualifications. That alternative was only narrowly defeated,
along party lines, by a vote of 207 in favor of the measure to 217
in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that the president sent to Hastert on Monday,
Clinton complained that the Republican bill ``fails to guarantee
that any funding will be used for hiring new teachers to reduce
class size.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we made a promise to America's children to provide
smaller classes with well-prepared teachers,'' Clinton wrote,
referring to an agreement between Democrats and Republicans,
reached within the context of an omnibus spending bill, that led to
an expenditure of $1.2 billion this year for the hiring of the
first 30,000 new teachers. ``I urge Congress to keep that
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The pledge and projection of 100,000 new teachers was one that
Clinton and many other Democrats proudly trumpeted, and Republicans
clearly wanted to undercut it by raising questions about whether
there was any quality control in the equation and about why federal
lawmakers did not trust local governments to decide their most
pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's vote left the fate of Clinton's initiative
unclear. Democratic leaders succeeded in keeping enough of their
party members in the fold that the margin of victory for
Republicans was not nearly enough to override a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   It is also difficult to predict what the Senate, which seems to
be several months away from any consideration of similar
legislation, will do. Earlier this year, a majority of senators
signaled a desire to scuttle Clinton's 100,000-teachers pledge, but
that vote did not ultimately become part of any legislation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Republican bill that the House passed Tuesday night
represented the first step in a months-long process of
reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which
comes up for renewal every five years and represents about $13
billion a year in federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which concerns the next fiscal year, combined about
$800 million that was being spent on teacher training under the act
with the extra $1.2 billion that the federal government had
allocated for the salaries of additional teachers, for a total of
$2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill then proposed that states be given broad discretion
over how to spend their portions of that money on improving the
teaching in schools. That latitude adhered to a larger philosophy
and broader push among congressional Republicans to transfer more
control over the spending of federal education dollars to the state
and local level.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats said that in this case the Republicans were
going too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definition of professional development is broad enough to
permit a teacher trip to Disneyland,'' said Rep. Robert Andrews,
D-N.J. ``This money will become a slush fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also said that the bill would alter the current
formula, which guarantees the poorest school districts a larger
share of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who voted for the bill, said
Republicans had made last-minute changes to soften this impact.
Miller added that the Republican bill, more so than the Clinton
administration's teacher-hiring initiative, would institute
stringent competency requirements and effectively prevent the
dumping of inadequate instructors on schools in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that to be a historic change,'' Miller said.

SUCCESS TO EXCESS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's record trade deficit _ $21.3 billion in May _ is a
tribute to the American economy, a combination of the confidence
that goes with rising personal and corporate earnings and a strong
dollar. However, too much success can become a problem _ for which
the remedy may be uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the causes for the deficit are out of
American hands. The Asian economies have begun to recover from
their debacle of 1997 and 1998 but have not yet resumed their full
role as major American customers. As former treasury secretary
Robert Rubin observed, the United States can't be Asia's customer
of last resort forever. The yen has risen against the dollar, but
Japan's deep-seated cultural unwillingness to give foreign goods
and services full access to its economy has kept its trade surplus
high.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, too, has lagged as a customer. Trade relations have been
clouded by nasty squabbles over minor issues like bans on imports
of American hormone-fed beef and retaliatory American moves. Of
more substance, the newly launched euro has sagged more than 10
percent against the dollar, though it has been bolstered in the
past few days, primarily by the perception of American trade
problems. If the euro resumes its decline, US competitiveness will
be further diminished.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Americans luxuriate in the best of
conditions. US unemployment rates are the lowest among major
industrial nations. Prices are steady, and the prices of imported
goods have played a major role in keeping domestic prices down
while consumers enjoy wide choices in quality and variety of goods.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot last forever. Bringing trade back into balance
requires economic recovery elsewhere and relentless American
efforts to improve the quality and lower the cost of US goods and
services so they are competitive in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that the American economy will soften and that the
siren song of protectionism, never far beneath the surface of the
American political scene, will lure the unwary into that
destructive trap. That would be a bad sequel to these good times.

 DRUG MAKERS REPORTING MIXED RESULTS DURING SECOND QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's largest pharmaceutical companies are expected to
notch some healthy gains in second-quarter earnings this week, but
analysts are not convinced that will be enough to rouse investor
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, long dismissed as an industry laggard,
surprised analysts Tuesday by announcing a 14.9 percent increase in
its second-quarter earnings, to $1.16 billion. The company, which
makes such disparate brands as Tylenol, Neutrogena and the anemia
drug Procrit, said it had earned 84 cents a diluted share, 2 cents
above First Call Corp.'s consensus estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Two other drug makers also reported results Tuesday, with
varying success. SmithKline Beecham PLC, the world's 10th-largest
drug maker, posted a 12 percent earnings gain, to $487 million;
sales of its popular antidepressant Paxil increased 27 percent.
SmithKline said it had earned 40 cents per American depository
receipt, which met analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Even though American Home Products Corp. warned investors last
month that its earnings would fall below expectations, the
company's performance startled some analysts. The company, which is
based in Madison, N.J., said that its second-quarter earnings
decreased 13.7 percent from last year's period, to $451.7 million
before a special charge.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday that despite American Home's warning, they
were surprised by the depth of the 29 percent plunge in the
company's agricultural division. The company attributed the decline
to lower demand in the United States for its Pursuit, Raptor, Prowl
and Scepter herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   American Home also raised eyebrows by taking a $53 million
charge to suspend shipments temporarily for Rotashield, its vaccine
against the rotavirus. Some analysts interpreted the charge as a
signal from American Home that it would not continue the drug.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when most drug stocks declined, investors had mixed
reactions to the earnings news. Shares of Johnson &AMP; Johnson
increased 0.5 percent, or 50 cents, to $96.4375. American Home
Products' stock dropped 3.95 percent, or $1.9375, to close at
$50.9375. SmithKline Beecham's ADRs dropped 2.7 percent, or $1.625,
to close at $61.375.
</P>
<P>
   After being one of the globe's best- performing sectors last
year, drug makers have lagged this year. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index has increased 12.03 percent so far this year but
the S&AMP;P drug index has fallen 10.2 percent. Shares of Eli Lilly &AMP;
Co. are down 16.95 percent this year, while Pfizer Inc.'s stock has
decreased 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, the drug stocks were
overvalued,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners
in New York. ``But now the prices have fallen so much that they are
undervalued. A lot of people moved their money out to put it in
another sector. And some people may have been nervous about
President Clinton's Medicare plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the drug makers remain solid. Second-quarter
earnings are expected to increase 11 percent over last year, thanks
to enormous gains of pharmaceuticals sold in the United States. For
the full year, earnings are expected to increase 15 percent, one
percentage point below last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some drug makers could still report higher gains than expected.
Analysts said pharmaceutical sales at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
and Eli Lilly might be higher than expected. Bristol-Myers is
expected to report a 15 percent earnings gain Thursday and Lilly is
expected to report an increase of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, Warner-Lambert Co., the industry's earnings
leader, is expected to notch a second-quarter gain of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson's performance came with a caveat. Analysts
noted that drug wholesalers had stocked up about $100 million worth
of the company's drugs _ as they did in lesser amounts from other
companies _ in anticipation of a price increase. Yet, even with
that stockpiling, Johnson &AMP; Johnson's performance was stellar.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported record second-quarter sales of $6.85
billion, thanks largely to a 37.3 percent increase in
pharmaceutical sales in the United States. Analysts said Tuesday
that Procrit's sales increased more than 90 percent during the
quarter in the United States, while the company's deep portfolio
appeared to pay dividends. Worldwide sales of Neutrogena skin
products jumped 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any way you look at it, J&AMP;J's performance was really good,''
said Traversa. ``They received some savings from their
restructuring, but most of this came from the top line in
pharmaceutical sales.''

 VIDEO WARS _ BIG CHAINS SQUEEZING INDEPENDENT RENTAL STORES  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- It's summertime, but the living isn't easy for
most independent video rental stores.
<P>
   The economy is hot. Kids are out of school and watching movies.
Yet the Video Software Dealers Association annual convention in Los
Angeles last week looked more like a wake than a celebration of the
$17 billion-a-year home video industry, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Just as independent booksellers have accused the giant chains of
using predatory prices to try and drive them out of business,
independent video stores make similar claims. They argue that
Blockbuster and Hollywood Entertainment have made a concerted
effort to capture their customers by offering super-low prices on
new releases, even though they may lose money in the process.

   Andy Katz, owner of Five Star Video stores in Berkeley, Calif.,
and Albany, Calif., figures that the two giants of the rental
business ``don't want to peacefully coexist. They want to gain
market share at any cost and, once they control it, raise prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The chains have a big advantage because they can acquire
cassettes at lower costs and strike favorable rental
revenue-sharing agreements with the Hollywood studios. The moves
have allowed the chains to both conserve cash and plaster their
walls with scores of copies of the latest releases that have the
greatest appeal to young renters.
</P>
<P>
   In response, stores like Five Star have de-emphasized new
releases and try to draw customers with fuller libraries of foreign
and independent films and old chestnuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point of going deep with copies of movies like
`Saving Private Ryan?' '' Katz asks rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Blockbuster (which has a location five blocks away)
will guarantee they have it in stock or give something for free if
they don't,'' Katz says.
</P>
<P>
   He says his business is down 20 percent from its peak in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is even worse at Captain Video on San Pablo Avenue
in Albany. With two Blockbusters within a mile striking distance,
``there's been a slow loss of market share,'' said store manager
Bill Wood. ``We've lost money for over a year.'' As a result, this
Captain Video store and its 4,000 titles will close permanently
after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 20,000 independent video stores in the United
States. ``But they are going out of business at an alarming rate,''
said John Merchant, owner of 49er Video stores in the Sacramento,
Calif., area and a director of the Video Software Dealers
Association and the Independent Video Retailers Group. ``I've heard
as many as 400 a month are leaving the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchant used to have five stores but he is down to four _ and
only three are profitable. ``We've taken quite a beating,'' he
said. ``We know we can't compete going head-to-head with
Blockbuster on new releases.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Blockbuster's market share of the home video industry
is close to 35 percent and Hollywood Entertainment's is approaching
7 percent, according to Marcy Magiera, editor of Video Business
Magazine, a weekly published by Varsity Group in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little guys believe they are at a huge and unfair price
disadvantage compared to the big stores,'' she said. ``They've been
talking about filing an antitrust action for a long time but
whether volume discounts are untoward, unethical or illegal is an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster, a unit of media giant Viacom Inc. and the largest
video rental chain with about 6,500 stores around the world, has
recovered from a two-year slump largely as a result of revenue
sharing agreements with Hollywood studios. Nevertheless, the Dallas
company has lost close to $1 billion since Viacom Chairman Sumner
Redstone bought it for $8.4 billion five years ago, according to
industry estimates. Blockbuster will soon sell 18 percent of its
shares to the public, and Redstone said he expects to reach 40 to
50 percent market share sooner than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Entertainment, based in Wilsonville, Ore., has more
than 1,000 outlets and lost $50.5 million on $763.9 million
revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how to order is crucial to success in the movie rental
business. But it is far from simple, according to Five Star's Katz,
46, who has an MBA from MIT and was a commodity broker and Chevron
marketer before getting into the movie rental business 12 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to sell securities, but this is the most difficult
portfolio I've ever managed,'' he said. ``With stocks or options,
it usually doesn't make much difference if you buy one or 100
(units). But in videocassettes, the more you buy, the less chance
you have of making money if they just sit on the shelf. But if you
have too few, your customers will go elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other video shop operators say that before ordering
cassettes it is essential to analyze how well the movies did at the
box office and how well they are likely to do in the rental market,
anticipate what the big chains will do, and assess the tastes of
their own customers.
</P>
<P>
   To break even on new releases, Katz figures he needs to rent out
each cassette 23 times for $3.25. Katz is wary of buying too many
cassettes because he realizes the giants will stock hundreds of
copies on the expectation that everyone who wants to see the movie
will have done so in a few weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   For new releases like ``Analyze This,'' the Warner Bros. comedy
starring Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro that comes out next
month, Katz said that he will order six copies per store. Five
years ago, he would have bought 15 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Blockbuster and Hollywood will guarantee (the
availability of) rentals, and if I buy 15, I'll lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent stores increasingly try to compete on everything but
new releases.
</P>
<P>
   Le Video in San Francisco has one of the best movie libraries,
with nearly 50,000 titles, and customers including Robin Williams,
Nicholas Cage and Joan Chen.
</P>
<P>
   The store is doing well enough to expand recently from one
storefront to two to house all its movies, which typically rent for
$3.50 for four nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus on a different market,'' said Rudha, the store
manager. Le Video has no ``new release'' wall, and recent releases
account for less than a third of its inventory. By contrast, there
are large sections devoted to cult and classic films and and movies
cataloged by country, director and actor.
</P>
<P>
   Five Star's store, on University Avenue in Berkeley, has a
library of close to 15,000 VHS tapes and sections devoted to
Humphrey Bogart, gay and lesbian films, El Cerrito, Calif.,
filmmaker Les Blank and other specialties. It also has a wide
selection of about 1,400 DVD disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independent stores can differentiate themselves by offering
more DVDs, foreign, independent and adult titles and more
personalized service,'' said video market consultant Barbara
McNamara of Alexander &AMP; Associates in New York. ``But with limited
budgets to buy films and advertise it has definitely become more
difficult for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to competition from the chain stores, independent
operators face consumer defections to pay-per-view cable services
and satellite TV broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, they will have to confront ``streaming'' video,
or ``movies on demand,'' which will allow consumers to conveniently
download movies directly from Web sites in just a few minutes and
play them whenever they want, just like home videos.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, savvy independents can compete on
selection, service, clever promotions and even consumer preference
for the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   49er Video's John Merchant, who offers defensive strategy
seminars to independent operators, recommends special pricing deals
like discounts for senior citizens or five catalog movies for five
days for $4.

PILOT ERROR LOOMS LARGE IN KENNEDY CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airplane accident investigators frequently say any accident is
the result of seven or eight factors coming together in a deadly
combination. Remove any one of them from the sequence and the
accident would not occur.
</P>
<P>
   While the cause of Friday's crash that killed John F. Kennedy
Jr., his wife and sister-in-law is still under investigation, pilot
error is something investigators are closely considering. The
plane, with Kennedy at the controls, went into a steep dive in the
moments before it crashed off Martha's Vineyard. There are two
possible explanations: mechanical problems or pilot error. Based on
previous accidents, the latter seems more likely, said a longtime
accident investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   If Kennedy was at fault, one crucial element in the sequence of
events that led to the accident, was the pressure on him to make
the flight in uncertain weather. Pilots call it ``gethome-itis.''
</P>
<P>
   There were reasons for Kennedy not to make the flight _ the
weather was questionable, he and his party were delayed leaving New
York City and stuck in traffic which resulted in the flight
departing three hours later than he had planned _ critical factors
for a pilot not qualified to use instruments to fly the plane in
poor visibility.
</P>
<P>
   But there were even more reasons to make the flight: His cousin
Rory was to be married the next day; he had promised that he would
drop his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette off on Martha's Vineyard
before flying to Barnstable Airport; he had spent about $300,000 on
the the Piper Saratoga II HP 2 1/2 months ago and wanted to use it;
and, quite possibly, as celebrities, Kennedy and his wife found the
idea of flying in their own private plane much more attractive than
traveling on a commercial flight.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on a pilot to reach his or her destination has
afflicted pilots much more seasoned than Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, an American Airlines MD-82, which was piloted by
Richard Buschmann, American's chief pilot in Chicago for the MD-80,
landed in Little Rock, Ark., in a driving thunderstorm, went off
the end of the runway at 90 m.p.h. and slammed into a light pier.
Buschmann and 10 others were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the areas investigators in that crash are examining are
Buschmann's decision to land at Little Rock in a thunderstorm. The
plane, scheduled to spent the overnight in Little Rock, was two
hours late leaving Dallas and its crew had spent 13 1/2 hours
flying that day, 30 minutes less than the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that comes up in many accident investigations,
but we have never made any specific recommendation to deal with
this issue,'' said an official with the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Komich, a commercial airline pilot who works for Damos
Research, a Los Angeles-based aviation consulting firm, said that
Kennedy almost certainly realized the margins of safety for his
flight were diminished, but did not consider it unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not as safe as daytime flight in good weather, and that
is part of the judgment process, but 99.9 percent of the time, it
would work and I guarantee you, pilots like him do what he did
everyday, said Komich.''
</P>
<P>
   Komich said commercial pilots are bitten by the same bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``You push to get home,'' he said. ``You don't want to lay over
in East Umpty Ump when your car is parked at the airport you are
supposed to fly to.''
</P>
<P>
   Succumbing to pressure to make the flight was just one link in
the chain that led to the accident. If spatial orientation caused
the accident, then almost certainly, leaving three hours behind
schedule, was a contibuting factor, since safety experts think it
likely Kennedy could have easily made the flight in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   But in the night-time, looking away from the horizon, even to do
something as simple as change the radio frequency dial in order to
prepare to talk with controller at Martha's Vineyard, could spell
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Spatial disorientation has brought down pilots much more
experienced than Kennedy, who had in excess of 300 hours of flight
time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 a US Air Force tactical air command report found that
command fighter pilots with as much as 6,000 hours of flying time
could become disoriented flying at night by simple distractions
like changing radio frequencies. The study found that if it took
pilots as much as 45 seconds to scan their instruments to realize
their plane was in trouble _ either losing altitude or flying at an
unsual angle _ they had wasted too much time to successfully
recover.
</P>
<P>
   And the closer the pilots were to the ground, the less time they
had to recover the aircraft. Kennedy was at 2,200 feet at the start
of the plane's dive.

REPORT CRITICIZES CLINTON'S PLAN FOR TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Spelling of ``Kati'' in penultimate graf is CQ) 
(yn) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding fuel to widespread concern about the looming shortage of
qualified public-school teachers, a new report contends that some
of the most trumpeted plans for change would only make matters
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-page report, ``Better Teachers, Better Schools,'' was
released by the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation last week just as
Congress was getting ready to debate competing proposals to spend
billions in Federal funds to raise the quality of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is a three-year-old research group based in
Washington (it has no connection to Fordham University) that has
become an influential voice on the conservative, free-market side
of many education debates. Its president, and a principal editor of
the report on teaching, is Chester E. Finn Jr., who was an
assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   The report takes sharp issue with the Clinton administration's
proposal to raise the standards for teacher certification. ``Every
additional requirement for prospective teachers _ every additional
pedagogical course, every new hoop or hurdle _ will have a
predictable and inexorable effect,'' it says. ``It will limit the
potential supply of teachers by narrowing the pipeline while having
no bearing whatever on the quality or effectiveness of those in the
pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   It recommends scrapping most teacher-hiring regulations,
particularly those that tie would-be teachers to education schools
and courses on methodology, and instead make it easier for local
school districts to hire teachers who know their academic fields
well. ``Instead of requiring a long list of courses and degrees,
test future teachers for their knowledge and skills,'' it says.
``Focus relentlessly on results, on whether students are
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   With retirements and record enrollments, 2 million teachers are
expected to be hired in the next 10 years. President Clinton has
called for tightening teaching requirements, and the Education
Department is working with the states in drafting tougher standards
for teacher training. The Fordham report calls these approaches
counterproductive; in turn, the Education Department, major teacher
unions and accreditation agencies are attacking the report as
simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   The report's essays are particularly hard on two leading
accreditation agencies: the National Board for Professional
Teaching Standards, which seeks to identify master teachers and has
been praised by Clinton; and the National Council for Accreditation
of Teacher Education, the largest accreditor of teacher-training
programs. It accuses both of playing into the hands of teachers
unions by disregarding academic knowledge in favor of fuzzy,
unproven theories that focus on a congenial learning environment
instead of the learning itself.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from those criticized in the report has been quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chapter about the National Board is wrong on so many
scores that it isn't possible to quickly cite the inaccuracies and
misrepresentations in it,'' said James A. Kelly, president of the
teaching standards board. He said the board's standards are
developed by leading scholars, undergo a lengthy review process and
are supported not just by teacher unions but also by the National
School Boards Association, prominent business groups and the
federal and state governments. He said the Fordham report reflected
Finn's preconceived views, and called it ``a polemic cleverly
camouflaged as scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chase, president of the National Education Association,
the nation's largest teachers union, defended teacher licensing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Licensure isn't a regulatory intrusion,'' he said. ``It's a
standard to protect children. The loosey-goosey approach suggested
by Mr. Finn would sweep away all requirements. We don't need warm
bodies _ we need good, qualified teachers teaching our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Therese Dozier, special adviser on teaching to the secretary of
education, said the Fordham Foundation report actually buttressed
the administration's contention that teachers should not get
licenses outside the fields in which they are qualified. Tightening
certification is not incompatible with opening up alternative
pathways to teaching, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position has always been, we don't care how you acquire
the knowledge and skills to be an effective teacher, as long as you
can demonstrate that,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group
that advocates better training of teachers, said she agreed with
the report's emphasis on teachers knowing their subjects, and
warned that the administration was likely to leave it too easy to
hold a teaching certificate. But she added that methodology is
still important, particularly when dealing with younger children
and beginner skills like reading. She also said the report appeared
to place too much faith in the ability of principals and parents to
choose teachers wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the foundation report, she said, ``This is a group of
essentially conservative folks going to war with the Democrats and
each pretending that the other is doing something that it isn't.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MENEMSHA, Mass. _ Investigators located what they believe was
the ``splash point'' where John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane plunged into
the ocean, but a rapid deployment of divers Tuesday to two nearby
targets failed to turn up bodies or wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The site 7 1/2 miles southwest of Aquinnah, or Gay Head, on
Martha's Vineyard was pinpointed using a new and more chilling
account of the plane's final moments. As he navigated through the
inky night, Kennedy began an unexplained right turn, then suddenly
dived toward the water at roughly 10 times the normal rate of
descent, even faster than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   Some aeronautics authorities said the new information suggests
Kennedy's plane corkscrewed into a ``graveyard spiral,'' but
investigators declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also declined to speculate on the force of the
impact or its effect on the plane or its passengers. However, chief
investigator Robert Pearce of the National Transportation Safety
Board said: ``I'm sure you can draw a conclusion by the debris
we've been bringing in, which is fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   A highly placed source familiar with the investigation said
searchers ``are not very hopeful about the condition of the
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials said the two target areas were 115 feet
below the ocean surface, but the search was complicated by
52-degree water at the bottom, strong currents, and visibility of
less than eight feet. Divers earlier Tuesday ruled out four other
targets identified by sophisticated sonar vessels, leaving 13 or 14
potential debris sites to be examined during the around-the-clock
effort to find the plane and the remains of Kennedy, his wife
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a Federal Aviation Administration source said the
agency was considering disciplining an employee who failed to
follow up on a telephone inquiry about Kennedy's plane 25 minutes
after it fell off radar screens Friday night. The source said FAA
officials planned to interview the unidentified employee before
deciding what action, if any, to take.
</P>
<P>
   The call, a transcript of which was published Tuesday by the
Globe, was made by a Martha's Vineyard Airport employee, Adam Budd,
on behalf of a couple who had come to the airport to meet Lauren
Bessette. Budd called an FAA outpost in Bridgeport, Conn.,
mentioning Kennedy by name, offering two possible identification
numbers for his plane, and asking whether it was possible to track
the airplane because ``they wanna know, uh, where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   As the search dragged through a fourth unproductive day,
Kennedy's sister Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg emerged from
seclusion Tuesday. First, she and her husband went on an hour-long
bicycle ride near their Bridgehampton, N.Y., summer home, where a
flag flew at half-staff. Later she went for a drive with an
entourage that included two cousins, television newswoman Maria
Shriver and William Kennedy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of memorial services also began in earnest, and there were
reports that the Kennedy family is considering marking their losses
Thursday or Friday at the Church of St. Thomas More in Manhattan,
where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis sometimes worshipped.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official word where Kennedy and his wife might be
buried, but workers at Arlington National Cemetery apparently took
it upon themselves to measure the plot where Kennedy's parents,
infant brother Patrick, and a stillborn sister are buried. Sources
close to the family, however, said there are no plans to seek
permission for burials at Arlington. The Bessette family released
no information on memorial plans for Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   At a late afternoon briefing, Pearce, the chief crash
investigator, added grim new details to the final minutes of the
tragic flight.
</P>
<P>
   About seven minutes before the plane crashed, Kennedy was flying
_ apparently uneventfully _ at 5,600 feet. He was 34 miles from
Martha's Vineyard Airport.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Kennedy was heading in an easterly direction and
traveling at about 160 knots, which translates into a ground speed
of 184 miles per hour. He then began descending at a rate of about
700 feet per minute. Pilots familiar with Kennedy's Piper Saratoga
II HP said that was a normal, if somewhat rapid, rate of descent.
</P>
<P>
   That initial descent continued for about five minutes, at which
point he was 20 miles from the airport at an altitude of 2,300
feet. He then started to turn to the right, off course from
Martha's Vineyard. The plane rose to 2,600 feet at the start of the
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy remained at that altitude for one minute, on a
southeasterly heading, putting him about 18 miles from the airport.
Kennedy then began another descent at a rate of 700 feet per
minute, and started a turn back to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, 30 seconds into that maneuver, the airplane started a
turn to the right and a rapid descent,'' Pearce said. He said an
NTSB computer analysis determined the plane was racing downard in
excess of 5,000 feet per minute. A day earlier, NTSB officials
estimated the descent at 4,700 feet per minute. The descent gauge
on Kennedy's type of plane goes only to 2,000 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran pilots say a descent of 5,000 feet per minute at that
altitude would be nearly impossible for someone with Kennedy's
experience _ or even considerably more _ to regain control.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators declined to say why Kennedy might have undertaken
the previously undisclosed maneuvers. But pilots and aeronautics
authorities speculated he might have become disoriented on a night
with heavy haze and little moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee said sonar scans by
two boats from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration, the Rude and the Whiting, and the Coast Guard
cutter Willow had identified two clusters of dive targets five
miles apart off the Martha's Vineyard coast.
</P>
<P>
   Divers from the Massachusetts State Police and the Navy vessel
USS Grasp ruled out four targets from an original group of 10,
while the sonar boats added seven or eight more targets that will
be searched in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, FAA officials continued their public defense of
the employee who received the phone inquiry about Kennedy's plane,
saying the 10:05 p.m. Friday call was not specific enough to prompt
a response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish very much that we'd had more information, but we had
no information that the plane was in trouble or overdue,'' said FAA
spokesman Eliot Brenner. ``We do not provide information on private
citizens or private aircraft over the telephone. Again, we wish
we'd gotten more information.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA source said that although they do not believe the
employee acted improperly, officials are upset that the man did not
come forward to tell superiors about the call when it became clear
the plane was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Under FAA policy, if a pilot files a flight plan, no action
would be taken on such a call until a plane was at least 30 minutes
overdue. In cases such as Kennedy's, where no flight plane was
filed, the FAA takes no action until a plane is an hour overdue and
reported so by ``a reliable source.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, FAA policy is not to release information over the
telephone unless the caller is known to the FAA. In the case of a
plane involving a Kennedy, the FAA source said, officials might be
even more reluctant to release information out of fear that the
caller could be ``a nutcase or paparazzi.''
</P>
<P>
   A second FAA source would not even discuss the possibility of
discipline, saying, ``He did the right thing. He did not release
private information. But in retrospect, it might have been useful
to ask some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, no action was taken until more than four hours
after Budd's call. The first response resulted from a 2:15 a.m.
Saturday call to the Coast Guard by a Kennedy friend identified as
Carol Ratowell. An official search and rescue mission began just
over an hour later, at 3:28 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Until the plane is found, there is no way to know whether a
quicker response time might have made a difference in the survival
of Kennedy and the Bessette sisters. Based on radar readings, the
plane made a sharp plunge into the ocean, and aeronautics
authorities said there was a low chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the country's largest general aviation
association said he agreed with the FAA's explanation that the call
was ignored because Budd never used the precise language required
in such a situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was asking the specialist to read someone's mind and read
between the lines,'' said Warren Morningstar, director of media
relations for the Aircraft Owner and Pilots Association, a lobbying
group with 340,000 members. ``Their primary job is pilot briefings,
and I would have a hard time throwing stones at them for this.''
</P>
<P>

   ``Since we've been here we haven't heard a thing about it,''
said Dave Thomassen, a day-tripper from Plymouth. ``What else can
you do? You just have to wait and see what happens.''

   Beyond Martha's Vineyard, the commercialization of the tragedy

online auction house eBay.com. By late afternoon, there were 289
items for sale linked to John F. Kennedy Jr., including a signed
credit card slip that had attracted 17 bids, the last one for $635.
Someone also was offering the internet domain name
carolyn-bessette.com for $35,000. There were no bidders.

PEPSICO PROFIT IS UP 50 PERCENT, AIDED BY SPINOFF OF BOTTLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showing solid company-wide results, Pepsico said Tuesday that
its second-quarter earnings rose 50 percent, based in large part on
a one-time gain from the spinoff of its bottling operations in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Without the $270 million gain from the spinoff, Pepsico's
earnings rose 7.4 percent, to $467 million, or 31 cents a diluted
share, compared with operating profit of $435 million, or 28 cents
a share, in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 29 cents a share,
according to First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings. With
the gain, net income was $743 million, or 49 cents a share,
compared with $494 million, or 33 cents a share, in the quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-forma revenue rose 5 percent, to $4.5 billion from $4.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings exceeded our expectations,'' said Bill
Pecoriello, a beverage analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, adding
that he expected Wall Street analysts to increase their earnings
estimates for Pepsico for the rest of the year based on the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Several divisions finished the quarter with
greater-than-expected profit, and Pepsi collected $30 million in
equity income from Pepsi Bottling Group, which it spun off in late
March.
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Emanuel Goldman of Merrill Lynch, noted that
Pepsi's soft-drink sales rose 3 percent, a departure from years
past. ``That was certainly a standout in the quarter, and it is a
marked contrast to what the company has been going through,'' he
said. For the last six months, supermarket scanner data have shown
Pepsi products selling faster than those of its chief rival,
Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   However, volume growth at Frito-Lay North America, which
accounts for about half of Pepsico's earnings, was just 3.5
percent, Goldman added. ``That's OK, but it's nothing to write home
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay North America posted a 12 percent increase in
operating profit. In addition, Frito-Lay's international division
increased its operating profit 6 percent, to $91 million, on $867
million in revenue. Volume rose 10 percent in the division, about
half of it from acquisitions, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   On the soft-drink side, Pepsi-Cola North America increased its
revenue 5 percent, to $751 million, although operating profit grew
only 2.5 percent, to $205 million. Pepsi-Cola International's
revenue was flat, the company said, while operating profit rose
slightly, to $44 million compared with $41 million in the quarter a
year earlier. Bottler case sales declined 3 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue at Tropicana, the juice company Pepsi acquired a year
ago, rose 12 percent, to $533 million, the company said, with 4
percent more volume. Equity income rose 30 percent, to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a much sharper focus on the marketplace, we're generating
healthy volume gains, better returns and higher earnings growth,''
Roger A. Enrico, the chairman of Pepsico, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said he thought that focus would turn to Frito-Lay's
domestic operations in the coming months. ``As Frito goes, so goes
the earnings,'' he said.

 A FINE TIME TO TAKE A TAX BREAK  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: What tax incentives are available to businesses that are
starting or expanding in California and how do you apply for them?
<P>
   A: It's a good time to win tax breaks. The clamor of states,
counties and countries to create jobs and bolster their industrial
and tax bases has set off fierce bidding battles around the world.
The favored weapon in this corporate dating game is a nifty package
of tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
   California now has one of the richest programs. Last year,
California state and local programs to promote economic growth
granted nearly $9 billion in corporate, sales, use and other tax
exemptions, according to Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's bigger than the budgets of many states,'' notes Richard
Sloniker, a multistate tax partner for the accounting and
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche's Center for Multistate Taxation at the
University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee has just published ``A
Lawmaker's Guide to the use of Business Tax Incentives.'' The
booklet discusses the various types of incentives, including income
tax credits and deductions; exemptions from sales, use and property
taxes; and enterprise zones. (For a free copy, e-mail
hightech &LR; dttus.com.)
</P>
<P>
   This guide also discusses the pros and cons of tax incentives
and has interesting tales of how states have used financial lures
to persuade companies to relocate, expand or stay put. For example,
North Carolina awarded $155 million of incentives to Nucor last
year to locate a steel mill in Hertford County that will create 300
jobs. That translates into an astounding $517,333 per job.
</P>
<P>
   There are several steps you can take to win business tax
incentives, starting with simply asking. Sloniker says that many
companies falsely believe they do not qualify so they do not bother
to ask. That can be a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start your research is the California Trade and
Commerce Agency. It has offices in the Bay Area or you can go to
its Web site (www.locate.ca.gov/) and click on Section 5
Incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Also, contact your local chamber of commerce about incentives
offered by your county or city. The state and local governments
often form so-called Red Teams with the private sector to identify
and package programs to lure or retain particularly attractive
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the main programs in California:
</P>
<P>
   _ Enterprise zones. There are various sites in California, such
as San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and elsewhere, that provide
generous incentives to hire the economically disadvantaged. Credits
can be as much as 50 percent of first-year pay. That means a
business might be able to deduct $8,000 of a worker's $16,000
compensation directly from its tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   _ Manufacturer's investment credit. Businesses that purchase
equipment for use in California manufacturing can offset income
taxes by 6 percent of the purchase price. For example, a company
that buys $10,000 of equipment could deduct $600 from its state
income tax bill. New corporate taxpayers can get a credit on their
state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Research and development credit. Companies that increase their
R&AMP;D spending can deduct up to 11 percent of the incremental
increase in expenditures directly from their tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   Sloniker said that most any business that contributes to the
economic health and well-being of the state and local economy is
eligible for something. Typically, these companies have 100 or more
employees. But smaller firms that are prestigious or have
high-paying jobs or great growth prospects can qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Start researching and negotiating early. The bigger your
company, the more time it will take. &UR;  &LR; Deloitte &AMP; Touche says a good
rule of thumb is to start preparing for credits and incentives
negotiations about two years prior to a move, acquisition,
expansion or expiration of a lease option.
</P>
<P>
   It is good to select two or three comparable sites and then
prepare your case by compiling the following data:
</P>
<P>
   _ Business profile. This includes basic information such as
number of employees, combined annual salaries and tax payments.
Also emphasize what your company offers the community and the
state, such as positive publicity, charitable work or environmental
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ List of desired business tax incentives. You may not get all
the tax credits, incentives or special waivers you seek. But
Deloitte &AMP; Touche says it doesn't hurt to ask. Consider reductions
in utility fees, relaxed permits, carry forward of net operating
losses, accelerated depreciation for certain equipment and
discounts on city fees.

 LEVI'S JOINS WAR AGAINST SWEATSHOPS  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. Tuesday joined the Fair Labor
Association, an alliance of corporations, human-rights groups and
universities that is fighting against abusive labor conditions
overseas.
<P>
   The move adds the San Francisco jeansmaker's prestige and market
clout to an ungainly, deeply divided consumer movement that has
shamed some leading corporations by casting light on the low wages
and often-abusive conditions in their global production networks.
</P>
<P>
   The association plans to monitor its member companies' factories
for three years before they can use the FLA seal on its products _
indicating that they are sweatshop-free and guilt-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are increasingly educated and concerned'' about
international labor rights, said Gare Smith, a vice president at
Levi's, which contracts its clothes manufacturing to about 500
firms in more than 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, nobody thought about child labor, and now
President Clinton goes to the International Labor Organization to
talk about it. ... If you want to address these concerns in a
cost-effective way that has credibility, the FLA is the way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the FLA is a logical management step for Levi's, which
in 1991 was the first large U.S. firm to adopt a code of conduct
for its international operations.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of its this code of conduct, Levi's has avoided
much of the unfavorable publicity received by some of its
competitors, such as the controversy that arose in 1996, when TV
personality Kathie Lee Gifford found out that her line of clothes
were made by child laborers under sweatshop conditions.
</P>
<P>
   FLA was founded in November after a two-year gestation process
sponsored by the White House. Its members now include firms such as
Adidas-Salomon, Nike, Liz Claiborne, Reebok and Phillips Van
Heusen; several human-rights groups; and 107 colleges and
universities, including the seven Ivy League schools, San Francisco
State University, California State University at Sacramento, Santa
Clara University and University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   When it starts its monitoring programs next year, the FLA will
inspect its member companies' foreign factories to see whether they
comply with the following provisions: freedom to form labor unions,
no child or forced labor, inspection of up to 30 percent of a brand
name's factories by independent monitors such as local human-rights
groups and a ban on requiring workers to work more than 60 hours
per week.
</P>
<P>
   The FLA has critics on both sides of the aisles. Many student
anti-sweatshop activists say its standards are not strong enough.
For example, they say the FLA's standards lack any provision for
paying workers more than poverty-level wages and they do not
require companies to publicly disclose the identities and locations
of their contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Levi's will support the adoption of a ``living wage''
provision once the FLA is fully operational.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the University of California _ which has not
joined the FLA _ reacted to growing student pressure by adopting a
code that has a living-wage clause _ but does not have any
enforcement mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, many firms have been leery of joining because
they see the FLA as unwanted interference in boardroom decision
making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firms have to understand that business as usual is no longer
an option,'' said Roberta Karp, a vice president at Liz Claiborne
and a key FLA organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have transparency, you have to have input from
people outside industry, rather than hoping you can keep flying
under the radar screen. ... This issue is not going away.''

   GM PROFIT BEATS FORECAST BUT MARKET SHARE SHRINKS
</P>
<P>
   Pocketing higher profits even as its market share continues to
erode, General Motors said that it earned $1.73 billion in the
second quarter, a vast improvement over the $306 million it earned
from continuing operations during the same period last year, when
there was a costly strike.
</P>
<P>
   The results amounted to $2.66 a share and beat analysts'
expectations of $2.56 a share. Second-quarter revenue rose to
$45.07 billion from $37.27 billion, allowing GM to maintain its
position as the world's largest company, ahead of Ford. In a down
market, shares of GM fell $1.8125, to $66.50.
</P>
<P>
   EURO GAINS, BUT THE YEN DECLINES
</P>
<P>
   Europe's single currency rallied sharply against the dollar
after a key economic report showed business confidence in Germany
growing much more than expected. In contrast, the dollar climbed
higher against the Japanese yen after the Bank of Japan sold yen
for dollars through the Federal Reserve System.
</P>
<P>
   PEPSICO PROFIT SURPASSES FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico said that its second-quarter earnings rose 50 percent,
based in large part on a one-time gain from the spinoff of its
bottling operations. Without the $270 million gain from the
spinoff, Pepsico's earnings rose 7.4 percent, slightly beating the
expectations of Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   GOP LEADERS TRY TO SAVE TAX CUT
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House scrambled to head off a revolt
by party moderates and avert a humiliating defeat on their
signature issue of tax cuts. With a vote on the biggest tax cut
since 1981 scheduled for Wednesday, Republicans said it was unclear
whether enough of the 20 or so moderates would break with the
leadership to defeat or block passage of the bill, the centerpiece
of the party's domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE GROUP SETTLES ON LEADERS
</P>
<P>
   Members of the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules
for global commerce, resolved a prolonged and bitter dispute over
who would be its next leader by agreeing that the two finalists
would share the job in consecutive three-year terms. Mike Moore,
the New Zealand candidate, will go first, followed by his Thai
rival, Supachai Panitchpakdi.
</P>
<P>
   KRAFT BOLSTERS PHILIP MORRIS RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris said that its second-quarter profit, excluding
charges, rose nearly 3 percent as its Kraft food unit lifted sales
and cut costs, softening declines in cigarette profits.
</P>
<P>
   TRASH-HAULING MERGER IS APPROVED
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department approved the merger of Allied Waste and
Browning-Ferris, one of the largest combinations in the
trash-hauling business, on the condition that the companies sell
operations in 18 cities in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
   THREE DRUG MAKERS POST EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson surprised analysts by announcing a 14.9
percent increase in its second-quarter earnings. Two other drug
makers also reported results, with varying success. SmithKline
Beecham posted a 12 percent earnings gain, but American Home
Products said that its earnings decreased 13.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   LUCENT NET INCOME INCREASES 45 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, the maker of telecommunications equipment,
posted a stronger-than-expected 45 percent jump in its
third-quarter net income on strength in its international and
microelectronics operations.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT RISES AT SBC AND AMERITECH
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications and Ameritech, which plan to merge into the
United States' largest local telephone company, reported
second-quarter earnings that topped forecasts.

THE WB PUTS A FACE TO ITS PLEDGE FOR MORE DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The ``WB'' in The WB doesn't stand for white
bread. But if you looked only at the network's hourlong dramas, it
very well could. Painfully aware of recent complaints about lack of
racial and cultural diversity in prime-time programming, the
producers of two new WB series _ ``Roswell'' and ``Jack &AMP; Jill'' _
said they are keenly aware of the need to reflect a multicultural
society.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there isn't a producer in Hollywood who hasn't said
the same thing. What sticks in the craw of many critics is that
these pledges to add diversity _ after the pilot episodes have been
shot with lily-white casts _ usually end up as unseemly exercises
in tokenism.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for that reason, The WB took the unusual step of
trotting out Yvette Lee Bowser, creator of ``Living Single'' and
the current WB comedy, ``For Your Love,'' to announce plans for a
new drama series about a young African American woman whose parents
have gotten remarried to form multi-ethnic couples.
</P>
<P>
   The series, tentatively titled ``The Miseducation of Piper
Fein,'' is at least a year off, but Bowser's appearance here before
TV critics Tuesday showcased at least one network's desire to show
that it's hearing the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Bowser, who is biracial, said she thinks The WB is
``enthusiastic'' about showcasing actors of color in the dramatic
form. ``A change is going to come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Here's a concept. The WB has ordered 22 episodes _ a full
season pickup _ of ``Roswell,'' which centers on normal and
paranormal teens living in Roswell, N.M. Like ``Felicity'' and
``Dawson's Creek'' before it, ``Roswell'' has tons of favorable
buzz preceding it, and network chief executive officer Jamie
Kellner says the 22-episode order is testament to The WB's belief
in the series.
</P>
<P>
   (Actually, the show's studio, Twentieth Century Fox Television,
pretty much forced the issue, demanding a firm commitment from The
WB after the Fox network, for which the show was originally
intended, failed to find a spot for ``Roswell'' on its fall
schedule.)
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's a nice situation for creator Jason Katims, who
never got much support from ABC for ``My So-called Life'' and
``Relativity.'' Neither lasted a full season, despite critical
acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's really wonderful about the order, from a
writing perspective, is that it's much easier to plan,'' Katims
said. Knowing that he's got more than a six- or nine- or 13-episode
pickup makes for a strength of continuity that's impossible to
achieve otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if The WB's motives aren't entirely altruistic, give
'em credit for taking a chance. Series star Sarah Michelle Gellar
says she figures ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' would have been
canceled after three episodes if it aired on any other network.
This fall, it enters its fourth season on The WB.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gellar says she wept when ``Buffy'' creator Joss Whedon
announced plans to do a spinoff series featuring David Boreanaz's
character, Angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joss is our show,'' Gellar said Tuesday. ``I didn't know if we
knew how to make this show without him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Whedon has assured the world and the ``Buffy'' cast that he
will remain as hands-on as ever next season, despite the enormous
demands of getting a new series up and running.
</P>
<P>
   _ Odds 'n' ends: Nick Turturro, who plays detective James
Martinez on ``NYPD Blue,'' will leave the series after the
1999-2000 season to create a comedy series for The WB.

THE KENNEDY FAMILY'S STATEMENT ABOUT THEIR LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KENNEDY-RDP, KENNEDY-BESSETTE-TEXT) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is the statement from the Kennedy family on the
letterhead of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., dated July 19:
</P>
<P>
   We are filled with unspeakable grief and sadness by the loss of
John and Carolyn and Lauren Bessette. John was a shining light in
all our lives and in the lives of the nation and the world that
first came to know him when he was a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   He was a devoted husband to Carolyn, a loving brother to
Caroline and an amazing uncle to her children, a close and dear
friend to his cousins and a beloved nephew to my sisters and me.
</P>
<P>
   He was the adored son of two proud parents whom he now joins
with God.
</P>
<P>
   We loved him deeply and his loss leaves an enormous void in all
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   John had many gifts and gave us great joy, most especially when
he brought his wonderful bride, Carolyn, into our lives. They had
their own special brand of magic that touched everyone who knew and
loved them. We are thankful for her life and for their lives
together.
</P>
<P>
   We loved Carolyn and share in the grief of the Bessette and
Freeman families at the tragic loss of both Carolyn and Lauren.
Carolyn and Lauren were exceptional and accomplished young women
who reflected the extraordinary qualities of their family.
</P>
<P>
   The Bessette and Freeman families will always be in our thoughts
and prayers.
</P>
<P>
   At this most difficult time, we rely on our faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   We are more grateful than we can ever say for the support of our
family and friends and so many of our fellow Americans who opened
their hearts to John.
</P>
<P>
   We also thank in a very special way the men and women who have
worked well and long and hard in these past days to find John,
Carolyn and Lauren. We will never forget the dedication, the
professionalism and the sensitivity they have shown.
</P>
<P>
   We pray that John, Carolyn and Lauren will find eternal rest and
that God's perpetual light will shine on them.

SHE'S UR-MOTHER, WARRIOR, LOVER: ISN'T SHE DIVINE?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Major exhibitions of the art of India are rare in
this part of the world. They always have been. Why? Nobody knows.
This art has everything: epic drama and swoony sob stories, gods,
gremlins and glamour queens, the human at its most human, the
spiritual at its most ineffable.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, it is pure seduction. Intellectually and emotionally,
it looks you in the eye and says, over and over again in a thousand
different ways: wake up, change your life, look again, things are
not what they seem. Which are the fundamental messages of great
art, sacred or secular, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   All these elements play a role in ``Devi: The Great Goddess,'' a
gathering of 120 sculptures and paintings at the Arthur M. Sackler
Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution through Sept. 6. Organized
by Vidya Dehejia, associate director and chief curator at the
Sackler and the Freer Gallery, it is just about as visually
entrancing as a museum show can be, and full of ideas that have
every bit as much meaning in the present as they did in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Devi is the generic name for the divine female principle in her
guises of mother, lover, warrior, creator and destroyer. She was
pre-eminent in India before Aryan invaders arrived with their
patriarchal religion around 1500 B.C. After that, she was often
assigned the supporting role of girlfriend or spouse to male gods
like Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu. But her power, though submerged,
never waned.
</P>
<P>
   Emblems of that power are what this exhibition is all about.
Ancient or modern, spectacular or discreet, they derive both from
religions native to India and from cultures beyond the subcontinent
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The opening work is, in fact, an abstract sculpture by the
contemporary British artist Anish Kapoor. Titled ``At the Hub of
Things,'' it is a large, hollow half sphere of cast fiberglass
coated with velvety midnight-blue pigment. In India, the color is
associated with the goddess Kali, her skin as dark as a starless
night. And standing in front of Kapoor's light-absorbing sculpture,
one has a sense of staring into bottomless depths.
</P>
<P>
   Next come two classic stone temple figures. One, carved of milky
alabaster, is a 12th-century Jain image of the goddess Sarasvati,
patron of learning and music. Posed like a dancer at rest,
imperturbable but vibrant, she holds a lotus stem up in one hand as
if she were about to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Beside her is a South Indian Durga, another incarnation of the
goddess. A taut column of energy, she stands on the flattened head
of the buffalo-demon named Mahisha, a monster so ferocious that the
gods fled from him in panic, handing Durga their weapons in the
hope she would finish him off.
</P>
<P>
   She did, and her victory _ a triumph over fear and self-doubt
and disbelief _ is often portrayed in South Asian art. In a
wonderful 19th-century Rajput miniature, Mahisha puts up a decent
fight. But even with his gold-tipped corkscrew horns, he's no match
for a pint-size, 16-armed goddess.
</P>
<P>
   Chic in her gold sari, combat hardware in every hand, she
delivers the coup de grace as the gods, safely perched on distant
clouds, cheer her on.
</P>
<P>
   Devi isn't always a beauty. She can take on outlandish forms;
the blood-drinking Chamunda with her necklace of human heads is
one. Such images belong to the world of Tantra and are meant to
shock the psychic system into perception of the divine. The more
repellent a deity, the greater her potential to effect change may
be.
</P>
<P>
   This dynamic is illustrated in one of the show's most
sensational entries, a set of miniatures from the book known as the
``Tantric Devi.'' Of an original series of 70 or so paintings, made
in Western India around 1660, 32 survive, and 16 have been brought
together here. In each the goddess reigns supreme.
</P>
<P>
   In her presence, the gods tiptoe around like nervous courtiers.
She uses a nude male corpse, fresh from the cemetery, as her
throne. In one amazing picture she stands at the center of an
auralike sun, her skin a luminous coal black, the jewels in her
crown fashioned from iridescent beetle wings glued to the paper
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Other goddess images that follow are more benign. Her maternal
identity is made much of in a sixth-century Madonna-like Rajasthan
stone sculpture, and in the wooden figure of a so-called bhuta from
Karnataka. As tall and stern as a school mistress, she is a
commanding example of religious art from rural India in which the
exhibition is usually rich.
</P>
<P>
   Devi is repeatedly identified with forces of nature. A svelte
young maharani in a silvery Rajput miniature (it looks as if it
were seen through a summer haze) is actually a personification of
the river Ganges, kneeling on a giant fish.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes she embodies a theological concept. Such is the
case with a wooden Nepalese Buddhist icon of divine wisdom, her
skin painted a hot vermilion, as if flushed with intellectual
passion and spiritual ardor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Passion can be overwhelming, even devastating, when divine and
human intersect, as they do in the female Hindu saints of South
India, who once wandered from temple to temple singing erotically
charged hymns. They sacrificed everything to devotion, but their
reward was bliss. In a bronze image, the body of the saint known as
Karaikkal Ammaiyar is bone thin, but the smile on her face is
beatific.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the heroine-lovers of the epics. Radha and
Krishna (an incarnation of the god Vishnu) are the paradigm for all
besotted couples, meeting by moonlight, mumbling poetry, making
love. Their match _ often interpreted as the marriage of the soul
to god _ is made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   And there are few more charming images of them than a little
painting from the Punjab hills in which the sweethearts, infatuated
beyond embarrassment, wear daffy, look-alike costumes of white and
pink lotus blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Sita in the ``Ramayana'' is different, though, and
disturbing. Unjustly rejected by her husband, Rama (Vishnu again),
she responds with nonaccusatory grief. Patient, faithful, she has
traditionally been held up as an ideal to Hindu women, not only in
literature and art, but also in contemporary religious tracts,
children's books, popular comics and films.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Columbia University organized a conference to examine
the meaning of Sita in modern life, both as an oppressive
stereotype and as a positive role model. And in India itself,
artists are similarly re-examining the Great Goddess in her many
forms.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 painting titled ``Durga,'' by the Bengali-born artist
Arpita Singh, for example, presents the demon-slayer as a new kind
of avenger, wielding a pistol and trampling a man underfoot. (The
painting was widely criticized in India, where the male figure was
taken to represent Rajiv Gandhi, who had recently been
assassinated.)
</P>
<P>
   It says much for the many-faceted character of Devi that,
although Ms. Singh's painting isn't included here, it would have
fit right into the expansive context Ms. Dehejia has created. The
scope of the exhibition is further extended by a superb catalog
(fine contributions by the art historians Debra Diamond and Mary
Slusser, among others) and by two other Sackler shows.
</P>
<P>
   One, just closed, was a bouquet of miniatures, among them scenes
from the Radha-Krishna story, attributed to the legendary
18th-century artist Nainsukh and lent by the Rietberg Museum in
Zurich. The other is the Sackler's own superb long-term
installation ``Puja: Expressions of Hindu Devotion,'' an
atmospheric, multimedia look at ritual worship in India.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Devi'' itself has the last word, and sends us back out
into the world with a sight of the Great Goddess in one of her most
captivating forms. Alone in the show's last gallery is a splendid
bronze South Indian sculpture of the goddess Parvati from the 11th
century, a period often called the golden age of Indian metal
casting.
</P>
<P>
   Parvati is the wife of the god Shiva, and in a temple setting
she would be accompanied by his larger figure. Here, however, she
is self-sufficient, a lithe, youthful queen with a glow-in-the-dark
radiance. Anyone encountering her, or her many counterparts at the
Sackler, will surely come away enthralled and wondering why the
glorious alternative universe of Indian art is so seldom invited to
touch down in our midst.

PRODUCER GETS OK FOR SERIES PILOT FOCUSING ON BLACK WOMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _Yvette Lee Bowser, who created Living Single for Fox
and currently produces For Your Love for The WB, has gotten the
green light to shoot the pilot of what would be an hourlong series
focusing on an African-American woman.
</P>
<P>
   The Miseducation of Piper Fein will center on a black woman
whose parents have gotten remarried. The show _ part comedy, part
drama in the form of Sports Night and Ally McBeal _ plans to
explore the realities of a modern-day multi-racial extended family,
to which Bowser herself belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Bowser says she's been working on the idea for about three
years, but the timing is intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   The networks, particularly The WB, which is becoming known for
developing dramas with all-white or predominately white casts, are
under extreme pressure to diversify casting and mirror the society
in which they serve. Of the more than 30 new comedies and dramas
premiering on The WB, CBS, ABC, Fox and NBC _ not one features a
minority in a leading role. UPN has two sitcoms featuring
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   During an often raucous press session yesterday where most of
the questions centered on race and whether the networks were being
exclusionary, Susanne Daniels, president of entertainment for The
WB, denied that the programming deal was struck in order to appease
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Bowser, who began her career as a writer on A Different World,
concurred, saying she was too busy with other series to do the
dramady. `I wanted to make sure I was ready to do it,` she said.
`This is a good time.`
</P>
<P>
   For her and The WB.

HOTEL CORPORATION TO OPEN RESERVATION CENTER IN LANCASTER, CALIF.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JIM SKEEN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANCASTER, Calif. _ Starwood Hotels and Resorts will establish a
reservation center in Lancaster, 55 miles north of downtown Los
Angeles, selecting the city over 160 others for the 250-job
operation, officials announced.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood, which includes the Sheraton and Westin Hotel chains,
plans to establish a regional reservation center at the former
La-Z-Boy furniture showroom. The center is expected to employ 150
people when it opens in late September, then add 100 workers over
the first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great operation for the city of Lancaster,'' said
Mayor Frank Roberts on Tuesday. ``We've enhanced this shopping
center by bringing in a Fortune 500 company.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the reservation center, Lancaster offered a $200,000 loan
that will be considered paid off, provided the company hires 250
employees and maintains their jobs. The chief incentive, however,
was the enterprise zone designated in Southern California's
Antelope Valley, which can provide the company $2 million to $4
million in state tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses in the enterprise zone are eligible for state tax
breaks, including credits on equipment purchases, interest
deductions for income earned on investments and wage credits for
workers hired through certain programs or from certain low-income
areas. The wage credits can be as much as $26,000 per worker over a
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be here here without it (enterprise zone),'' said
Michael English, director of regional reservation centers for
Starwood.
</P>
<P>
   The company was also drawn to the region by the building and the
availability of a skilled work force, English said.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood plans to spend about $2 million to convert the
17,000-square-foot building from a showroom to a phone operation
center. That work will include providing an uninterrupted power
supply, installing phone lines and remodeling the interior of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood expects to begin recruiting in the Antelope Valley in
early September. Antelope Valley College and Starwood plan to
develop a training program for the company's employees.
</P>
<P>
   The training program will include computer and customer service
skills. The program will use existing facilities at Antelope Valley
College.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood has more than 700 hotels in 72 countries. The company
employs more than 130,000 people worldwide.

APOLLO 11 CREW RECEIVES AVIATION'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the 30th anniversary of their historic mission
to the moon, the crew members of Apollo 11 reunited Tuesday at the
National Air and Space Museum to receive aviation's most
prestigious award.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a stage with the Columbia command module that
brought them back to Earth, space pioneers Neil Armstrong, Buzz
Aldrin and Michael Collins were presented with the Smithsonian
Institution's Samuel P. Langley Medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mission taught us a great deal about the moon, but it
taught us even more about ourselves, what we could accomplish as a
nation if we set our hearts and minds to it,'' Vice President Al
Gore told the astronauts as he presented the medal.
</P>
<P>
   The three spacemen later delivered a moon rock to the White
House and, in a televised discussion of their mission, credited
Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union for America's victory in
the race for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we would have gone to the moon in the time that
we did without competition'' from the Soviets, said Aldrin, the
second man to walk on the moon. ``Competition got us there in a
hurry, but left us without a clear vision'' for future space
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Although some would have preferred a cooperative effort, ``in
many cases, competition is more effective,'' said Armstrong, the
Apollo 11 commander and the first man to set foot on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports that then-President Nixon's speechwriter had
prepared remarks for use if Armstrong and Aldrin had become
stranded on the moon, the astronauts said they were unaware at the
time but expected such steps had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin said he figured the lunar-landing portion of their
mission had little better than a 50-50 chance of succeeding, so
``it is not surprising'' that officials made contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who remained in moon orbit in the Columbia capsule,
recalled that he was safer than Armstrong and Aldrin aboard the
landing module Eagle and might have been the only one to survive
the mission. ``I didn't want to come home by myself, but if I had
to, I would have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's rare joint appearance by the three astronauts
coincided with the scheduled launch of the first space-shuttle
mission commanded by a woman, Air Force Col. Eileen Collins. The
launch was delayed after sensors erroneously reported an abnormal
amount of hydrogen in an engine compartment. Liftoff was reset for
12:28 a.m. EDT Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of the July 20 moonwalk by Armstrong and Aldrin
also was marked by the recovery of the Liberty Bell 7, the Mercury
capsule that carried astronaut Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom into space
and almost dragged him to the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. The
capsule sank near the Bahamas moments after splashdown at the end
of Grissom's suborbital flight July 21, 1961.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's ceremony at the Air and Space Museum, Gore
recalled the challenge of President Kennedy in 1961 to put a man on
the moon and return him safely to Earth by the end of the decade.
It was Kennedy, the vice president said, ``who taught us to reach
for the moon and the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore lauded the slain president's vision for America's space
program, then took note of the loss of Kennedy's son in an airplane
crash Friday night. ``John Kennedy Jr. wore that mantle of
possibility and discovery, the belief that we can reach a new
horizon if we have the urge to try,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore praised Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins, calling them heroes
during a period of civil unrest amid Vietnam War protests and the
assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther
King. ``With your first step into the Sea of Tranquillity, you
brought tranquillity to the millions waiting here at home,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong spoke for Aldrin and Collins as they stood against a
backdrop of their space capsule. Hanging overhead was Charles
Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis and the airplane flown at Kitty
Hawk by the Wright brothers. Armstrong said the Apollo 11 crew was
accepting the award ``on behalf of all the men and women of the
Apollo program ... (and) the contributions of so many in this past
century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The important achievement of Apollo was a demonstration that
humanity is not forever chained to this planet, and our visions go
farther than that,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   The solid-gold Langley medal, named for a U.S. aviation pioneer
and the Smithsonian's third secretary, has been awarded to only 19
others, including Wilbur and Orville Wright; Lindbergh, the first
trans-Atlantic aviator; Robert Goddard, the rocket scientist; and
Alan Shepard, the first American in space.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins presented
President Clinton with a half-pound rock from the moon. Armstrong
said NASA was only loaning the rock to the White House and might
someday ask for its return. He then assured Clinton that the rock
``will be here a while.'' The rock was collected by Armstrong on
July 20, 1969, about four paces from the spot where the Eagle
landed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while answering students' questions during a television
appearance at the Newseum in suburban Washington, the astronauts
recalled being ``concerned'' and ``worried'' _ but not scared _
during the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that much equipment, always there are some things that go
wrong, but it really wasn't the equipment we were worried about,''
Armstrong said. ``We were concerned that we might somehow make a
mistake that would not allow the flight to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scared, no; worried, yes,'' Collins said during the program
broadcast live on CNBC and NASA's internal television network.
``Spaceflight is just kind of an awareness in the back of your mind
that a lot of things can go on.''

A MOSTLY MOZARTEAN SO FAR: MOSTLY A SUCCESS?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (af)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Gerard Schwarz was named music adviser of the
Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center in 1982, his conducting
career had the brilliance and momentum of a rocket streaking across
the heavens. Then 34, he had resigned as a trumpeter of the New
York Philharmonic seven years before to devote himself to
conducting, which he had done as a sideline since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He was the music director of two orchestras _ the Y Chamber
Symphony (now the New York Chamber Symphony), which was created for
him at the 92d Street Y in 1976, and the Los Angeles Chamber
Orchestra, which he inherited from Sir Neville Marriner in 1978 _
as well as the founding director of the Waterloo Festival in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He had established his credentials as an advocate of new music,
both at the Y and at Merkin Concert Hall, where he started the
series Music Today. He was making inroads on the guest-conducting
circuit. And the Mostly Mozart position, which soon morphed into a
full-fledged directorship, raised his visibility around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk, as there always is when a young American
conductor begins piling up accomplishments, of a future at the helm
of a major American orchestra. ``With talent on this order,''
Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times in 1980, after a
New York visit by the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, ``there is no
place for him but up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after that prediction, it is fair to ask whether
Schwarz, now 51, has indeed made his way up in the music world. But
how one answers that question is bound up with one's view of what
constitutes success for a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz continues to direct Mostly Mozart, which opens its 33d
season on Tuesday evening. But the festival has been scaled back in
recent years to make way for the Lincoln Center Festival, and
Schwarz has become less of a presence. Of the 19 programs this
summer, 11 are to be performed by guest ensembles, leaving only 8
for the festival orchestra, with Schwarz conducting 3.
</P>
<P>
   He also remains music director of the New York Chamber Symphony,
conducting four of its six programs a season at Alice Tully Hall.
His other two directorships in 1982 have fallen by the wayside, but
in 1983 he became music adviser to the Seattle Symphony, and two
years later he was appointed its music director. His involvement
with Seattle has since eclipsed his other activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career as a conductor is based in Seattle,'' Schwarz
recently said by telephone from his home there. ``I believe that if
you're going to do something significant in the music world, you
have to plant your roots and fight for what's important
artistically. If you think about it, I am the major representative
of classical music in Seattle. And that's a tremendous
responsibility, not only to the public and the orchestra but also
to the art form. Seattle is not New York. If we don't do a
Tchaikovsky symphony, there is a strong possibility that no
Tchaikovsky symphony will be played in Seattle that season. We are
the orchestra of this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly Mozart, by contrast, has been as much a battleground as a
home for Schwarz in the 1990s. Still, it would be wrong to take his
accomplishments there for granted. When he took over the festival,
it had become tired and formulaic. He quickly reinvigorated it,
reconfiguring its repertory to include 19th- and early 20th-century
examples of Neo-Classicism while maintaining Mozart's centrality.
</P>
<P>
   He also broke an unfortunate pattern in the orchestra's
performances. In the festival's early years, the group produced
polished, energetic performances during the first week, and then
increasingly frayed ones as inadequate rehearsal time and a heavy
performing schedule took their toll.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz upgraded the freelance band, bringing in players who
worked with him at the 92d Street Y. An improvement in performance
was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to sour in 1992, at the end of Lincoln Center's
misbegotten Mozart Bicentennial, a two-year traversal of Mozart's
complete works. In the original plan, Lincoln Center's constituent
organizations and visiting performers were to have divided the gems
and the juvenilia equitably.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Mostly Mozart was saddled with a
disproportionate number of early and minor works that no one else
wanted to perform. Neither Schwarz nor the players could muster
enthusiasm for these pieces, and the festival was scrappily played,
badly attended and generally stultifying: ``a horrible
experience,'' Schwarz now calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse. William Lockwood, an architect of Mostly
Mozart, left Lincoln Center, and Nathan Leventhal, the center's
president, talked about replacing Mostly Mozart with a broader
summer program, which has become the Lincoln Center Festival.
Schwarz, seeing an opportunity to expand his activities at Lincoln
Center, lobbied behind the scenes, arguing that as a musician with
programming experience, he should have more say in Lincoln Center
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   His timing was not ideal. In November 1992, Lincoln Center
appointed Jane S. Moss vice president for programming, specifically
to revitalize the center's offerings. Ms. Moss, not yet inculcated
with Lincoln Center's sense of corporate diplomacy, made no secret
of her desire to see Schwarz ousted, and Mostly Mozart with him.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz was not defenseless. In his years on the podium, he has
developed an ability to make powerful friends and a sense of when
to enlist their clout. As members of the Mostly Mozart Festival
Orchestra took to the streets, encouraging patrons to write letters
and sign petitions, Schwarz called Jerome L. Greene, a
philanthropist whose foundation provided hefty support to Lincoln
Center.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry was a great man, a great supporter of the arts and a
dear friend,'' Schwarz said of Greene, who died last month. ``Yes,
I did, at the time, speak to him, eliciting his aid. What did he
do? I don't know. I just called him on the phone, and he said he'd
help.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Mostly Mozart was reduced rather than jettisoned,
and it has continued to evolve, largely through Ms. Moss'
initiatives. She has expanded its role as a presenter of other
ensembles, this year including the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra, the
Salzburg Camerata Academica, the New London Consort and Gidon
Kremer's Kremerata Baltica.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ms. Moss and Schwarz profess great admiration for
each other, and Ms. Moss denies that the spotlight on visiting
ensembles is meant to diminish Schwarz's role in the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all developments that Gerry has embraced,'' Ms. Moss
said. ``I think the reality of Mostly Mozart is that since it has a
theme and identity, one is always looking for ways to expand what
it is and what it does. But I think Gerry is doing a wonderful job
with Mostly Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz returned the compliment: ``Look, Jane and I were on
opposite sides, slightly, but we have gotten along wonderfully
since then. She came to Lincoln Center with lots of good,
innovative ideas, some of them unrealistic, as we all do. But she
has become a realist. I think she understands that we are guided by
the public. I'm a great believer in the public. I want to lead
them, but if I lead and they don't like what they hear, they're not
going to come back. If they trust me, whether in New York or
Seattle, they'll keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schwarz's work in Seattle shows that he understands that
balance. His success is quantifiable. The Seattle Symphony played
30 percent more concerts last season than a year before, with
ticket sales at an impressive 92 percent. Schwarz has also expanded
its activities to include Baroque and Mozart series beyond the
regular season. During his tenure, the orchestra retired its
longstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
   There have been minor dust-ups. In one, Schwarz sought to hire a
principal horn player over the objections of the orchestra
committee. In another, his chosen choral director raised hackles by
radically reconfiguring the orchestra's choir, dismissing several
longtime members in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But such disputes have been overshadowed by Schwarz's
accomplishments: not least, the construction of Benaroya Hall,
which opened to glowing reviews last September. Built at a cost of
$118 million, it has a main auditorium that seats 2,500 and a
recital hall that seats 450. Schwarz was involved in every aspect
of the project, from the acoustics to the color of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't an inch of that hall that I didn't have the
ability to be involved with,'' Schwarz said, correctly noting that
it is unusual for a conductor to take such an active hand. What's
more, the project benefited from the same talent for making
influential friends that helped save Schwarz's job at Mostly
Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't raised any money,'' he said. ``I'm an artistic
person, not a fund-raiser. But as a part of this community, I know
a lot of people. I didn't ask Jack Benaroya for his initial gift to
build the new hall. He asked me to lunch and said he was thinking
of giving us 10 or 15 million dollars. And I quickly said, `15.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz spends most of his time in Seattle now, and has become
entrenched in its civic life. His children attend school there, and
when a school tax was proposed, he joined members of the Seahawks
and other Seattle celebrities in a phone bank, calling voters to
enlist support for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, he contributes editorials to The Seattle Times. He
conducts the Seattle Opera on occasion and is said to be as
recognizable in the city as Leonard Bernstein was in New York in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Seattle, Schwarz's career has blossomed more slowly than
his supporters of the 1970s and 80s expected. The commonest measure
of a podium career is the extent to which a conductor has been
embraced by major orchestras in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For an American, success with the so-called Big Five _ the New
York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the Philadelphia Orchestra,
the Cleveland Orchestra and the Chicago Symphony _ is generally
considered crucial. The podiums of those orchestras are coveted in
a way that others are not, and right now, music directorships in
New York, Boston and Philadelphia are up for grabs (Cleveland's
having just been filled, by Franz Welser-Most).
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Schwarz is rarely mentioned as a likely candidate
for such a directorship is striking. But it is not surprising,
since the major orchestras have been slow to hire him as a guest
conductor. He has conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra three times:
twice as a substitute for an ailing conductor, and in a scheduled
appearance last season. He was invited to conduct the Boston
Symphony, he said, but had a scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He points out, too, that he conducts annually in Paris. He has
led the London Symphony, the English Chamber Orchestra and the
Czech Philharmonic, and has conducted opera at the Kirov in St.
Petersburg, as well as in Washington and Seattle. He has
engagements in Dresden and recently completed a three-year term as
artistic adviser to the Tokyo Bunkamura Orchard Hall, which
involved conducting the Tokyo Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from his resume are conducting appearances
at the New York Philharmonic, where he was co-principal trumpeter
from 1972 to 1975. Deborah Borda, the orchestra's executive
director, refused to comment on whether Schwarz might conduct the
orchestra, but several of his supporters, who would not speak for
attribution, say that the Philharmonic musicians oppose extending
an invitation. Schwarz's own theory follows similar lines.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of the problem is that in New York, I'm very
familiar,'' he said. ``There are players in all the major
orchestras who went to high school with me at Music and Arts, or
who were in my class at Juilliard, or who were students of mine at
Waterloo. I am an open book. But I went to Berlin to conduct a
radio orchestra recently, and I had a big success there. They don't
know me. They don't even know that I was ever an instrumentalist.
There is comfort in ignorance. It allows the relationship to evolve
over a period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Symphony remains on the periphery of the major
American orchestras. But the city has had a higher national profile
in the age of ``Frasier,'' Nirvana, Starbucks and Amazon.com, and
Schwarz is riding that wave. He records plentifully with the
orchestra, and because many of his Seattle recordings offer
repertory otherwise unavailable _ including works by
mid-20th-century American symphonists like Howard Hanson, David
Diamond and Deems Taylor _ they inherently attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Benaroya Hall has improved the orchestra's sound,
Schwarz said, and he hopes listeners around the country will gain
some sense of his accomplishment with the orchestra next month,
when it gives its first nationally telecast concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at someone like me, and when Cleveland, say, is
looking for a music director, I'm not there,'' he said. ``I've
never conducted there. They've never seen me. And in New York,
which is the most important city in the world for most people, most
concertgoers have never seen me conduct a Brahms, Mahler or
Bruckner symphony. I do those things in Seattle. In New York, I
conduct chamber orchestras, and the fact is, important conductors
have always emerged from large orchestras, not from chamber
orchestras.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the resistance to Schwarz is undoubtedly artistic. Like
most musicians, he has detractors, some of whom find his
performances concerned with fussy detail rather than the larger
musical line; others find his readings of standard repertory
wooden. But those opinions are far from unanimous. In both New York
and Seattle, his reviews have largely been favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Even Schwarz's detractors concede that his programming has
always been adventurous, and his interpretations of 20th-century
American music have always been persuasive. He revived neglected
works by Hanson, Diamond and other American Romantics almost
single-handedly, and he continues to explore obscure corners of
that repertory.
</P>
<P>
   He has kept up with younger composers as well, particularly
those writing music that is accessible but not simplistic. Richard
Danielpour, Deborah Drattell, Michael Nathaniel Hersch and Vivian
Fung all had early performances in Schwarz's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Few conductors have devoted themselves to 20th-century American
music with his methodical devotion, and those who have _ among
them, Michael Tilson Thomas, Leonard Slatkin, David Zinman and
Dennis Russell Davies _ also seem to have hit a glass ceiling that
keeps them from Big Five directorships.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that for whatever reasons _ orchestral players'
artistic or personal qualms, administrators' distrust of Schwarz's
backstage maneuvering, or his own increasing focus on Seattle _ he
is not about to crack into the top rank of international superstar
conductors. But whether his career has so far been a success is
another question.
</P>
<P>
   If classical music is to thrive, it must do so beyond the cities
of the Big Five orchestras and their European counterparts. Schwarz
has lighted a fire under symphonic music in Seattle and, along the
way, campaigned hard for an expanded repertory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Gerry hasn't had the big opportunities in New York,''
said Omus Hirshbein, who founded the New York Chamber Symphony and
is now its executive vice president. ``But he has done in Seattle
what the great conductors have done with their cities. In artistic
terms, in terms of the public, in terms of the hall, he has taken
that orchestra from one level to another. That's the success a
music director should have in a community. Maybe the community
should have been Boston. But it was Seattle. And so what?''

1994, more than 1,500 Cubans have made it ashore in South Florida
so far this year. But increasingly, say U.S. Coast Guard officials,
the Cubans are making their passage not on rafts or in fishing

EDITORIAL: CRACKS IN THE GLASS CEILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 21: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carleton S. Fiorina, the new chief executive officer of the
Hewlett-Packard Co., says there is no need to focus on her gender
in discussing her appointment. ``I truly hope,'' she told reporters
after her appointment was announced, ``that we are at the point now
where everyone has figured out that the accomplishments of women
across industry demonstrate that there is not a glass ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if that were true, and it was impressive that
questions about her gender came at the end of a lengthy news
conference at which far more attention was paid to her plans for
Hewlett-Packard and to the challenges it faces. Nonetheless, we
have not gotten to the point where it is common to see women at the
helm of major corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiorina's appointment reduces to 497 the number of companies
in the Fortune 500 whose chief executives are men. (The other
exceptions are Jill Barad of Mattel and Marion Sandler of Golden
West Financial.) When Fortune magazine ranked the most powerful
women in American business last fall, Ms. Fiorina, then a senior
executive at Lucent Technologies, ranked first. Catalyst, a
nonprofit research organization that focuses on women executives,
reports that in 1998 11 percent of senior executives at Fortune 500
companies were women.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, there is an age factor at work in the small
number of female chief executives. Ms. Fiorina, 44, earned her MBA
degree in 1980, by which time many companies were willing to hire
women as junior executives. Most chief executives are in their 50s
or 60s, and entered the business ranks at a time when there were
fewer opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
   There are also industry issues, as Ms. Fiorina noted in an
interview Tuesday. ``You get a very competitive industry, with a
very intensive pace of change,'' she said. ``The companies that are
going to survive or excel have to focus on getting the best talent,
regardless of gender, regardless of race or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still institutional resistance to women at some
companies. Until recently, few companies have had women in senior
posts who could serve as role models and mentors for younger women.
In that regard, Hewlett-Packard has been a pioneer. Its executive
committee will now have four women and three men on it. One of the
women is Ann Livermore, the 40-year-old head of Hewlett-Packard's
enterprise computer systems business, who was widely viewed as the
top inside candidate for chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The greater challenge for Ms. Fiorina may stem from her status
as an outsider at a company that has historically promoted from
within. (She last worked for Hewlett-Packard as a secretary during
the summer before her sophomore year at Stanford University.) Her
hope that the glass ceiling no longer exists may be premature, but
her appointment is a signal that it is at least cracking.

07-20 -- Ray Dieppa, 37, originally of San Jose de las Lajas, Cuba,
came to the United States in May, 1980 during the exodus of Cubans
which became known as the Mariel Boatlift. In the heaviest exodus
since Fidel Castro allowed 33,000 people to exit the island in
1994, more than 1,500 Cubans have made it ashore in South Florida
so far this year. But increasingly, say U.S. Coast Guard officials,
the Cubans are making their passage not on rafts or in fishing
vessels but in the boats of smugglers who bring them in close
enough to swim ashore or launch a small dinghy. (Andrew Itkoff/New

EDITORIAL: A VOTE FOR DEMOCRACY ABROAD

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 21: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In most repressive countries today, civic activists such as
election monitors, labor organizers, independent journalists and
human rights groups look to Washington for support. But the Senate
may vote any day to end one of their most important lifelines. Judd
Gregg, R-N.H., has persuaded the appropriations committee to
recommend that the National Endowment for Democracy's funding drop
from $31 million to zero. The Senate should defy him and vote to
preserve an organization whose mission is more vital than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The endowment finances four international affairs institutes,
run by the Republican and Democratic parties, the Chamber of
Commerce and the AFL-CIO The endowment also gives money directly to
organizations abroad that promote the rule of law and democracy.
One of its strengths is that its budget is independent of the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of a dictatorship whose opponents have not
benefited from the endowment. Among hundreds of other projects, it
has provided money and advice for village elections and exposure of
prison labor camps in China, human rights groups in Sudan,
independent broadcasting in Serbia, families of political prisoners
in Cuba and the underground labor movement in Myanmar. Augusto
Pinochet might still be ruling Chile if the National Democratic
Institute had not helped the opposition set up a parallel vote
count during the 1988 plebiscite on his rule, which caught
Pinochet's attempt to rig the outcome. The endowment has earned the
right to remain healthy and independent.

EDITORIAL: THE ALBANY BUDGET MINUET

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 21: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally the New York State Legislature has resumed work on its
budget, now 112 days late, with a $73-billion spending plan that
was mapped out the old-fashioned way, behind closed doors. Last
year's open negotiations were deemed a failure by the lawmakers
after Gov. George Pataki, Zorro-like, slashed through much of the
legislature's early effort. Now, declaring that their process is
more like Washington's, the governor, assembly speaker and Senate
majority leader have adopted a structure that cedes only small
changes to 10 conference committees open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The big three _ Pataki, Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno,
the Senate majority leader _ have produced what was once called a
gentlemen's agreement that the governor will not shred this year's
budget if the legislators stay within its $73 billion limit. The
legislative leaders convened the 10 conference committees this week
to figure out how to spend $1.1 billion on schools, health and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The budget deal already approved by Albany's legislative triad
restores some crucial spending for Medicaid and tuition assistance
for low-income college students. Money can be allotted for
pre-kindergarten classes and reducing early-grade class size,
increases that come at the expense of basic operating aid for
schools. New York City's school system, the nation's largest, still
needs extra attention as it imposes new standards and ends social
promotion, sending over 300,000 children into un-air-conditioned
summer schools next year.
</P>
<P>
   Albany also needs to find enough money for an anti-tobacco
campaign, given the $1-billion-a-year windfall coming soon from the
national settlement with tobacco companies. At this point the state
spends $6.5 million annually, compared with Florida's $70 million
or California's $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   As for fiscal responsibility, the governor deserves credit for
planning to use nearly $2 billion in surplus funds to help pay for
future deficits. However, the present plan also calls for several
shaky one-shot revenue proposals that include selling the state's
malpractice insurance fund, delaying an end to New York's sales tax
on clothing and raiding a program for retraining health care
workers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The big-ticket items for the future, unfortunately, are still a
matter of ``internal debate.'' They include how much to borrow for
capital projects and how much to cut taxes. So much for an open
budget process in Albany.

METROPOLITAN EDITOR AT NEW YORK TIMES STEPS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joyce Purnick will step down as metropolitan editor
of The New York Times after two years of supervising the paper's
largest news department, it was announced Tuesday. Jonathan
Landman, the editor of The Week in Review, will succeed her.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-year career at the newspaper, Ms. Purnick has covered
city and state government, written editorials and written the Metro
Matters column. She will return to writing a twice-weekly column on
politics and government in the fall, said Joseph Lelyveld,
executive editor of The Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm leaving is simple,'' Ms. Purnick said at a
meeting with her staff on Tuesday. ``After a lot of soul-searching,
I decided I want my future to be in writing, not editing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Purnick, 53, has overseen coverage of the New York region by
a department of nearly 140 reporters and editors since June 1997,
when she became the first woman to be metropolitan editor at The
Times. She received the 1997 Meyer Berger Award from the Graduate
School of Journalism of Columbia University for her columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``During her two years as metro editor, Joyce Purnick has made
an indelible mark in one of our most demanding leadership roles,''
Lelyveld said in a memo to the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Landman, 46, has been editor of The Week in Review since January
1994. He joined The Times as a copy editor in 1987, and was later
an assistant editor on the national and metropolitan desks. He was
deputy editor of the Washington bureau in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to The Times, Landman was deputy city editor at
The Daily News. He also worked as a reporter at Newsday and as a
reporter and an editor at The Chicago Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
   Lelyveld said that at The Times, Landman had shown himself ``to
be anything but a play-it-safe organization guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Outspoken to a fault, contrarian in his zest for ideas and
passionate in his love of good copy, he has long been recognized as
one of our most original editors,'' Lelyveld said.

BUSH RELEASES NAMES OF 115 `PIONEERS' WHO RAISED $100,000 FOR HIS
CAMPAIGN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mich., Wash., Colo., Md., Conn.)   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bowing to criticism from several groups, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas has revealed the identities of some of the
``Pioneers'' who have raised at least $100,000 each for his
deep-pocketed presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   They comprise a cross-section of some of the most wealthy and
powerful people in the Republican Party, including several Bush
family members, former members of President George Bush's
administration, several chief executives, several members of
Congress (Rep. Joe L. Barton of Texas and Jennifer Dunn of
Washington) and two governors (John Engler of Michigan and Bill
Owens of Colorado).
</P>
<P>
   The 115 friends and supporters identified by Bush have already
met their money targets and played a crucial role in helping his
campaign accumulate a record-shattering $37 million in just four
months. But the campaign declined to identify several hundred
others who are still working to make their goals.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, several public interest groups here and in Texas and
several news organizations, including The New York Times, had asked
Bush campaign officials for a complete list of the Pioneers, but
the campaign zealously guarded their identities. But after being
asked about the fund-raising program again at a news conference on
Monday, Bush agreed to release the identities of the 115 Pioneers
who had raised at least $11.5 million for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who've decided to take time out of their
lives to help me become the president,'' Bush told reporters in
Austin, Texas. ``And I am really grateful and very humbled by the
outpouring of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six of the Pioneers, nearly half, live in Texas, including
Kenneth Lay, chairman of the Enron Corp., and A.W. Riter Jr., a
managing partner in Pinstripe Investments and a regent of the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which takes its name from an offhand remark made by
Bush at a meeting of campaign strategists earlier this year, also
includes some powerful Republican fund-raisers who collected huge
sums for former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the party's presidential
nominee in 1996, and for the elder Bush in his re-election campaign
in 1992. They include Peter Terpeluk Jr. and Wayne L. Berman, both
Washington lobbyists; Hank Greenberg, the chairman of American
International Group; and Dr. Zach Zachariah of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist estimated Tuesday that there were 300
other Pioneers still trying to meet their $100,000 goals. Bush's
campaign did not disclose precisely how much each of the 115
Pioneers had raised.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Texas public interest group that pressed for
a full list of Pioneers said he was dissatisfied with the
campaign's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush took a step in the right direction, but it is far
short of full disclosure,'' said Craig L. McDonald, director of
Texans for Public Justice, a nonpartisan research group that
studies the role of money in Texas government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a formalized sophisticated bundling operation,''
McDonald said of the Pioneers program. ``In a sense, the Pioneers
are $100,000 donors or $200,000 donors who are skirting the
post-Watergate campaign finance reforms. We wish the practice would
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Bush on Monday, McDonald complained that each
Pioneer has ``a secret identification number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pioneers reportedly instruct the donors whom they recruit to
note their secret code number on their checks so that your campaign
can credit the money to the proper Pioneer,'' McDonald wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, did not
return several phone calls seeking comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneers program is one secret of Bush's success, but
several of his opponents have similar programs. Vice President Al
Gore, for example, has an incentive program for fund-raisers who
raise at least $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed the intense interest in the Pioneers among
reporters and advocates for an overhaul of the campaign finance
system, saying he had nothing to hide. He also reminded members of
the news media that his campaign had received more than 80,000
donations, ranging from $5 to the $1,000 maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Two Bush family members are among the Pioneers who have raised
at least $100,000 each: Bush's sister, Dorothy B. Koch of Maryland,
and his uncle Jonathan Bush of Connecticut. At his news conference,
Bush mistakenly said that his brother Marvin was a Pioneer who had
met his goal. But his name was not on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a Pioneer,'' the governor said. ``If he's not, we
need to expose that he's not.''

GM PROFIT BEATS WALL STREET EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Pocketing higher profits even as its market share
continues to erode, the General Motors Corp. said Tuesday that it
earned $1.73 billion in the second quarter, a vast improvement over
the $306 million it earned from continuing operations during the
same period last year, when there was a costly strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went right during the quarter,'' said David B.
Healy, an auto analyst at Burnham Securities. ``It represents the
best GM can do, given the way the company is laid out these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Others concurred, particularly because auto sales have been at
record levels so far this year. ``Given the circumstances, they
pretty much had a license to print money this quarter,'' said
Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Lehman Bros. In a down
market, shares of the largest auto makers declined. GM fell
$1.8125, to $66.50.
</P>
<P>
   The profit, which amounted to $2.66 a diluted share, compared
with 40 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier, beat analysts'
expectations of $2.56 a share, according to the First Call Corp.,
which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Those results exclude Delphi Automotive Systems, the giant auto
parts unit, which GM spun off on May 28. Including Delphi, GM's
second-quarter net income hit $1.92 billion, or $2.94 a share,
compared with $389 million, or 52 cents a share, during the period
a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue rose to $45.07 billion from
$37.27 billion, allowing GM to maintain its position as the world's
largest company, ahead of Ford, which had $42.28 billion in
second-quarter sales.
</P>
<P>
   Profits strengthened in North America and Europe but turned to
losses in Latin America. Losses worsened in Asia, and GM's Hughes
Electronics unit took a one-time, pretax charge of $125 million
that caused a $92 million loss, compared with a $56 million profit
in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consolidated results show the strength of our globally
integrated company,'' said John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman and
chief executive. He was particularly pleased with the company's
performance in North America ``in one of the most intensely
competitive markets in recent history.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rising profits, GM executives have been watching the
company's market share in the United States continue its
decades-long slide. By the end of the second quarter, it hit 29.5
percent, down 2.1 percent from the figure in the quarter a year
earlier. If the drop in share persists for a year, GM would have
lost buyers for more than an entire factory-worth of products.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Losh, GM's chief financial officer, said that will
not happen, noting that market share had topped 30 percent in June.
``We expect the share to continue to improve as we go through the
balance of the year,'' Losh said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wendy Beale Needham, an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette said, ``Imagine what will happen to profits when their
market share improves.'' She raised her earnings estimate for the
year to $8.32 a share from $8.14 on the basis of Tuesday's strong
results. The consensus among auto analysts is that GM will earn
$8.22 a share for the year, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall second-quarter results are a mix of impressive
strengths and lingering weaknesses. The company had $16.7 billion
in cash at the end of the quarter, up from $11 billion a year ago.
Most shareholders have applauded two recent moves: its spinoff of
Delphi earlier this year and its huge stock buyback plan. GM has
spent about $7.3 billion buying back about 15.2 percent of its
outstanding shares since January 1997. During the second quarter,
it bought back $520 million worth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GM has been searching for ways to cut costs. It
trimmed $1.8 billion in the first half of the year, Losh said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the company remained bloated. ``They are still
a high-cost producer,'' Healy said. ``They'll turn out to have
lower profit margins than either Ford or the domestic operations of
DaimlerChrysler.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said last week that its North American auto operations
earned profit margins of 7.7 percent in the second quarter.
DaimlerChrysler is scheduled to report its first-half results on
July 29.
</P>
<P>
   GM's automotive profit margins worldwide were 4.2 percent, short
of the company's own goal of 5 percent. Margins hit 5.1 percent in
North America, beating the goal for three consecutive quarters now.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sold a greater proportion of its cars and
trucks at discounts to car rental fleets: 21.2 percent of its
vehicles were sold to fleets in the second quarter, up from 18.4
percent last year. That helped lift its market share. Some analysts
predicted the company would struggle to increase its share, as
executives have vowed to do. ``They are going to continue to have
frustration in their market share,'' Lobaccaro said.
</P>
<P>
   But continuing talks with the United Automobile Workers union
amount to the biggest wild card of the year. The union's three-year
contract expires this fall, and GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler are
negotiating the next contract this summer. Analysts are not
expecting a strike, but GM is most at risk because it has strained
relations with the union.
</P>
<P>
   Losh refused to comment on the negotiations Tuesday except to
say that the company had ``a strong cash position and a strong
balance sheet.''

COAST GUARD FOCUSES ON `SPLASH POINT' AS DEBRIS SCATTERED OVER WIDE
AREA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOE STINEBAKER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ Federal officials confirmed Tuesday that
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s airplane smashed into the Atlantic Ocean with
such force that it scattered debris over an area several hundred
yards wide, hampering their search efforts. The search was then
made more difficult by strong currents off the Massachusetts coast,
which scattered the debris even farther along the ocean bottom.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-dozen ships from at least three federal
agencies have been scouring the ocean floor for days in an as-yet
unsuccessful effort to retrieve debris and, more importantly, the
bodies of Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her
older sister Lauren Bessette who were killed Friday night when
their airplane crashed while on approach to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The search area has been narrowed to a 12-square mile field a
few miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard. While some ``target
areas'' within that field have been eliminated, sonar searches have
added others _ leaving the Navy, Coast Guard and the Massachusetts
State Police with more than a dozen specific sites remaining to be
searched.
</P>
<P>
   One target area seven-and-a-half miles southwest of Gay Head,
near where investigators believe the plane crashed into the water,
has attracted much of the searchers' attention. Although officials
would not describe the size of the debris they believe they have
located, the site has dominated their attention thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the day (Tuesday) with a much more accurate
projection of what the airplane's splash point was,'' said Coast
Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee. ``We have a theoretical splash
point that we feel pretty good about.``
</P>
<P>
   A sonar-equipped Coast Guard ship, the Willow, identified
something near that ``splash point'' Tuesday, and searchers dropped
scuba divers from the Massachusetts State Police at the site. But
officials said the divers were hampered by strong currents, poor
visibility and limited dive times.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Bert Marsh, a salvage operation supervisor with the Navy,
said Tuesday that the divers were dropped over the spot, but
struggled with visibility of less than eight feet, 52-degree
temperatures and a ``significant'' current along the ocean floor
115 feet below the surface. Ultimately, no debris was found at the
site, but divers continued to search the site into Tuesday night
and were considering continuing all night.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, investigators released more radar information
about the position, speed and altitude of Kennedy's plane in the
seconds before its high-speed ditch into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pearce, the chief investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge of the
investigation, said his agency had collected radar agency from
several radar sites in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data show that Kennedy's plane was at 5,600 feet above
sea level as it got within 34 miles of its goal, the airport at
Martha's Vineyard. The plane descended at a rate of nearly 700 feet
per minute _ a descent rate pilots say is typical for a plane such
as Kennedy's. Within five minutes, the plane had descended to 2,300
feet and was within 20 miles of the airport. It is then that the
flight takes an unusual turn.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce said radar indicates that the plane then turned to the
right and climbed back up to 2,600 feet for one minute. Thirty
seconds later, the plane turned right again and began a dizzying
descent that Pearce said may have exceeded 5,000 feet per minute.
Pilots and other experts say that means Kennedy's plane was in a
virtual freefall, or ``death spiral'' for the approximately 30
seconds before it smashed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Although NTSB officials have been careful not to characterize
the speed of the plane's final descent or its crash, the aircraft
apparently shattered on impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you could draw your conclusions from the pieces we've
been bringing in, which are fragmented,'' Pearce said at an
afternoon news briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although divers were unable to retrieve any debris Tuesday, more
pieces were found floating or washed up on shore. Pearce said the
new debris included interior pieces of the plane's cabin and
overhead lining. Investigators declined to say whether any of the
new debris included personal effects, saying they had not yet had a
chance to discuss the finds with the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Cod Times reported that the debris included
registration papers from the plane that had washed ashore and been
delivered to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration spent part of Tuesday
battling reports that it had mishandled a warning about the Kennedy
plane just 25 minutes after it is believed to have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Budd, a 21-year-old intern at the Martha's Vineyard
airport, called the FAA office in Bridgeport, Conn., at 10:05 p.m.
EDT Friday at the request of an unidentified couple waiting for
Lauren Bessette's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy Jr.'s on board,'' transcripts quote Budd telling the
FAA employee. ``He's, uh, they want to know, uh, where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   After repeated questions about Budd's identity, the FAA employee
rejected Budd's request to track the plane, saying, ``We don't give
this information out to people over the phone.'' The call ended
with Budd commenting, ``It's no big deal.``
</P>
<P>
   No action was taken until the Coast Guard received an urgent
call from a Kennedy family friend about 2:15 a.m. Saturday. The
friend was concerned that the Kennedy couple was late for their
expected arrival at Hyannis Port, where they were expected to
attend the wedding of Rory Kennedy, the youngest daughter of the
late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials have begun clamping down on the flow of
information to the media and the public in the past day or so.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gary Jones, a public information officer with the Coast
Guard, said Tuesday that Coast Guard officials would no longer be
allowed to grant interviews to the media other than at daily media
briefings. That decision prompted speculation that James Hall, the
presidentially appointed chairman of the NTSB, was responding to
political pressure from the Kennedy camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jones declined to comment on the speculation, saying only that
the gag order ``is not within usual Coast Guard public affairs
doctrine,'' but acknowledged that the Kennedy crash was ``a very
unusual case.``
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision came from above the Coast Guard, above and
outside the Coast Guard,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also have been careful to protect the crash site,
forbidding media outlets and sightseers from coming within 3,000
feet or from flying within a mile overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The search was expected to continue at least throughout the day
Wednesday. Officials have been hesitant to take on the sensitive
question of when the search might be called off if it continues to
show little success.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question we have been pondering, and I have been
pondering,'' Larrabee said, adding that he and others were
struggling to define what would be ``a reasonable amount of time.``
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, mourning continued for the Kennedys and Lauren
Bessette on Tuesday, with hundreds of people lining up to tour the
John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston and sign a condolence
card to the Kennedy family. Well-wishers also piled cards and
flowers at makeshift shrines at the Manhattan homes of the Kennedys
and Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Flags were lowered to half-staff Tuesday throughout Cape Cod,
most conspicuously at the Kennedy family compound at Hyannis Port.
Sources close to the family said the Kennedys were discussing
arrangements for a memorial service at St. Thomas More Catholic
Church in New York City on Thursday or Friday.

 &HT;    Warrick back to try again
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greensboro, N.C. _ Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick is
one of the preseason favorites to win the Heisman Trophy and the
fleet pass-catcher was the center of attention during the final day
of the annual ACC Football Kickoff meetings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick surprised most Seminole fans by turning away from a sure
first-round pick in the NFL to return to Tallahassee for his final
year. ``After the Florida game (a 23-12 FSU victory), I decided I
was leaving, but I couldn't leave on a losing note after the
(national championship) Tennessee game,'' he said. ``I didn't
really feel it in my heart to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a year ago, I thought I'd be living in fame and
riches,'' he added. ``Well, it's fame all right, but it sure ain't
riches.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick says quarterback Chris Weinke is back 100 percent after
missing FSU's last four games with an injury. ``Weinke knows the
game,'' Warrick said. ``He's fine now. He rips a pair of my gloves
every day at practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-0, 195-pounder says he's done everything he can think of
to keep his distance from sports agents. ``I've already had my
telephone number changed three times,'' he said. ``I don't know how
they get those numbers. They must be the FBI or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Different strokes
</P>
<P>
   Clemson free safety Robert Carswell, a graduate of Stone
Mountain High, says the Tommy Bowden approach differs from last
year's coaching staff headed by Tommy West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coaching staff shows you what they want. They'll take you
out on the field and walk you through it,'' he said. ``Last year,
that coaching staff just told you what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Carswell said he knew Bowden meant business on his first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a team meeting and one guy had a dog in there and he
threw the dog out. A couple of guys had their hats cocked to the
side and he made them take them off. We were in limbo and we wanted
a coach. We wanted to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback draw
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State senior quarterback Jamie Barnette has 7,295 career
total yards of offense compared with the 6,846 yards of Georgia
Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton, but Hamilton is the one being touted
as a Heisman Trophy candidate. Barnette shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the man well,'' he said. ``We've become good friends.
He kids me a lot about not having (split end) Torry Holt to throw
to this year and about not having a big offensive line to take care
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnette says he kids Hamilton about only one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taller than he is and I let him hear about that a lot.''
Barnette is listed as 6-0 while Hamilton is listed as 5-10. Both
are actually closer to 5-9, but Barnette may be a half inch taller.
</P>
<P>
   Who's calling?
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton lives with three teammates and says nobody wants to
answer the telephone when it rings. The all-conference quarterback
says he just refuses to answer it for fear it'll be an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we'll answer it using other people's voices,'' he
said. ``Sometimes we'll answer it in a girl's voice.''

TAIWAN'S NEW DOCTRINE UNINTELLIGIBLE IN CHINESE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-TAIWAN-U.S.) 
(lb) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Even with all the justifications,
interpretations and clarifications that Taiwan's leaders have
offered in recent days to try to explain their new relationship to
the Chinese mainland, one thing stands out: They can't say it in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Baffling as that may sound, the formula that Taiwan invented
earlier this month to redefine itself as a separate state but not
an independent country from China is so hard to articulate that
officials here routinely resort to English.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is one nation and two countries,'' said Chen
Chien-jen, Taiwan's chief spokesman, speaking in English in an
interview Tuesday. Invited to say the same thing in Chinese, Chen
paused and then replied, again in English: ``We are still looking
for the right words.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a perplexing problem. In Chinese, ``nation'' and
``country'' and even ``state'' are the same word: ``guojia''
(pronounced gwo-jah).
</P>
<P>
   Yet Taiwan officials like the slightly different gradings that
those words each carry in English, conveniently allowing them to
argue simultaneously that Taiwan is no longer part of China while
not declaring independence, a step that Beijing has vowed to use
force to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   So they use the English words, even though Taiwan is a
Chinese-speaking country, or state, or nation _ or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, for the record, calls Taiwan a province, one that has
served as the base for the nationalists since their defeat in the
civil war in 1949. And one that Beijing wants returned to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Many Taiwan officials, when discussing the issue in Chinese,
simply say ``state'' or ``nation'' in English.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 11 days since President Lee Teng-hui created a
diplomatic crisis by calling Taiwan a separate country, yet he and
other Taiwan leaders are still struggling to find a way to express
what they want: more distance from China, without getting crushed
by an irate Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Lee emerged in public on Tuesday for the first time since July 9
to reiterate his stance, and to try to rebut criticism of his
decision to drop the ``one China'' formula that Taiwan and China
and the United States have all followed for decades as a way of
averting a potentially violent argument about whose China that is.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lee fine-tuned his message. But for the ordinary
listener that did not help much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only after a democratic reunification can there be a
possibility of one China,'' Lee said, in Chinese for once. ``One
China is not now.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rough translation: If we insist on conditions like the
arrival of democracy in China, we can say we still have the goal of
reunifying, even though it's so far in the future that we can stop
saying Taiwan and China are part of the same country. In a word, no
more ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Taiwan's quandary is that it and the Chinese
mainland have effectively been separate and independent since the
civil war, but have been unwilling to say so for political and
historical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For decades both the nationalists on Taiwan and the communists
on the mainland maintained rival claims to be the legitimate
government of all China. Taiwan has since dropped its ambitions to
rule the mainland, but Beijing insists that it will attack if
Taiwan moves to thwart reunification by actually declaring
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not seeking independence,'' said Lee on Tuesday, in
case there were any lingering question. ``We will foster dialogue
and negotiations with the Chinese communists on an equal footing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Lee's words, as far as can be discerned, the key issue is
whether Taiwan and China talk to each other as separate ``states.''
Until now, Taiwan and China had agreed to talk to each other as
``separate political entities,'' but as part of the same
``country.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound very different to the untrained ear, but in
the framework of a debate where a disputed notion of sovereignty
could spark war, it is everything. As might be expected, six years
of talks between Taiwan and China have so far yielded little beyond
an endless back-and-forth about terminology.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem surprising that Lee's aides did not work out various
explanations before he announced the change on July 9. Several
aides to Lee have apparently admitted that his remarks, in Chinese
during a German radio interview, came as a total surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan's chief decision-making
body on the Taiwan-China issue, met for hours on July 10 and again
on July 11, to try to work out the implications of what Lee said.
Apparently it was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Su Chi, chairman of the council, told reporters on July 10 that
there was ``no big change,'' and that the Nationalist Party was
keeping to its reunification platform.
</P>
<P>
   The very next day, Su emerged from several more hours of talks
to say that actually Taiwan was dropping its long-held ``one
China'' stance, and that it was abandoning the guidelines for
reunification that had steered policy since 1991. Those words
landed like a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, government officials have offered various
interpretations, many of them peppered with the English words
``nation'' and ``state.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Chen, Taiwan's word-parsing spokesman, conceded that
describing Taiwan and China as part of the same country does not
always accurately reflect the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words cannot fully betray the significance,'' Chen said. ``A
policy has to not only be legitimate, but also realistic.''

DODGERS WAKE UP, NAIL PIRATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson made the
proclamation no one else in the Dodgers clubhouse felt comfortable
making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time for the club to start coming together,''
Johnson said after the Dodgers' 8-4 win at Pittsburgh on Tuesday.
``It looks like we're going to make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago the Dodgers were dead, thinking about whether to
reshuffle and reload for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Now the rest of the division is struggling, and though the
Dodgers (43-49) remain under .500, they're no longer in last place
and have momentum after winning eight of 10. That momentum has
manifested itself in the return of enthusiasm and camaraderie to
the once-dormant clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a day when their ace, Kevin Brown, wasted a four-run
lead, the mood was pretty much happy-go-lucky because catcher Todd
Hundley, who has turned into the power source they hoped for,
countered with a two-run homer in the eighth to break a 4-4 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers can accentuate their second-half push when they host
Colorado for three games beginning tonight, before heading to
second-place Arizona for three weekend games that could help shape
the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of motivated in the second half, and we've started
doing the things we didn't do,'' said Dodgers third baseman Adrian
Beltre, who had three RBI and was pardoned after making a crucial
defensive gaffe. ``We're doing little things, moving guys over, the
kinds of plays we need from this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Brown, who hadn't pitched well lately, got into the act,
snapping a winless stretch at four starts for his first win since
June 25. Brown (10-6) allowed four runs in seven innings and had to
pitch out of a second-and-third, none-out situation after allowing
two runs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The jam was partly caused by Beltre's miscue. Ed Sprague's hard
grounder went through Beltre's legs _ though it was ruled a double
by official scorer Evan Pattak _ and Warren Morris followed with a
two-run double to tie it at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, under pressure to perform after signing his now-famous
$105 million contract, sounded frustrated with the number of
broken-bat hits he's allowed and the untimely mistakes in the field
that have plagued many of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if someone is trying to test me,'' said Brown,
who was 0-2 with a 7.27 ERA in his four starts before Tuesday.
``It's like the witch doctor has a curse on me. If anyone has
anything for me they can send to get rid of it, I'll take anything.
I'll take some for myself and for the team. This game, you have to
have some luck. There ain't been a whole lot of it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of a lot easier when the team is winning. From a
team standpoint, if you win, it makes it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   After Morris' double, Brown got Adrian Brown to ground out,
struck out John Wehner and got out of the inning when Al Martin
grounded to first, where Eric Karros made a diving stop and flipped
to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers reclaimed the lead before an out was recorded in the
top of the eighth on Hundley's two-run, opposite-field homer off
reliever Brad Clontz (0-3) that barely cleared the left-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got extended on it,'' said Hundley, who has hit half of his
14 homers since returning to the starting lineup June 25. ``I was
trying to hit it hard and I was able to get my arms extended.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's homer was almost a carbon copy of the grand slam he
hit in Monday's game. The Dodgers made it 8-4 in the ninth on RBI
singles by Angel Pena and Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hundley's) homer was big, especially for me because I should
have made that play,'' Beltre said. ``It was my fault the game was
tied.''

BUSH `PIONEERS' INSIST FUND RAISING BY 115 IS A GRASS-ROOTS EFFORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's elite 115 fund-raisers are
called ``Pioneers'' because they are blazing new trails in campaign
finance by raising at least $100,000 each for his Republican
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raisers and Bush's campaign insist that the money is a
result of a populist grass-roots campaign, not the work of elite
business leaders seeking favors.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the Pioneers are people who helped the governor's
father, George Bush, win the presidency in 1988 by donating
$100,000 or more of their own money to the Republican National
Committee, a feat that granted them membership to Team 100. At
least two were criticized for getting special favors from the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Another four are Gov. Bush's relatives: two of his father's
brothers, a cousin and his sister, Doro Koch. Seven are developers
and lawyers who helped Bush's brother, Jeb, win office as governor
of Florida last year.
</P>
<P>
   Midland, Texas, independent oilman and Pioneer Joe O'Neill is
probably more important to Bush than just for the money he has
raised. O'Neill introduced Bush to his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Four Pioneers are men who owned shares in the Texas Rangers
baseball team with Bush, including the governor's former Yale
fraternity brother Roland Betts. Another is Austin radio station
chain executive Steve Hicks, whose brother, Tom, bought the Rangers
last year.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven Pioneers have received Bush appointments to state
boards and commissions, including four University of Texas regents,
transportation commission Chairman David Laney, parks and wildlife
department Chairman Lee Bass and board member Dick Heath and public
safety commission Chairman Jim Francis, who also is chairman of the
Pioneers organization.
</P>
<P>
   One group of Pioneers appears to be aligned with Michigan Gov.
John Engler, frequently mentioned as a possible Bush running mate.
Another group of Pioneers are backers of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge, another potential Bush running mate.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pioneers have helped Bush raise his record $37 million
campaign fund, the campaign also has drawn criticism for appearing
to use ``power brokers'' to pay for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush released the list of Pioneers late Monday under pressure
from the news media and public interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   The group Texans for Public Justice, however, said Tuesday that
Bush had not gone far enough because he has not released the list
of more than 250 people who have pledged to become Pioneers but
have not yet raised $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a right to know who these high rollers are and
exactly how much money they have delivered,'' said Craig McDonald,
director of Texans for Public Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Simon, acting president of Common Cause, said Bush's
Pioneer organization indicated the governor is ready to launch a
financial arms race in next year's general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``These so-called Pioneers are the new class of political power
brokers whose status and access are determined by the big money
they bring to the campaign,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker defended the organization Tuesday,
calling it grass-roots fund raising that differed from a normal
campaign finance committee only in what its members are called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like having a block captain for door knocking before
the election,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign finance Chairman Don Evans said voters will have
to trust Bush not to give his fund-raisers any special privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a leader who does the right things for the
right reasons,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   But several of Bush's Pioneers have been criticized in the past
for benefits they received from government under a Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Common Cause criticized actions involving California
agricultural investor Howard Leach, now a Pioneer. Leach, a member
of Team 100, told President Bush that growers needed low-cost water
released from the Central Valley Project. The water was released 10
days later.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Pioneer Heinz Prechter of Michigan, who was a Team
100 member, traveled to Japan with President Bush as a member of
the President's Export Council. The trip resulted in Prechter's
company getting a lucrative contract to sell sunroofs for Honda's
American-made cars, Common Cause reported.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas investor Charles Wyly was one of President Bush's Team
100 members and now is a Pioneer. In 1993, Wyly and his brother Sam
formed the Maverick Capital Fund, which last year received a $90
million investment from the University of Texas Investment
Management Co. Fund managers will receive more than $900,000 in
management fees.
</P>
<P>
   Another Pioneer is Boston real estate developer Herb Collins.
The Washington Post reported in 1996 that Collins was among a group
of developers trying to persuade House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, to retain a lucrative tax break at
the same time they were raising money to help Archer's son-in-law
run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Pioneer Marty Fiorentino, vice president of CSX
Transportation, helped Jeb Bush win the Sunshine State's
governorship. In 1997 Fiorentino was critical of a Democratic
National Committee retreat in Florida that allowed 70 people who
gave $50,000 to the DNC to meet privately with President Bill
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll get access to individuals in a small setting and you'll
get to show that you are a supporter in a very graphic way,''
Fiorentino told a Florida newspaper. ``This is as close to the
mother's milk of politics as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent Bush fund-raisers from Houston, investment banker
Peter Coneway and lawyer-lobbyist Joe B. Allen, said they were part
of a grass-roots effort that belies the criticism from public
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the facts that I have seen, it (the contributions to
Bush) has been a great groundswell of individuals,'' Coneway said.
``It's exactly the opposite of what these people are objecting
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Coneway said he volunteered to collect Bush campaign money from
friends and colleagues across the country as ``a labor of love''
because he thinks Bush would be a good president. He said he did
not raise the money as a member of a particular industry or
political group.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the individuals who have given $1,000 each have far
less influence on the political process than industries and
organizations that give unlimited funds to the political parties.
With so many individuals willingly contributing to Bush's campaign,
``what this campaign proves to me (is) you don't have a limited
number of people who are `the big contributors,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, along with Pioneers Robert Whilden and Tom Marinis, all
are with the firm of Vinson &AMP; Elkins in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he gathered the money primarily from friends, lawyers
and their spouses without regard to the legal and political causes
he represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that I care most about probably don't have as much
to do with my law firm as they do with my long-term well-being,
which I think is connected to what generally happens in the whole
country,'' Allen remarked.

A JAZZ PIANIST WITH A BRAHMSIAN BENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Adam Shatz's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
Chicago Underground Trio.  
 By ADAM SHATZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jazz has an Oedipal problem, and critics are at least partly to
blame. A good deal of jazz writing comes down to matching sons with
their putative fathers, the men (for they are almost invariably
men) who influenced young musicians and whom the young resemble
with apparently biological precision.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing these lines of descent may be unavoidable, and even
illuminating at times. But it proves a crude, not to mention
patriarchal, way of listening. (Is it any wonder that young jazz
musicians revolt against the traditions handed down to them?)
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, the reception of Brad Mehldau, who, at
28, is among the most celebrated jazz pianists of his generation.
If you've heard his name mentioned, you've probably heard that he's
``the next Bill Evans.'' High praise, to be sure. But like most
such comparisons, this one is more than a little misleading, as
unfair as it is flattering.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Mehldau has often suggested the wounded,
melancholic Evans on his three ``Art of the Trio'' recordings with
the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jorge Rossy. And he has
Evans' gift for elevating standard material. (He has also battled
on and off with heroin addiction, which ultimately felled Evans.)
</P>
<P>
   But with each new record, Mehldau sounds less and less like
Evans, and his latest, ``Elegaic Cycle,'' a solo piano effort, is
further evidence of their differences. Evans, who died in 1980,
seemed to find it unbearable to shatter the perfection of silence,
which gave his music a haunting reticence. Mehldau, by contrast,
tends toward rapture, lavishly embroidering his improvisations with
counterpoint and caprice.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason behind the Evans analogies, one suspects, has
less to do with music than with race. Evans is the most famous
member of the tiny coterie of great white jazz pianists, a club
that also includes Lenny Tristano, Paul Bley and Keith Jarrett.
Being likened to him is the lot of sensitive white pianists, even
when, as in Mehldau's case, their playing carries equally strong
echoes of Herbie Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Elegaic Cycle'' underscores, however, Mehldau has his own,
eccentric sensibility. Like Evans, he is profoundly drawn to
classical music, but where Evans invoked early French modernists
like Debussy and Ravel, Mehldau demonstrates affinities with
19th-century German Romantics like Schubert and Brahms. On this
record, he has embraced what he admires of this repertory in a
manner so audacious that it seems ungenerous to refer to him as a
jazz musician.
</P>
<P>
   Mehldau's interest in European concert music is one he shares
with many of his fellow pianists. Hancock made his concert debut at
the age of 11 in a performance with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra;
Cecil Taylor was an avid student of Stravinsky and Bartok; Jarrett
has recorded Shostakovich and Bach. Among Mehldau's exact
contemporaries, Jason Moran and Marc Cary have offered jazz
interpretations of, respectively, Ravel and Satie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mehldau's passion for the brooding, metaphysical
sensibility of German Romanticism is unusual in jazz, in which
classical influences tend to be French, and casually held. During a
recent interview at the Avatar Studio in midtown Manhattan, where
he was mixing a forthcoming trio record, Mehldau reflected: ``If
there's any German ethos that attracts me, it has to do with the
incredible amount of welled-up emotion that's being conveyed.
There's a kind of longing that you feel in the literature and in
the music of Schubert and Schumann.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a studious, unpretentious air about Mehldau, who could
easily be mistaken for a graduate student in comparative
literature. The humble, worshipful mode comes naturally to him, as
he meditates on what he calls ``greatness'' _ the quality, he says,
of ``something so removed from me that it, like, feels above me.''
He added: ``When I hear Beethoven's string quartets or Coltrane's
`A Love Supreme,' I have no clue to how they pulled it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehldau felt exactly this commingling of awe, exaltation and
terror when, in his early 20s, he began practicing classical music
for the first time in a decade. (He studied jazz at the New School
in lower Manhattan.) ``I came back to classical more for pleasure
than anything else,'' he said, ``and it led me to this discovery of
Brahms, and that led to Schumann and Schubert.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, he read Thomas Mann's 1948 novel, ``Doctor
Faustus,'' an allegory of Germany's descent into fascism. The tale
of a composer who sells his soul to the Devil, the book features a
stirring lecture on Beethoven's late piano sonatas by Wendell
Kretschmar, a thinly disguised caricature of the music philosopher
Theodor Adorno.
</P>
<P>
   Mehldau was overwhelmed by Mann's book, and went on to read
Rilke, Goethe and other German writers. Last summer he flew from
Hollywood, where he lives, to Berlin to spend a few months studying
German.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, Berlin was celebrating the 50th anniversary of
``Doctor Faustus'' with an exhibit of Mann's manuscripts at the
national library. Just then, it occurred to Mehldau that he was
retracing the steps of his favorite author, for Mann had written
his novel in Pacific Palisades while in exile from Nazi Germany. It
was a good time to be in Berlin, and it was there that ``Elegaic
Cycle'' was conceived.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the piece, he said, ``came from the song-cycles
that I love in the German lieder tradition of Schubert's
`Winterreise.''' Composed in 1827, ``Winterreise,'' or ``Winter's
Journey,'' is a composition for piano and baritone set to two dozen
poems by Wilhelm Muller. In this bleak, hallucinatory work, a
jilted lover trudges through the snow, despairing of his love and
coming to terms with his mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Mehldau has tried to recreate something of this circular,
death-obsessed mood in ``Elegaic Cycle.'' One of its pieces,
``Ruckblick,'' or ``Retrospect,'' is named after the penultimate
movement of Brahms' Third Piano Sonata. Two tracks are explicit
elegies: one for William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, the other
for his mentor Fred Myrow.
</P>
<P>
   The three-note motif that starts the first piece, ``The Bard,''
recurs throughout the cycle, in some cases played upside-down. The
cycle as a whole is, by design, exceptionally dense with harmonic
cross-referencing. As Mehldau explained, ``There's something that
has always appealed to me about music that lets you know it's
bringing its themes back, because it's a real play on your
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Such devices were, in fact, (italics)the(end italics) hallmark
of Romantic elegies. As the musicologist Charles Rosen points out
in his study ``The Romantic Generation,'' the song-cycle's listener
is forced to ``listen back in his memory to the earlier songs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only then can he perceive how the cycle is taking shape,''
Rosen writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elegaic Cycle'' does not always wear its Germanic
predilections lightly, and Mehldau is certain to be faulted for
indulging them. Although recognizably a jazz record in its emphasis
on improvisation, it is occasionally lugubrious _ ponderous rather
than poetic. Not surprisingly, Mehldau was warned early on by
Warner Brothers, his label, that a solo album of original,
classical-inspired compositions would be a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Mehldau himself worried that ``it would come off sounding like a
misfired attempt at doing something classical.'' But he reminded
himself that most of the music he loved ``broke away from whatever
genre it was in.'' He went on: ``And with jazz, the people who do
that for me are musicians like Miles Davis, coming along with
`Bitches Brew' or `In a Silent Way.' I mean, (italics)what the hell
was that?(end italics) Or Keith Jarrett, who made this whole series
of solo piano records on ECM, which are so completely
unclassifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett is a pianist who often comes to mind here, which is not
to say that Mehldau is the ``next Keith Jarrett.'' For Jarrett
virtually invented the genre in which ``Elegaic Cycle'' belongs:
the sprawling, introspective solo recital.
</P>
<P>
   One of the distinguishing genres of jazz in the 1970s, it had
largely vanished by the '90s when Bley, Andrew Hill and finally
Jarrett himself sought to re-establish their reputations in more
straight-ahead contexts.
</P>
<P>
   Like these pianists, Mehldau is an individualist with an
obsessive streak; or, as he would prefer, he is a ``hopeless
Romantic.'' And his recording raises the larger and more
interesting question of whether jazz contains an impulse that is
not, in the deepest sense, Romantic.
</P>
<P>
   After all, jazz is derived from the blues, a music that is on
intimate terms with grief and loss _ the signature concerns of
Romantic art. And as Mehldau suggests, jazz musicians are perhaps
dealing with the hard stuff when they're doing what comes
naturally, namely improvising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of improvisation,'' he writes in his liner notes,
``is a kind of affirmation of mortality. Even in the moment you're
creating something, it's already gone forever, and that's precisely
its strength. Improvisation would seem to solve the problem of
death by constantly dying as it's being born. It scoffs at loss,
and revels in its own transience.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mehldau is saying, in essence, is that jazz is an
inherently Romantic art, one that finds transcendence in the
ephemeral _ ``in the moment,'' as jazz musicians put it. The
pleasures of ``Elegaic Cycle,'' like those of Jarrett's seminal
``Koln Concert,'' are grandly provisional, achieved at the price of
occasional noodling.
</P>
<P>
   Mehldau has not yet succeeded in fusing jazz improvisation with
the classical elegy. American listeners, who are as uncomfortable
with failure as they are with death, are not likely to give it the
hearing it deserves. But as Romantics have always insisted, art
that risks nothing in pursuit of the sublime is not worthy of the
name.

STANLEY TRETICK, `PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S PHOTOGRAPHIC BOSWELL,' DIES
AT 77
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)

<P>
   Stanley Tretick, the Look magazine photographer known for his
intimate pictures of the Kennedy White House, including one of John
F. Kennedy Jr. as a toddler playing under his father's desk, died
Monday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, said the author Kitty Kelley, a close
friend. Ms. Kelley added that Tretick had been incapacitated for
the last four years after several strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him what happened over the weekend, but I'm not sure he
was aware of it,'' Ms. Kelley said of the presumed death of
Kennedy. ``I told him his photographs were all over television.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelley recalled how Tretick had wanted to put together a
series of photographs of President Kennedy and his son, but
Jacqueline Kennedy was against the idea at first, not wanting her
husband to use the pictures for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in October 1963, when the first lady left the White House
on a trip, Tretick was allowed to take candid pictures of father
and son, including the desk picture, which Ms. Kelley said he knew
he would be remembered for.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Ms. Kelley said, she asked the young Kennedy to
sign the original photograph, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   Tretick also took many photographs of the Kennedy administration
at work, including a well-known lineup of the president with his
military advisers during the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Stanley Tretick was born on July 21, 1921, in Baltimore,
and grew up in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the Acme News Service and then United Press
International, covering the Korean War, the White House, Capitol
Hill and presidential campaigns and elections from 1952 to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Tretick won numerous awards for his work in the White House
Photographers' competition. He was referred to as ``President
Kennedy's photographic Boswell'' in the final publication of Look.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Tretick became close to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and
covered his presidential campaign in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He rebuffed an approach by President Jimmy Carter to become
Carter's personal photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel he wanted an intimate, personal photographer
around him,'' Tretick said in an interview with The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   After Look folded, Tretick worked as a freelance photographer
and for People magazine until he retired after a stroke in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Tretick is survived by a brother, Gordon Tretick of New Milford,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kennedy's election, Tretick was best known for an article
he wrote for The Saturday Evening Post in 1958 called ``I Shoot the
Big Shots.''
</P>
<P>
   In the article, he discussed his coverage of the Senate rackets
committee hearings, in which he had so angered a gangster named
Johnny Dio that Tretick had to duck when Dio swung at him. He got
the picture, but complained, ``The worst part of being hit while on
an assignment is that some other photographer invariably scoops you
with a sensational shot of you getting belted.''  &QL;

EVER PRAGMATIC SINGAPORE IS MAKING ART ITS BUSINESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for SINGAPORE-DANCE)  
 (af)  
 Susan Heller Anderson, a former New York Times reporter, writes
about the visual and performing arts.  
 By SUSAN HELLER ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ In less than five years the arts scene here has gone
from invisible to explosive. With a combination of seduction and
subsidies, the Singapore government is aggressively wooing artists
and arts organizations around the world to make their homes in this
affluent city-state.
</P>
<P>
   The first annual Singapore Arts Festival ended its monthlong run
at the end of June, having attracted 29 international troupes, more
than 200 fringe performers and a mammoth citywide sculpture
exhibition, thanks to generous government support.
</P>
<P>
   Three new museums have opened since 1996, with the expansion of
one under way. On the waterfront rises the Esplanade, an ambitious
$265 million performing-arts center with two concert halls,
rehearsal studios, outdoor performing spaces and a panoply of food
and entertainment amenities.
</P>
<P>
   These state-of-the-art facilities, combined with an
infrastructure of excellent transportation, communications and
financial services, greatly enhance Singapore's potential as an
arts center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the mid-'90s we realized that we must have a more
creative approach and encourage cultural activities,'' said Liu Tai
Ker, a Yale-educated architect and chairman of the National Arts
Council. ``A person involved in cultural activities will be a more
creative, thinking person, better in the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many officially sanctioned developments here, cultural
activity is a result of pragmatic financial considerations. A zeal
to achieve first-world economic status coupled with three decades
of authoritarian, repressive leadership, had nearly obliterated
creativity. The city-state had become bland and boring, compared
with the bawdy glamour it had acquired under British rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is art for business' sake,'' said Christine Khor, the
assistant director for arts and entertainment at the Singapore
Tourism Board, which promotes the arts to attract tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of these factors _ the importance of business creativity
in an information age and culture as a tourist magnet _ the
government has established financial incentives for the arts
similar to those with which it has lured business.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Cirque du Soleil announced that it would make
Singapore its Asian touring base for at least six years. In return,
the government awarded it ``business headquarter status,'' a new
tax category that insures the Cirque several years' exemption from
paying income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Donors to museums are offered income-tax deductions and
permanent residency, depending on the size of their donations.
Gifts in excess of about $590,000 allow the donor a $1.2 million
tax deduction, twice the amount of the gift.
</P>
<P>
   The downside? The specter of censorship. Officially, Singapore
has no written censorship laws, according to Yong Pung How, the
chief justice of the supreme court. Yet every public performance
requires a license from the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit,
part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Unofficially, except for
outrageously controversial works, a number of established groups
are exempted, like the Singapore Repertory Theater, the Singapore
Dance Theater and Theaterworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already given them guidelines,'' said Goh Ching Lee, the
festival's organizer and the program development director at the
National Arts Council. She explained that the guidelines
``discourage'' works that are racist, pornographic, excessively
violent or politically offensive, which covers the majority of
themes that artists find provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood is a more open one, but it's not totally unmanaged,''
said Liu of the National Arts Council. ``It's very difficult for a
big country like the U.S. to recognize the vulnerability of a small
country to political unrest.'' How does a country merge wariness of
new ideas with an open cultural climate? ``That's the challenge,''
Liu admits.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from the festival's offerings and art exhibitions
and from interviews with artists and heads of arts organizations,
the government's rules have relaxed considerably. ``I've been here
six years and never once saw a guideline,'' said Tony Petito, the
founder and artistic director of Singapore Rep.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he directed ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' with its
themes of political repression, military brutality and
homosexuality. ``That could never have happened a few years ago,''
Petito said. ``We just applied for an R(A) rating, got the license
and did the show.'' Recently the government introduced a rating
system for films and plays to alert audiences about content.
</P>
<P>
   ``R(A) means `restricted artistic,' and may contain scenes and
language that are objectionable,'' Ms. Goh explained. R(A)
indicates viewing restricted to people 18 years old and over, but
there is no official enforcement. ``In more than 95 percent of
cases we don't even ask for an R(A) rating,'' Ms. Goh said, adding
that she could not recall a performance piece that had been banned
recently.
</P>
<P>
   But all limits are not suspended in this tightly controlled
city-state. Artistic decisions are policed by arts administrators
themselves. While Petito, a Brooklyn-born director who plans to
return to the United States this year, dares test the government's
boundaries, most older Singaporean arts administrators tread more
gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual curators have to deal with the artists,'' said Liu,
who recalled a recent incident at a pan-Asian contemporary art
exhibition. ``One artist was asked not to submit a work which we
felt was disrespectful of our political leaders,'' he said. ``The
development of culture cannot exist separately from what we are, a
small country vulnerable to destabilization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Singapore Dance Theater does not submit works for licensing.
``We have blanket approval,'' said Ng Siew Eng, the company's
general manager. ``We're mindful of being a national dance company,
that our works should be appropriate for children and people of all
ages and levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Goh Soo Khim, the troupe's artistic director (no relation to the
arts festival's organizer), recently told a young choreographer to
modify a ballet scheduled to have its premiere at one of its
outdoor performances, which usually attract thousands of
spectators, many of them families with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about sexual identity, so there was cross-dressing,
then dancers would undress to reveal their true sex,'' explained
Andrea Pell, the company's assistant ballet mistress, who came from
the Atlanta Ballet. ``Ms. Goh thought it went too far, so she asked
him to tone it down. And he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Many society-bending works do, however, reach the public. At the
festival, the Famous Door Theater from Chicago performed
``Hellcab,'' larded with four-letter expletives, sex between
unmarried partners, drug addicts, gangsters and out-of-control
aggression, behavior frowned upon, at the very least. Drug
possession carries the death penalty, but there was no R(A) rating
for ``Hellcab.'' Merely an innocuous, small-print warning about
strong language.
</P>
<P>
   The two festival entries that carried the R(A) rating played to
attentive, appreciative audiences. ``The Plastic Woman,'' a Thai
theater piece, featured an androgynous actor in flesh-colored
tights and baby-blue high heels.
</P>
<P>
   The main prop was a life-size doll's head with flowing hair. The
plastic doll, which symbolized women in male-dominated cultures
like Singapore's, was alternately beaten, caressed, sexually
assaulted, praised, insulted and abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Even to a Western sensibility the work was tough stuff. But
nothing compared with the second R(A)-rated work by Dairakudakan, a
Japanese dance group, which performed ``Ryuba,'' an abstract
two-hour performance created by Akaji Maro, the troupe's founder.
``Very dark and grotesque,'' Ms. Goh, the festival's organizer,
observed, explaining the rating.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ryuba'' nearly nude dancers moved to electronic music
layered with terrifying sound effects _ bombs falling, machine-gun
fire, human screams _ with the bass turned up so that it vibrated
the theater seats. The set consisted of panels strung with splayed
skins (perhaps human, perhaps animal), suggestive of primitive
mankind.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One segment depicted the walking wounded: dancers wore crimson
bikinis and held bloodied rags in their mouths; jaws were agape,
lips twisted in fear, agony, pain, horror or silent cries.
``Ryuba'' was profoundly gut-wrenching, riveting in its depiction
of human emotions. ``A cry from the soul,'' said Ms. Khor, a dance
critic before joining the tourism board. ``This is totally Asian;
why would we ban this? It touches our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Such works are far from the feel-good, Disneyesque entertainment
Singaporeans were accustomed to when theater and film were
rigorously censored. Nevertheless, life is still carefully ordered
and behavior prescribed. Spraying graffiti and chewing gum, for
example, carry stiff penalties. The image of an American who was
caned in 1994 for spray-painting cars has not faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singapore has gone through three cycles of development,'' said
Liu, the arts council chairman, explaining the history of the
nation, established in 1965 from a British colony. ``Consolidation
as a nation, membership among the upper leagues of nations in
providing housing and health care services and, since the mid-'90s,
recognition that to have a quality work force, we need a more
creative approach to cultural activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``consolidation'' to which he refers was imposed by the
government, a stern work-and-behavior ethic often unacceptable in
the West, but to which most Singaporeans credit their disciplined
society and the resulting ebullient economy. Nonadherence to those
standards brought swift punishment, leading to the local joke that
Singapore is a ``fine'' country, referring to its monetary
penalties for a variety of frowned-upon social behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In the performing arts this societal rigor enhances the artistic
result. ``Discipline is very good,'' Ms. Pell said about her
dancers. Henry Ong, a Singaporean playwright based in Los Angeles,
noted, ``Production values are wonderful.'' He traveled here on
government money to oversee Singapore Rep's festival production of
his play ``Fabric.'' Ong left Singapore in 1977 for the University
of Iowa, to pursue a journalism career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been such a tremendous evolution in the appreciation
and support of the arts. When I left there was no arts scene,'' Ong
recalled. ``I don't get the sense of actors here feeling
censorship,'' he said of his mix of American and Singaporean
actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater started when we did, in 1993,'' Petito explained.
Singapore Rep is moving into a restored former warehouse on the
Singapore River, thanks to rent subsidies from the arts council,
which houses arts organizations and artists' space in restored
landmark buildings. The Singapore Dance Theater and Theaterworks
share an airy building in the greenery of Fort Canning Park,
overlooking the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterloo arts complex, just northeast of the new museums in
the heart of the government center, includes studios, art galleries
and a cafe. The new museums are jewel boxes set in renovated
colonial buildings redolent of Colonial Britain _ white stucco,
mahogany-hued woods, languid palms, whirring fans, spacious
courtyards. The council houses 53 arts groups and 25 artists, in
addition to the museums.
</P>
<P>
   Some 99 percent of government money for the arts flows from the
National Arts Council and the National Heritage Board, formed in
1993 to oversee the museums. Together they spent $36 million in
1998 on the arts, compared with $20 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The number of art exhibitions doubled from 1994 to 1998, from
200 to 400, while the number of performances increased 15 percent.
The figure does not include free performances, given frequently by
the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, the Singapore Dance Theater and
most of the eight resident theater groups.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the increasing demand for performing and visual artists
and all the supporting activities of scholarship and stagecraft,
the government plans a new Institute of the Arts and to upgrade the
existing colleges, LaSalle and Nanyang. Again, arts for business'
sake, in this case employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more Singaporeans have qualifications,'' said Dr.
Kenson Kwok, the director of the new Asian Civilizations Museum,
which will expand further into a 135,000-square-foot space. ``Five
years ago we would have had trouble with staffing. Now, people are
studying subjects not conventionally useful to making money.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer docents give tours of the national museums. Kwok, an
art historian, said:``Five years ago, they were all expatriates.
But in the last three years many locals have begun to volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Asian nations, Singaporeans have a melange of
backgrounds, 78 percent Chinese from various regions, 14 percent
from the Malay Peninsula, 7 percent Indian and 1 percent
miscellaneous, in a population of 3.78 million. Four official
languages are spoken, although English is mandatory in school.
Travel for educational and cultural purposes is widely encouraged.
``We send scholars all over the world for doctorates,'' Liu said.
``We welcome foreigners here, to have cross-fertilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore looks to the West, not to its neighbors, as the model
for cultural development. ``They've decided that they made their
money,'' Petito said. ``Now they feel they want world-class arts
organizations.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: HEMINGWAY AND THE DRAMA OF THE WRITER'S SELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About the time T.S. Eliot was advancing the idea that an
artist's progress is a ``continual extinction of personality,''
another American, 11 years Eliot's junior and just out of high
school, was putting in a brief apprenticeship at The Kansas City
Star and preparing to head off to the war in Europe. He _ Ernest
Hemingway, that is _ reached the Italian front in June 1918 and was
badly wounded by early July, narrowly avoiding a more complete
extinction of personality than even Eliot seemed to require.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hemingway, too, the writer's personality was something
of a crux. If he had not disliked Eliot so much, he might even have
agreed with Eliot's limpid statement of the problem. Poetry, Eliot
concluded, is an escape from emotions, from personality. ``But, of
course,'' Eliot famously added, ``only those who have personality
and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these
things.'' This could have served as an epigraph, with Gertrude
Stein and Ecclesiastes, to Hemingway's first novel, ``The Sun Also
Rises,'' which is the story of people who have personalities and
emotions but do not want them.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 100 years today since Hemingway was born, and,
looking back, it is plain to see that he, more than any other
American in the past century, has changed our sense of what it
means to be a writer, if not necessarily to write. The very posture
with which young writers sit before blank computer screens, instead
of blank sheets of typing paper, is borrowed from Hemingway or from
those who have since refracted Hemingway. Whether he intended to or
not, Hemingway dramatized the gulf between what his personality
exacted from him _ the outer career of the man on safari, at war,
in the bull ring _ and what his prose exacted. Writing might not
have been action, but it was conflict. That drama has given comfort
to many who wished to write and found they could not.
</P>
<P>
   But Hemingway _ it is still necessary to say it _ could write.
And, as his literary executors have proved with posthumous
publications of steadily decreasing merit, he could also edit. The
writer in him may have struggled as he grew older, but the editor
never did. The silence in his early work, his best work, is brutal,
as brutal as the silence into which he lapsed just before killing
himself nearly 40 years ago. It was the asperity of his prose, as
much as its emotional distance, that made him modern.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway the man was never finished, and neither was the body
of his work. But his style, as a man and writer, was settled early
on, and so was his fame, which came to him while still very young.
In a sense, Hemingway tried always to be bigger than his
reputation, to outman his masculine self. This has made it harder
than it should be to sense the freshness, the intuition of his
finest work, the qualities that still give it life. It was a career
of internal conflict, and death has resolved nothing. Hemingway
will wrestle with himself, man and writer, for as long as the
language lives. &QL;

 '' Brett said. ``Obviously it's something, when you start playing,
it's a dream that someday you'll make it, but you really don't
think that dream will come true.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 21 years, American League pitchers tried in vain to find a
weakness in Brett. Finally, six seasons after his retirement, one
is revealed. Brett is too modest.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it can give a modern-day player pause to realize that
he is about to join the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Hank Aaron
and Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that Brett deserves a place in the Hall,
if not a separate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, who spent his entire career playing for the Kansas City
Royals, finished with 3,154 hits, 13th all-time. He had 665
doubles, fifth in the history of the game. He hit .305 for his
career, and had 11 seasons of better than .300. He hit 20 or more
homers in eight seasons, including 30 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He flirted with .400 for most of the 1980 season before
finishing at .390. It was the highest since Ted Williams batted
.406 in 1941 and has been topped just once since, by Tony Gwynn's
.394 average in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was the best hitter I ever played with,'' said former
Rangers catcher Jim Sundberg, who spent two of his 16 seasons as
Brett's teammate in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think there was a lot of natural ability. He worked
pretty hard. But he didn't see himself as clear as it really was.
He had a great swing.''
No one-hit wonder Ah, yes, the swing that launched a thousand
accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could roll out of bed on Christmas morning and
hit a line drive,'' said John Schuerholz, former Royals and current
Braves general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could get good wood on an aspirin,'' former
Royals manager Jim Frey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said that about Brett during his three seasons in the
minors after the Royals drafted him _ as a shortstop _ in the
second round in 1971. He wasn't a slouch, hitting .291, .274 and
then .284 at Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   But when he made it to the majors, he adopted the distinctive
style of batting guru Charlie Lau, hitting off his front foot with
the high, one-handed follow through.
</P>
<P>
   Brett said he expects to tear up when talking about Lau during
his induction speech, and with good reason. The two men were close,
and Brett credits Lau for turning him into a great hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lau's tutelage, Brett hit over .300 for the first time as
a pro in 1975. He then proceeded to do it as regularly as Nolan
Ryan won strikeout crowns. Brett batted over .300 in nine of the
next 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Brett won batting crowns in 1976, with a .333 average, and with
the .390 average in 1980. He ``slumped'' in the last half of the
1980s, although most players would take his averages of .290, .290,
.306 and .282.
</P>
<P>
   He rebounded with a league-leading .329 in 1990, becoming the
first player to win batting titles in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the best player right there,'' Yount said. ``To me, he
was the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a knack for driving in runs. Juan Gonzalez has made
knocking in more runs than games played almost routine, but no one
had done it since Joe DiMaggio in 1948 when Brett drove in 118 in
117 games in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Brett finished with 1,595 runs batted in, tied for 22nd with
Mike Schmidt, but Brett didn't have the raw power of his fellow
Hall of Fame third baseman. Brett hit his share of balls over the
fence, but his strength was line drives that found gaps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Brett's 212 hits included 42 doubles, 20 triples and 23
homers. Only four other players had put together 20-20-20 seasons
before that.
</P>
<P>
   The individual numbers _ which include three seasons of leading
the league in hits and triples, something only Ty Cobb accomplished
before or since _ are remarkable. They are why Brett was elected
with 98.19 percent of the vote, the fourth highest percentage ever
behind Tom Seaver (98.84), fellow '99 inductee Ryan (98.79) and
Cobb (98.23).
Mr. Postseason However, Brett was first and foremost a team player.
His grandest memory isn't of the .390 season, or the 1980 American
League Most Valuable Player award. It's of winning the World Series
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing on the mound and hugging Bret Saberhagen after an
11-0 defeat of the St. Louis Cardinals to win our first world
championship ... I can wear this ring proudly and say I was a world
champion,'' he said. ``It's the one thing I shared with 24 guys,
from April to October, in the grind of the season every day. That
was an extraordinary bunch of guys. It wasn't one of the better
teams I played on, but it was one of the closest-knit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett was the hero of the '85 postseason, batting .348 with
three homers in the American League Championship Series against the
Toronto Blue Jays and .373 in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing new, though. The Royals won the AL West six
times during Brett's career, and he excelled in the playoffs almost
every time. He holds ALCS records for highest slugging percentage
(.728), triples (4), home runs (9), extra-base hits (18), and total
bases (75).
</P>
<P>
   ``He had this knack of focusing when the pressure was on,''
former teammate Jamie Quirk told the ``Kansas City Star''. ``He had
this amazing concentration. The rest of us, we have a thousand
things going on in our mind. We think about the situation or the
pressure, we think about our swing or we guess what pitch is coming
or whatever. George just saw the ball. That was it. Everything else
was gone. That's what made him great, I think. The rest of us saw
shadows. George saw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest postseason hit came in 1980, in the ALCS against the
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had beaten the Royals the previous three years,
despite averages of .400, .300 and .389 by Brett. He hit just .273
with three hits in '80, but the final hit was a three-run homer off
closer Goose Gossage that put Kansas City into the World Series for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1980, finally winning, for us it was like winning the World
Series,'' Brett said.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't come until five years later; the Royals lost to
the Philadelphia Phillies in '80.
</P>
<P>
   In between World Series appearances, Brett had his most infamous
moment, the ``Pine Tar'' game.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run in a regular-season game against the Yankees,
but New York manager Billy Martin protested that the pine tar on
the bat extended too far up the barrel. The umpires agreed, and the
homer was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting image is of Brett charging toward the ump, a crazed
look on his face, seemingly intent on doing bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time it wasn't funny,'' said Brett, who later had the
home run restored when the league office ruled that Martin should
have protested before Brett used the bat. ``But now my oldest son,
Jackson, says, `Dad, let's put in that tape where you go berserk.'
So we fast-forward to that point in the tape and I have to explain
to him that's not the type of behavior I expect from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Brett and his son watch the tape, perhaps they
should fast-forward to the spot where Brett hits the home run and
stop there.
</P>
<P>
   It was that swing, that churned out line drive after line drive,
that got Brett into the Hall of Fame. nn

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a move that would represent a major break in
the solidarity of the gun industry, two major gun makers are
negotiating with New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, over a
lawsuit that Spitzer plans to file against gun manufacturers,
according to people involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has repeatedly accused the gun industry of irresponsible
marketing that has allowed firearms to fall into the hands of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations center on whether the gun maker will agree to
several far-reaching concessions, including better supervision of
how its guns are marketed and sold, according to participants in
the talks. In exchange, Spitzer would agree to exclude the
companies from the lawsuit, the participants said. The talks
involve Colt's Manufacturing of West Hartford, Conn., one of the
nation's oldest and best-known gun makers, and a second company
that was not identified, according to the participants.
</P>
<P>
   New York would be the first state to sue gun manufacturers, but
23 cities and counties have already done so.
</P>
<P>
   If either of the gun companies agrees to the demands, it would
be the first time a gun maker has made a concession to gun control
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   A voluntary settlement by Colt or the other company could act in
much the same way as the agreement by Liggett Group, a tobacco
company that broke ranks and reached a settlement in suits filed by
the state attorneys general against the tobacco industry. It was a
major breakthrough that shattered decades of unanimous resistance
by cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's negotiations, if successful, could also result in a
national model for other state and local governments in pursuing
gun makers, wholesalers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   In another move with significant implications, people close to
the talks said that Spitzer has also begun secret discussions with
Robert Delfay, the president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the largest gun industry trade association, which has
close ties to the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, a rival trade organization, the American
Shooting Sports Council was abolished, and its two chief officers
lost their jobs after reports that they were meeting with a lawyer
for several of the cities that have filed suit. The ouster was
orchestrated by the NRA and hard-liners in the industry who opposed
making concessions to settle the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions between Spitzer and Delfay involve establishing
what one person knowledgeable about the negotiations described as
``a code of conduct'' for the gun industry. The talks with Delfay
appear to focus on how to make companies more responsible in their
marketing and distribution of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer declined to comment on the issue in an interview Tuesday
afternoon, saying that he could not discuss any matter that might
be the subject of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's focus on trying to make the gun industry more
responsible for how guns are sold grows out of a new understanding
by law enforcement officials that a large number of criminals are
able to buy guns from corrupt firearms dealers or gun traffickers
buying on their behalf. Data compiled by the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has found that more than half of all
guns used in crimes that can be traced to their point of sale were
sold by less than 1 percent of licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers have long maintained that they have no knowledge of
what happens to their products after they leave the factory because
they sell only to distributors, or wholesalers, who in turn sell to
individual dealers, like gun shops or sports stores. But gun
control advocates and some law enforcement officials have become
increasingly skeptical of this claim as the firearms agency has
begun tracing more and more crime guns in the past five years and
found that certain brands move very quickly from manufacture to use
in crime, often in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately, executives at several handgun manufacturing
companies have said they would like to find ways to monitor their
sales better, but such steps could also lead to their being more
vulnerable to lawsuits. People close to Spitzer say that he would
prefer to avoid protracted and costly litigation with the gun
industry in favor of a quick settlement that would ultimately keep
guns out of the hands of criminals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the discussions say that Spitzer has given
Colt until Wednesday to respond to his demands, but company
officials have asked for an extension of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Colt executives have said they are prepared to get out of the
consumer handgun business if it cannot be made profitable. They
have focused much of their effort on expanding their military
small-arms business and on lobbying Washington for help financing
research on a smart gun, a new class of gun that can be fired only
by its owner.
</P>
<P>
   While the Colt name is prestigious, a New York banker, Donald
Zilkha, bought 85 percent of the company in 1994 for only $12
million, and in 1997, the last year for which numbers are
available, Colt earned only $2 million on $96 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Colt was one of several gun makers found liable for negligence
this year in a Brooklyn lawsuit on behalf of three people shot by
stolen guns.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between Spitzer and the gun makers has also
focused on other key areas, according to participants in the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has asked that gun makers participate in a new system in
which the companies would give the main federal firearms agency,
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, bullets that have been
fired during the testing of new guns. Each bullet has distinctive
grooves and other markings, which would identify the guns from
which they were fired. The agency has the technology to convert
these markings into a database of digital gun fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system would enable law enforcement officials to quickly
identify a gun when a bullet is recovered from a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has also asked that payments be made to a state panel
that provides monetary compensation to victims of crimes for any
losses they have suffered. It is not clear how much money Spitzer
is seeking for the panel, known as the Crime Victims Board, but
people involved in the talks say it is an important symbolic step.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Esposito, a consultant to Colt, said, ``We are not
opposed to any such talks,'' but added that Colt did not want to
discuss the terms in public.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview, Esposito indicated that before being
approached by Spitzer, Colt had already been trying to develop a
way to collect information on bullets test-fired from new guns and
provide it to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Esposito said, Colt was independently reviewing the
code of behavior for the distributors to whom it sells guns.
</P>
<P>
   Delfay said Tuesday that he could neither confirm nor deny that
he had met with Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, a rival trade organization, the American
Shooting Sports Council, was abolished, and its two chief officers
lost their jobs after reports that they were meeting with a lawyer
for several of the cities that had filed suit. Their ouster was
widely seen in the industry as a result of pressure by the NRA and
hard-liners in the industry who oppose making concessions to settle
the lawsuits.

ALBRIGHT TO DISCUSS TAIWAN WITH CHINESE OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-TAIWAN) 
(lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday
that when she meets in Singapore this weekend with China's foreign
minister, Tang Jiaxuan, she will make a direct appeal for a
peaceful resolution of the dispute with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for this situation to be settled by direct
dialogue,'' she said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton told reporters that in a
telephone conversation on Sunday with President Jiang Zemin of
China, he had said Washington would take ``very seriously any
abridgment of the peaceful dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has reacted to Taiwan's recent assertions that it is a
separate state by reiterating its longstanding vow that it would
use military force to prevent Taiwan from declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also said the United States is concerned by reports
that Chinese companies had transferred material to North Korea that
could be used as missile components. The reports were published
Tuesday in The Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do take all such reports seriously and we investigate them
thoroughly,'' she said. ``We have raised our concerns with China
and we'll continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials confirmed that the United States had
received intelligence suggesting that equipment including
gyroscopes and accelerometers may have been provided to North Korea
by China recently, and that the material may be useful in making
missiles.

BIG BENCH BETTERING DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ There's a reason the Los Angeles Dodgers are
winning, and it extends beyond the starting pitching and the
regulars in the field. It's the bench brigade _ Craig Counsell,
Trenidad Hubbard and Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson has waited since opening day to
have an able-bodied bench, and for the past month he's had it,
though it's taken time for the roles to become visible.
</P>
<P>
   The bench is the fire of this club, bringing versatility and, in
the case of Hollandsworth and Counsell, left-handed bats. And it
especially helps that they can hit at the top of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier in the season when Eric Young played hurt, now
Johnson can put Counsell at second and bat him leadoff when Young
is ailing, which he was Tuesday with a still-sore right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have won eight of 10, and during that spurt
Hollandsworth (10 for 25), Hubbard (7 for 14) and Counsell (6 for
19) have combined to go 23 for 58 (.397) and score 19 runs. ``I've
got a backup for the first and second hole,'' Johnson said.
``That's what I've been trying to get to, to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' No. 2 spot in the order has been a black hole.
Second hitters entered the day batting .234 with a .293 on-base
percentage despite the second spot producing a .368 batting average
and a .442 on-base mark during the hot spell.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst is Counsell, usually a defensive replacement for
Young. However, the Dodgers have won five of the six games he's
started, and in those games he's hitting .296 and has scored seven
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like Wally Backman,'' Johnson said in reference to his
days managing the Mets. ``He's a foxhole guy. He would battle his
(butt) off and get his uniform dirty. You know if they were in a
foxhole, they wouldn't be sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Opening de ja vu: When Kevin Brown signed as a free agent in
December, the immediate talk was of a super showdown with Arizona
lefty Randy Johnson on opening day. It never materialized into the
pitcher's duel everyone thought it would be, but the two
high-profile free agents of last winter will meet again Sunday in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Johnson both pitched Tuesday and will do so again in
the finale of a three-game series at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   When they met opening day, neither was around by the time Raul
Mondesi hit a two-run homer in the 11th to win it for the Dodgers.
Brown allowed five runs in 52/3 innings. Randy Johnson allowed two
runs in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Searching for hope: The Dodgers are in their best stretch of
the season, but they remain in fourth place and were 7{ games back
of San Francisco before the Giants played Texas.
</P>
<P>
   However, this could be the best time for the Dodgers to make a
move. The Giants, who are 1-4 since the All-Star break,
traditionally have problems coming off the three-day hiatus. Last
season they went 3-12 after the break. In 1997, they were 6-11, in
1996 they were 6-10 and in 1995 they were 6-12.
</P>
<P>
   __ Offseason positioning: Seven weeks of spring training and 92
games of the regular season is enough to show Johnson what needs to
be done in the free-agent market or with trades after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are playing well now, but the delicate balance on
the club could be drastically altered if an injury occurs, since
they lack insurance at the minor-league level.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, our job in the offseason is to be set up so we're a
little more flexible in the system, so when there's injuries,
there's insurance in the system,'' Johnson said. ``Then we have
options.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CLEMENS IS LOOKING FOR HIS KEYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First came a bit on morning television with Regis and
Kathy, and then came the key to New York, New York. At City Hall on
Tuesday, it occurred to an appreciative David Cone that maybe this
glad-handing had all gone a bit too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelming to hear the mayor announce that July 20 is
David Cone Day,'' Mr. Perfect said. ``I was thinking, `There's got
to be something else more important going on in New York.'''
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, there was. Roger Clemens was pitching on
Tuesday night, searching again for his old, breathless form to
eradicate his more recent unconfident air.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have predicted that Clemens, on July 20, David Cone
Day, would need to silence the Montreal Expos' bats to keep those
heartless Yankee Stadium fans from booing him off the mound? With
the possible exception of Dave Stewart, no one.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stewart, the Toronto assistant general manager and
one-time Clemens tormentor, who had wondered out loud what Clemens
stood to gain by demanding a trade to a team that had in the
previous season won 125 games without him. ``He's great, a Hall of
Famer, but how much more can he add to the Yankees?'' Stewart said,
in Dunedin, Fla., the day David Wells showed up a bloated,
bummed-out Blue Jay.
</P>
<P>
   The dime-store psychology was that Clemens wanted to hop aboard
the gravy train, take the easy ride to his first championship ring.
The less cynical perspective, the one that the Yankees are selling
as Clemens struggles to find himself, is that he wanted into New
York so that he could step onto the sport's grandest stage, and
continue to be the dominant pitcher of his time. And he will be
again, before it's over.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees say the radar gun doesn't lie. ``His fastball is
still big-time, to me,'' Joe Torre said before Clemens went out to
test it against the Expos. So Torre said the explanation for the
4.98 ERA, for the inability to beat the Mets, is in the mechanics,
in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really wanted to come into Yankee Stadium and make his
mark,'' Cone said. ``It's bothering him that he hasn't done better,
really bothering him. But it's very difficult to come to New York
your first year.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially this year. The Yankees sprinted for all of 1998, took
everything from a regular season they could possibly take. Clemens
has brought his trademark game-day passion to a Yankee team that
appears to be driving monotonously toward the postseason, on cruise
control.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Torre and Cone talk about the Yankees' one
significant addition to this most decorated team, you get the idea
that Clemens has pressured himself to dance as fast as he can and
in the process has forgotten which foot comes first. The result is
that he's looked out of step in a room full of teammates who are
engaged in a waltz.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is 36, a certain Hall of Famer, and yet he goes to the
mound every fifth day, trying to convince people that those five Cy
Young awards on the resume were not fudged. This is apparently no
career point of immunity to the misplacement of know-how, or to the
loss of belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a humbling game made up of negative statistics,'' the
manager said. ``The thing is, the bar is set so high for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone added: ``He's always been a hyper guy. He's legendary for
his intensity, almost unapproachable on game day. You can tell how
much he wants to do well, how much he wants to be part of this
whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone couldn't help notice how Clemens planted himself on the top
step of the dugout on Sunday, and stayed there, as if not to jinx
the perfect game, right until the 27th out. How he was one of the
first Yankees out onto the field to reach, to lift him up by the
sleeve. Cone, also 36, understands how the great aging pitcher
straddles the line between where he has long been and where he must
inevitably go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You constantly have to prove yourself,'' Cone said. ``Each
start, each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone shocked everyone, including himself, by winning 20 last
year along the way to Yankee championship No. 24. Clemens won 20 in
Toronto, but those victories don't mean anything in New York. Wells
also pitches now to an ERA of almost five in Toronto, but Yankee
fans' only basis for comparison is 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the big games, the postseason, are going to define
his first year as a Yankee, should we make it,'' Cone said of
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will make it, one way or another. Clemens has, in
effect, a whole season to get the mind and body working together,
to find the key that unlocks 1999.

FIVE AMERICAN LEAGUE UMPIRES DON'T WANT TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>

 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The blue wall of solidarity that the umpire union
created a week ago is not so solid anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Five American League umpires have asked the league to rescind
the resignations they submitted last week, baseball officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig and the leagues declined to comment on
the development that threatened to expand in coming days as umpires
reconsidered the unexpected step they took last Wednesday when they
signed letters saying they were resigning effective Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, the head of the Major League Umpires
Association, did not return telephone calls seeking comment. But
when Bruce Froemming, an N.L. umpire and a member of the union's
board of directors, was asked whether the reversal by some umpires
was bad for the union's position, he said, ``Nothing is good when
you have people going in different directions.''
</P>
<P>
   The five A.L. umpires who changed their minds were identified as
Larry Barnett, Davey Phillips, Rocky Roe, Dale Scott and Jim Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Roe, in his 19th year as an A.L. umpire, said he rescinded his
resignation after consulting a lawyer friend in Detroit. ``After
the smoke cleared, you have the reality you've resigned,'' Roe said
before working a game in Toronto. ``I was told by my good personal
friend that it wasn't a good move.''
</P>
<P>
   Roe, 48 years old, acknowledged that others had rescinded their
resignations but wouldn't talk about them. ``Right now I'm kind of
hot property,'' he said. ``I'm not the only guy who's rescinded,
but I don't want to be the poster boy, so to speak. There are a lot
of issues and people who are unhappy with the stance.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the union position in staging the mass resignation.
Roe, however, declined to say why he joined the move initially. Roe
was one of 14 umpires who voted against Richie Phillips at a union
meeting last February when Phillips received a five-year contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett and Davey Phillips, in their 31st and 30th years,
respectively, are the two most senior A.L. umpires. Barnett, 54,
has accepted a buyout and is retiring at the end of the season.
Phillips, 55, hasn't worked in a month because of a back injury.
Both he and Barnett are crew chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 39, is in his 14th year, and Joyce, 43, is in his 11th
year.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has not announced a position on the
resignations and gave no indication on how the umpires' request to
rescind their resignations would be viewed. Officials plan to let
the evolving situation play out and see what other umpires do.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires initiated their mass resignation at a meeting in
Philadelphia last Wednesday. Richie Phillips said the umpires
initially wanted to strike, but their labor contract with the
leagues prohibits that action.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips said that all 57 umpires at the meeting signed
letters of resignation and that the next day he faxed 63 letters to
the league offices. One baseball official said 54 letters were
received.
</P>
<P>
   Nine union members did not attend the meeting and did not submit
resignations. The remaining two members of the 68-man umpiring
crew, Derryl Cousins and John Shulock, are not union members; they
were replacement umpires during the 1979 umpires strike.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball official said two N.L. umpires, Greg Bonin and Mark
Hirschbeck, were among the umpires who did not submit resignations,
leaving 34 N.L. umpires who did. With the five defections, the A.L.
resignation contingent dropped to 15 of the league's 32 umpires.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If umpires seek a second opinion, as Roe did with his friend in
Detroit, they may reconsider a contention that Richie Phillips was
said to have made at their Philadelphia meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials were told that Richie Phillips told the
umpires that baseball had a list of 20 umpires who had been singled
out for dismissal after the season. But officials, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, denied that any such list exists.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has had a group of six former minor league
umpires evaluating minor league umpires to determine the best 25
who will be assigned to work in the Arizona Fall League later this
year. Baseball is also seeking umpires to replace three or four who
are retiring from the American League staff and for a possible
seven new positions in the majors next season.
</P>
<P>
   With the commissioner's office planning to centralize umpires in
that office beginning next season, officials are thinking of using
five-man crews instead of the current four-man crews. Each umpire
in a crew would have a week off every fifth week.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, however, has suspected that minor league
umpires are being evaluated to find replacements for umpires who
will be fired. &QL;

CSUN PICKED TO FINISH NEXT TO LAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ Before the vote they said all the right things
about Cal State Northridge. But when the Big Sky Conference
football coaches' poll was released Tuesday afternoon, it was
obvious what the coaches said and what they really felt were two
different things.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were picked to finish eighth in the nine-team
conference, one day after several coaches said they thought CSUN
would have been a team picked among the top three or four.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go by what's on a piece of paper,'' said Terrance
Johnson, the team's administrator-in-charge since CSUN head coach
Ron Ponciano was fired last Friday. ``We know what our guys are
capable of doing. The events that have taken place, that's the way
(the coaches) see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll placed Montana first and Northern Arizona second. CSUN
returns 14 starters from a team that went 7-4 last year, 5-3 in the
Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Washington, which returns 19 starters, was picked to
finish third by the coaches. The rest of the order: Portland State,
Montana State, Sacramento State, Weber State, CSUN and Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   The media poll was similar to the coaches'. The order: Montana,
Northern Arizona, Eastern Washington, Montana State, Portland
State, Sacramento State, CSUN, Weber State and Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   __ He's interested: Johnson, who has been on staff for two
years, said he considers himself a candidate to become the interim
head coach for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   He described Ponciano's firing as ``devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at (Ponciano) as my mentor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ The new rules: Doug Toole, the Big Sky's first-year
coordinator of football officials, went over rule changes for the
upcoming season Monday _ and two seem to have CSUN in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Toole said a team will be charged a full timeout if a player
doesn't have his jersey tucked in or is wearing a visible bandana
on the field. That doesn't mean a player can't wear a bandana, but
if he takes his helmet off on the field with it showing, the team
would be charged.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN senior defensive back Chazz Moore often wore his uniform
top out last season. Many Matadors wore bandanas.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT APPROVES TRASH HAULERS' MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department gave its approval Tuesday to one of the
largest mergers in the trash-hauling business on the condition that
the combining companies, Allied Waste Industries and
Browning-Ferris Industries, sell operations in 18 metropolitan
areas in 13 states, from Massachusetts to California.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will create a trash-hauling giant with revenues of
about $6.4 billion, second only to the industry leader, Waste
Management Inc., which had 1998 revenues of $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When the merger, a leveraged takeover for $7.3 billion in cash,
was announced in early March, analysts raised concerns about
whether Allied Waste would be able to complete the financing and
whether the Justice Department would object.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the agreement with Allied on selling operations in
Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit, Oakland, Calif., and
other cities, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge
of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said, ``Without
these divestitures, consumers in these 18 areas would have lost a
significant competitive alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied does business in about 28 states, Browning-Ferris in
about 40, the Justice Department said. The companies collect
garbage from residential and commercial customers, competing
directly in many places.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Van Weelden, the chief executive of Allied, said in a
statement, ``We are pleased'' to have reached agreement with the
Justice Department. Making clear that he, like the analysts, had
anticipated a divestiture, Van Weelden added that the sale of
operations with revenues of about $197 million, was ``well within
our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Varoli, an analyst for Merger Insight and one of those who
had suggested that financing the deal might be difficult, said that
according to Allied documents, the company expected to borrow $5
billion from banks and raise $3 billion by issuing bonds and
preferred stock. The company said in its statement Tuesday that it
expected to close the deal on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Ms. Varoli said, ``they feel they will be able to
get the financing they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the operations that are to be sold, the Justice Department
said, are landfills and incinerators, transfer stations where
garbage is dumped and then taken elsewhere, trucks, containers and
garages.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said the sale of the facilities ``could
well surpass'' the $500 million that Waste Management received when
it was forced to make a divestiture after its purchase of USA Waste
in 1998. Previously that had been the largest divestiture in the
industry.

ONE PILOT'S OPINION ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED ON KENNEDY FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LEE J. GUITTAR  
 SPECIAL TO THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEHAMPTON, N.Y. _ Moments after early reports of John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s missing single-engine airplane hit the television
airwaves, I began getting telephone calls from friends, relatives
and former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   They all knew that, for seven years, I had commuted summer
weekends from New York City to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., piloting a
single-engine airplane. They wanted my take on what might have
happened to Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   My route on those flights was from Teterboro, N.J., to the
Vineyard, under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) as JFK Jr., did Friday
night, I flew essentially the same route, hugging the Connecticut
and Rhode Island coastlines and keeping the over-water segment to
the Martha's Vineyard Airport as short as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, my flight instructor on the Vineyard was Arthur
Marx, who was one of JFK Jr.'s, flight instructors. Marx is a
splendid instructor; the best I ever had. There is every reason to
believe then that JFK Jr., was a well-coached pilot.
</P>
<P>
   I told my callers that even though I have an Instrument Flight
Rating (IFR), (a difficult rating for a private pilot to acquire,
demanding completion of a rigorous written exam and in-flight
performance test), I have never flown the route at night. My reason
is simple: I don't consider it the safest thing to fly a
single-engine airplane when I cannot see the surface beneath me.
</P>
<P>
   I fly a Cessna-172, a plane that is simpler and slower than JFK
Jr.'s Saratoga. I know that the odds of losing an engine, or
encountering some other emergency that would call for an immediate
landing, are slim. Yet, if an emergency occurs in daylight, I also
know that with my airplane's ``stall'' speed of about 45 miles per
hour, I should be able to find some level ground that would give me
an excellent chance to walk away from a forced landing.
</P>
<P>
   After dark, all I could do would be to trim the plane for its
best glide speed and hope that it would find a reasonably
appropriate site. I just don't like the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my fellow pilots would conclude that I am much too
conservative. Some say that flying at night is the best because the
ground lights are beautiful and the air is generally smoother. So,
when JFK Jr., elected to make the trip to the Vineyard, he was not
doing anything that most pilots would consider all that risky.
</P>
<P>
   I am puzzled why he did not ask an FAA flight controller for
``flight following,'' a voluntary program under which the
controller assigns the airplane a specific radar ``squawk,'' tracks
the airplane, and keeps the pilot informed of nearby traffic. It is
a practice most pilots consider helpful even in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   There is an on-going debate about whether an instrument rating
should be required for every pilot who flies at night, and I think
it makes a lot of sense. And, if weather conditions deteriorate, as
the visibility seems to have done Friday night, the rated pilot can
easily contact an FAA flight controller, file an IFR flight plan
from the air, and ask for vectors to the airport. It seems like
good insurance to me.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my callers wanted me to speculate on what I thought may
have happened inside Kennedy's airplane that would cause it to go
down. I said we don't know and probably never will. But I told them
that when I heard the news that FAA radar had the plane descending
at 4,700 feet per minute, I knew the Saratoga was in a steep dive,
and probably accelerating as it passed through the 1,100-foot
level, at which FAA's radar had last contact.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it was in a spin, corkscrewing toward the sea, it
is doubtful JFK Jr., had enough altitude to pull out of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some speculation that JFK Jr., was attempting to
turn the plane, and having lost his visual horizon in the haze and
darkness, overbanked the plane and put it into a spin. That's a
possibility, but since he was still over water some 15 miles from
the airport, there was little need for much maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   From that distance out, he should have been calling the airport
tower to report his position and that he was ``inbound'' and had
listened to the Martha's Vineyard automated weather report. The
tower would then provide instructions (``Left downwind, Runway
24,'' for example), and the pilot would require only a gentle turn
to put himself on course to enter the landing pattern.
</P>
<P>
   A better guess, I think, is that when he found himself in the
haze and darkness, he became disoriented. His body sent him
erroneous signals. He responded to those signals with incorrect
control inputs, making the situation worse. Understandably, he
probably froze at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   My callers had trouble with that scenario. How, they asked,
could anyone not know whether he was going up or down? Or right or
left?
</P>
<P>
   I told them that the technical explanation had to do with canals
in the inner ear that I couldn't explain in great detail. I
explained that in my early instrument training, I could remember
many instances when I thought the plane was straight-and-level,
only to have my instructor thump his finger on the altitude
indicator, or artificial horizon, which showed me to be flying a
20-degree bank. Or, when I might fixate on nailing a directional
heading, I had to be reminded that I was unintentionally descending
at 700 to 800 feet a minute!
</P>
<P>
   One caller asked, ``I can understand some disorientation, but if
you're going down at 4,700-feet-a-minute, how can you not know
you're going down?'' My guess is that they knew they were going
down, but the pilot's mind was providing little constructive input
to help out.
</P>
<P>
   My take on the tragedy is this. It was a horrible accident. It
was not a death-defying decision to make the flight. It was a
mistake not to request ``flight following'' from the FAA. We may
find it was equipment failure, but I doubt it. Unless the wings
fell off the Saratoga, there's little to cause it to descend at
4,700-feet-a-minute.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, JFK Jr. inadvertently got into an unusual situation
beyond his experience and piloting skills. It is something every
pilot has to be wary of every time he or she flies an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the cautions we constantly emphasize to ourselves
sometimes are overcome by the extra jolt of confidence we all seem
to carry with us.
</P>
<P>
   Editor's note: Lee J. Guittar retired last year as editor and
publisher of the San Francisco Examiner. He has a private pilot
license for single and multiengine aircraft, and is instrument
rated.

LAST-MINUTE SLIP ADDS TO ANGELS SLIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was symbolic of the Anaheim Angels' season,
a season that is quickly slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Angels reliever Mark Petkovsek had the ball slip out of his hand
on a fake pickoff attempt, allowing Carlos Baerga to score in the
ninth inning of the Padres' 2-1 victory before 35,247 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' fifth loss in a row and their sixth in seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek, who has been one of the Angels' best pitchers this
season, was set to face Quilvio Veras with runners on first and
third and one out in the ninth of a 1-1 game.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek was attempting the fake-to-third, throw-to-first
pickoff move. But when he faked to third, the ball came out of his
hand and bounced toward the Angels' on-deck circle on the
third-base side.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Jeff Huson scrambled to retrieve the ball and
threw home, but it was too late to get Baerga and prevent the
Padres from completing the three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``After nine innings like that and then a play like that decides
the game, it leaves you shaking your head,'' Petkovsek (9-3) said.
``It was more arm action than sweat (that caused the ball to slip
out). A couple of guys have tried the move this year and it's
worked. I was trying to steal an out, but it backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn, who was on-deck when the play
took place: ``I said to myself, `Did I really see what I just saw?'
I've never seen that before.''
</P>
<P>
   What made the loss even tougher for the Angels was that it
spoiled Chuck Finley's best start in weeks. Finley shut out the
Padres for seven innings before yielding a run in the eighth on
Eric Owens' two-out RBI double. Finley gave up one run and three
hits in 72/3 innings, striking out six and walking five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he wanted that game bad,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said of Finley. ``He always competes great, but he wanted this game
bad and he deserved to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's previous five starts represented the worst stretch of
his career. In those games he allowed 32 earned runs in 22 innings.
But it all came together for him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Finley said when asked to explain the
turnaround. ``I was just trying to do the same things as in the
last couple starts. It worked out this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference was that Finley had all three of his
pitches _ fastball, curveball, forkball _ working, so he was able
to use all three and keep the hitters off balance all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to use them all right away and not wait until the
second time around in the lineup,'' Finley said. ``And I tried to
mix them up.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance didn't result in a win because of the botched
pickoff attempt and the lifeless offense. But Finley said the team
can't waste time feeling sorry for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to walk out there, throw a quarter in the well
and wish good things,'' he said. ``We've got to do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start doing it would be on the offensive end.
They've scored nine runs during their five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored their only run when Darin Erstad hit Padres
starter Andy Ashby's first pitch of the game into the right-field
bleachers for his eighth homer of the season. After that, the
Angels got nothing. Ashby (9-4) gave up one run and five hits in
eight innings and Trevor Hoffman (25th save) pitched the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't been able to push across runs,'' Angels
shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``Two-out hits, sustaining rallies .
. . we haven't been doing it. You can't come out here in the
American League and score two runs a game.

B.C. PREMIER CLARK UNDER PRESSURE FROM MINISTERS TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying it is time for ``a new style of leadership,'' influential
senior Cabinet ministers have launched a drive to force
controversial, confrontational British Columbia Premier Glen Clark
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Clark told a Vancouver news conference on Tuesday that he
intends to stay on, but two Cabinet ministers have resigned and
influential Attorney General Ujjal Dosanj is expected to quit after
he returns late this week from a trip to Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The public crisis follows a stormy closed-door session last
week, in which provincial legislators of Clark's left-leaning New
Democratic Party challenged the premier's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premier agreed that his style needed to change in order
for us to be able to govern,'' said an internal memo prepared after
the meeting of the 40-member caucus, which includes the entire
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he can change to be more inclusive, to listen, to
limit the battles he takes on, to let his ministers lead without
taking over their proper functions, and to offer a real
plan/vision/message for gaining back the public's confidence,'' it
added. ``If he cannot make those changes, he will make the decision
to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   But senior figures in the party want Clark to go _ now. The New
Democrats were supported by just 16 percent of those surveyed in a
recent poll. The poll figures indicate the party is in danger of
being wiped out in the next provincial election.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has plummeted in popularity, both with the public and
fellow politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers raided the
premier's Vancouver home, apparently seeking evidence of possible
bribery in a friend's application for a casino license.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for two new hydrofoil ferries, a pet Clark project,
has nearly doubled. The B.C. Ferry Corp. recently disclosed that
its debts total more than $1 billion (Canadian) and substantially
exceed its assets.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was bypassed by U.S. and Canadian government officials,
and by Northwest governors, in the recent negotiation of a new
long-term U.S.-Canada salmon treaty. The premier once offered to
pay the legal fees of British Columbia fishermen who in 1997
blockaded the Alaska ferry ``Malaspina'' for four days in the
harbor at Prince Rupert.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke was one of those put off by Clark's
militance during the salmon treaty negotiations. At one point, the
premier moved to bar U.S. Navy ships from using a torpedo testing
range on the Strait of Georgia, as retaliation against alleged
American overfishing. The Canadian government stopped Clark by
moving to expropriate the testing range from provincial ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with unending scandals and controversies _ and plummeting
poll numbers _ senior New Democrats began to plan several weeks ago
to force Clark to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Dissent has since spiraled. The province's finance minister, Joy
MacPhail, resigned last week. So did Graeme Bowbrick, a legislator
who served as Clark's parliamentary secretary in the B.C.
Legislature. Women's equality minister Susan Hammell tendered her
resignation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 20 former Cabinet ministers and legislators, all
stalwart New Democrats, sent a letter to Clark predicting disaster
if he leads the party into another election.
</P>
<P>
   Others calling for new leadership include agriculture minister
Corky Evans and environment minister Cathy McGregor, repeatedly
upstaged and preempted by Clark on major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But the key players have been three Cabinet ministers thought to
be in line to succeed Clark.
</P>
<P>
   MacPhail is a former chief economist with the B.C. Labor
Federation, who reportedly was overruled when she tried to limit
the deficit in the latest provincial budget. Dosanj is a prominent
Indo-Canadian lawyer who has repeatedly rebuffed political
interference in the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The third Cabinet minister is Gordon Wilson, a former opposition
politician who joined the New Democrats only five months ago. He
was hastily appointed finance minister last week after MacPhail
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has reportedly agreed that Clark must go, but argued that
no date should be imposed upon the premier.
</P>
<P>
   Under Canada's parliamentary-style government, the New Democrats
can name a new premier and go on governing if Clark resigns. They
hold 40 seats in the 75-member B.C. Legislature. The party has
until April of 2001 to call a provincial election.
</P>
<P>
   Clark insisted Tuesdsay that he will carry on, and that his
critics are a minority. ``When you're not popular and you've got
these economic challenges, these divisions on direction, these
strains start to show and that's what we're seeing,'' he told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The premier is reportedly planning to shuffle his Cabinet to
reward those who have stayed loyal.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be too late. ``It's time for a new style of
leadership,'' said the memo out of last week's contentious meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Former B.C. agriculture and tourism minister Bill Barlee put it
more bluntly when asked when Clark should resign. ``Yesterday,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Toronto's sweep deepens Atlanta's slide to 4
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Braves only wished that puff of smoke swirling
high above the turf in the sixth inning at SkyDome on Tuesday night
was announcing their disappearance. No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke was a remnant of celebratory fireworks after another
Blue Jays grand slam, this one by Darrin Fletcher to spark an 11-6
Toronto win that completed a three-game sweep of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   A Shawn Green grand slam had fueled the Blue Jays'
come-from-behind win Monday night. Fletcher's shot did the same for
the Jays on Tuesday. He broke a 5-5 tie in the sixth inning by
pulling a two-out, two-strike pitch from left-handed reliever Mike
Remlinger into the Braves' bullpen in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger might wish he were still back there, after following
Tom Glavine to the mound and giving him no relief. With the score
tied and runners at first and second, Remlinger recorded one out
before giving up three hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves bid adieu to interleague play, the American League
and Toronto bitterly as their interleague record for the season
fell to 9-9. Their losing streak has grown to four, matching their
longest of the season, going into a two-game series against the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   With Odalis Perez, Kevin Millwood and Bruce Chen coming up empty
over the previous three games, the Braves had turned to Glavine for
a little reassurance and a win.
</P>
<P>
   What he and the Braves found was more American League trouble.
The Blue Jays patiently awaited their chances against Glavine and
jumped on him for two runs in the first, two in the fifth, and then
batted around in the sixth for six runs, four on Fletcher's third
career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   With Keith Lockhart batting second in the order and Bret Boone
dropping to seventh, the Braves showed a little offensive life
early, spotting Glavine a 3-0 lead in the first inning on
consecutive hits off Chris Carpenter by Chipper Jones (single),
Brian Jordan (two-run double) and Javy Lopez (RBI double).
</P>
<P>
   But the Blue Jays weren't fazed, coming back with two runs off
Glavine in the bottom of the inning on three hits and a walk. They
got only one run out of a bases-loaded, one-out opportunity but
kept it close for the next four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using two-out hits by Tony Batista and Jose Cruz Jr. in
the sixth inning, the Blue Jays cut the lead to 5-4, before tying
it on a Carlos Delgado RBI single.

<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ John F. Kennedy Jr. turned sharply away from
Martha's Vineyard before his plane began plunging toward the sea,
federal investigators said Tuesday, leading several authorities on
aviation to conclude that he had become lost or disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came on the fourth day of a search for the
wrecked plane and the remains of Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette _ a search
that has generated many questions here and in Washington about the
use of federal resources in what could be a fruitless search. In
part, as a result of the new radar information, investigators
warned Tuesday night that they might never find any large pieces of
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Tuesday evening, Robert Pearce, who is leading the
investigation for the National Transportation Safety Board, said
radar records are filling in the harrowing details of the last
seven minutes of the flight as Kennedy, 38, and his 33-year-old
wife headed for a family wedding on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce said that Kennedy had been headed straight toward
Martha's Vineyard, about 34 miles out and traveling at 5,600 feet,
when the plane began to descend at about 700 feet a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The descent continued for about five minutes to 2,300 feet,
when the airplane was about 20 miles from the airport,'' Pearce
said. ``The airplane started a turn to the right and climbed back
to 2,600 feet. It remained at that altitude for about one minute on
a southeasterly heading. Thirty seconds into the maneuver, the
airplane started a turn to the right and descended at a rapid rate
of descent. The rate of descent may have been greater than 5,000
feet per minute. The last radar return was about 16 miles from the
airport and the altitude indicated 1,100 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Kennedy was headed away from the airport when
the plunge began. Pearce would not characterize the information
beyond saying that Kennedy had been on the right path before he
began turning. ``Anything from that would not go to Martha's
Vineyard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barr, the director of the Aviation Safety Program at the
University of Southern California, a leading training center for
accident investigators, said Kennedy apparently lost his way after
making the first turn, then went into a dive as he tried to right
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this getting yourself in a square corner, when you run
out of ideas and experience at the same time,'' said Barr, who was
a fighter pilot during the Vietnam War. ``He would have been
looking straight out at the dark ocean on a nearly moonless night.
He probably looked over his right shoulder for lights, then when he
started to sink, he would have been trying to get the nose back to
the horizon, get the wings level and find where he was, all at the
same time. Even for a good pilot, that could produce a death
spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts offered a similar assessment, while cautioning
that it may never be possible to know what happened in the cockpit.
Warren Morningstar, the director of media relations for the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said the scenario
``suggests that the pilot was disoriented.'' He said a pilot might
intentionally turn away from his destination to reduce altitude,
but he said Kennedy had been at about the right altitude for his
approach before he began the turns.
</P>
<P>
   The new information is based on an analysis in Washington of
radar data that is being collected from stations along Kennedy's
flight path, including stations in New Jersey, New York,
Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. So far all the records
reviewed have been on paper, and Pearce said an even more complete
picture might emerge as specialists delve into computerized records
that are being sent to them.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of searching, investigators said no debris has
been salvaged from the ocean floor; the small pieces that have been
found were floating or washed ashore. Pearce said most are interior
cabin pieces, and the largest piece found so far is a three-foot
section of overhead molding. Asked about the likelihood if finding
sizable pieces of wreckage, Pearce said, ``I'm sure you could draw
a conclusion based on the debris that we've been bringing in, which
is fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the search itself, several officials said Tuesday that
the effort was the first to retrieve an aircraft other than for
public safety. While salvages of crashed planes, even at sea, are
common, they are almost always paid for by insurance companies or
by families, according to aviation officials and salvors.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, a spokesman acknowledged the unusual nature
of the effort. ``We're taking some reasonable measures beyond what
we might normally do in this instance,'' said Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge
of air crash investigations, Lauren Peduzzi, a spokeswoman, said
that the board has in the past paid for salvage when the board had
an extraordinary reason to discover what happened.
</P>
<P>
   But aviation officials were clear in stating that they are not
undertaking this search because they expect to uncover a generic
flaw in Piper Saratogas of the type Kennedy was flying.
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary circumstances the government does nothing to
retrieve such wreckage. The Federal Aviation Administration
provides radar data to help find a wreck, and the Coast Guard will
control marine traffic while private parties pay for salvage.
Airplanes that crash, whether they are operated by private
individuals, corporations or airlines, are almost always salvaged
by the insurance company that covered them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An exception was TWA 800, the Boeing 747 that went down off the
south shore of Long Island three years ago. The airline and its
insurer declined to recover the wreckage, but the National
Transportation Safety Board said the plane had to be raised to
determine the cause of the explosion and to help improve public
safety in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy search is using many of the same ships.
</P>
<P>
   But James O'Dell III, a spokesman for the Coast Guard, said that
this was the first time he knew of that his agency had participated
in the salvage of a private plane.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in finding bodies poses an awkward dilemma as Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and other family members try to plan a
funeral or memorial service. The Kennedy family has not requested
that Kennedy be buried with his parents, at the eternal flame in
Arlington National Cemetery, a White House official said Tuesday
afternoon. ``We don't think they are going to ask,'' the official
added, citing informal contacts with members of the family. Because
Kennedy does not qualify for burial in the military cemetery,
interment there would require a presidential waiver.
</P>
<P>
   As the family waits in seclusion at Hyannis Port, two Navy
ships, two Coast Guard cutters and two research vessels from the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration are being
used in the effort to map the sea off of Martha's Vineyard, using
high-resolution sonar to detect objects with straight edges,
indicating they are manmade. Then 10 divers from the Massachusetts
State Police and 20 from the Navy use those maps to look for
wreckage. But many of the seemingly promising targets turn out to
be things like barrels or fishnets.

GIULIANI AND PATAKI PICK ADELPHI PRESIDENT TO HEAD CUNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have
selected Matthew Goldstein, the president of Adelphi University, as
their choice to be the next chancellor of the City University of
New York, they said in a joint statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With that backing, Goldstein's appointment is considered
virtually certain. The governor and the mayor exert strong
influence over CUNY's board of trustees, most of whom they named to
the board.
</P>
<P>
   As a City College alumnus, Goldstein, 57, would be the first
CUNY chancellor to have graduated from the university.
</P>
<P>
   A mathematical statistician who received his doctorate from the
University of Connecticut, Goldstein earned the respect of CUNY's
trustees in his role as president of Baruch College from 1991 to
1998. By narrowing Baruch's focus somewhat to the liberal arts,
business and public affairs, and by raising more than $50 million
in private donations, he helped make Baruch one of CUNY's most
selective campuses and gave it a growing national reputation among
business schools.
</P>
<P>
   The board is expected to approve Goldstein's appointment on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a first-rate administrator with a proven record of
improving one of the CUNY campuses,'' Ronald Marino, a trustee,
said. ``He has a true dedication to reforming the City University
system and still maintaining access to students.''
</P>
<P>
   The release issued by the governor and the mayor quoted
Goldstein as saying, ``This is a wonderful honor for me to return
to the university that provided me with the tools that launched my
career and opened my eyes to wider worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his long affiliation with CUNY, Goldstein had relished
the challenge of trying to rebuild Adelphi University after the New
York State Board of Regents dismissed most of its trustees for
mismanagement. Colleagues of Goldstein's said that he had been torn
over the decision about leaving Adelphi, which is in Garden City,
N.Y., on Long Island.

WOMAN WHO FLED GENITAL CUTTING ADAPTS TO NEW FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Adelaide Abankwah walked out of Wackenhut
Detention Center in Queens on Monday night, she was wearing the
same clothes that she had on more than two years ago when she was
arrested at Kennedy International Airport. But now they were
practically falling off her.
</P>
<P>
   Weight loss was only one of the trials Ms. Abankwah endured
during two and a half years of detention. She was arrested after
she tried to enter the country with a false passport, saying she
was fleeing her country, Ghana, so she would not have to undergo
ritual genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   During two years of hearings, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service repeatedly denied her requests for asylum, saying she had
not proved she would be mutilated if she returned to the African
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Manhattan supported her petition. Her release came as abruptly as
her detention had, her lawyer, Jonathan Rauchway, said. She was
told to pack her bags, and then she was put in a waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally left the center, she walked out to greet some
supporters who had made her case a cause celebre in recent months.
Then she was driven through the city, where she gaped at the tall
buildings, said Jessica Neuwirth, the president of Equality Now,
the group that campaigned for her release.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah, 29, was then taken to her new home in the Bronx.
She is to live there with Victoria Otumfuor, a minister from Ghana
who befriended her shortly after she was detained.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ms. Abankwah was in seclusion, resting and trying to
absorb her new world. ``In some ways, today is her first day in the
real America,'' Ms. Neuwirth said.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate agenda includes some medical treatment. Ms.
Neuwirth said that for the last three weeks, Ms. Abankwah had been
in pain because of a tooth needing root canal work, and would be
going to a dentist. She also has gynecological and digestive
ailments that need attention.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Abankwah is free, she must still await a final
decision on her asylum request by the Board of Immigration Appeals.
Both Rauchway and Ms. Neuwirth expressed optimism that the board
would not prevent Ms. Abankwah from remaining in the United States,
but they also said that they did not know when the board would
issue its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neuwirth said that Ms. Abankwah was still worried that she
would be sent back to Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   If she is not, her long-term plans include more schooling. In
detention, Ms. Abankwah learned English, which she can now read,
write and speak, but she had little beyond a primary school
education in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Neuwirth said it was likely that with time, a very
different personality would emerge from the one that Ms. Abankwah,
who was sometimes suicidal, showed in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neuwirth said such a transformation occurred with Fauziya
Kassindja, a woman from Togo who was given asylum in the United
States in 1996 based on her fear of having to undergo genital
cutting.

HASIDIC JEWS SAID TO BE COURIERS IN DRUG SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In their black hats, dark suits and side curls, the
stream of young Hasidic men flying home from Europe seemed unlikely
to raise the suspicions of U.S. Customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors say the sober young men were enlisted as
couriers in a huge operation to flood New York with the designer
drug MDMA, popularly called Ecstasy, for resale at high markups to
young people partying their nights away at clubs and ``rave''
dances.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, law-enforcement officials announced the indictment
of seven people suspected of running the operation, which the
officials said brought in more than 1 million MDMA pills into New
York and laundered millions of dollars in subsequent profits. None
of those indicted were couriers, but investigators said they
expected more arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments followed a 21-month investigation by an
organized crime and drug-enforcement task force. Officials said the
Ecstasy-smuggling operation was based in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, and also operated in Brooklyn and Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the indictments, Loretta E. Lynch, the new U.S.
attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said that Ecstasy
tablets were ``aggressively marketed to young adults and teen-agers
in the New York metropolitan area.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy is a synthetic drug similar to the stimulant
methamphetamine and the hallucinogen mescaline. It causes euphoria,
increased alertness and some psychedelic effects, which has made it
popular among young people.
</P>
<P>
   But Ecstasy can damage parts of the brain that are critical for
thought and memory, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins
University. Experimenting with squirrels, they found that four days
of exposure to the drug caused damage persisting six or seven years
later.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictments, young men, primarily from the
Hasidic communities in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and
Monsey were offered a free trip to Europe and about $1,500 in
return for smuggling back some contraband. Some were also offered
$200 for each new courier they recruited. The authorities said that
each courier smuggled as many as 45,000 Ecstasy tablets into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiters chose the couriers, whose exact number was not
given, believing that their religious dress and appearance would
not attract the attention of Customs inspectors. Some couriers were
reportedly told that they would be bringing back diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   But a news release issued by the U.S. attorney on the indictment
said, ``Although there were warning signs along the way that the
couriers were smuggling drugs, they generally closed their eyes to
these facts.''

LAWMAKERS TO RESURRECT QUICK DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lawmakers negotiating details of the state budget
have agreed to resurrect the Quick Draw video lottery game, and to
postpone the elimination of sales tax on clothing for three months,
legislators and aides to the governor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures will increase state revenues, bringing in $180
million during the fiscal year. Officials were quick to insist that
with the sales tax, at least, revenue was not a consideration. But
the moves underscored the odd spectacle of lawmakers scouring the
budget for sources of extra cash, at a time when the state has a
surplus of nearly $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gov. George Pataki also warned the Assembly and Senate
that if they went too far in cutting taxes or borrowing for capital
projects, the governor would withdraw his agreement to make sparing
use of his veto pen on the final budget bills.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority
leader, Joseph Bruno, agreed last week to the outlines of a $73
billion spending plan, with the Republican governor pledging not to
veto large portions of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   With that accord in hand, the Legislature began meeting Monday
in conference committees to hammer out the details, with final
passage expected as early as next week. The budget will be 112 days
overdue on Wednesday, the second-latest in state history.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal between the governor and the legislative leaders
said nothing about borrowing and tax cuts, which can be structured
so that they cost nothing in the current fiscal year but expand to
billions of dollars in future years.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno and Silver have said they will negotiate the tax cuts and
borrowing this week and reveal their conclusions on Friday. But
administration officials are already concerned about reports that
the Legislature plans to use these areas to make major new
commitments, borrowing to build roads and housing for the mentally
ill and cutting taxes for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything with major future-year implications would be a
violation of our agreement, and once that happens, there is no
agreement,'' said a top aide to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of Quick Draw, which is found in 3,200 bars,
restaurants and stores, concludes one of the oddest tales in this
year's budget. Pataki fought hard to implement the keno-style game
in 1995, and this year he proposed expanding it. The law that
created the game expired on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, a Democrat, refused to have the Assembly re-authorize
the game in March, letting the law die. The governor insisted that
he did not mind if the game died, but the Democrats have never
believed that, holding it as leverage in the overall budget fight.
People involved in budget negotiations say that it was Pataki who
urged that the game be revived, but in the end, the game mattered
to everyone, because the revenue will let them spend more.
</P>
<P>
   Quick Draw generates $120 million a year in profit for the
state. This fiscal year, $40 million of that has already been lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature and the governor decided last year, in part at
the urging of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, to eliminate the sales tax on
clothes, up to $110 per item, starting on Dec. 1 of this year. But
stores have complained that the timing of the change would be a
burden to them in the midst of their heaviest season. They also
worried that it would discourage people from shopping on the day
after Thanksgiving, traditionally the busiest shopping day.
</P>
<P>
   The stores had asked that the tax elimination be changed to Nov.
1. But instead, Silver, Bruno, a Republican, and the governor have
agreed to make it effective March 1 of next year, legislators and
aides to the three leaders said Tuesday. In the interim, they will
provide for two tax-free sales weeks for clothes, up to $500 per
item, in September and again in January.

DUVAL-WOODS IS SLATED TO LAST ONLY 3 HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Tiger Woods and David Duval meet in their match-play duel
on Aug. 2, they will not only be fighting for the $1.1 million
winner's prize.
</P>
<P>
   They will also be fighting for daylight in a rare prime-time
golf showcase.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of the matchup is obvious. They are the world's
top two players based on the current ranking, both in their 20s,
but they have shared no Jack-and-Arnie moments on a final Sunday,
one stroke apart, with the tournament on the line.
</P>
<P>
   It's natural to wonder who is better, even if the outcome of
their made-for-TV exhibition will decide nothing, at least not
officially.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disrespect to Davis Love, Ernie Els or Vijay Singh,'' said
Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent, ``but these two guys have been the
dominant forces in golf for two or three years. They're No. 1 and
No. 2 and well ahead of No. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   To justify the $1.5 million purse, and to appeal to a casual
audience bored with the reruns of the summer doldrums, it made no
sense to stage the match in any part of the day but prime time. The
only way to stage it from 8 to 11 p.m. for the Eastern time zone
was to start it out West in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther west the better,'' said Barry Frank, a senior vice
president of International Management Group. ``We talked to several
clubs. One club in Las Vegas was interested, but the sun sets 45
minutes earlier than we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   For sunsets, Hawaii would have been ideal, but it is too far
away.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherwood Country Club, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., the site of
the Shark Shootout, agreed to pay $1 million for the right to stage
the event, and in turn received the benefit of having its name
appear in the official title ``Showdown at Sherwood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been a fool to think this wouldn't be beneficial
for the club,'' said Alexandra Castenskiold, Sherwood's general
manager. Attendance will be limited to 3,000 fans, who will pay
$225 to $550 each.
</P>
<P>
   ABC Sports, whose new president, Howard Katz, was eager to make
a bold statement about his leadership, signed for about $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   When the event was announced in May, there was no hint of the
debate over whether Woods and Duval can complete all 18 holes from
5 to 8 p.m., Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   Can Woods and Duval finish a round, with no golfers ahead or
behind them, in three hours?
</P>
<P>
   Or should the telecast abide by the PGA Tour's insistence that 3
hours is too short, and a cushion must be created in case of a
playoff?
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour, which is sanctioning the event for a $1 million
fee, said match play needs from 3 hours 20 minutes to 3:40.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the competition end in a timely manner, we'll commence
at 4:30,'' said Henry Hughes, the Tour's chief of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the decision is up to ABC and the Tour, but hopes the
entire match can be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to decide until that day,'' Frank said. ``I want
to see how late it gets dark on Saturday and Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank believes Woods and Duval can finish in 3 hours, especially
because in match play, easy short putts are usually conceded and
the round can end early if one golfer is 4-up with three holes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Even if ABC does not show Duval and Woods on the first two
holes, viewers will see the end, in regulation, or a playoff, for
which the 17th and 18th holes will be lighted with stadium-type
lighting. Unlike regular Tour events, the players and the caddies
will wear microphones.
</P>
<P>
   This is very much an IMG event. Frank devised the match while
watching Woods putt during a tournament in the spring and mused
about the attraction of a Woods-Duval match. He did not have to
venture far to find them: Woods and Duval are IMG clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a `let's pick the best of IMG's players for an
event,''' Steinberg said. ``It was `let's pick the two best players
in the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said that Woods, who recently finished seventh at the
British Open, was quickly enamored of Frank's concept, and
ruminated about the merits of match play against stroke play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Match play intrigued him,'' Steinberg said, ``but you don't
talk Tiger into things. Usually we agree. He thought this was a
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval was more reluctant. ``He thought it would separate him and
Tiger from the rest of the Tour,'' said Charley Moore, Duval's
agent. ``David respects the guys. He doesn't want to be a
separatist guy. But at the end of the day, this is about
introducing golf to a new audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner is to receive $1.1 million, the loser $400,000. Each
golfer will donate $200,000 to charity, split between First Tee,
which introduces golf to minority-group members, and a charity of
each golfer's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of a one-on-one exhibition on an open Monday night
(the week before the final major, the PGA Championship, begins)
will not determine who is the world's best golfer _ at least the
organizers and the golfers insist it should not.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference announcing the match, Duval said, ``It's
not the U.S. Open or the Masters on a Sunday, going head to head.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said: ``We're not out to prove who's No. 1. To do that you
should play 20 matches.''
</P>
<P>
   But the match will invite speculation _ at least about who is
the best on Aug. 2 _ which should help ABC's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it's the kind of event that people will talk about in
the days leading up to it,'' Katz said, ``and in the days
afterward.''

PANEL WANTS FRESHMEN ELIGIBLE IN BASKETBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 27-member panel recommended to the NCAA Tuesday that freshmen
continue to be eligible to play basketball. But the college
presidents, athletic directors and the retired North Carolina coach
Dean Smith, who made up the panel, recommended that the NCAA
tighten the rules governing freshmen and also reward colleges that
have high graduation rates for basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators have been concerned over the fact that graduation
rates for male basketball players have dropped in recent years. The
latest figures, for players who entered college in the 1991-92
school year, show that only 44 percent of the 844 men involved
graduated within six years.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen have been eligible for NCAA sports since 1972. If the
panel's recommendations are adopted by the NCAA's executive
committee Aug. 5 and the board of directors in January, freshmen
will remain eligible if they complete 12 course hours and achieve a
grade point average of at least 2.0 in their first term. Freshmen
who do not qualify academically would still be allowed to receive
financial aid despite being ineligible to play.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Shaw, the Syracuse chancellor, headed the panel. He said
he favored making freshmen ineligible but added, ``We have had to
temper the enthusiasm of some with the realities of what we can
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel would create an athletic scholarship system based on
graduation rates. Men's basketball teams at schools with graduation
rates of 75 percent or higher would have 14 annual grants, those
with rates from 33 to 74 percent would have 13 grants, and those
below 33 percent would have 12 grants. In addition, a maximum of
four new grants could be given each year. Another recommendation
was intended to reduce midyear transfers. It would require all
transfer athletes, not just some, to sit out one year.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also recommended that starting with the 2000-1 season,
regular-season games could not begin until the day after
Thanksgiving and practice could not begin until 34 days before the
first game. In some cases, that would delay the start of practice
for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen and transfer students would be encouraged to enroll in
summer school before their first fall term, and if they took at
least six hours of classes they could receive financial aid for
that term. While that recommendation would apply only to
basketball, the panel said it would urge that it be adopted for all
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the panel recommended that all male basketball players
at Division I colleges attend programs that ``should address
sportsmanship and leadership, manners and etiquette, on- and
off-court behavior and public-speaking skills.''

McDOWELL GETS READY TO START 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Pitcher Jack McDowell is expected to be
activated from the disabled list this week in time to make his
first start of the season Friday in Baltimore against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell, who had surgery on his right shoulder Feb. 2, has made
three rehab starts, the last one coming last Thursday for Single-A
Lake Elsinore. He gave up seven runs and 11 hits in 71/3 innings
but pitched the last few innings throwing nothing but fastballs to
build up arm strength.
</P>
<P>
   If McDowell starts Friday, he would replace Mike Fyhrie in the
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Tim Belcher (broken pinky finger on right hand) threw in
the bullpen Tuesday but isn't expected back until early August.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Matt Luke (strained muscle in side) will begin taking
batting practice in the next few days and said he expects to join
the club in Tampa during the three-game series against the Devil
Rays July 26-28.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hill country: Manager Terry Collins' first order of business
Tuesday morning was to check on pitcher Ken Hill. Hill threw six
scoreless innings Monday night after being out since June 30 with
an inflamed right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's happy, he feels fine today,'' Collins said. ``We probably
did the right thing getting him out at the right time. We were
going to hold him to a pitch count of 90 and he was just six away
from that after the sixth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who is scheduled to make his next start Saturday in
Baltimore, said the arthritis and inflammation in the elbow will
always be an issue for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I'm going to have to deal with the rest of my
life, not only in the game,'' Hill said. ``Playing golf, playing
with my kids. . . . When I'm healthy, I feel confident. When I feel
good, I can pitch against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Off key?: The Angels begin a two-game series against the
first-place Rangers tonight and Collins is singing a different
tune. Normally, Collins says no game or series is any more
important than any other. However. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bigger than normal right now,'' he said. ``I know
we've got them at the end of the year (a three-game, season-ending
series), but these are big because we have a chance to pick up two
games. And right now, that's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Tony Gwynn's sixth-inning double was career
hit No. 2,983 for the Padres right fielder. . . . Since returning
to the lineup Saturday, Tim Salmon is 1 for 14 with four walks and
one RBI. . . . With Salmon hitting behind him in the past four
games, Mo Vaughn is 3 for 14 with four walks and two RBI.
