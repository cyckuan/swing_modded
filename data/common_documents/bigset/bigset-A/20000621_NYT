RUSSIAN PLAYWRIGHT GRIGORY GORIN DEAD AT 60 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Grigory Gorin, the Russian playwright, humorist and
screenwriter, died here on June 15. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, the Culture Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mikhail Bulgakov and Anton Chekhov, Gorin began his working
life as a doctor. In 1966 he and Arkady Arkanov wrote ``To All
Europe,'' a comedy that was so successful that Gorin gave up
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Gorin wrote many popular films, including ``The One and Only
Munchausen'' and ``Formula for Love.'' His longest collaboration
was with Mark Zakharov, director of the Lenkom Theater where most
of his plays _ including ``Requiem'' and ``Royal Games'' _ were
staged. When Gorin died he was working on his latest play, ``The
Jester Balakirev,'' set in the time of Peter the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Gorin _ whose real name was Grigory Ofshtein _
described the play. ``Toward the end of his life, the jester
understands that he has been a bad jester and his climb up the
social ladder hasn't happened,'' he said. ``He had been a cow herd,
and maybe that was his main accomplishment. The Czar Peter also
understands, toward the end, that the remaking of such a country is
no easy task, that maybe he had been wrong and his son Aleksei was
right. It should have been done slowly, gradually, without losing
moral purpose.''

DIGITAL ISLAND FORGES NETWORK TO DELIVER STREAMING AUDIO, VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares of Digital Island Inc. jumped 31 percen
Tuesday after the company said that it was working with Compaq
Computer, Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to create a network for
delivering real-time audio and video over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, called streaming and made popular by Real
Networks' Real Player, Apple Computer's QuickTime and Microsoft's
Windows Media Player, allows the distribution of full motion video
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, Intel and Microsoft said they would make a combined
equity investment of $45 million in Digital Island, which is based
here. Digital Island is the No. 2 provider, after Akamai
Technologies Inc., of Internet content delivery services, which
seek to speed Web pages by distributing the content from servers
closer to the user. Digital Island has focused on electronic
commerce; its e-Business Delivery Network offers hosting, network,
content delivery and application services. Akamai has not
specialized, instead going after the entire market.
</P>
<P>
   Both Digital Island and Akamai moved into streaming media
services earlier this year, when Digital Island acquired Live On
Line and Akamai bought Network24 Communications, both of which
provide streaming production services for corporate and
entertainment clients. Digital Island, Akamai and Intervu, which
has an alliance with Microsoft, want their streaming services to
become the foundation for Internet television, but competition will
be intense as AT&AMP;T, UUNet and Intel also enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Digital Island rose $10.6875 on Tuesday, to $45.1875
in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Island said it would roll out the network over the next
two years and that it would ultimately support up to 7.5 million
simultaneous media streams over the Internet. Digital Island has
committed to deploying 8,000 Compaq ProLiant servers with Intel
Pentium III microprocessor and running Windows Media Player.
Compaq's Financial Services unit will provide $50 million in
equipment lease financing to Digital Island and an additional $50
million in financing to qualified customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The target customer here is the enterprise or corporation that
wants to do real business using the Internet and sees the value of
a rich media experience in doing that,'' RuAnn Ernst, Digital
Island's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone
interview. ``That kind of rich media experience creates more
transactions, creates the decision to push the `buy button' and
that has been demonstrated with customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel's hosting service also offers streaming media,
Ernst said she saw no conflict. Howard High, an Intel spokesman,
said that while the two services competed on some fronts, they
could collaborate on others.

CBS PLANS TO KEEP PEOPLE INDOORS THIS SUMMER WITH `BIG BROTHER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIA KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Come July 5, the same San Fernando Valley that
gave the world ``The Brady Bunch'' could become home to yet another
pop culture icon.
</P>
<P>
   CBS showed off its custom-built ``Big Brother'' house in the
Studio City neighborhood on Tuesday, and executives are optimistic
it can attract the kind of voyeuristic audience that has made
``Survivor'' the television hit of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, everybody said the networks were guilty, and
rightly so, of not putting on original programming in the summer,''
CBS Television President Leslie Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's nothing more original than `Big Brother.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, the day before the first broadcast, while the rest of
the country is celebrating its independence, 10 strangers will
surrender theirs. Inside the ``house'' - a prefabricated structure
tossed up in under seven weeks - 140 producers and technicians will
monitor the contestants' every move and utterance with 28 cameras
and 60 microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Every blemish - the physical ones and the personality ones -
will be exposed for their housemates and the American audience to
judge.
</P>
<P>
   In the pursuit of cash awards and celebrity, they will give up
all contact with the outside world - no phones, no TV, no radio, no
newspapers, no mail - until they are voted out or quit the contest.
They could suffer intense stress from being constantly on guard or
humiliate themselves if they are too relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS isn't interested in making their stay particularly
inviting. The front yard of the house is a sea of bark chips
scattered across asphalt - no flowers or shrubs - but the
contestants won't see it again until they leave the show, one way
or another.
</P>
<P>
   Every other week, one of the contestants will be ejected from
the house during the broadcast, based on nominations from residents
and call-in votes from viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The last resident wins the tangible prize of $500,000 and the
less certain benefits of fame.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they can survive the 89-day stay inside the home
decorated in a riot of unpleasant colors - canary yellow, saturated
lavender, bright blue and, in one room, blood red - probably chosen
for their ability to keep participants lively or agitated as much
as to look good on camera.
</P>
<P>
   The furnishings, provided by Ikea, are spartan, mainly raw pine
tables, dressers and beds.
</P>
<P>
   Microphones dangle at regular intervals from the acoustic
ceilings, and cameras perched in the corners cover those zones not
visible from the dozens of lenses behind one-way windows
surrounding the 1,800-square-foot interior. There even is a camera
in the small toilet chamber - the only room with a door - both to
prevent ``secret meetings'' and to ensure the security of all the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   There is a courtyard in which they will grow vegetables and
gather eggs laid by seven Rhode Island reds, hand-wash and wring
their laundry, exercise with free weights, and get wet in a
4-foot-deep pool that measures 5 by 8 feet.
</P>
<P>
   There are two bedrooms, each arranged to sleep five, each
holding a bunk bed, three twins and one dresser.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which premieres July 5, will run 24 hours a day on
four Internet sites and five nights a week on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour program at 8 p.m. every Monday, Tuesday and Friday
will highlight the previous day's events of living in a one-way
fishbowl. Thursday will be a live hourlong discussion among family
members and psychologists, who will examine the give and take, the
romances and the friendships, the quarrels and grudges, and the
spirit of cooperation evident or lacking in the corps.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the previous week will be recapped with fresh
highlights from Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're enjoying our best summer in many, many years
because of ... `Survivor,' '' Moonves said. ``Survivor'' has
stranded a number of contestants on a Malaysian island to compete
for a $1 million prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when you add to that `Big Brother,' which we think could
be an even bigger event, you could see why we say to everybody this
is going to be CBS's most adventurous summer ever. And we are
indeed excited and nervous about putting on a project that is this
ambitious, this demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The contestant roster, which includes 10 alternates, is almost
set, but producers are keeping their identities secret until the
night of the first telecast. The idea, they say, is to ensure that
the inhabitants know nothing about each other until they meet on
the red carpet leading up to the front door. Moonves said only that
they range in age from their 20s to their 40s and ``there are no
professional entertainers in this group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' launched last year by John de Mol's Endemol
Entertainment in the Netherlands, has been a major hit in Europe,
with audiences growing with each new country's program. And in each
case, the 10 residents have become major celebrities. In Germany,
three of the participants recorded a CD together that has sold 3.5
million copies.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is almost guaranteed a hit with viewers and advertisers,
particularly in light of its smashing success with the tropical
island-based ``Survivor!''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves, who usually squirms uncomfortably or sometimes growls
to television reporters when discussing ratings, was almost giddy
Tuesday while reveling in ``Survivor'' mania, which delivered 12
percent more 18- to 49-year-old viewers last week than the other
five broadcast networks combined.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Big Brother'' is likely to be bashed by social
scientists and media pundits who see such voyeuristic broadcasts
and Webcasts as a societal ill, Moonves sees the show as a good
answer to the summer rerun doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it is voyeuristic TV and I don't necessarily think
it's bad,'' Moonves said. ``I think there is a desire to see this
kind of programming. I think people are interested in what other
people will do in this situation. They imagine themselves in this
situation ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And as I always say, there are 500 channels. You don't like
it, change the channel.''

POLICE CHIEF, MAYOR DEFEND RESPONSE TO POSTGAME MAYHEM
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; With Los Angeles' image once again tarnished,
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks and Mayor Richard Riordan defended
the handling of rioters outside Staples Center after the Lakers'
NBA championship victory.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an uproar over nationally televised scenes of police
cars and private vehicles torched and smashed and other mayhem,
Parks and Riordan insisted on Tuesday the Los Angeles Police
Department's failure to move into the swirling mob was prudent and
effective and prevented violence from escalating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there to protect life and to reduce and eliminate any
potential of harm to the people who attended that event,'' Parks
said. ``And although there was some property damage, we believe
that it was a successful event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only mistake was those who showed up not to celebrate, but
to create havoc and vandalism in their city. Life was the No. 1
priority and the safety of those attending also was a top
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor called the police response ``strategic and measured.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their disciplined restraint minimized any possible escalation
of violence,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``There is much to be learned from (Monday)
night's incident, so that we can do a better job of keeping our
city safe.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's 11 a.m. parade down Figueroa Street to Staples
Center, officials pledged ``zero tolerance'' for violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to stand for any law violation by any
person,'' said LAPD Capt. Stuart Maislin.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also offered assurance that their strategy to handle
what are expected to be thousands of protesters during Democratic
National Convention on Aug. 14-17 at Staples Center will maintain
peace and prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism came from many quarters. The Police Protective
League was harshly critical, saying many officers were horrified
and embarrassed at what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever tactical plan they put into effect, it failed,'' said
police union Vice President Dennis Zine. ``They didn't take action
at the appropriate time. They waited too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the LAPD's response at the start of the 1992 riots, he
added: ``I was looking (at TV) and saying, Where are the officers?
... In my mind, we were reliving Reginald Denny being beaten at
Florence and Normandy (avenues).''
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall on Tuesday, the council called upon Parks to
deliver an impromptu report on the events of the previous night.
Several members were critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the situation should have been allowed to
escalate to the extent that it did last night and the stain on the
city from those images will last indefinitely,'' said City
Councilman Mike Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   Added Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr.: ``What concerned me is that
the entire nation, and maybe across the world, saw individuals ...
running amok for approximately two hours after this event.''
</P>
<P>
   Some City Council members applauded the police response,
questioning only the failure of officers to cite people for
drinking beer and alcohol outside the arena where thousands watched
the game on a giant TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nick Pacheco, who was stuck in traffic trying to
leave the game, said the situation was different than it had seemed
on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no point did I feel threatened by anyone; they were
celebrating, primarily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nate Holden chastised council critics, saying they
would have blasted the LAPD if it had used force against the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be applauding the Police Department for a job well
done,'' he said. ``It's not what did happen, it's what could have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Business owners cleaning up the damage along the Figueroa
Corridor area worried about a recurrence during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   At Winston Tires on Olympic Boulevard, where crews replaced
numerous broken windows and smashed garage doors, manager Tony
Alfaro said: ``The police say they've got everything covered. But
if they have everything covered this time, why did this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the zero tolerance policy at Wednesday's parade
does not conflict with their statements defending the police
reaction Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the mayor and the police chief said that things
went as well as things could have gone under the circumstances,
that doesn't mean that one can't sit down and assess what could we
have done better so that we can learn from all of this,'' said
Deputy Mayor Manuel Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. Dave Kalish, the chief spokesman, added: ``Every time
we have an occurrence, we learn from it. Even though they are crowd
control issues, they are very different types of events.''
</P>
<P>
   At his morning press conference, Riordan set the tone of
defending the LAPD response while adding that lessons can be
learned and promising violence would not occur again.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said the violence and looting were confined to a
small area and were less serious than other cities have experienced
after national sports victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not fans. They are losers who only know how to trash
their city,'' Riordan said. ``We are not going to let a few
hoodlums ruin a glorious celebration for millions of Angelenos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 Tuesday to
authorize a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of those responsible for inciting the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What began as a tremendous victory on the basketball court
became a black eye for Los Angeles County as the result of
senseless, irresponsible behavior,'' Supervisor Michael D.
Antonovich said. ``There is no excuse for threatening people's
safety and damaging their property.''

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ A baby step here, a baby step there and the
Los Angeles Galaxy could be off and running again.
</P>
<P>
   The team ended a winless streak at four games with a 2-1 victory
over Tampa Bay on Saturday. It was a satisfying victory considering
that Mexican striker Luis Hernandez is without a point after five
MLS matches and Cobi Jones hasn't scored since April 15.
</P>
<P>
   The two franchise strikers are knocking on the door and
providing good chances for one another. But they need to find the
back of the net _ and fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created a number of dangerous opportunities,'' Galaxy coach
Sigi Schmid said. ``I thought the combinations of Luis, Cobi and
Mauricio (Cienfuegos) playing balls into them was a lot more
dangerous than it has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're starting to understand the system we're playing. Now,
it's just a matter of fine-tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   This would be a good time for Hernandez and Jones to get on
track as the Galaxy faces the two best teams in MLS this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, L.A. plays host to the Central Division-leading Chicago
Fire (9-7-1, 28 points) at the Rose Bowl, before challenging MLS
and Western Division leader Kansas City (10-2-3, 33 points) on
Saturday at Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Two victories and a Kansas City loss to Dallas tonight would
leave the Galaxy (7-3-6, 27 points) tied with the Wizards at the
end of the week. That would provide a big lift, considering the
team's 1-3-4 stretch before Saturday's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a victory in the U.S. Open Cup last week, so now we've
got two wins in a row and we're starting to score goals again,''
Schmid said. ``We still haven't scored off the flow of play, but
we're getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defender Danny Califf has been a nice surprise since
getting a chance when central defender Robin Fraser went down with
an ankle injury at the same time Jones and defender Greg Vanney
were called to the U.S. national team for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Califf scored his first MLS goal in Saturday's victory when he
finished a header off a Vanney cross. But he did his best work on
big Mutiny forward Mamadou Diallo (10 goals this season), as he
held the African striker scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Califf was named MLS player of the week for his performance and
will need a similar effort against the Fire, which boasts speedy
forwards Ante Razov and Josh Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny has always shown a very good ability at being able to
mark fast players, even though he's not a fast guy,'' Schmid said.
``When he marks a fast player, he concentrates better. As a result,
he's more focused in the game.'' &QL;

   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 21:
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials from Secretary Bill Richardson on
down have failed to provide adequate explanations for the
disappearance and mysterious reappearance of two computer hard
drives containing sensitive nuclear bomb information from the Los
Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory. More than a year after charges
that a Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee, removed and copied secret
nuclear weapons data brought the lab's lax security procedures to
national attention, management there remains shockingly
lackadaisical.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter oversight cannot come soon enough. Primary
responsibility must now go to the National Nuclear Security
Administration, created by Congress in response to the Wen Ho Lee
fiasco. Its newly confirmed director, Gen. John Gordon, a physicist
who currently serves as deputy director of the CIA, appears ideally
qualified for the job. Richardson, who initially resisted the
creation of this semiautonomous agency within the Energy
Department, must give Gordon his fullest cooperation. Senate
Republicans are pressing for Richardson's resignation, but for the
moment we see a greater value in continuity, provided the secretary
will really take on the flawed security culture that he has blamed
for the lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The new security administration was designed to establish clear
lines of authority over the department's nuclear weapons agencies,
replacing the current tangle of overlapping bureaucratic
responsibilities. This structure will allow Gordon to ensure that
stricter security guidelines are drawn up and followed at all
nuclear weapons laboratories. At a minimum he will have to
establish stricter safeguards such as continuous camera monitoring
of all areas where sensitive work is performed, more rigorous
procedures for signing people and materials in and out, and more
consistent use of safes and secure storage vaults for data not in
current use. Equally important is making sure that lab employees
become more aware of security issues themselves. They should know
at all times what kind of data is on their computers and what
precautions must be taken to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Los Alamos combines scientific inquiry, which needs
a degree of openness, with weapons work, which requires strict
secrecy. Over the years some scientists have clearly grown
complacent about the security side of the equation. That may be
partly because too much scientific research is overclassified,
diminishing respect for security and making it harder to focus on
protecting real secrets like bomb miniaturization formulas and
computer programs for simulating nuclear weapons tests. Richardson
and Gordon will need to generate wholesale change in lax security
attitudes at the national laboratories.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   New York's state Legislature moves this week into that slippery
season when a number of bills could be passed into law _ or
disappear _ with the speed that comes when politicians are ready to
go home and campaign for re-election. With days, perhaps hours to
go in this session, now is the moment for lawmakers to finish work
on crucial issues that voters should remember on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Campaign finance reform: &LR;  This vital legislation seems in
danger of being lost within the power triangle that dominates the
State Capitol. Gov. George Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
and Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, have separate plans.
The Assembly version is the best, but a failure to agree on any
reform would signal voters that Albany politicians think nobody is
watching their gathering of special-interest money.

   &UR; Rockefeller laws: &LR;  These outdated and barbaric drug sentencing
laws skew the state's judicial system, robbing judges of the
ability to fit the jail term to the crime. Under these laws, many
nonviolent drug offenders serve more time than convicted
perpetrators of violent crimes. It is a reform that needs some
political courage, a rare commodity in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ballot access: &LR;  After an embarrassing presidential primary
election that tried to lock out Sen. John McCain, there was hope
that New York's notoriously closed ballots would finally be opened.
A winner-take-all provision weakens the bill, but the ballot access
legislation being offered by Republicans still presents a rare
opportunity for New York voters to have a wider choice of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Guns: &LR;  The governor's decent gun-control proposal would ban
assault weapons, raise the age for purchasing guns and provide
ballistic fingerprints. This bill should be passed as a move in the
right direction, even if it would be improved by a stronger
trigger-lock provision.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Restructuring courts: &LR;  Three years is long enough for
legislators to protect their patronage appointments in the courts.
It is time to endorse Chief Judge Judith Kaye's solid 1997 plan to
untangle the court system. The overhaul needs constitutional
approval, which means that it must be approved by two separate
Legislatures. If this Legislature will not do it, voters should
demand a better one for the next session.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Physician profiles: &LR;  A system like the one in Massachusetts
that lists medical minuses along with the pluses should be approved
to give consumers vital information about their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jet Skis: &LR;  A law that grants local towns and communities the
authority to ban these and similar personal watercraft deserves
approval.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Casinos: &LR;  Legislators should make certain that the state's
casino laws do not turn the Catskills into another Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   After this session is over, voters will be given a rare chance
to choose a very important state Legislature this fall. Next year's
legislators get to redraw their own electoral districts based on
the new census. For such a golden opportunity to pick their own
future voters, Albany's legislators should provide this year's
voters with a larger and more distinguished list of
accomplishments. &QL;

EDITORIAL: ISRAEL'S POLITICAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 21:
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Shas party drove its high-pressure bargaining to a new
level of recklessness on Tuesday by giving 48 hours' notice of its
departure from Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition.
Shas' concerns have nothing to do with peacemaking or the
Palestinians. But if Shas, an Orthodox religious party, carries out
its resignation threat, Barak will lose the broad parliamentary
majority he needs to negotiate a final peace deal with the
Palestinians later this summer as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The issues dividing Shas from its government partners are
narrower than they were a few weeks ago when this crisis began.
Both sides need to find ways to bridge the remaining gaps and keep
Shas inside the Barak coalition.
</P>
<P>
   One of Shas' main demands concerns a network of radio stations
owned by its religious supporters. Currently those stations are
unlicensed and risk being shut down by the police. Shas wants
guarantees from Barak that they will be quickly accredited. The
government fears that making such a deal could create an
irresistible precedent allowing other unlicensed stations to evade
reasonable licensing requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' other main concern is insulating its private school system
from supervision by Barak's education minister, a strong
secularist. It has already gotten extra funding for its financially
struggling schools. Barak now proposes shifting authority over
those schools to the prime minister's office. Shas has not yet
responded to this offer.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' constituency, mainly working-class Jews whose families
came to Israel from other Middle Eastern countries, is a large and
important one. Only in recent years has it begun to be fairly
represented in the Israeli political system. By reaching agreement,
Barak and Shas party leaders can preserve a broadly inclusive
government as well as maintaining the delicate momentum of
peacemaking. &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 21:
</P>
<P>
   Recent developments in the case of Gary Graham, a death row
inmate in Texas who is scheduled to die by lethal injection on
Thursday afternoon, reinforce qualms about his murder conviction _
and the duty of Gov. George W. Bush and the state pardons board to
prevent injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's conviction hinged primarily on the testimony of a
single witness, who testified she saw him from 30 to 40 feet away
through her car windshield. His defense lawyer failed to tell the
jury of the defective lineup procedure that may have guided her
identification of Graham, or of ballistics tests showing that the
gun Graham was carrying was not the murder weapon. Moreover, the
jury was never told of two other witnesses at the scene identified
in the police report, who say the assailant was not Graham.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days Graham's current lawyers have submitted
affidavits from three members of the jury to the Texas Board of
Pardons and Paroles, which is considering his application for a
full or conditional pardon, a 120-day reprieve to permit a hearing
or a commutation of the sentence. In these sworn statements the
jurors say that had they been presented with the additional
evidence, they would not have voted to find Graham guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there is a strong likelihood the outcome would
have been different had Graham been afforded a fair trial. With the
clock ticking toward the execution date, the jurors' statements
have to weigh heavily on the consciences of Bush and the 18 members
of the pardons board. Together, they hold his life in their hands.

IN 5 WEEKS, TALE WILL BE TOLD ON THIS TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Minnesota Twins are back in town, but
let's knock off the jokes about small-market midgets and moving to
Charlotte, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   There are no gimmes for the Rangers. Not the Wal Mart-priced
Twins. Not the dysfunctional Orioles. Not even those mighty Tampa
Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   What once was found now appears lost. As they began an ominous
two-week stretch last night, the Rangers lead the American League
West only in losses and inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's early. But let me suggest that it's later than some
people care to think.
</P>
<P>
   After last night's 5-2 victory against the Twins, the Rangers
have 94 games to play. An eight-game sobriety test against the
division's two best teams, the Oakland Athletics and Seattle
Mariners, will be administered next week. By five weeks from
tonight, July 26, manager Johnny Oates' bunch will have played AL
West foes 17 more times.
</P>
<P>
   And that should tell us and general manager Doug Melvin all we
need to know about the '00 Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Oates is different. His penchant is to see sunshine on a cloudy
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we've got the talent,'' the skipper said again last night.
``There's talent here. It's a matter of doing it consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Consistency. The C-word.
</P>
<P>
   A scrapbook of headlines from this puzzling Rangers season would
look like a ransom note. An awful April. A buoyant May. Who would
have thought that, at this point of the season, Oates' team would
have hit nearly as many double-play grounders (81) as home runs
(88)?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a magic secret button,'' Oates mused yesterday,
``we'd have pushed it weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, this club was reared with inconsistency's
bitter milk from the start. Radical change _ and excising a
two-time league MVP from the middle of your lineup certainly
constitutes radical change _ prompts a spike in team chemistry.
There were new and young faces, and both old and new arms.
</P>
<P>
   In poker terms, Melvin tried to fill an inside straight. It
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, does he draw again _ or bluff?
</P>
<P>
   By July 26, the GM should know. If the Rangers, having run their
gauntlet of AL West teams, aren't within an arm's length of the
division leaders, a change in landscaping will be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland, who becomes a free agent at season's end,
figures to be the club's most tradable commodity. Yes, he has had a
maddeningly inconsistent season. But Wetteland's October
credentials alone should be enough to tease an Atlanta, a Boston, a
St. Louis, and maybe even the Dodgers, Indians or Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that first baseman-designated hitter David Segui
would also attract interest. Like Wetteland, Segui would be a free
agent at the end of the season. The guy is a big-league hitter, no
question _ but his presence in the lineup isn't helping Rafael
Palmeiro any, is it?
</P>
<P>
   By July 26, Melvin should also know what he needs to about the
enigmatic pitching twosome of Darren Oliver and Esteban Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Oliver is ailing. Or, at least, his pitching suggests that
he must be.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver started 30 games for St. Louis last season and posted a
3.35 earned- run average in 13 starts after the All-Star break. The
Rangers gifted him with a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. But that's baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver probably needs to be shut down until his arm recovers
from whatever it is that continues to ail him. He and Loaiza have
been flickering beacons of inconsistency all season long.
</P>
<P>
   Trade bait? Pray tell, to whom? Where? When?
</P>
<P>
   Oates, meanwhile, is left to utter the C-word and wonder if this
odd mix of Rangers will ever show a steady pulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it revolves around your pitching staff,'' Oates said.
``When they're consistent, you're going to play good baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates is baffled that his team is on the dire end of one of
baseball's most telling statistics _ runs scored vs. runs allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think we could be giving up 30 more runs than
we've scored,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 30 or so games, it's as much a badge of this team's
struggles as anything.
</P>
<P>
   There are no gimmes. The Rangers need to play out these five
weeks, and then plot for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, tomorrow looks a lot like 2001.

SCINTILLATING, HIGH-SCORING FINALS OFFER HOPE FOR NBA FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the risk of descent into old fogeydom, I
remember when NBA teams, as a fairly regular event, made around
half their field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Jumpers were midrange, back-cuts to the hoop were frequent, and
players without the ball moved relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a flow that transcended defenses and whistles.
Which is not to say there weren't plenty of both. But the time
spent on offense was more about craftsmanship than circus.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around the time of the Bad Boys' reign in Detroit in
1989-90 _ and the testosterone-flattering import of
sports-highlight shows _ things started going to hell.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on defensive brutality created twin Pistons
championships and an ugly trend. NBA coaches could show they
actually counted for something by devising defenses that could deal
more broken concrete than the Kingdome imploders.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't grim enough, the titles won by Houston in 1994
and '95 accelerated the decay. In the playoff absence of Michael
Jordan, the Rockets' strategy was largely about dumping the ball
into Hakeem Olajuwon and watching him decide between his Dream
Shake or a pass to a teammate rooted beyond the 3-point arc. It was
a league-wide hit, although largely a miss for offense-minded fans.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered around these developments were Chicago's six titles.
Splendid as was the achievement, no real trend emerged because the
extraordinary Jordan made imitation impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, his tandem with Scottie Pippen, for a while the
game's second-best player, gave the Bulls a pairing of midsized
players of versatility unprecedented in championship history.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the standard title recipe included a good big man
and a good point guard, with variations that might include a superb
forward (Julius Erving, Maurice Lucas, Tim Duncan) or a dominant
front line such as Boston's trio of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and
Robert Parish.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the freakish Bulls, the emphasis continued to be on
defense and 3-point shooting. The results were so deadening that
the NBA in the late '90s set lows for scoring and shooting
percentage unseen since the Eisenhower years. Point totals in the
60s and 70s reintroduced a new generation of oblivious fans to the
former existences of franchises in Fort Wayne, Syracuse and St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending a few weeks chasing the NBA tournament, it is
with some pleasure I report a trend:
</P>
<P>
   Hope.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying it's anything conclusive, but I bore witness to
three consecutive games in which both parties scored in triple
figures. My swoon was so severe I had to ask that sharp-cornered
furniture be removed from my hotel room, lest my faintness cause
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Games 4, 5 and 6 of the NBA Finals between the Los Angeles
Lakers and Indiana Pacers were mostly wonderful basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, the Lakers tripped on their egos in the fifth game. It's
also true neither team will make basketball historians re-chisel
the ancient tablets, and Hack-a-Shaq and other sins of the
three-hour debacle of Game 2 can't be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the games were reminiscent of the
stylistic successes of the 1980s, when the Lakers, Celtics and
76ers dominated with ball movement, alert passing, and above all,
quality shotmaking. As significantly, the Finals looked little like
the horrifying ball dispensed in recent seasons by the New York
Knicks and Miami Heat, who are to hoops what bazookas are to
woodcarving.
</P>
<P>
   Of themselves, the point totals are not ends, but barometers of
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's attack was a delight. All the starters are at least
scorers. Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose are splendid shooters. Miller
showed how even pencil-necked geeks can play a championship-level
game, with his relentless moves to get the ball and his cleverness
in getting open.
</P>
<P>
   In the final four games, the Pacers' accuracy from the field was
46, 50, 57 and 47 percent, despite Shaquille O'Neal's presence, and
they set a Finals record with 85.2 percent from the free-throw
line.
</P>
<P>
   A purist might lament the emphasis on the 3-pointer _ their 49
treys broke the record for a six-game Finals by 10 _ but the Pacers
are merely emphasizing a strength dictated by the rules, and not
deploying out of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers' offense seemed less remarkable, owing to its
tendency to stand and watch the large gentleman, it was much more
than a dunking machine.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's passing out of double-teams has improved markedly. Kobe
Bryant's eagerness to slash to the basket instead of dancing on the
perimeter was a throwback, albeit sometimes a throwaway, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Phil Jackson's much-discussed triangle offense has
proven to work without Jordan, and within a single season, it's
hard to know whether it is exportable to other teams. Mimicry is
best done when the target is overdrawn, not subtle.
</P>
<P>
   What can be said is that the NBA, with a different champion
three consecutive years, has this June witnessed a rekindling of
the kind of play that made its industry a hot item not so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   If what the Lakers and Pacers accomplished can be fanned into a
flame, hoops fans chilled by too many seasons of
stand-and-shoot-and-slug will warm up to an old friend.

MORE THAN 60 ARE HURT IN SUBWAY DERAILMENT IN BROOKLYN
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At least 60 people were injured, three of them
critically, when a subway train derailed as it pulled out of a
station in downtown Brooklyn on Tuesday night, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The third and fourth cars of the southbound B train slid off the
tracks as the train left the DeKalb Avenue station at 9:57 p.m.,
landing upright but hurling passengers up against each other and
the walls of the train, the authorities and passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment's cause was not immediately known, but Lawrence
G. Reuter, the New York City Transit president, said that the
derailment occurred as the train was passing over a switch and that
the investigation would focus on the switch.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said 10 people were taken to Brooklyn
Hospital Center or to Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. One of
the critically injured passengers had suffered a heart attack, he
said, possibly caused in part by the 100-degree heat in the subway
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the station, at Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues, the scene
was one of controlled chaos on Tuesday night, with dozens of
emergency vehicles swarming the normally busy intersection and
about 30 passengers waiting on a triage line as the police barked
orders at them.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger, Tanya Acevedo, said that a few seconds after the
train left the DeKalb Avenue station, it jerked once, then five
seconds later jerked again with enough force to cause her to butt
heads with another passenger.
</P>
<P>
   She looked up to see the floor of the car carpeted with people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was total chaos,'' said Acevedo, who was nursing a
golfball-sized knot on her forehead. ``There were people yelling
`Oh my God.' They were crying, they were screaming, they were
praying.''

FIRST-ROUND PICK IN AWE OF ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Joe Torres just received a $2.1 million
signing bonus, but the Anaheim Angels' first-round draft choice
looked like any other 17-year-old kid Tuesday when he walked on the
Edison Field diamond for the first time: starry-eyed, smiling and
humble.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, a left-handed pitcher from Gateway High in Kisssimmee,
Fla., met general manager Bill Stoneman, manager Mike Scioscia,
pitching coach Bud Black and catcher Bengie Molina, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angels have made my dream come true,'' said the 6-foot-3,
175-pound Torres, who was joined by his family. He didn't approach
any Angels during batting practice because ``I don't want to bother
them while they're doing their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres will report Sunday to the Angels' Single-A club in Boise,
Idaho _ he'll be the only high school player to start his career
there this season _ and clearly big things are expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a high-ceiling, high-end, left-handed pitcher,'' said
director of scouting Donny Rowland, who saw Torres pitch four times
this season. ``He's the kind of player I think is profiled on a
championship club. He's got a fastball in the mid-90s and his
curveball is devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels now have signed 17 of their first 21 picks after
coming to terms Tuesday with second-round pick Jared Abruzzo, a
catcher from El Capitan High near San Diego. Nine of their first 12
picks were pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The only unsigned players in that group are Auburn right-handed
pitcher Chris Bootcheck (first round, 20th pick), Florida Atlantic
shortstop Tom Murphy (third round), Kansas right-handed reliever
Brandon O'Neal (sixth round) and Visalia Redwood High shortstop
Aaron Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland was most pleased about drafting and signing a pair of
Florida preps, catcher Michael Napoli (17th round) and right-handed
pitcher Brett Cimorelli (20th round), who he thought slipped
because many teams didn't think they were signable.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Kent Bottenfield, recovering from tendinitis in
his right shoulder, threw a simulated game and appears on track to
return from the disabled list Saturday, when he would start against
the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked great,'' Scioscia said. ``His pitches were sharp. He
was very strong. I hope he's ready to go this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other injured Angels starters, Ken Hill and Jason Dickson,
are continuing their road to recovery. Hill, out since May 10 with
a pulled rib-cage muscle, was scheduled to pitch for Triple-A
Edmonton Tuesday night and Dickson tonight.!

PHILLIES DOWN METS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Hampton stood at his locker dressing silently,
while Armando Benitez, one stall away, explained over and over the
pitch he had thrown and the result of the pitch. Hampton did not
look up as Benitez expressed his apologies for the damage done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hampton had sat in the dugout less than an hour earlier,
watching as Benitez, the usually reliable New York Mets closer,
surrendered a leadoff home run in the top of the ninth inning to
pull a hard-earned victory away from him.
</P>
<P>
   The home run, by Philadelphia's Pat Burrell, tied the score at
2-2, spoiling seven innings of hard work by Hampton. At least
Hampton had made it that far after the elements conspired to ruin
his last two outings, but that did little to soothe the Mets'
frustration after Benitez gave the game away in the 10th and they
fell to the Phillies, 3-2, at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hanging slider,'' Benitez said of the home run pitch.
``He's a good hitter and he hit it. You can't do the job every
time. Sometimes you have to lose. I feel sorry for Mike. He threw a
real good game. I came in for one inning and I blew the game. I
feel real bad for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said Benitez had apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the guy was what, 16 appearances in a row without giving
up a run?'' Hampton said. ``You can't expect the guy not to give up
a run the rest of the year. He tried to make a pitch, probably left
it a little up, and the guy's got a lot of power and he hit the
ball out. He's out there trying to make good pitches and trying to
win. It's part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team game. I'm here for one reason, and that's to
help the team reach and win a World Series. We win as a team and
lose as a team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Hampton left with a 2-1 lead after seven innings, John
Franco pitched a perfect eighth and handed the ball to Benitez. But
the hard-throwing right-hander gave up a home run on a 1-2 pitch to
Burrell, ending Benitez's streak of 17 scoreless innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, Benitez gave up a leadoff double to Doug Glanville.
After Benitez struck out Ron Gant and Scott Rolen, Mike Lieberthal
lined a hard single to center, scoring Glanville with the winning
run. The Mets went down meekly in the bottom of the inning, as Jeff
Brantley registered his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous two starts, Hampton threw a total of just 79
pitches, battling the weather and an injury. Against the Yankees on
June 11, he pitched two and one-third innings before the game was
called because of rain. He started just three days later in
Chicago, but rain pelted Wrigley Field and he pitched just one
inning before the weather and a strained groin ended his day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the injury healed sufficiently for Hampton to take the
mound on Tuesday night, he toiled through seven innings, somehow
slipping around the holes he dug with control troubles to allow
just one run and four singles. He walked six, his highest total
since he issued six on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little out of sync the first three innings,'' Hampton
said. ``I started getting better as the game went on. I don't care
if I walk 50. If they score one run I can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza provided an early cushion for Hampton, driving an
0-1 fastball into the left-field bleachers for a two-run home run
off of Paul Byrd in the first inning, his 19th home run of the
season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hampton had a rough first inning. He walked Gant and Rolen in
succession with one out, but got out of trouble by inducing
Lieberthal into a 5-4-3 double play. While he did not surrender a
hit over the first three innings, he struggled with his control,
walking five and throwing 51 pitches, 30 of them balls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies broke through in the bottom of the seventh. Kevin
Sefcik led off with a single that deflected off the glove of a
diving Robin Ventura at third base, and Alex Arias hit a ground
single just past second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo. Desi Relaford
sacrificed Sefcik to third, and he scored on Glanville's sacrifice
fly to right. &QL;

YANKEES BLANK REDSOX, 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez went out for lunch on
Tuesday afternoon, a chance for the New York Yankee teammates to
think about something other than the task that faced them in a few
hours: batting against Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez. They ordered
pizza and the pie served to them was custom-sliced: PEDRO, it
spelled.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Jeter earned the right to send his pizza back and
have these words added: Loses to the Yanks. Jeter, Bernie Williams
and Paul O'Neill slugged home runs against Martinez on Tuesday
night and Andy Pettitte shut out Boston into the eighth inning as
the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner is the principal owner of a first-place team
once again. The Yankees (36-29) have taken the first two games of
this four-game series to move one and a half games ahead of the Red
Sox (35-31) in the American League East, and exactly one week after
he spoke ominously about his team at Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner
cheerfully boarded an elevator on the third floor of Fenway Park on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did great,'' Steinbrenner said, words charging from his
mouth. ``Pettitte pitched a great game. Any time you beat that
guy'' _ Martinez _ ``you're doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had allowed only three home runs this season before
this game; he had not lost a decision to the Yankees since
September 1998. One of the goals against Martinez, Yankee Manager
Joe Torre said before Tuesday night's game, is to try to stay even
with the right-hander, to keep the game close and hope that you can
beat the pitchers who relieve him.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza lifted the Yankees' morale tremendously with his
performance here Monday night, when the Yankees crushed the Red
Sox, 22-1, and Pettitte's teammates could see early on Tuesday
night that he had the stuff and the focus to give them a chance to
win again.
</P>
<P>
   He was working with alacrity, nodding in agreement to the signs
quickly and pumping his two-seam fastballs for strikes, getting the
ball back and throwing it again. Pettitte said afterward that it
was as good as he had ever felt.
</P>
<P>
   A good thing, too, because Martinez was doing what he always
does. The Yankees began the game with just 15 hits in their last
112 at-bats against Martinez, with 51 strikeouts, and Martinez
retired the first nine hitters, six on strikeouts. The home plate
umpire, Larry Young, called out O'Neill on a low changeup to end
the first inning, and started the second inning by calling out
Williams on a fastball belly-button high. Torre yelled to Young
from the dugout, asking facetiously if the umpire was O.K.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte faltered in the third inning, walking Jeff Frye with a
runner on first and one out. Pettitte promised himself before the
game that he would not allow Nomar Garciaparra to beat him on an
inside fastball, but in this situation Pettitte whipped a cutter
and Garciaparra singled to left; self-loathing overcame Pettitte as
he ran to back up home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Shane Spencer charged Garciaparra's single,
thinking the ball was hit too softly for him to throw out Jose
Offerman at home plate, but he tried anyway, grabbing the bounder
quickly and firing, feeling as if he did not make the best possible
throw because he had gripped the ball deep in his palm.
</P>
<P>
   The throw reached catcher Jorge Posada on one bounce, awkwardly,
forcing Posada to draw both hands toward his chest. It appeared to
Pettitte that if Offerman had slid, he would have been safe easily.
</P>
<P>
   But Offerman went at the plate standing, preparing to separate
the ball from Posada, and he was out when Posada showed the ball to
the umpire. The Red Sox did not score in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch singled to lead off the next half-inning, the
Yankee fourth, before being picked off promptly with Jeter at the
plate. Before the game, Jeter had held a remote control in his
right hand, leaned forward and stared at a small TV screen, like a
kid absorbed by a cartoon. What Jeter was staring at, actually, was
videotape of Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The best approach against him, Jeter said before the game, is to
look for the fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you guess with his other pitches, you got no chance,'' he
said. ``You can guess with the fastball and try to eliminate the
other pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a 1-and-1 count, Martinez threw a fastball. Jeter
swung and smashed the ball halfway up the screen that is built
above the monstrous left-field wall. It was only one run, but it
was a lead, and Pettitte agreed later that it bolstered his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Williams decided before the game that the best way to hit
Martinez was to attack him early in the count, to try not to fall
behind in the count and fall at the mercy of his other pitches.
Williams, batting left-handed, led off the Yankee seventh and
whacked Martinez's first pitch the other way, into the screen,
close to where Jeter's ball had gone.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill homered the next inning, a golfed liner that barely
cleared the low wall of the Boston bullpen in right-center field.
It was the first time Martinez had allowed three homers in one game
since Sept. 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez left after eight innings, allowing one walk and
striking out nine, but as Pettitte shut out the Red Sox through the
seventh and into the eighth, the boos grew louder for the Red Sox,
who have mustered one run in 18 innings at home against the
once-slumping Yankees and have relinquished first place.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte departed with two out in the eighth, having yielded six
hits in a commanding effort, and Mariano Rivera got the final four
outs for his 16th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees shook hands in the middle of Fenway Park. If winning
back-to-back games in this town, including a victory against
Martinez, does not help the Yankees' confidence, Torre said
afterward, then nothing will. &QL;

Season-ending surgery likely for Wagner
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
For nearly three months, Billy Wagner hasn't been, well, Billy
Wagner. On Tuesday, the Astros learned why.
</P>
<P>
   A magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed a partial tear of the
flexor tendon in Wagner's left elbow, and he likely will require
season-ending surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner will fly to Los Angeles later this week to seek a second
opinion from Dr. Lewis Yocum, an orthopedist with the Anaheim
Angels. If Wagner undergoes surgery, the expected rehabilitation
time is four months.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-throwing lefthander has been aware of a problem since
late last season, but he has continued to pitch this year while
hoping the elbow would improve. He informed Astros officials of his
predicament this past weekend in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt every time I pitched,'' said Wagner, who has blown
nine saves in 15 opportunities this season. ``All I knew was to go
out there and keep pitching, and sometime it would stop hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, and Wagner failed to find the form that led to his
recognition as one of the National League's top closers last
season. After posting a club-record 39 saves in 1999, Wagner is 2-4
with six saves and a 6.18 ERA this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who blew five consecutive saves earlier this season, was
removed from the closer's role on Friday. He suffered his ninth
blown save the next day when he walked four batters and failed to
record an out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew Billy wasn't Billy,'' general manager Gerry
Hunsicker said. ``The velocity seems to be there. We were all
searching for answers and mostly looking for mechanical reasons.
The fact is the hop and life just didn't seem to be there on his
fastball. Instead of guys swinging through pitches and fouling off
a lot of pitches, they were making pretty good contact. This would
appear to be the primary reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker stressed the injury is not career-threatening and that
no damage was found in the area of the medial collateral ligament,
which is commonly associated with Tommy John surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, 28, said he has been pitching with the injury since the
end of last season. Not wanting to risk further injury, he was
unavailable for the final game of the Astros' divisional playoff
series with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said rest during the offseason helped the elbow, but the
pain began to reappear early this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (team) doctors said to keep pitching, and it would get
better,'' Wagner said. ``It wasn't getting any better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for waiting so long before disclosing his condition, Wagner
said: ``I didn't want to make any excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker understood Wagner's reasoning for not informing the
club sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes guys feel like they are letting their teammates
down,'' Hunsicker said. ``If he would have come to us in March or
April, the results wouldn't have been any different. It's not like
he hurt himself further and could have avoided an operation if he
would have come to us sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   While his velocity remained in the high 90s, Wagner said the
most noticeable difference with his pitching involved location.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your livelihood is a fastball, of course you are
concerned,'' Wagner said. ``Next year I have to come back and
probably prove myself all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner will enter the final year of a three-year, $10.3 million
contract next season.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker said he will go with a closer-by-committee
in Wagner's absence. The Astros used a similar plan two years ago
when Wagner missed a month after being hit in the head by a line
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker will likely use Doug Henry and Jay Powell, who both have
experience as closers, in the role. After Tuesday night's loss to
the Dodgers, the Astros placed Wagner on the disabled list and
recalled reliever Jose Cabrera from Class AAA New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try and hold the fort,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   During the past week, the Astros have suffered significant
injuries to three players. Third baseman Ken Caminiti underwent
surgery Monday to repair the tendon sheath in his right wrist, and
outfielder Richard Hidalgo will have an MRI today on his sprained
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when we thought we might be getting over the hump and
making a turn, we get knocked back down again,'' Hunsicker said.
``This is not going to be easy to deal with.''

L.A. OPTIMISTIC ABOUT HEARINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After a two-hour meeting in which the appeals of three
coaches and an on-field assistant were heard, Los Aneles Dodgers
officials emerged confident about a reduction or complete dismissal
of the suspensions _ in the cases of both the coaches and many of
the players.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 suspended players will have their appeals heard today,
but ground work was laid during Tuesday's appeals hearing for
coaches Glenn Hoffman, Rick Dempsey and John Shelby and bullpen
catcher Travis Barbary. The appeals were presented in front of Paul
Beeston, chief operating officer for the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were coming in, we were optimistic that there would be a
reduction because we were able to tell both Frank (Robinson,
baseball's vice president of on-field operations) and Paul our side
of the story,'' Dodgers senior vice president Derrick Hall said.
``I think because of that, now they're going to put some good
thought into it and make a decision based on that. And I think the
decision will be favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Today) is the players (hearing), but I think (the ruling will
be ) favorable toward everyone. Because of the appeals process,
we're able to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen players were suspended for 60 games and fined $57,000
for their roles in the May 16 altercation with fans at Wrigley
Field. The hardest hit _ and the focus of the appeals _ is catcher
Chad Kreuter, who was the first into the stands during the melee.
He was suspended eight games and fined $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case when Robinson handed down the suspensions May
24, baseball is expected to establish a schedule of when the
players will serve their suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner the better for us because there are going to be
implications with the roster,'' Hall said. ``Moves we make will
have strong implications on the roster. When looking at the
schedule, you have to worry about which guys are going to be
missing when. However, with no control of that, you just have to be
thankful that they're going to stagger the suspensions so at least
they're not all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Orza, associate general counsel for the players
association, will be at the meeting, as will a contingent of agents
and lawyers for both sides. Beeston and Robinson will be present.
</P>
<P>
   The players association hopes to conclude the hearing in one
session, but Dodgers officials said the matter is likely to move
into Thursday. It will be done in an informal group setting.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hoping Beeston announces his decision within 24
hours of the hearings' end, but because of the volume of
suspensions, that now seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Once a ruling is made, it's unlikely any grievances would be
filed, a players association official said.
</P>
<P>
   As for as the coaches' hearing, Dodgers managing general partner
and CEO Bob Daly, president and COO Bob Graziano, senior vice
president and general counsel Sam Fernandez and the suspended
parties each spoke. Fernandez handled the bulk of the discussions
from the Dodgers' side while Robinson gave his side.
</P>
<P>
   From procedure, which was described as informal, it turned into
a search of what a coach's role is in such an incident. The Dodgers
are saying the coaches were involved purely from a peacemaker
standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the tape and kind of went through what happened,''
Shelby said. ``It gave each person a chance, which was good. We got
to understand why we were fined, and I guess Frank's (reasons) for
suspending the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, Graziano and Malone were granted permission to be at the
players' appeal hearing, though they're not expected to speak.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley remains
day-to-day with a strained right oblique muscle. . . . Dodgers
right-hander Gregg Olson had another setback during a simulated
game Tuesday. He felt stiffness in the lower part of his right
biceps and had to stop after 17 pitches (he was scheduled to throw
20). Olson was hopeful to return by the All-Star break, but that
doesn't seem possible now, manager Davey Johnson said. . . .
Houston closer Billy Wagner's season is apparently over after he
was diagnosed with a partially torn flexor tendon in his left
elbow. However, before having surgery he will get a second opinion
from Angels team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum. . . . Dodgers right
fielder Shawn Green's RBI single in the fifth inning extended his
streak of reaching base via a hit or walk to 50 games.

 BUSH CALLS FOR BILLIONS TO FUND K-12 CLASSES  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ The price of school reform was racheted up
again Tuesday as Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush
promised to spend $2.3 billion on improving math and science
instruction in grades K-12.
</P>
<P>
   That comes on top of the $400 million for improved computer
instruction he pledged in a stop at Vancouver, Wash., on Monday and
any proposals he may make when he stops at an inner-city school
site in Los Angeles Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I propose to use federal taxpayer dollars to raise standards
and challenge the status quo,'' he told a room of teachers and
students at Cupertino's De Anza College Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While the California economy is booming and voters seem
generally pleased with the way the state is running, public schools
are still a concern to many residents. That's one reason the Texas
governor has focused heavily on education, arguing that changes
need to be made in California and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Art Torres, the head of the state Democratic Party, disparaged
Bush's efforts as ``a photo op education plan.'' But Bush has
concentrated on education policy in Texas, and shows a passion when
discussing what education can mean to the country.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason American students should be ranked far below
students in other industrialized countries when it comes to science
and math, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the world's leading economy and leader in technology
and innovation,'' he said. ``We are creating the jobs of the
future, but we are not preparing our children to fill them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the community college, Bush quizzed a panel of students and
educators about the need for improved math and science instruction
and highlighted his own plans to jump start those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations,''
Bush said, citing his attempts to improve Texas schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set high standards and we measure _ we measure a lot,'' he
said. ``We measure achievement not to punish people, but so we know
how we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's testing is part of a carrot-and-stick approach. If
testing shows that some schools are doing a good job, they can get
more funds to improve their efforts. But schools not meeting state
or national standards could find themselves losing their federal
education funding, which would then be turned over to the students
to let them pay for a better education elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan to improve math and science also contains rewards
and penalties. He would provide $1 billion to allow low-income
students who take college-level math and science classes in high
school to get an additional $1,000 for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also would put together a $1 billion Math and Science
Partnership Fund to help states work with colleges to strengthen
technical education. He also would allow science and math teachers
who spend at least five years in a low-income school to have up to
$17,500 of their student loans forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, however, states getting the partnership money
would have to show that math and science achievement is improving.
And research universities receiving large amounts of federal grants
would be asked to work with their states to strengthen math and
science education.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Bush focused on technical education during
a visit to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important economic issue we have in the Valley is a
well-trained workforce,'' said Ruben Barrales, president of Joint
Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a high-tech industry group. ``We
have to develop a home-grown workforce that brings in the African
American and Hispanic kids that are here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of people were at De Anza to hear Bush talk about
education Tuesday, a change from the hundreds who paid up to
$25,000 a couple to shake hands and schmooze with the GOP candidate
at fund-raising events Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast wasn't lost on the people on Bush's panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of educational problems could be solved if you're as
able to raise as much money for education as you have for the
Republican Party,'' said Barbara Illowsky, a math teacher at De
Anza.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, Bush's wife, Laura, saw a different part
of the education mix as she toured a Menlo Park job training
center. Laura Bush, a former elementary school teacher, chatted
with students in a clerical training center and then stopped
briefly at a classroom where about 20 students were training for
guaranteed jobs with Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so terrific to see a great collaboration between
businesses that need people and people who need jobs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also stopped at the child development center, where she
tried to read a book to toddlers far more interested in the
television cameras that surrounded her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just to remind everyone here in the press that you
have to start reading to your babies when they're six months old,''
she said, laughing. ``Even if they aren't listening to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, who has avoided the limelight as Texas first lady,
also had a quick answer when asked if she was prepared for the
inevitable public scrutiny that comes with her husband's run for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' she said as she followed Secret Service agents to her
car.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Beating the Minnesota Twins should not be
considered progress for any American League team. After all, the
Twins are well on their way to their eighth consecutive losing
season.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're in last place and spinning out of control, any
victory against any team is worth a smile and a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, trying to get back into contention before their
season becomes irretrievably lost, began a potentially crucial
stretch of 15 out of 18 games at home with a 5-2 victory against
the Twins before 34,608 at The Ballpark in Arlington last night.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Kenny Rogers stopped the Twins on two runs and
five hits to get the victory, and John Wetteland, coming in with
runners at second and third, got the final three outs in the ninth
for his 17th save. They were supported by a 13-hit attack that
included at least one hit from each starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was a good start,'' left fielder Rusty Greer said.
``Kenny pitched well, and we threw some hits on the board. It's a
good start. If we build on that the next 14 games at home, we can
make up some ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't make up ground last night. The Oakland
Athletics defeated the Baltimore Orioles, leaving the Rangers eight
games out of first place. But getting back to .500 and out of last
place is the immediate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well at home all year, so by no means do we think
all is lost,'' center fielder Gabe Kapler said. ``But we've dug
ourselves a little hole, so we have to dig ourselves out of it. We
just need to think about getting back to .500, then we can think
about catching the teams ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, after their disastrous 1-8 road trip, are four
games under .500. But yesterday's victory was their 11th in their
past 14 at The Ballpark, which gives them hope they can use the
upcoming stretch to get their ship righted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter, home or road, we're going to get it
righted,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``Right now, we've got to
focus on just one game. We can't worry about 15 of 18 or 13 of 16.
We need to worry about the next game and then, after two weeks,
we'll look back and see how we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Some good pitching would help immensely, and Rogers provided
that. He gave up four hits and two walks in the first four innings
but only one run. After his teammates staked him to a 4-1 lead in
the fourth against Twins starter and loser Mark Redman, Rogers
retired 13 consecutive hitters before allowing a walk and a double
to start the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we were in trouble in the fifth inning when he
got into a groove,'' Minnesota manager Tom Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, 6-5 with a 3.96 earned-run average, admitted he went
into the game hoping he would be the one who would get the Rangers
headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every starter, when he toes the rubber, wants to be
the one who pitches well enough to give his team a chance to win
and get things turned around,'' Rogers said. ``We need to play a
lot better. We played terrible on the road; nothing has gone right
for us. These next few weeks we have to play a lot better and get
into a groove. Nothing dramatic, like winning 10 in a row, but just
a lot more consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some more offense would also help, especially from the outfield,
and that may be forthcoming. Kapler went 2-for-4 with a homer to
give him a six-game hitting streak, and Greer went 2-for-5 for his
third consecutive multihit game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's time to worry about being eight games
out,'' Greer said. ``Obviously, we'd like to be closer. We'd like
to be in first place. But we dug ourselves into the hole, and we
have to dig ourselves out of it. Tonight was a good start.'' nn

EFFORT TO GIVE PARENTS VOUCHERS FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLING MOVES
TO  BALLOT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ A initiative that would give parents $4,000 to
spend on their child's education qualified for the state's November
ballot day, the Secretary of State's office said.
</P>
<P>
   ``School Vouchers 2000'' would give parents money from the
state's education fund to pay for tuition at a private or religious
school. Families whose children go to public schools without
tuition would not receive the funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this initiative passes, schools will be accountable to
parents and grandparents and this accountability will improve
California's failing education system,'' said Silicon Valley
executive Tim Draper, who is sponsoring the initiative. ``It is
only fair that every child _ regardless of income _ have the chance
to receive a quality education.''
</P>
<P>
   The proponents submitted more than 823,000 signatures to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents _ including Gov. Gray Davis and teacher groups _
say the initiative will hurt public schools by draining resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to have to beat it,'' said Gary South, Davis'
political spokesman. The governor ``made it clear in the campaign
that he is not for vouchers. Particularly in the context of having
just gotten started in major improvements in accountability in the
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is expected to formally announce his opposition to the
initiative Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also argue the initiative would let schools receive
public money without being held accountable to state standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``By siphoning off scarce resources, this voucher initiative
will do nothing to improve our neighborhood public schools,'' said
Lavonne McBroom, president of the California State PTA. ``It
creates a new system of unregulated, taxpayer-funded voucher
schools that are not required to meet many of the state's new
educational standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Draper's group argues California schools are in such bad shape
they need a major overhaul, not just quick fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Another initiative that qualified for the November ballot this
week would stop allowing cities and counties to impose hidden
taxes, according to its supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the California Chamber of Commerce, the initiative
seeks to close a loophole created by a 1997 California Supreme
Court decision that allows state and local governments to impose
``fees'' on businesses. Supporters say they are simply taxes by an
another name.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative would require the state's constitution to require
that fees be instituted like taxes, which must be passed by local
voters or the Legislature by a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``To protect taxpayer and consumer rights, voters must close a
damaging loophole in Proposition 13,'' said Larry McCarthy,
president of the California Taxpayers' Association. ``With this
initiative, voters have an opportunity to guarentee that they will
be part of the decision process determining which tax proposals are
necessary. Without this measure, California taxpayers could face
limitless new `fees' from state and local government, and there
will be no government accountability to trail the funds.''

TROUBLE ON THE ROCK: RIVALS CHALLENGE BLUE &AMP; GOLD FLEET
OVER  ACCESS TO ALCATRAZ  
 BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; The trip to Alcatraz has become such a hot ticket that tour
operators reserve space up to six months in advance, while summer
tourists looking for a same-day ticket at San Francisco's Pier 41
ticket booth are often out of luck.
<P>
   The tiny island has never been quite the same since the 1995
movie ``The Rock,'' starring Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage, made
it even more of an international tourist mecca.
</P>
<P>
   That has been good for Blue &AMP; Gold Fleet, which has a lock on
the Rock through an agreement with the National Park Service. Each
day, Blue &AMP; Gold has the exclusive right to ferry 4,200 visitors to
Alcatraz and sell the scarce tickets.
</P>
<P>
   While tourists love the trip, Blue &AMP; Gold is drawing fire for
the way it allocates tickets and deals with tour companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two small Fisherman's Wharf tour operators added new
charges to a lawsuit they filed in October that accuses Blue &AMP; Gold
of violating equal-access provisions of its park service contract
by giving more-favorable treatment to big tour companies.
</P>
<P>
   They also allege that Blue &AMP; Gold violated antitrust law by
threatening to cut off large tour operators' Alcatraz ticket
allotments unless they agreed to use Blue &AMP; Gold exclusively for
their other Bay cruise business.
</P>
<P>
   The ripples from this lawsuit are likely to grow. Red &AMP; White
Fleet believes Blue &AMP; Gold's alleged pressure tactics crippled its
own bay cruise business and is considering filing its own lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state attorney general's office is reviewing
the allegations. And the Park Service has asked Blue &AMP; Gold to
respond to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Blue &AMP; Gold, a unit of privately owned Pier 39, declined comment
on the charges filed in San Francisco Superior Court by Jeffrey
Sears' A American Tours and Elric Leano's San Francisco Magical
Mystery Tours. But attorney Ernest Reddick said, ``We believe this
is a nuisance lawsuit and are confident we will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue &AMP; Gold, which filed its cross-complaint in January, charged
that Sears' pedicab tours and Leano's walking tours were not
marketing Alcatraz tickets as part of a tour package but rather
were reselling them at prices well above their face value in
violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; High Stakes Fracas
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in this waterfront legal brawl are high. Even though
people did all they could to get off the Rock during its 29 years
as a maximum-security prison, now they are fighting to get on.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service limits visitors to 14 boats per day, 300
passengers per voyage, during summer. But daily demand is much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to Alcatraz with 40 Norwegian tourists, San
Francisco tour director Barbara White said she buys tickets as much
as six months in advance. Mark Kern, a massage machine salesman
from Anaheim (Orange County) paid a hotel concierge a $4.50
surcharge for two scarce last-minute tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can't get a ticket to Alcatraz, they want to jump
off the Golden Gate Bridge,'' joked Anthea McGoldrick, vice
president of marketing for Gray Line tours.
</P>
<P>
   Money Machine
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of the Rock has grown gradually since 1963, when
Alcatraz was shut down as a federal prison because of soaring
operating costs. Today, the 22-acre island is a federal cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 percent franchise fee that Blue &AMP; Gold pays the Park
Service on each ticket ($8.75 for adults) is expected to generate
$1.2 million in revenue this year. The $3.50 self-guided audio tour
used by about 80 percent of the 1.3 million annual visitors to
Alcatraz and a bookstore concession net about $2.2 million more for
the Golden Gate National Parks Association.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of its contract with the Park Service, Blue &AMP; Gold
must charge all customers the same price. But it can sell up to 130
out of 300 tickets per voyage to tour operators, who bundle them
with a bus or other tour and reportedly mark up the price of the
combined package as much as $20 above the component parts.
</P>
<P>
   Gray Line, for example, makes an additional $4.75 per ticket by
packaging the Alcatraz trip and $31 City Tour and charging $48.
Gray Line purchases 200 to 250 Alcatraz tickets a month in advance.
McGoldrick said the company could use 100 tickets more, but like
everyone else can't get them.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Gray Line uses whatever services its customers
want and that she was unaware of the lawsuit against Blue &AMP; Gold.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to the plaintiffs and depositions they
recently took from former Blue &AMP; Gold employees, tour companies
including Gray Line were pressured to purchase all their bay cruise
tickets from Blue &AMP; Gold rather than Red &AMP; White if they wanted to
keep their Alcatraz allotments.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant also allegedly placed similar ``illegal tying''
pressure on hotel concierges to buy city tours from Tower Tours
when Blue &AMP; Gold briefly owned that tour bus company.
</P>
<P>
   Sears and Leano also charge that Blue &AMP; Gold repeatedly gave
preferential treatment to their biggest wholesale customers,
including advance ticket allocations, the most-popular departure
times and, in the case of Tower Tours, exclusive permission to
return unsold tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Donald Jelinek of Berkeley said businesses
commonly give favorable treatment to their best and biggest
customers. But he said a Park Service contract requires Blue &AMP; Gold
to ``observe a strict impartiality as to rates and services in all
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the plaintiffs allege that Blue &AMP; Gold enforced
anti-solicitation provisions very selectively. While it allowed
Gray Line, Tower Tours and Eco Tours to sell tickets within 1,000
feet of Pier 41, the Alcatraz tour departure point, Blue &AMP; Gold
banned Sears' company from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just looking for a level playing field,'' said Sears,
who started Barbary Coast Pedicab in 1982, two years out of high
school. Over the years, he and his wife, Helena, went from doing
all the peddling to renting out a fleet of pedicabs to independent
contractors for $30 to $50 per shift. They also got into the
bicycle rental business.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing popularity of Alcatraz, Sears started A
American Tours (so named to get top billing in the classified ads)
and entered into a wholesale rate agreement with Blue &AMP; Gold in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging pedicab tours with 50 or more Alcatraz tickets a day
became Sears' fastest-growing business. Then, a year ago, Sears
says Blue &AMP; Gold amended his contract adding provisions that A
American Tours could not sell tickets within 1,000 feet of the
pier.
</P>
<P>
   Sears refused to sign the non-solicitation clause because
Alcatraz tour signs on the back of his pedicabs generated a lot of
business. Now his tour business has evaporated and Sears said he is
already out more than $50,000 in legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Leano's Magical Mystery Tours, which offered a tour of Alcatraz
capped by a walking tour of North Beach and Chinatown, says it was
also singled out for unfair treatment by Blue &AMP; Gold and joined the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sears maintains his company ``did everything by the
book,'' several Fisherman's Wharf sources said Sears' independent
pedicab contractors frequently violated the law by buying Alcatraz
tickets at Blue &AMP; Gold's ticket booth days or weeks in advance and
then reselling them for big profits on the day of the sailing when
Blue &AMP; Gold was itself sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some pedicab drivers would buy up to 10 tickets at a time and
then scalp them,'' said Colin Jones, a former Alcatraz tour ticket
collector who said he was frequently offered $100 for a pair of
tickets on weekends but always said no. More Legal Clouds Loom
</P>
<P>
   Blue &AMP; Gold's legal battle may not end with Sears and Leano. Red
&AMP; White is trying to assess the damages from Blue &AMP; Gold's alleged
illegal tying arrangements. ``My business has been damaged
enormously,'' said Red &AMP; White owner Tom Escher. ``I've laid off
people and lost money.''
</P>
<P>
   Red &AMP; White knows a thing or two about the Alcatraz concession.
It used to own it when it was part of San Francisco's Crowley
Maritime Corp. Then, in 1997, Crowley decided to focus on
commercial hauling and sell Red &AMP; White's 11 tour boats, ferry
service, bay cruises, Alcatraz contract and a packaged bus tour
business to Blue &AMP; Gold.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem. Concerned about a monopoly on the Bay,
the California attorney general's office objected. As part of a
consent decree, Crowley relative Tom Escher acquired the Red &AMP;
White name, three of its ferryboats and its lease at Pier 431/2.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of most of the old Red &AMP; White fleet
nevertheless made Blue &AMP; Gold the Bay Area's largest provider of
ferry and water excursion services, with 13 vessels and annual
revenue of $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still interested in preserving competition on the bay,
California Deputy Attorney General John Donhoff said, ``We're
looking at the circumstances involved in the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the National Park Service. Lawyers for Red &AMP; White and
Sears and Leano have advised Golden Gate National Recreation Area
General Superintendent Brian O'Neill that the Park Service has the
right to terminate Blue &AMP; Gold for material breach of contract.
O'Neill said he has asked Blue &AMP; Gold to respond to recent charges
but declined to comment on allegations. He also said that from his
vantage point, Blue &AMP; Gold has been ``an excellent operator.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Blue &AMP; Gold's 15-year contract expired at the end of
1998 and O'Neill is only allowed to grant three one-year extensions
before throwing the contract open to competitive bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service, which has granted two extensions, recently
began an 18-month water transportation planning study for the bay,
and O'Neill suggested it would make little sense to put a long-term
Alcatraz agreement out to bid until it is determined whether other
sites should be included in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   That could make the end of next year the earliest Blue &AMP; Gold's
hold on Alcatraz might be threatened. Unless, of course, legal
suits cause a sea change.

RECORD INDUSTRY TOLD TO EJECT CDS FOR DOWNLOADABLE MUSIC 
 &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; San Diego _ With Napster's wildfire popularity, the recording
industry has to learn to fight piracy by serving downloadable music
instead of lawsuits, MP3.com Inc. founder Michael Robertson said
Tuesday.
<P>
   In his keynote address to the 3rd annual MP3 Summit, Robertson
said record and Web music companies can head off the
revenue-sapping threat of free file-swapping programs like Napster
by becoming ``music service providers'' instead of just selling
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to fight piracy is not to wage a war-on-drugs''
campaign, Robertson said. ``It's about simply finding a way to
create a better drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by pioneering Web music portal MP3.com of San Diego
and other companies such as digital rights management firm
InterTrust Inc. of Santa Clara, the two-day event at the University
of California at San Diego is expected to draw nearly 2,000
technology and entertainment industry representatives from around
the world, about double the attendance from last year.
</P>
<P>
   The summit began as a way to promote MP3.com and using the MP3
file compression format to share and download music from the
Internet. But the summit is particularly significant this year
because of lawsuits involving Napster, an easy-to-use software
program made by a San Mateo startup of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry and several artists have sued to stop
Napster from allowing its 10 million registered users from swapping
free but illegal copies of top music hits.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com was also sued by the recording industry for copyright
infringement but has agreed to multimillion-dollar settlements with
two of the top five record labels and is negotiating similar
agreements with the remaining three.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson is now positioning MP3.com as an ally to the recording
industry to help make sure everyone gets a slice of revenues from
downloadable music.
</P>
<P>
   To profit from downloadable music, record companies need to
discard the belief that the main source of their revenue is selling
a CD, Robertson said. The movie industry, for example, makes money
from one movie shown in different ways: theaters, home video sales
and cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Record and technology companies could deliver music, like power
companies distribute electricity, in forms that consumers could use
on the Internet, with portable handheld players and in wireless
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's all about CD sales,'' Robertson said. ``Tomorrow,
we believe that it will be about thinking of music as a service.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who admitted the recording industry isn't rushing to
adopt his ideas, is also trying to push the phrase ``music service
providers,'' or MSPs, which he coined to describe all Internet
music companies in the same way ISP refers to Internet service
providers. This year's summit theme is ``The Year of the MSP.''
</P>
<P>
   Ric Dube, an analyst with the Internet research firm Webnoize,
said it's still ``the year of Napster'' but added that Napster's
grassroots success may spur the recording industry to follow
Robertson's ``MSP'' idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster sent a message to the major media companies that this
is not going away,'' Dube said.
</P>
<P>
   Rap star Ice-T said the controversy over Napster is generated by
lawyers, not artists like himself.

   ``You going to worry about technology?'' Ice-T said. ``That's
stupid. Technology will always figure itself out. Whatever problem
there is, there's 15 guys in a building right now trying to figure
it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster is like radio,'' he added. ``If you put your record on
radio, people can tape it and hand it around. It's just not

   An obscure trade show only three years ago, the MP3 Summit has
become one of the major events of the year for music technology
companies to meet and promote new products. The list of sponsors
and panel participants also includes Microsoft, Qualcomm and Texas
Instruments, as well as Bay Area companies like Emusic.com Inc. and
Napster Inc.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Cnet, for example, chose the summit to formally
launch its new Cnet Music Center, a Web resource for Internet users
to learn how to download, play and organize music. There are also
hints on how to better use programs like Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson Consumer Electronics of Indianapolis introduced five
portable MP3 players that will be on the market later this year
under the RCA Lyra brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the summit as one of the high points of the year in the
online music calendar, more so this year than ever before,'' said
Sara Perkins, spokeswoman for Rocket Network, a San Francisco firm
trying to make its mark with Internet recording studio technology.
``Every important player in the industry will be there and it is a
crucial networking opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lattig, spokesman for San Francisco Net music company
Kick.com, said this year's summit ``could be a moment of truth for
MP3 technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If (MP3.com) can bridge the gap between the record companies
and technology companies, this could be a landmark event in moving
this industry where it needs to be,'' Lattig said. ``It could be a
moment of truth for MP3 technology.''

STANFORD GAMES WIN GLOBAL CONNECTIONS  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business plan competitions have become the rage on college
campuses as engineering and business school students vie for
venture capital, corporate recognition and academic degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University this week is hosting the equivalent of the
Olympic Games of entrepreneurial face-offs. The Global
Entrepreneurs Conference 2000, a four-day event that concludes
Wednesday, is the first worldwide business plan conference and
competition among the winning student business plans from 21
university teams representing 14 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the finalists in each of five categories listed by team
name, product or service and sponsor:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Most Innovative Product &LR; : Biomedical Modeling Co., patient
information (China's Tsing Hua University); T-RAM, semiconductor
memory (Stanford University); Personal Integrated Communication,
speech-recognition processing device (Germany's Munich Bavaria
Business Plan Competition).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Elegance of Business Strategy  &LR; (most compelling solution to a
market need): NyteFyre Systems, record-keeping and transcription
software (Purdue University); T-RAM (Stanford University);
M-Contact, mobile service (Korea Student Venture Business Center).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Positive Social Impact:  &LR; Eduisfun.com, education portal (Indian
Institute of Management Bangalore); Latinarte.com, online art
(Argentina team); Setagon Inc., medical delivery system (Darden
Business School, University of Virginia).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Global Market Potential &LR; : ThermaGen, pocket-size soda can that
will cool beverages in less than two minutes (France's Hautes
Etudes Commerciales); EyeGen, bio-markers (Massachusetts Institute
of Technology); Personal Integrated Communication (Germany's Munich
Bavaria Business Plan Competition).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Internet-Based Plan:  &LR; Apparel-Online, business-to-business
apparel exchange (Princeton University); Sydney Worldwide Pty.
Ltd., online city guides and portals for tourists to Asia and
Australia (Australia's University of Sydney).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some business plan contests, this one is not the idea of
venture capitalists interested in spotting new technology and
talent. Rather, it is the brainchild of Ted Acworth, head of
marketing for the Business Association of Stanford Engineering
Students and recent recipient of a doctorate in mechanical
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Acworth says the idea behind the global challenge is to give
Stanford's already well-developed entrepreneurial network a
worldwide reach. He and engineering school colleagues also wanted
to shift the focus of their event from winning prizes and doing
deals to learning and networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of business plan competitions are designed to funnel
good ideas to the firms that finance the contests,'' Acworth says.
By contrast, ``The global challenge is not just a money grab; it's
four days of conference and networking.''
</P>
<P>
   The event included a keynote address by well-known venture
capitalist John Doerr and eight 90-minute discussions on such key
issues as negotiating a term sheet, protecting intellectual
property, developing a marketing plan and building a management
team.
</P>
<P>
   Only yesterday, three days into the event, did the teams begin
making 45-minute pitches to 30 volunteer venture capital and
industry judges. Acworth maintains the main purpose of the judging
sessions was for the entrepreneurs to gain useful feedback rather
than win awards.
</P>
<P>
   But there are prizes for five of the teams:
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard put up $150,000 in consulting services, servers
and other hardware for the winner of the best Internet plan.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting contributed a total of $75,000 for four
other awards: groundbreaking product, elegance of business
strategy, positive social impact and global market potential.
</P>
<P>
   As at the Olympic Games, the Stanford global challenge is trying
to shift the glory to participation. As for Acworth, after the
contest he is heading for Alaska to spend the summer as a bush
pilot before biking back to the Bay Area and consulting with NASA
on calibrating space telescopes.

NEW HARRY POTTER MAGIC COULD ENCHANT SCHOLASTIC'S TIMID STOCK  &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Scholastic Inc. is printing 3.8 million copies of the fourth
installment in its wildly popular Harry Potter series. That's a
record first-run volume and it's soaking up a good chunk of the
nation's printing capacity. But that doesn't guarantee everyone who
wants the 752-page story about a teenage wizard will magically get
one.
<P>
   Believe it or not, New York's Scholastic, Harry Potter's U.S.
publisher, is being conservative _ or at least realistic _ in its
production schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fairly frugal in distributing (volumes) one, two
and three,'' says Scholastic Chief Financial Officer Kevin McEnery.
``We've been very careful with the distribution (of No. 4) and at
times have not blindly fulfilled the trade demands. We're trying
not to oversupply. Sometimes, logistically, that creates a little
bit of stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingram Book, a major wholesaler, is getting about 75 percent of
its initial order the first day, with the balance coming shortly
afterward, says President Jim Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic has reason to be cautious. The New York company
horrified investors when sales of its last megahit, the prodigious
Goosebumps series, did a vanishing act, leaving stacks of
paperbacks gathering cobwebs on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, its stock fell 40 percent in one day after the
company predicted a quarterly loss of 70 cents to 80 cents per
share, when Wall Street was expecting a 68 cent profit.
</P>
<P>
   The main culprit: a charge of 50 cents per share to cover
Goosebumps returns.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic stock (SCHL), which hit $77 in November 1996, sank to
$21 in April 1997. In March of that year, it was the lowest-rated
stock on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But Scholastic has never been a one-hit wonder. It has a long
list of popular kids' series including Clifford the Big Red Dog,
Babysitter's Club, Animorphis, I Spy, Captain Underpants, Dear
America and Pokemon. By building those brands, and cutting costs,
the company turned itself around.
</P>
<P>
   After earning next to nothing in fiscal 1997, Scholastic earned
$23.7 million ($1.88 per share) in 1998. It earned $36.8 million
($2.20) on $1.15 billion in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate earnings of $3.20 per share for the year ended
in May and $3.68 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the turnaround, and the cacophony building toward the July
8 release of Harry Potter IV, it's odd that Scholastic stock, at
$61.94, is still below its all-time high and is trading at only 25
times trailing earnings, compared with 30 times for the S&AMP;P 500. In
late 1996, Scholastic traded at 50 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have long memories'' and many have not forgotten the
``Goosebumps incident,'' says analyst Peter Appert of Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, Harry Potter is not another Goosebumps. ``Harry
Potter is classic children's literature as opposed to pulp fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rollout schedule is much more logical _ one a year, not
one a month. The hardcover becomes a softcover so there are
residual issues.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't even sold the second two (volumes) in softcover
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Goosebumps appealed mainly to preteen boys, Harry
Potter is a hit with boys, girls and many adults. The first three
books have sold 20.6 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   McEnery says Harry Potter accounts for about $100 million or 9
percent of total revenues. He wouldn't disclose profits, but
typically the publisher and retailer split the cover price 50-50.
The pseudonymous Harry Potter IV _ the real name is still under
wraps _ will retail for $25.95.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the initial printing of 3.8 million copies will satisfy
demand remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3, the ``Prisoner of Azkaban,'' sold 4.4 million copies. It
had an initial print run of 250,000 and was frequently out of
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic does not expect shortages this time around. ``We are
continuously monitoring our inventory levels and that of our
customers and we will be reprinting as necessary,'' spokeswoman
Judy Corman says.
</P>
<P>
   At Amazon.com, advance orders stood at 176,539 last night and
are growing by about 500 per hour, ``significantly up from a few
days ago,'' says Lynn Blake, general manager of Amazon books.
Amazon will start receiving books this week and Blake says she
``feels confident we'll receive the amount we requested.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller bookstores also expect to get their orders filled. ``No.
3 was out of stock pretty continuously for a few months last year.
But I think they've learned their lesson with No. 4,'' says Martha
Jackson of Book Passage in Corte Madera.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Wynne, co-owner of Cover to Cover in San Francisco, where
Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling appeared last fall, says the
initial printing is ``outrageously large, bigger than John Grisham.
If they were to run out, blood would flow in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Appert thinks the stock will get a short-term boost as
Harry Potter buzz builds. It's up almost $8 per share in the last
week. But, he says, investors should look beyond the Potter
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, you had (volumes) one, two and three all
contributing (to revenues) at once. But you will not sustain the
unit volume sales you had last year. There's little question that
Harry Potter revenues (overall) will be down this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-term gain, he says, will come from a ``significant
increase in operating margins over the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Management has said it expects to increase operating margins
from about 7 percent this year to about 10 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are also bullish about Scholastic's pending acquisition
of Grolier Inc. for $400 million. Grolier is about half the size of
Scholastic. It's the largest direct-mail marketer of books for kids
under age 5 and is a major publisher of online and print children's
reference products, sold primarily to libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic is the leading publisher of books for kids ages 6
through high school. It's also the largest operator of
book-ordering clubs and book fairs in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Sweeting, a senior vice president with Templeton Global
Advisors, sees all kinds of cross-selling opportunities. Scholastic
could sell its titles through Grolier's direct-marketing and
library channels, and Grolier could sell its reference works
through Scholastic's school channels.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting's firm started buying stock in Scholastic a few years
ago, betting on a turnaround. Once the stock rebounded, ``we
reduced our positions a bit, but we're quite comfortable with the
long-term prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   She considers Scholastic a classic case of ``growth at a
reasonable price.'' It is selling at 19.5 times estimated earnings,
and its long-term growth rate is 18.3. That gives it a PE-to-growth
ratio of 1.06, which is attractive to GARP investors.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic won't get any revenues from the movie version of
Harry Potter, scheduled for release in November 2001. But movie
hype may renew interest in the books, if everyone hasn't read them
by then.
</P>
<P>
   What's the worst that could happen? ``I have recurring
nightmares that on July 9 we'll read in the New York Times book
review that Harry Potter 4 is not so great after all,'' says
Appert.

APPEALS COURT INVALIDATES RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT FOR
CONGRESSIONAL  CANDIDATES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal appeals court struck down Tuesday a
state law requiring candidates for the U.S. House of
Representatives to be California residents when they file for
candidacy, ruling in favor of a Nevada man who wanted to run for a
seat in Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Constitution requires members of Congress to be
residents of the state they serve once they're elected, the U.S.
Court of Appeals in San Francisco said that the state cannot
require them to be living in the state when they file their
nomination papers.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires candidates to file for congressional seats
more than 83 days before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Bill Jones called the concept of someone from
out of state representing the people of California a ``nutty idea''
and vowed to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally reject with all due respect to the Ninth Circuit any
assumption that we are going to have state boundaries evaporate,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   While most states have similar residency requirements, San
Francisco lawyer Joseph Remcho, who represented Democrats in their
unsuccessful challenge of term limits for state lawmakers, said
that the decision is not expected to have much of a practical
impact on Congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not imagine a ``serious candidate'' refusing to
move to the state where they're running for office unless they win
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton and her husband bought a home last year in
Westchester County, north of New York City, because she needed a
New York address to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision was a victory for Michael Schaefer, a Nevada
resident who wanted to run in the special Congressional election in
April 1998 for the vacancy held by the late Sonny Bono.
</P>
<P>
   The registrar of voters for Riverside County refused to give him
the required papers because he was not registered to vote in the
state. Bono's widow Mary won the election, but Schaefer still
pursued his lawsuit, seeking a declaration of his rights to run for
a congressional seat in California.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's opinion, the three-judge panel said that even
though it was too late for Schaefer to run for Bono's seat, the
issue needed to be resolved for future candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In finding that the state residency requirement was
unconstitutional, the federal appeals court relied on a 1995 U.S.
Supreme Court ruling striking down state laws setting term limits
for members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The federal constitution explicitly sets out the qualifications
for members of Congress, wrote the judges, noting that the framers
of the constitution specifically rejected any requirement of
in-state residency before the election.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected the state's argument that it had the power to
set procedures for federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California residency requirement has the likely effect of
handicapping the class of nonresident candidates who would
otherwise meet the requirements of the Qualifications Clause,''
wrote Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain of Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer, who lives in North Las Vegas, said that eventually he
would like to sit in the U.S. House of Representative. For now, he
said, he is running for the local justice of the peace.

HOUSE OF CARDS BROUGHT DOWN BY INTEREST-RATE PITCH 
 &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
It came down to the simple act of refusing to tell consumers what
rate they would pay on transferred credit card balances.
<P>
   In their consumer fraud probe of credit card giant Providian
Financial, the San Francisco district attorney's office and federal
bank regulators found a range of practices they considered shady.
One of their top concerns was a sales pitch that promised savings
on transferred balances but failed to disclose interest rates, The
Chronicle has learned.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on that practice is a key part of a more-than $300 million
agreement to settle fraud charges that the law enforcement agencies
and San Francisco's Providian are likely to unveil in the next few
days, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, if approved, will be one of the largest
settlements reached in a consumer finance case, topping the $265
million retailer Sears Roebuck agreed to pay three years ago for
improperly dunning customers who had declared bankruptcy.
``Everybody is shocked by the size of the settlement,`` said Mark
Alpert, an analyst with the brokerage firm Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday, Providian confirmed it is near
an agreement with the district attorney's office and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, the U.S. regulatory agency that
supervises the company's banking operations.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement would require the nation's sixth-largest issuer of
bank credit cards to pay a fine, reimburse victimized customers and
clean up certain business practices, the company noted. It said it
has already made many of the required changes.
</P>
<P>
   Providian didn't disclose the size of the settlement. But it
said it expects to take a charge against earnings of $1.12 to $1.17
a share to cover settlement costs, an amount analysts said was
consistent with the $300 million-plus figure. If a settlement is
reached, the company expects earnings per diluted share in the
second quarter of between 39 and 44 cents, about 66 percent below
Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   After initially jumping, the company's shares fell back as
investors digested the news, closing at $93.41, down 31 cents. The
stock dropped because the settlement is about 10 times larger than
had been expected and curbs on the company's business practices may
trim profit growth, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Providian that emerges from this settlement is going to be
a very different company,'' said Jefferies &AMP; Co. analyst Charlotte
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Providian said in its statement that settlement talks centered
on marketing and sales practices directed at the company's most
creditworthy customers. The company is best known for selling cards
to people with tarnished credit records.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to elaborate. But people familiar with the
case said the district attorney's and comptroller's offices
demanded that Providian halt its so-called Guaranteed Savings Rate
marketing pitch.
</P>
<P>
   That come-on promised to give customers who transferred balances
from other cards ``a rate that is guaranteed to save you money.''
Telemarketers were instructed not to tell customers what they would
be charged, but, if pressed, to say the rate would be 0.3 percent
better than the average they paid on other cards. Federal
regulations require lenders to clearly disclose rates and terms.
</P>
<P>
   Providian spokesman Alan Elias said the company stopped using
the pitch to solicit new customers several months ago and planned
to end the practice with existing clients later this year.

FADING LEVI'S STARTS TO SHOW SIGNS OF LIFE 
 &HT;     BY CAROL EMERT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Business is looking up for Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., the troubled San
Francisco jeansmaker whose sales have nose-dived in recent years.
<P>
   Although its performance remains well below par, Levi's, which
recently installed a new management team, has managed to stem its
sliding sales, fatten its profits, pay down debt and improve its
cash flow, according to financial results released Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   Net income jumped 48 percent for the quarter to $45 million from
$30.4 million, the result of U.S. plant closings and other
cost-cutting measures. Levi's posted net income of $110.2 million
in the first half, compared with a loss of $206.8 million in the
comparable 1999 period.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the second quarter, which ended May 28, fell 6.4
percent to $1.15 billion, with currency changes accounting for one
percentage point of the decline. That compares with a drop of 15
percent in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Marineau, Levi's chief executive, said the company is on
track to post single-digit sales declines for the year instead of
the double-digit drop he expected when he came aboard in September.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Levi's sales plummeted to $5.1 billion from a peak of
$7.1 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope sales will be equal to a year ago as we end the year,
so we can stabilize the business or grow it modestly in 2001,''
said Marineau, a former PepsiCo executive who received a $3 million
signing bonus for joining Levi's.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to robust cash flows from operations, Levi's is paying
down its debt faster than anticipated. Debt stood at $2.3 billion
on May 28, down from $2.4 billion at the end of the fiscal first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of fiscal 1999, the company's indebtedness stood at
$2.7 billion, or more than half of its annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Regionally, sales of Levi's, Dockers and Slates clothing
declined 4.9 percent in North and South America for the quarter.
European sales fell 17.4 percent, with currency fluctuations
accounting for more than one-third of the European decline.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in Japan and the rest of Asia leaped 21.9 percent due to a
stronger dollar and improved economic conditions in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is slowly improving its timely fulfillment of retailers'
orders, but ``we still have problems we need to fix'' in the supply
chain, Marineau said. A complete overhaul will take 18 to 30
months, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   For the crucial back-to-school season, which begins in August,
Marineau said he is confident that 95 percent of orders placed
before the season starts will be delivered complete and on time.
``That is a substantial improvement over where we were just a year
ago,'' he said, declining to disclose the earlier fulfillment rate.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, some retailers have been selling out of
Levi's because their order levels have been based on past demand
and didn't take into account recent fashion and marketing
initiatives, Marineau said.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's forecasters have begun working with retailers to develop
more realistic order levels, which will be in place for the
back-to-school season, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Levi's will roll out two advertising campaigns, one
featuring its pricey, futuristic-looking ``engineered jeans,''
which sell for $70 to $75, and one focusing on basic products,
including loose-fitting 569 jeans and a new line of Levi's
corduroys. The tag line will be ``Make them your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineered jeans have proven a big hit in Europe and Asia, where
they were introduced six months ago and already account for 8 to 10
percent of sales. The jeans are made from a dark, stretchy fabric
and are designed with twisted side seams and other features to make
them more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The rollout of engineered jeans has been slower in the United
States, in part because retailers were not convinced the
odd-looking pants would sell. But sales are strong in the 100 U.S.
specialty stores that carry them, and by August, distribution will
be expanded to 300 domestic stores.
</P>
<P>
   Although engineered jeans will never account for the bulk of
Levi's sales, ``they are allowing us to restore Levi's image and
the whole idea that (Levi's) is a hot brand,'' Marineau said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant brand erosion in the 1990s, Levi's is still
the first jean mentioned by American 15- to 29-year-olds when asked
to name a jeans brand. The company's market share has held steady
for the past year at about 15 percent after declining for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   One hopeful sign is a 20 percent increase in unit sales in the
United Kingdom, which Levi's is using as a test market for new
advertising, products and retail displays, Marineau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is that we're on the right track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trading of Levi's corporate bonds also reflects a greater level
of confidence on Wall Street. Prices have also increased to more
than $83 from the $50s earlier this year. The bonds have a face
value of $100.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's stopped reporting detailed financial results after a 1996
buyout by the Haas family, which owns the company. Yesterday's
quarterly report is the second it has filed since registering its
bonds with the SEC in February, which triggered public disclosure
requirements.

 ENVIRONMENT A BIG CONCERN FOR CALIFORNIANS, POLL SHOWS  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new poll finds that Californians are greatly
concerned about the environment and are willing to tolerate higher
housing and gasoline prices to protect the state's natural heritage
_ but they would rather not endure higher taxes to pay for cleanups
or land acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California
and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, apparently is the most
comprehensive environmental survey ever conducted in the state.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people were questioned from various regions of
California. Latinos were broken out as a separate survey group,
reflecting the fact that they are California's fastest growing
ethnic group, said pollster Mark Baldassare, a senior fellow of the
institute.
</P>
<P>
   The sampling error for the survey is plus or minus 2 percent,
Baldassare said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the poll's key findings:
</P>
<P>
   -- Seventy percent of state residents see environmental problems
as a threat to their health and well-being, with 1 in 4 one in four
 &LR; characterizing the danger as ``very serious'' and almost half
considering the problem ``somewhat serious.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Half of all residents say state government efforts to protect
the environment are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   -- Air pollution tops the list of concerns, followed
respectively by runaway development, general pollution, water
pollution, traffic congestion and inadequate or unsafe water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   -- The majority of residents say they favor using public funds
to buy undeveloped land to slow growth, but become ambivalent when
given the choice of using surplus government revenues for tax cuts
or protecting open space.
</P>
<P>
   -- Latinos are more concerned about the environment than the
public at large.
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare said a strong economy and progress on other issues
such as crime and education may have shifted public focus to the
environment and may become a hot button issue in the upcoming
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is good and crime is down, and most people are
satisfied with progress on education,'' he said. ``(People) want to
hear from candidates on environmental issues, and the candidates
will have to address those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Californians are somewhat pessimistic about the environmental
future of the state _ especially so in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   By a 2-to-1 ratio, the largest of any region in the state, more
Bay Area respondents said their region will be a worse place to
live in 2010 than said it will be a better place to live _ 43
percent versus 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 36 percent predicted worse conditions, compared with
27 percent who said their region will be a better place to live in
2010. Only in the Central Valley did optimists edge out pessimists,
with 34 percent saying the region will be a better place and 31
percent saying it will be a worse place.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found that Gov. Gray Davis ranked higher with
Californians on economic issues than environmental ones.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine percent of state residents approved of the way Davis
handled economic issues, while 29 percent disapproved and 22
percent had no opinion. But on environmental matters, only 36
percent approved of Davis' performance in office, while 28 percent
disapproved and 36 percent were unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Most Californians feel current state efforts to halt
environmental decay are inadequate, said Baldassare. Fifty percent
of adults said state government is not doing enough to protect the
environment, compared with 37 percent who said ``just enough'' is
being done.
</P>
<P>
   While most Californians expressed concern about environmental
degradation, there were wide regional disparities of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, environmental concern was highest in the Bay
Area and lowest in the Central Valley. Los Angeles generally ranked
between the two in degree of concern.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 74 percent of Bay Area adult residents considered
traffic a big problem, while only 21 percent of Central Valley
residents were similarly concerned. Forty-seven percent of Los
Angeles residents put traffic in the ``big problem'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven percent of Bay Area adults considered population
growth and development a ``big problem,'' compared to 17 percent of
Central Valley residents and 21 percent of Los Angelenos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is much more concerned about the environment in
general and is (particularly) concerned about growth,'' said
Baldassare. ``(Residents) are willing to limit development.''
</P>
<P>
   The one exception was air pollution. In the Bay Area, which
enjoys relatively good quality of breezy air, only 26 percent of
residents considered air pollution a big problem. In contrast, 40
percent of Los Angelenos consider air quality a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest surprises of the survey was the views of
Latinos, said Baldassare, who noted that many pundits thought
California's fastest growing ethnic group was generally
uninterested in environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-one percent of Latino adults consider environmental
problems very serious, compared to 25 percent of adults in the
general public,'' said Baldassare. ``As the Latino population
grows, we can expect growing concern about environmental issues,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In protecting the environment, state residents are willing to
put their money where their mouths are _ to a degree.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine percent oppose development that threatens endangered
species, even if it results in more expensive housing. And 54
percent oppose offshore oil drilling in California, even if higher
gasoline prices are the result.
</P>
<P>
   And Californians would narrowly prefer using surplus government
revenues for a public land trust rather than receiving a tax cut,
with 49 percent supporting the trust, 44 percent favoring the tax
break and 7 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But more than half _ 52 percent _ would vote against a
hypothetical local bond measure to buy undeveloped land to protect
it from development, even if it meant paying higher property taxes.
Forty-three percent would vote for the bond.
</P>

Institute of California's web site at  &UR; www.ppic.org. &LR; )

 GAS COSTS SOAR NATIONALLY BUT HOLD FAST IN CALIFORNIA  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For the first time in about a decade, the
average price of a gallon of self-serve unleaded regular gas in
California is almost the same as the national average _ a result of
soaring prices elsewhere, not any sudden break for long-suffering
Golden State motorists.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the California average fell one penny to
$1.66, while the national average surged by 15 cents to $1.64,
according to the Northern California branch of the American
Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   And if you go by the U.S. Energy Department's weekly survey of
gas costs _ which uses a smaller sample than the automobile
association's survey _ California pump prices are now  &UR; below  &LR; the
national average by as much as 6 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The last time California and national gas prices were this close
was in 1991, when the statewide average was $1.15 and the national
average was $1.14.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area drivers may no longer be watching gas prices ratchet
ever higher, but they're still feeling the pinch at the pump. While
Northern California gas prices have dropped 2 cents to an average
$1.71 in the past month, that's still 25 cents above year-ago
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're having a grand old time here,'' said
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy
Institute in Berkeley. ``As long as oil prices are this high, I
don't expect us to get a real break any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   With representatives of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries meeting Wednesday in Vienna to discuss global oil
supplies, the price of oil rose $1.36 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange Tuesday to $33.05 a barrel _ the highest closing price in
more than three months.
</P>
<P>
   Average gas prices in the U.S. have spiked sharply higher as
Midwest states introduce reformulated fuel similar to the
environmentally friendly blend that has helped push California pump
prices through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   However, the two mixtures are not the same. California's
emissions standards are still stricter than the federal standard
being adopted elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwest is going through what we went through in 1996 _
conversion to a new fuel with all the headaches that go with it,''
Borenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Clinton administration suspects that some price
gouging on the part of oil companies may be to blame as well for
the sky-high Midwest gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission announced late Tuesday that it has
opened a formal investigation into the matter. Subpoenas could be
issued to oil-company executives within days.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago now has the dubious distinction of having the nation's
most expensive gas: as high as $2.33 for a gallon of self-serve
regular unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   Pump prices also are hitting record highs in Milwaukee, Detroit
and other Midwest cities.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, by comparison, is getting off relatively easy.
The average gas price in the city fell by a penny over the past
four weeks to $1.85, according to the automobile association.
</P>
<P>
   The price in Oakland declined 2 cents to $1.77, while in Concord
it was unchanged at $1.67, in Santa Rosa it was down a penny to
$1.71 and in San Jose it was 4 cents lower to $1.75.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area gas prices generally run higher than other parts of the
country because of a combination of reformulated fuel and limited
competition among service statins.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Midwest grapples with introduction of new fuel,
coupled with shortages caused by pipeline troubles, the Bay Area
looks instead like a model of efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that our prices are down but that prices in
other parts of the country are way up,'' said Paul Moreno, a
spokesman for the automobile association.
</P>
<P>
   For California as a whole, he said smooth operations at
refineries statewide have helped push gas prices a few cents lower,
despite increased summertime demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is now ranked 16th in the nation for gas prices,''
Moreno said. ``This is unusual. California is almost always in the
top five.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's ranking may soon climb. Moreno said rising oil
prices, along with increased demand resulting from school being
out, should result in higher charges at the pump within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a slight upward trend in West Coast wholesale
prices,'' agreed Alan Kovski, energy analyst with the Kiplinger
Washington Letter. ``I would expect gasoline prices to go up a bit.
Not a whole lot, but some.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the UC Energy Institute's Borenstein said Bay Area gas
prices likely will not fluctuate much. ``I think OPEC is much more
together than they were before,'' he said. ``Don't expect any
bargains.''

 SPONSORS FOR THAT SPECIAL DAY  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Never underestimate the advertising world's
capacity to stoop to new depths.
</P>
<P>
   Ads printed on toilet paper, billboards on barges in the Bay,
billboard trucks that clog and blight the streets of San Francisco,
the hypnotic eye garbage of the Muni station saturation ads.
</P>
<P>
   And now (trumpet fanfare, please):
</P>
<P>
   Sponsor Your Wedding Inc. As crass as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride &LR; 
 &UR; and chug this bottle of Colt 45 Malt Liquor, the brew that rings &LR; 
 &UR; your wedding bells! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For $1,000 to $1,750, the sponsor gets verbal acknowledgment at
the reception (``Thanks, Mom and Dad. And thanks, Roach Motel''),
sponsor name on invitation insertions, corporate logo on cups and
other memorabilia, a mailing list of all the guests, and the
knowledge that your sponsorship has cheapened a sacred ceremony!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Oh, look at the lovely wedding cake, with The Chronicle &LR; 
 &UR; logo and the cute little tuxedo-clad figures of Scott Ostler and &LR; 
 &UR; Jon Carroll! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I would never sell my wedding to a sponsor. My funeral, sure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I know Scott would have wanted me to mention that he is &LR; 
 &UR; being buried with a can of Johnson's Lemon Pledge _ ``Ashes to &LR; 
 &UR; ashes, but no dust!'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RECENTLY SEEN sauntering into the same hotel room: Dennis
Richmond, anchor of Channel 2's top-rated news program, and Channel
5 general manager Jerry Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't using the bed, but strange bedfellows, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   What's up? Dennis' Channel 2 contract, for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN IT HIT 103 in the city last week, some kids in the south
part of town opened a fire hydrant. Fire fighters responded and
shut down the hydrant, but the kids fought back, throwing stuff.
Damage included a busted $1,000 computer inside the truck. The
truck left the scene under police escort.
</P>
<P>
   YOU PAID that damn parking ticket years ago, but now they're
sending you notices that you still owe the dough, plus a hefty late
fee?
</P>
<P>
   That's because the San Francisco Dept. of Parking &AMP; Traffic has
turned a huge stack of old tickets over to a new collection agency,
and some mistakes happen.
</P>
<P>
   Like to Sue Burgess, who recently had her car impounded for not
paying a 1968 parking ticket. It cost her $391 in assorted fees to
re-claim her ride, even though she says she has proof she paid the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Sue also says the ticket does not appear on her DMV record, so
she had no way of knowing that the DPT had not properly recorded
her payment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal: The DPT has instructed the collections agency
to honor legit proof of payment. The collections people have beefed
up their staff, so service should be improving.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Just because you got your car registration renewed doesn't
mean you don't have any outstanding tickets. Sometimes, for various
reasons, the DMV computer spits your ticket out and decides not to
put a hold on your renewal, even if the ticket is unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   But if you still have a beef about a ticket or about the
collection service, call DPT boss Fred Hamdun's office at (415)
554-9811. Fred assures me you will be treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE OTHER hand, Muni is looking good.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent Metro rider Cuffs Corbett gives thumbs-up to the new
honor system that allows riders to enter through a rear car or door
without showing a pass/transfer to the operator.
</P>
<P>
   Cars load more quickly, passengers are happier,
drivers/operators are happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nightmare is over,'' says Cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be that easy? Why didn't they do this sooner?
</P>
<P>
   SHOUT OUT to We Three, the jazz trio celebrating the third
anniversary of its nightly gig at John's Grill on Ellis. Guitar
superstar Carl Lockett and the boys could be traveling the world,
but prefer to stay home, thrillin' da Grill.
</P>
<P>
   CONSIDER YOURSELF a grizzled native of San Francisco if you
remember who was the first person to drive the 49-Mile Scenic
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   It was Douglas (Wrong Way) Corrigan, who christened the Drive in
'38 by driving it backwards. I'm not sure if that means he drove
the car backwards, or drove the route from finish to start.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, if you have any cool memories of the Scenic Drive, or
attended the World Fair on Treasure Island ('39 and '40), or have
any comments on the 49-MSD, like favorite spots, call (415)
777-7132.
</P>
<P>
   GAVIN NEWSOM says it's a bum call by the Port Commission to turn
Pier 45 over to a firm that will create a virtual-San Francisco
fun-zone attraction with stuff like an earthquake ride and fake
fog.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Newsom and others favor a plan to build an
interactive environmental center.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen Steve Abney says if the commission winds up getting its
way, let's make the best of it by including such rides as a Parking
Space Race, a Looney Muni-go-'round and an Affordable Housing Hall
of Mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   LONG LINE at the bank, and a man whips out his cell phone and
leaves a message:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, beautiful, just wanted to hear your voice. Sorry I'm not
there, but I just wanted to say that last night was  &UR; wonderful, &LR; 
and I had an absolutely  &UR; great time  &LR; in bed. And I'm going to make
sure it happens again. Ciao.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same line, Don Stevens whispers to his SigOth, Nicole
Bilotti, that it's disgusting to have to listen to some jerk
talking to his babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be so sure,'' Nicole says. ``He's probably leaving the
message on his own answering machine.''

 ANALYSIS: SOCIAL SECURITY PLANS PAINT CONTRAST  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In just over a month, Social Security has gone from
the untouchable ``third rail'' of American politics to the main
vehicle for making every American a stockholder.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's proposal Tuesday to create new
government-subsidized private investment accounts as an add-on to
Social Security vividly demonstrates the rising political clout of
the new ``investor class,'' the nearly half of all households that
now own stock.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal follows a plan announced last month by his
Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, to allow people to
invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in private
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   While the dueling plans make Social Security a defining issue of
the 2000 presidential campaign, they also starkly highlight the
differences between the two candidates, who approach the program
from opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new ``Retirement Savings Plus'' accounts are aimed at
helping lower and middle-income workers _ the core Democratic
constituency _ build retirement savings outside of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan announced Tuesday would give up to $3 in
government subsidies for every $1 invested by an individual who
makes less than $15,000 annually and by couples earning $30,000 or
less. The subsidies would phase out for individuals earning $50,000
and couples earning $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's accounts would do nothing to reform Social Security
itself. The vice president has already announced that he plans to
deal with Social Security's impending insolvency by drawing on
expected future budget surpluses to shore up the program when the
Baby Boom generation begins to retire in just over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan, by contrast, would alter the program itself by
allowing workers to invest some portion _ many outside models
suggest 2 percentage points _ of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that
workers now pay into Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to give workers partial ownership of their Social
Security payroll taxes and to allow them to earn a potentially
higher return than the program's current level of 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, hopes to restructure Social Security by
replacing its government-backed promises to pay future benefits
with actual assets in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan aims to increase savings among poor workers, many
of whom live paycheck to paycheck and depend entirely on Social
Security for their retirement. The problem of extremely low savings
among poor workers has long been a big policy concern because those
workers are likely to find themselves impoverished when they
retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt to make savings more attractive to American
workers can only help,'' said William Arnone, director of employee
financial education at the big  &LR; accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young and a
member of the National Academy of Social Insurance. ``At the end of
the day, the only question that matters is ... `Can I afford not to
work?' And right now, most people are on track never to reach that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has criticized the Bush proposal as ``a risky scheme'' and
``stock-market roulette'' that threatens Social Security benefits.
But the idea of private retirement accounts has proven surprisingly
popular in the polls. Gore's new accounts  &LR; plan contains two
elements of the Bush platform that Gore has frequently criticized:
They would allow investment of government funds in the stock market
and would essentially amount to a large tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore contends that the new accounts, by running parallel to
Social Security, would enhance retirement security without posing
any risk to the program itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan is Social Security plus, not Social Security minus,''
Gore said Tuesday in Lexington, Ky. ``It's the best of both worlds,
not the worst of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an interview Tuesday with The Chronicle, called Gore's
proposal ``an interesting about-face'' on stock market investing
and praised what he called Gore's move ``toward my position ...
because it's the right thing to trust younger workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago that the man was calling my plan to
allow younger workers to invest some of their payroll taxes in the
private sector `roulette,' as if the private markets were, you
know, a kind of huge gamble,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Gore accounts are a retooled and more expensive version
of a program President Clinton proposed last year as part of his
Social Security reform package. The accounts would provide very
 &LR; generous matching funds to low-income workers who choose to set
aside money for their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidies would be highly progressive, starting at the $3
government payment for every $1 saved for low-income workers, and
declining as people earn more money.
</P>
<P>
   Couples earning between $30,000 and $60,000 would get a
dollar-for-dollar government ``match.'' The subsidies would phase
out completely at individual incomes over $50,000, and couple
incomes over $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore adviser Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist,
said the accounts were ``deliberately designed to be most
attractive to people at the bottom and in the middle of the income
distribution. For people at the top it's not attractive at all,
because they would receive no benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign estimates that the accounts would cost the
government $200 billion over 10 years, a fourfold increase over
Clinton's proposal that takes advantage of new projections of
burgeoning government budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Workers could also withdraw from the accounts penalty-free after
five years to pay for college, buy a new house or pay
``extraordinary'' medical expenses. The provision was added to make
the new accounts even more attractive to low-income workers who now
save little.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the biggest incentive for savings ever offered
to people of low incomes,'' Blinder said. ``A 300 percent match is
quite extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   But many policy analysts argued that the Gore retirement
accounts would create a large new entitlement program aimed
primarily at redistributing income to low and middle-income workers
while ignoring Social Security's future fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``To create a new entitlement at this juncture and not get any
mileage at all out of that by bringing Social Security into balance
I just find problematic,'' said Sylvester Siebert, a Social
Security expert and author of ``The Real Deal,'' a new book on the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weinberger, chief of staff of a 1994 presidential
commission on Social Security reform, praised Gore's focus on
retirement security but said the accounts divert attention from
Social Security's financing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does nothing to increase the return of the assets in Social
Security,'' Weinberger said, ``and it does nothing to make the
system more solvent.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberger also said low-income workers will still have to come
up with added savings to take advantage of the new accounts, which
may be difficult for many to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Gore's plan does is say to those people not earning a lot
of money, who are already paying more in payroll taxes than they do
in income taxes, to reach into their pockets and set aside money to
save,'' Weinberger said. Bush's plan, he said, allows poor workers
to invest money that they're already paying in payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even critics of Gore's plan to bail out Social
Security with future surpluses found some merit in the idea of
parallel private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget
Office, said increasing savings is imperative, especially given the
host of ways that the government discourages the building of
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is reason to try to make everybody a capitalist,''
Penner said. ``I'm generally favorable toward any attempt to get
Americans to increase their retirement savings.''

   BRITAIN-ROYALTY-BIRTHDAYS (Windsor, England) _ Five royal
birthdays are to be feted at a gala given by Queen Elizabeth II at
Windsor Castle on Wednesday night, but the celebrator who is the
hope for continuing generations of the beleaguered British monarchy
will be marking his 18 years less ceremoniously. Final exam studies
will keep Prince William in his Eton dormitory room, a 10-minute

phones, demanding the simple, painless test that can find lung
cancers so tiny that they can be snipped out and, doctors hope, the

   VOCATION-SCHOOLS (New York) _ Vocational schools are struggling,
in a high-tech, white-collar era. The range of explanations for the
decline of the city's once vaunted trade schools is wide: budget
cuts and the sense that the schools had become dumping grounds for
students not smart enough to go to college; waning interest among
youngsters worried about making their way in a high-technology
economy; the difficulty of keeping teachers who, in a booming
marketplace, have no trouble finding high-paying work.

ANOTHER FINE OUTING BY COOPER WASTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When Kent Bottenfiled, Ken Hill and Jason
Dickson make their expected returns from the disabled list in the
next week or two, the Anaheim Angels will have to play a game of
musical chairs with their starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   When the music stops, they might have to hold a chair for Brian
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie right-hander from USC continued his bid for a
permanent spot in the rotation with another solid performance,
though he didn't have much to show for it after Kansas City scored
three runs in the top of the ninth to score an 8-6 victory over the
Angels before 16,711 Tuesday night at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive start in which Cooper turned over
a multiple-run lead to the bullpen, only to have Troy Percival blow
it. Last week at Tampa Bay, Cooper threw eight shutout innings
before the Devil Rays scored three times in the ninth against the
Angels closer.
</P>
<P>
   Percival gave up four consecutive hits on Tuesday night without
getting an out in the ninth. The Royals tied the score 6-6 on Mike
Sweeney's single _ his third RBI and fourth hit of the game _ and
took the lead on Joe Randa's single. Luis Ordaz drove in another
run with a two-out single off Mark Petkovsek.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and
dropped them 5 games behind first-place Oakland in the AL West and
3 games behind second-place Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   All this was no fault of Cooper's.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed two runs in the first, then held the Royals to an
unearned run through the sixth. By that time, the Angels had
regained the lead on Tim Salmon's grand slam and a two-run shot by
Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, through six starts, has given the Angels the type of
steady effort they have lacked in a season where nine pitchers have
already been on the disabled list and the healthy ones have been
inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   He is 2-2 despite the two blown leads, has a 3.85 ERA and hasn't
allowed more than four earned runs in any of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   His performance Tuesday night was typical of what the Angels
have received from him. After Sweeney's two-out RBI single staked
the Royals to a 3-0 lead in the third, Cooper retired 10 of the
next 13 Royals.
</P>
<P>
   He did it by inducing Kansas City, which had peppered the middle
of the infield with ground balls early, to keep the ball in the
air. The Royals hit 12 fly balls in all against Cooper, including
five that never left the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper left in the seventh, after his 115th pitch and
back-to-back singles by Johnny Damon and Jeff Reboulet started the
inning. Both runners would score against Shigetoshi Hasegawa, on
Carlos Beltran's sacrifice fly and Randa's single, closing the gap
to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals threatened against Hasegawa in the eighth, getting
runners to second and third with two out, but Reboulet grounded to
third baseman Troy Glaus, whose wild throw was flagged down by
first baseman Mo Vaughn, who tagged a sliding Reboulet.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, meanwhile, didn't do much with Crespi of Encino
graduate Jeff Suppan _ getting only four hits in six innings _ but
they made them count.
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the third, Suppan walked Darin Erstad and Kevin
Stocker, then hit Vaughn on the left elbow with a 2-2 fastball to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   After raising his arms to home plate umpire Ron Kulpa to
complain about a 2-1 offspeed pitch to Salmon that was called a
ball, Suppan threw a fastball that Salmon blasted over the
left-field wall to give the Angels the lead, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson padded the lead to 6-3 in the sixth when he followed a
one-out, four-pitch walk to Salmon with a home run over the
right-field scoreboard.

VIZCAINO TRADED TO YANKS; DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ By the time utility infielder Jose Vizcaino delivered
his go-ahead single in the top of the 10th inning, he was all but
on his way to the New York Yankees. Jim Leyritz, in turn, was set
to be the Los Angeles Dodgers' right-handed power off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The teams had the major points of a trade completed during the
eighth inning of the Dodgers' 10-inning 9-6 win over the Houston
Astros on Tuesday night, and the deal was announced afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But after Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw blew his sixth save in 18
chances, things took on an eeriness. Vizcaino was called on to
pinch-hit in the 10th with the go-ahead run at third and one out.
With the infield in, he grounded a ball off shortstop Tim Bogar's
glove that allowed Paul LoDuca to score. Gary Sheffield added a
three-run homer later in the inning. The Dodgers survived, but
Vizcaino didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a right-handed bat,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``With (Geronimo) Berroa going down, that's something we need
over here. Vizzy has done everything I've ever asked from him, and
it's only fitting that he got the game-winning hit. He'll help them
over in New York and we feel Leyritz will help us here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could catch him occasionally, but basically he's a threat
from the right side, he's an outstanding hitter. Those kind of
people that come off the bench late win you ballgames. It's
something we've been missing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Leyritz, the Dodgers get a proven veteran player who can
provide right-handed power in a pinch. He was hitting .231 (12 for
52) with a homer and four RBI with the Yankees, but he's been on
World Series winners, and the Dodgers like that.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also save a bunch of salary. Both players are in the
final year of contracts, but Vizcaino is making $3.5 million and
Leyritz $1 million. The Dodgers will pick up a slight portion of
Vizcaino's contract, but a final number is yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, 36, who played with Kevin Brown during the San Diego
Padres' run to the National League crown in 1998, won World Series
titles with the Yankees in 1996 and 1999. He can play catcher and
first base, but the Dodgers plan to use him mostly as a pinch
hitter. Leyritz is expected to join the team Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Leyritz) is the bat off the bench,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``Leyritz has championship experience. He's been
on a lot of championship clubs. He knows how to win. He's an
established veteran bat off the bench that can get you that big
hit, and he's an emergency catcher, a third catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers viewed Vizcaino as expendable because of the
development of Alex Cora at shortstop and the way Mark Grudzielanek
has made the transition to second base. He was used under only
extreme situations, though he had the game-winning hit in his last
Dodgers at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not having a good season, but I guess they need a second
baseman who can help out defensively,'' said Vizcaino, 32, who hit
.204 with four RBI in 40 games. ``I'll probably have a chance to
play over there. For sure, I think I'll get more playing time over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   To everyone, it was a crazy ending to a strange game. Brown
allowed four earned runs for the first time this season, Shaw had
trouble holding the lead in the ninth, but 30-year-old rookie Matt
Herges (4-0) came on with two on and none out with the game tied
5-5 and got out of it.
</P>
<P>
   After Vizcaino's RBI single, Sheffield continued his torrid
stretch with a three-run homer. It was his team-leading 21st homer.
He also leads the Dodgers with a .352 average and 61 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in New York before and it's going to be a good
experience,'' said Vizcaino, who signed a three-year, $9.5 million
free agent deal with the Dodgers before the 1998 season. ``I signed
here because I wanted to be close to home and I wanted to play
every day. I started playing every day, then I got hurt and things
didn't go my way. You have to keep working hard and when you get an
opportunity you have to do their job. Now, I have to prove I can
still play.''

Houston Comets at the Forum, that dream may not be so farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (9-2), which took only its second loss of the season,
remains atop the Western Division, but the Sparks proved that this
year's WNBA title is not a given.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes, Tina Thompson and Cynthia Cooper posted big
numbers for Houston, accounting for 62 of the Comets' 81 points,
but the Sparks manged to break Houston's six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we come out and give a concerted effort and don't beat
ourselves by giving up turnovers, we can play with anyone,'' said
Sparks coach Michael Cooper. ``Our team played great defense. We're
a very deep team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who has been hounding his team the past few weeks about
getting the ball in the net, finally got the showing he's been
looking for in the first 20 minutes of the game with successful
shooting from all ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Tamika Dixon's basket sparked a nine-point run that gave the
Sparks a 21-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That run was very important for us,'' Cooper said. ``After
that, our defense settled and started sticking its chest out .. it
gave us a little bit of room.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Houston struggled from the floor but did
manage to stay in the game since they were sent to the line so many
times _ Houston made 18 of their 23 free throws in the first half
and made another 10 of 14 in the final 20.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie, who came up big with seven rebounds in the first half,
almost single handily put it to Houston in the final minutes,
scoring 11 points in a five-minute period to end the evening with
21 points and 14 rebounds.

84 ARE HURT IN SUBWAY DERAILMENT IN BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)  By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eighty-four people were hurt, three of them
critically, when a subway train derailed as it pulled out of a
station in downtown Brooklyn on Tuesday night, hurling passengers
into one another and against the train's windows, causing many head
injuries, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   As the southbound B train left the DeKalb Avenue station at 9:57
p.m., the third car of the silver eight-car train slid off the
track, pulling the second car with it, said Al O'Leary, a spokesman
for New York City Transit. The cars landed upright, but with a
noise that passengers said sounded like an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was total chaos,'' said Tanya Acevedo, a passenger who was
nursing a golfball-sized knob on her forehead. ``There were people
yelling `Oh my God.' They were crying, they were screaming, they
were praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials said they expected service on several subway
lines to be disrupted at least through Wednesday morning rush hour
and reshuffled the routes of those trains.
</P>
<P>
   To clear the way for other trains, workers must lift three
40-ton cars back onto the track, an operation which takes two hours
per car under ideal conditions, O'Leary said. Damage to the tracks
themselves would cause further delay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The DeKalb Avenue station is one of several main transit hubs in
downtown Brooklyn. The B train was traveling on tracks normally
used by the D train because there was a work train blocking the B's
tracks, transit officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment occurred just a few carlengths out of the
station, where the track divides, O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two cars went to the left like they're supposed
to,'' he said, ``but the third car went into the dividing wall''
between the left and right tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment's cause was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   Marina Gerkerova, 22, a school counselor from Bay Ridge,
Brooklyn, said the train started to jerk as it pulled out of the
station. Then there was a huge noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train was off the track,'' she said. ``I saw us next to an
N train and I thought we crashed into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion , she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several people screaming,'' she said. ``A couple of
people were bleeding badly from their faces. When it happened I saw
smoke. The woman next to me grabbed my hand and we went flying into
the window.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman looked over at her. ``There was blood coming down her
face because she smashed in the window and broke it,'' Gerkerova
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that 10 people were taken to
Brooklyn Hospital Center or to Bellevue Hospital Center in
Manhattan. One critically injured passenger had suffered a heart
attack, he said, possibly caused in part by the 100-degree heat in
the subway tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got shook up pretty badly,'' Giuliani said at the
scene. ``Heads were injured and they bounced back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the station, at Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues, the scene
was one of controlled chaos on Tuesday night, with dozens of
emergency vehicles swarming around the normally busy intersection
and about 30 passengers waiting on a triage line as the police
barked orders at them.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, emergency medical technicians commandeered a city bus
and turned it into a makeshift clinic, tying slings around injured
arms, wrapping knees in bandages, and applying ice packs. At 12:05
a.m., the bus carried 24 subway passengers the five blocks from the
DeKalb station to Brooklyn Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Charles, who was on her way home after work, said it felt
like someone had pulled the emergency brake. Passengers fell to the
floor and skidded toward the front of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   She said the conductor spoke over the loudspeaker, telling
passengers he had been injured, and to wait where they were for
paramedics to arrive. Those on the train remained calm, even though
the lights went out and the car doors had opened, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just waited,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo said that as the train pulled out of the station, she
was having a conversation with a friend about the band New Kids on
the Block. Seconds later the train jerked once, then again, the
second time with enough force to throw her headfirst into a fellow
passenger. She looked up to see the floor of the car carpeted with
people.

ABBOTT, RHODES, SASAKI HOLD RAYS AT BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Getting seven innings from a starting pitcher _ that's
music to Lou Piniella's ears.
</P>
<P>
   The man who gave him that Tuesday night, Paul Abbott, seems to
have found the right music for (ITAL) his (END ITAL) ears.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five starts, including a seven-inning effort in a
4-3 victory Tuesday over Tampa Bay at Safeco Field, Abbott has used
the same rotation of music on the day he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   First, Queensr &UR; gfumlaut &LR; yche, followed by a little acoustic
Bryan Adams, then Candlebox. You can see Abbott walking around the
Mariners' clubhouse before his starts, CD player in hand,
headphones duly attached, left and right. He's in his own world,
trying to get ready for battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to admit that I'm superstitious, but that's five games
in a row,'' Abbott said after his seven-inning, four-hit effort.
``Mostly it's positive music that gets me in a positive mood. It's
95 percent hard rock, with a little mellow Bryan Adams mixed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the formula, it seems to be working. In those five
games, Abbott is 3-1 with a 2.67 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has been a major boost for a Mariners rotation
that has yet to coalesce because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott gave us seven good innings on a night we really needed
it,'' Piniella said. ``Our bullpen was used up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game started, Piniella was hoping Abbott could give
him six or seven innings, because early exit by starter John Halama
on Monday had left the Mariners thin in the bullpen. There was no
way the manager wanted to use right-hander Frankie Rodriguez after
he had thrown three long innings. Lefty Rob Ramsay, who had thrown
two innings, wasn't much more likely to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott has had a habit of giving Piniella a lift when the
manager has the fewest resources on hand, and Tuesday night was no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a changeup so hard it looked like a fastball, and
Gerald Williams hit it so hard it looked like a home run. Which it
was, a two-run shot that brought Tampa Bay to within a run at 4-3
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays didn't get another base runner off Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one bad pitch on the home run,'' Piniella admitted.
``But other than that, I'd say he pitched exceedingly well.''
</P>
<P>
   As did Arthur Rhodes, who pitched 11/3 innings of shutout relief
after Abbott's exit. Included was a ninth-inning matchup against
Fred McGriff, a veteran, left-handed slugger who has the most power
in the current Tampa Bay lineup.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff saw nothing but fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't working around him _ I was just trying to keep the
ball down and stay away from the homer,'' Rhodes said. ``But once
it got to 3-0, I threw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   McGriff struck out in what shortstop Alex Rodriguez called
``maybe the biggest at-bat of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was not over, however. Kazuhiro Sasaki took over at
that point to record his 11th save without much of the usual
Kaz-a-ma-tazz that accompanies Sasaki when he pitches at home.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki allowed a bloop single to John Flaherty before striking
out Bobby Smith. After pinch-runner Miguel Cairo had stolen second
and third, Sasaki walked Jose Guillen after getting two quick
strikes on him. That meant veteran Ozzie Guillen had a shot at
tying the game, but Sasaki induced a pop-up for the final out of a
game that was never a lock until Rodriguez squeezed the ball in his
glove.
</P>
<P>
   With Tampa Bay veteran Steve Trachsel pitching a solid game from
start to finish _ he threw a complete game and allowed just five
hits _ Seattle had to scrape and scratch for every run it got.
</P>
<P>
   The renaissance of first baseman John Olerud saw him hit two
more doubles _ he has six doubles in his past six games _ in
setting up the Mariners offense. Olerud scored twice, once on a Joe
Oliver single in the second and again in the third on a two-out
throwing error by Rays shortstop Felix Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olerud's made a little adjustment with his setup, and he's
driving the ball again,'' Piniella said. ``He's starting to come
on, and that's good to see, because we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of the offense belonged to Rickey Henderson.
The left fielder came up with a two-out, bases-loaded single that
accounted for two runs in a three-run second inning after Oliver's
single had scored Olerud for an early 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trachsel's a veteran pitcher,'' Henderson said. ``We both know
how the game is played. I got to a point in the count where he had
to throw a fastball, and I hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple. But simply effective.

SYSTEM OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT DEEPLY FLAWED 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for
commentary on the U.S. Constitution His e-mail address is

<TEXT>
<P>
   The country is finally beginning to experience a backlash
against the blood lust of state executions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, this nation has
executed 646 men and women in state prisons _ with the rate of
state-sanctioned killing increasing dramatically each year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 98 inmates were executed in the United States _ a few
were mentally retarded or mentally ill and a number had committed
their capital crimes when they were juveniles. In 1995, there were
56 inmates executed; by 1997, the number of executions had climbed
to 74.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with criminal investigations and prosecutions of murder
suspects in Illinois have led to the release of more death row
inmates than have been executed since capital punishment was
reinstated in the state in 1977. Illinois Gov. George Ryan, who
supports the death penalty, is so disturbed by the flaws in the
system that he declared a moratorium on executions until the
problems are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, on the other hand, claims he has no
problem with the way capital punishment is meted out in his state.
Texas has executed 221 inmates, more than one-third of all those
executed in the entire country since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may not have a problem with the 131 executions that
occurred during his tenure as governor, but several in-depth
investigations of the death penalty system in Texas reveal deep
flaws that point to the probability that many of those executed by
the state have been innocent of the crime for which they were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has already executed 22 inmates this year, nearly half the
total number of inmates executed in the nation during the same
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   An investigative two-part series of news stories by the Chicago
Tribune, published earlier this month, showed serious flaws in the
trials that led inmates to death row. The Tribune reporters
examined trial transcripts, legal briefs, appellate rulings, lawyer
disciplinary records and interviewed witnesses, lawyers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Tribune, in one-third of the capital crime
cases that were tried during the Bush administration, the
''defendant was represented at trial or on initial appeal by an
attorney who had been or was later disbarred, suspended or
otherwise sanctioned.''
</P>
<P>
   In a significant number of Texas cases, the prosecution
presented damaging testimony from a psychiatrist who predicted that
the defendant would commit future violence _ without ever
interviewing or examining the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune stories report that in many of the capital cases
during the Bush administration, trial outcomes were influenced by
experts whose credentials were worse than suspect: A forensic
scientist, who was temporarily released from a psychiatric ward, in
order to give testimony damaging to the defense; a psychiatrist,
who was nicknamed ``Dr. Death,'' and expelled from the American
Psychiatric Association; and a pathologist who has admitted faking
autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources have pointed to Texas lawyers who slept during
murder trials or who had been drinking, who had no trial experience
when appointed to defend a murder suspect, who never met with their
clients before trial, or who called no witnesses in defense of
their clients.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is so bad in Texas that the U.S. Supreme Court,
not known for coddling criminals or those on death row, vacated the
death sentence of Argentine national Victor H. Saldano because a
court-appointed psychologist had given racially prejudiced
testimony during the sentencing hearing. The psychologist testified
that Saldano was ``a continuing threat to society'' because
Hispanics are more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who argues that murder suspects in Texas get a fair trial
is either blind or ignorant of the facts. And Texas is the
execution capital of the nation _ it plans to execute 14 more
prisoners by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A recently published nine-year study conducted by Columbia Law
School Professor James S. Liebman of death penalty cases between
1973 and 1995 concludes that death penalty cases in the states
``are persistently and systematically fraught with serious error.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that ``during the 23-year study period, the
overall rate of prejudicial error in the American capital
punishment system was 68 percent.'' Those were errors that were
caught. Not all errors are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This much error, and the time needed to cure it,'' the report
states, ``renders unattainable the finality, retribution and
deterrence that are the reasons usually given for having a death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the new questions raised by prosecutorial
misconduct or trial error in regard to death penalty cases,
Congress has initiated the ``Innocence Protection Act'' in both the
House (H.R. 4167) and in the Senate (S. 2690).
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would allow inmates on death row to
request DNA testing on evidence from their case that is in the
government's possession. Many states put restrictions on DNA
testing. This bill would force states to keep biological evidence
and make DNA testing ``available to any person convicted in State
court.'' According to findings made by Congress, at least eight
individuals on death row have been exonerated by DNA testing, some
within days of being executed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides a mechanism to ensure competent legal
representation in capital cases in all the states. And the bill
would require that judges inform juries that life imprisonment
without the possibility of release is an option to the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A judicial system that metes out death cannot be so flawed that
innocent people can and inevitably will be executed. That isn't
justice. It's retribution gone mad.

NEW SYRIA LEADER WANTS TO EASE INTERNET STRICTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS _ Down a deserted sidestreet, into an alley and up
three flights of stairs is ``Zoni Internet Service,'' which claims
to be Syria's only access to the Internet that is open to the
public and not controlled by the government.
</P>
<P>
   In this hidden corner of downtown, a fringe elite that can
afford the fees is going online despite tight Internet controls by
the authoritarian government. They are among the first here to pry
open a new door into the information age.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be arrested for this,'' said one surfer in his early
30s with an advanced degree in chemical engineering, who was
tapping into the Internet via the popular Yahoo portal.
</P>
<P>
   The Yahoo service is blocked at government-controlled sites.
Afterward, the surfer checked his e-mail on the Hotmail service,
the government stops at its sites. Internet sites with a
designation that includes the words ``Israel'' or ``sex'' and a
long list of other words are also blocked.
</P>
<P>
   The regime severely restricts information and limits freedom of
expression. Through control and fear, spies and secret police kept
President Hafez Assad in power for 30 years. But now as his son,
Bashar, moves to replace his father as president, Syria may be on
the edge of opening up to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At least, this is what the 34-year-old, London-educated Bashar
has said he intends to do, knowing just how far the country is
technologically behind its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   A younger generation of students, businessmen, and doctors are
all eager to open Internet access. People know the opportunities
that exist in the information age because they hear it from
relatives who have emigrated or they see it on satellite television
stations, which are also legally banned but the ban is not
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Syria has issued 7,000 tightly controlled ``points of
Internet connection,'' mostly to universities, research institutes,
industry and the tourism sector. Bashar's plan is to have as many
as 200,000 by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Zoni says it is the only site that received a
license before many of the laws restricting Internet access were
put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, members of the ruling Baath Party fear the Internet
could become a tool used to stir opposition. Some said they worry
about the Internet's impact on a traditional culture. But the
biggest concern appears to be a culture of secrecy and tight
control of information.
</P>
<P>
   Zoni Internet Service opened just eight months ago. The manager
of the small, dingy room with six computers and a fan boasts that
it is the closest thing in Syria to an Internet cafe. But you won't
find any ``caffe latte'' here. It is not well-known outside a small
circle of foreigners and a few Syrians. That may be because Zoni is
a luxury for the rich: One hour on-line costs roughly the daily
salary of an average worker.
</P>
<P>
   The service is owned by Yamor Alzoni, whose father was a
military judge with connections to the ruling establishment that
has tolerated his license, Syria's only non-government controlled
access to the Internet available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Alzoni moved in the early 1990s to apply for a license for an
Internet ``access point'' and his family connections allowed him to
achieve the first, and only, one issued for public use by a private
company. All other access points allow only government-issued
e-mail and passwords to be used. It is illegal for a citizen not
registered by the government to use a desktop or laptop at home
with an Internet access phone number.
</P>
<P>
   At Zoni, a select few are exploring the edge of this government
control. They flock to annonymous Web surfing sites such as
``the-cloak.com'' and ``silentsurf.com'' to slip past
government-imposed firewalls, electronic eavesdropping, and blocks.
Some of the sites use encryption to hide the users' identity, and
the information being gathered.
</P>
<P>
   As the government moves almost daily to block these anonymous
surfing sites, the US-based providers provide an updated list of
new and anonymous sounding names to evade detection. These names
are scribbled daily on a whiteboard like specials on a menu, and
today the password is ``sahadifoods.com''.
</P>
<P>
   In one booth, the young Syrian chemical engineer was just
entering silentsurf.com to send an e-mail to a friend expressing a
political opinion that could land him in jail. He asked that his
name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail to a woman in America, he lashed out at what he
calls ``the sheep'' who have been expressing public sorrow for
Assad, whose iron-fisted rule left the nation politically paralyzed
and economically far behind. He clicked away on the computer
composing this e-mail:
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheep people say nothing, instead they go to his funeral
and they cry for him!!! I cry for another reason. I was dreaming of
that moment when a man can say ``No'' in his own, loud sound but
nothing will happen to him . . . . Now I am thinking I must leave
my country forever because it is a hopeless one.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts are not heard in public or read in newspapers or
books. But others use the Internet not for political expression,
but for business.
</P>
<P>
   Raffi Kevorkian, 29, a jewelry designer, comes three or four
times a week to check the price of gold in the world markets. He
also studies designs of other jewelers who are online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too interested in political things,'' he said, adding
the wealth of his family allows him to go online but most of the
young people he knows in Syria have never been online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bashar has an open mind, a scientific person. He will do
many things with computers, technology and open up the economy.
This is what we hope for.''
</P>
<P>
   Imad Sakhal, 28, the manager of the site, said, ``People find a
way to use this tool. And it's going to come whether they want it
to or not. It's too big for them to try to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all members of the government are trying to stop it. The
Computer Society, a 10-member government board of professionals is
headed by Bashar Assad, is trying to hold the hand of the Baath
Party elite as Syria creeps forward into the information age.
</P>
<P>
   Saadalla Agha Kalaa, one board member, said the group was
founded in 1989 but only became active in 1994 with Bashar. Bashar
learned computer applications for ophthalmology when he was
studying in London. Board members who know Bashar said he is very
anxious to open up the Internet. He is constantly surfing the
Internet and is proud to say he is a ``Mac person,'' favoring Apple
computers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Syrian policy is reflected in a five-year plan. The
approach seems to cut against the whole idea of the Internet, which
opens doors to information and allows people to develop key skills
for technology, science, and commerce.
</P>

   Explaining the slow apporach, Kalaa said, ``It is not a problem
of information, it is a problem of infrastructure. We simply do not
have the phone lines and the switches to open this to everyone. It
would completely shut down our communication system.''

<P>
   Sadik Azm, an analyst and philosopher at the University of
Damascus who has just returned from several years in the United
States, warned against regarding the Internet as Syria's savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening up of Syria is not merely a question of the
Internet; this is reductive and unrealistic,'' he said. ``You could
still have the technology of the Internet, the dish, satellite TV
and maintain a more traditionally closed society. I think there are
more important decisions to make on the economy, and those lie
ahead.''

SYSTEM OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT DEEPLY FLAWED

<P>
   The country is finally beginning to experience a backlash
against the blood lust of state executions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, this nation has
executed 646 men and women in state prisons _ with the rate of
state-sanctioned killing increasing dramatically each year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 98 inmates were executed in the United States _ a few
were mentally retarded or mentally ill and a number had committed
their capital crimes when they were juveniles. In 1995, there were
56 inmates executed; by 1997, the number of executions had climbed
to 74.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with criminal investigations and prosecutions of murder
suspects in Illinois have led to the release of more death row
inmates than have been executed since capital punishment was
reinstated in the state in 1977. Illinois Gov. George Ryan, who
supports the death penalty, is so disturbed by the flaws in the
system that he declared a moratorium on executions until the
problems are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, on the other hand, claims he has no
problem with the way capital punishment is meted out in his state.
Texas has executed 221 inmates, more than one-third of all those
executed in the entire country since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may not have a problem with the 131 executions that
occurred during his tenure as governor, but several in-depth
investigations of the death penalty system in Texas reveal deep
flaws that point to the probability that many of those executed by
the state have been innocent of the crime for which they were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has already executed 22 inmates this year, nearly half the
total number of inmates executed in the nation during the same
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   An investigative two-part series of news stories by the Chicago
Tribune, published earlier this month, showed serious flaws in the
trials that led inmates to death row. The Tribune reporters
examined trial transcripts, legal briefs, appellate rulings, lawyer
disciplinary records and interviewed witnesses, lawyers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Tribune, in one-third of the capital crime
cases that were tried during the Bush administration, the
''defendant was represented at trial or on initial appeal by an
attorney who had been or was later disbarred, suspended or
otherwise sanctioned.''
</P>
<P>
   In a significant number of Texas cases, the prosecution
presented damaging testimony from a psychiatrist who predicted that
the defendant would commit future violence _ without ever
interviewing or examining the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune stories report that in many of the capital cases
during the Bush administration, trial outcomes were influenced by
experts whose credentials were worse than suspect: A forensic
scientist, who was temporarily released from a psychiatric ward, in
order to give testimony damaging to the defense; a psychiatrist,
who was nicknamed ``Dr. Death,'' and expelled from the American
Psychiatric Association; and a pathologist who has admitted faking
autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources have pointed to Texas lawyers who slept during
murder trials or who had been drinking, who had no trial experience
when appointed to defend a murder suspect, who never met with their
clients before trial, or who called no witnesses in defense of
their clients.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is so bad in Texas that the U.S. Supreme Court,
not known for coddling criminals or those on death row, vacated the
death sentence of Argentine national Victor H. Saldano because a
court-appointed psychologist had given racially prejudiced
testimony during the sentencing hearing. The psychologist testified
that Saldano was ``a continuing threat to society'' because
Hispanics are more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who argues that murder suspects in Texas get a fair trial
is either blind or ignorant of the facts. And Texas is the
execution capital of the nation _ it plans to execute 14 more
prisoners by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A recently published nine-year study conducted by Columbia Law
School Professor James S. Liebman of death penalty cases between
1973 and 1995 concludes that death penalty cases in the states
``are persistently and systematically fraught with serious error.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that ``during the 23-year study period, the
overall rate of prejudicial error in the American capital
punishment system was 68 percent.'' Those were errors that were
caught. Not all errors are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This much error, and the time needed to cure it,'' the report
states, ``renders unattainable the finality, retribution and
deterrence that are the reasons usually given for having a death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the new questions raised by prosecutorial
misconduct or trial error in regard to death penalty cases,
Congress has initiated the ``Innocence Protection Act'' in both the
House (H.R. 4167) and in the Senate (S. 2690).
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would allow inmates on death row to
request DNA testing on evidence from their case that is in the
government's possession. Many states put restrictions on DNA
testing. This bill would force states to keep biological evidence
and make DNA testing ``available to any person convicted in State
court.'' According to findings made by Congress, at least eight
individuals on death row have been exonerated by DNA testing, some
within days of being executed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides a mechanism to ensure competent legal
representation in capital cases in all the states. And the bill
would require that judges inform juries that life imprisonment
without the possibility of release is an option to the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A judicial system that metes out death cannot be so flawed that
innocent people can and inevitably will be executed. That isn't
justice. It's retribution gone mad.

 &HT;    Parking scam is just good business
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A hearty round of congratulations is in order
for the enterprising Austin street people who pose as parking
attendants at parking lots and collect fees. Police say these folks
can make more than $100 a night.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty good money. Maybe I should buy myself a butler's
outfit and look into this.
</P>
<P>
   One place the transients try to collect parking fees is under
Interstate 35 between Sixth and Eighth streets, where parking is
supposed to be free. This idea is economically sound, because it
makes use of space that wasn't bringing in any funds. I look
forward to the day when an opportunistic crew of unauthorized
parking attendants in orange vests fills the Capitol lawn with SUVs
for the Pecan Street Festival.
</P>
<P>
   I say more power to these scam artists. It's encouraging to know
our transients have become inventive enough to branch out beyond
the banal collection of spare change.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say there aren't other fields of opportunity yet
untapped by street people that they should look into. How about the
position of impromptu elevator operator?
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows there are enough unmanned (unpersoned?) high-rise
elevators downtown that could use a guy to hold the doors open and
let people off on their floors, in exchange for tips.
</P>
<P>
   Shoot, if a guy came up with a spiffy doorman's suit with big
brass buttons and one of those little round hats, he could march
into 100 Congress Avenue, the Bank of America building or the Omni
Hotel and start working the tenants.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of activity is going on all over town, and I'm all for
it. Texans traditionally are reluctant to help the poor, so if the
poor can help themselves, why discourage them?
</P>
<P>
   The other day on East Sixth Street a free-lance window washer
walked up and asked if he could wash my car w or so later, the car
windows were clean, and the car wasn't up on blocks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I wasn't so sure about the self-proclaimed
auto body repairman who pulled up beside me in the parking lot of
the new Albertson's supermarket at Interstate 35 and Stassney Lane.
``Hey, mister, I'll fix your dents,'' the driver said, looking at
my car. ``What dents?'' I asked. I had just gotten my car out of
the body shop a few days earlier. ``Hey, man, I'm trying to raise
money for Mother's Day,'' the guy said. The trouble was, it was
Mother's Day. So when he offered to come to my house and fix my
alleged dents, I declined.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are unauthorized fields of opportunity that remain
open to the imaginative. How about tourism? A group of transients
could set up a booth at 11th Street and Congress Avenue with a
``Walking Tours'' sign and charge passers-by $20 a head for foot
tours of the Capitol, the grounds of the Governor's Mansion and
other points of interest. Just drag the tourists right on into the
Rotunda and show them around. Who better than a street person who
has tramped all over town to point out Austin's highlights?

 &HT;    Prayer ruling best way to keep government from taking sides
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The same day that the Supreme Court reaffirmed the separation of
church and state, wire stories told of another deadly battle
between Christians and Muslims in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of killing between the warring religions in
Indonesia left at least 116 people dead, 292 homes burned and one
church destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   These deadly religious battles have been going on for more than
a year. An estimated 2,500 Christians and Muslims have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Christians, who are a distinct minority in Indonesia but a
majority where the fighting has occurred, have suffered the
greatest during the religious fighting.
</P>
<P>
   History overflows with examples of lethal religious intolerance,
a fact that did not escape this nation's founders.
</P>
<P>
   The first sentence in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights
says, ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The ``establishment clause'' was meant to foster religious
tolerance by giving citizens the right to exercise individual
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   What the government cannot do is take sides in religious
matters. The government cannot favor one religion over another even
when one religion is dominant in terms of membership.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the Bill of Rights was to put restraints on
government while giving express rights to individual citizens. The
Bill of Rights protects individuals and minorities from the tyranny
of the majority, especially from oppressive state powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas school prayer case decisively reaffirmed the founders'
beliefs embodied in the clause that says government has no business
sponsoring religion.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices struck down an effort by Santa Fe
school officials to allow student prayers on the public address
system before football games.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe officials were sued by two anonymous families, one
Mormon and the other Catholic. These two religions are distinct
minorities in the town of 10,000 in western Galveston County.
</P>
<P>
   Before the courts instructed school officials to knock it off,
Santa Fe students were interrogated in an effort to ferret out the
families who brought the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Kennedy, a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
reported that the same week that a student prayed before a Friday
night Santa Fe High School Indians' football game, a group of
students surrounded Santa Fe eighth-grader Phil Nevelow and
chanted:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler missed one! No more Jews!
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler missed one! He should have gotten you!''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother told Kennedy that Santa Fe school officials
have done nothing all year about the slurs hurled at her son, the
only Jewish student in a town with only two Jewish families.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe, Nevelow told Kennedy, is not just divided, ``It's
fractured'' over the prayer case. ``Us, the Catholic families, the
Mormon families _ it's as if this is war and we're all on the other
side. Everybody else is against all of us. Nobody will even have a
logical discussion. You try to start a conversation, and people
just start shouting at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Santa Fe teens now face juvenile charges in connection
with a terroristic threat on a school bus to ``hang'' Nevelow,
``you dirty Jew.'' The Santa Fe superintendent reportedly called
the incident a ``teen-age prank.''
</P>
<P>
   While the government cannot force religious tolerance into the
hearts of individual Americans, it can promote religious
intolerance by taking sides in religious matters. That's the
constitutional principle reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the
Santa Fe lawsuit.

 &HT;    Nature's gardens sing call of the wild
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Blue sky, cool temperatures, mercifully low humidity
for a June day in Dixie. Indeed, it was a fine time for a walk in
the garden. Nature's garden. And so we ambled, dozens of us nature
lovers, just after the dedication of the Lady Bird Johnson
Wildflower Trail, at Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The trail, named for the legendary founder of the Lady Bird
Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, Texas (of whose board I am a
member), begins near the Pioneer Log Cabin and gently winds its way
into the woods, offering close-up, in-action looks at shrubs,
trees, flowers, ferns, mosses and any other living thing you'd hope
to see during a woodland stroll. It is, to be sure, a trail of
nature, something that becomes more and more priceless as time and
clean air go by.
</P>
<P>
   Our walk was my latest reminder of efforts to green America,
efforts that should intensify with heightened concern over
ecological damage from hyper-development, and overburdened,
drought-ridden water supplies. Too, those efforts will be spurred
by the coming bulge of retirees demanding solace in unspoiled
places after a lifetime of slogging through polluteks close up.
</P>
<P>
   While each organization has its own focus, all have this in
common: They work to protect and preserve and promote nature's
beautiful, necessary bounty _ from the trust's riverside greenways,
to the botanical garden's all-around, inspiring cultivation, to the
history center's storytelling gardens. Through action and
instruction, each teaches the value of nature in harmony, its
contributions to our quality of life, such as trees' money-saving
cooling ability, herbs' medicinal value, shrubs' erosion control _
and, of course, the beauty of them all.
</P>
<P>
   Every walk through a garden reminds us of nature's gifts. So it
is with a walk through nature's gardens: the trails at Callaway,
those at the Botanical Garden, the History Center, along the
Chattahoochee River, those on our own land.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional gardens more groomed, fed and weeded,
native-plant-rich trails, even while tended to keep them
accessible, sing that call of the wild, beckoning us to the
un-doneness of a trailful of hearty, drought-tolerant natives. What
eloquent persuasion. In many different ways, we're all trying to
get back to the garden. Tramping along a trail somewhere, anywhere,
discovering trillium, Christmas fern, jack-in-the-pulpit,
columbine, joe-pye weed, hearts-a-bustin', sweet shrub and indigo
takes us there. Back to the days when it was easier to find these
plants in gardens and woods. To the days when water was purer, air
cleaner and life simpler. No wonder, then, that the people I joined
on the Callaway trail got such complicated joy from simple
beauties, countless ones, including purple coneflower, Solomon's
seal, black-eyed Susan and mountain laurel.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder we took such delight in our seed-scattering ceremony,
imitating nature's summer and fall sowing (though our dirt was
tilled to improve seed-soil contact), anticipating a new crop of
wild things. No wonder; for a few precious minutes, we had found
ourselves in the right place. Wondrous.

 &HT;    Gallin's decision one of care
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Perphaps the most puz- zling aspect of Dayton
school board member Mario Gallin's decision to send her son to
private school has been the muted response from parents.
</P>
<P>
   Gallin campaigned as a Dayton parent last November. Don't
parents feel betrayed, now that she is no longer one of them?
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton school board member knew there might be controversy.
Yet Ann Marie Gallin _ nicknamed Mario Andretti after plowing the
family car into the side of the house at 15 _ doesn't strike you as
the type who worries about winning popularity contests. ``I didn't
wrestle, 'Oh my gosh, are people going to yell at me?' I am first
and foremost responsible for this child.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallin hasn't received any calls from parents in the district,
but some have expressed public disappointment. ``If the schools
aren't good enough for her kids, why should we send ours to them?''
Bradie Brummett asked the Dayton Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brummett, too, is pulling her son out of the district.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the heart of the matter. Dayton parents may be
disappointed _ but they've also been there. ``It looks bad, but
only you can decide what's best for your child,'' said my friend
Cris King, who has two children in the district.
</P>
<P>
   So, far, the harshest criticism has come not from parents, but
from teachers union President Joyce Fulwiler Shawhan, who called
the decision a ``slap in the face'' to teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Gallin maintains the move is not ``an anti-Dayton Public Schools
statement.'' It is a choice, she said, in the best interests of her
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't run to make things better for my child,'' she said.
``I wanted to make things better for the community's children.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallin came to parenthood late, and through unconventional
means. Four years ago, at 41, she married Thomas Ruddick, a
professor at Edison Community College in Piqua. Although she
decided against having children because of her age, ``we knew we
wanted to do something with children and with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, that took the form of volunteering to be a ``Big
Couple'' through Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Greater Dayton. They
were matched with a 10-year-old boy who, within several months,
came to live in their Walnut Hills home. They are legal guardians
for the boy, now 13.

<P>
   At the end of his sixth-grade year, before entering middle
school, Gallin's son auditioned for Stivers School for the Arts.
When he was not accepted, she looked at other options. Gallin
became sold on Chamiande-Julienne because of its strong
extracurricular activities and community involvement program.
</P>
<P>
   Is she setting a bad example for parents who decide to ``stick
it out?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they think of it as 'sticking it out,' they're making the
wrong decision,'' Gallin said. ``We need to make Dayton Public
Schools a strong option for parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallin has vowed she will stay involved as a mentor or tutor in
Dayton Public Schools. But parents have reason to worry if her
decision will diminish one of her greatest strengths as a board
member: her ability to identify with parental frustration caused by
poor service from transportation and other boondoggles. Will
Gallin's sharp perspective on issues that affect parents fade when
she is no longer directly affected by such decisions? Gallin
doesn't think so: ``Parents have supported my decision in that I
believe in doing what's best for my child.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, at least, she will always be one of them.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com

<P>
   Q: A recent obituary for Mark Hughes, founder of the Herbalife
Corp., said an autopsy was planned. I didn't see a follow-up about
the results. Do you have any update?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Los Angeles County coroner's office determined that
Hughes died accidentally as the result of a lethal combination of
alcohol and an anti-depressant. Hughes, 44, was found dead on May
21 in his Malibu, Calif., mansion. The autopsy was performed
because of his relatively young age.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' blood-alcohol level at the time of death was found to be
0.21 percent, nearly three times the legally defined level of
intoxication, and he had an elevated level of the drug doxepin,
said Scott Carrier, spokesman for the coroner's office. Doxepin
sometimes is prescribed for anxiety-induced sleeplessness, and it
is thought that's why Hughes was using it. Neither the alcohol nor
the drug was present in sufficient quantity to have been the sole
cause of death, Carrier added.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication of foul play or intentional overdose. On
the day of his death, Hughes attended his grandmother's birthday
party, where he consumed alcohol, according to Herbalife.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Herbalife Web site, Hughes became interested in
nutrition at 18 when his mother, JoAnn Hughes, died of an
accidental overdose from prescription diet pills. Along with
Richard Marconi, a former colleague at Slender Now, Hughes started
the multimillion-dollar Herbalife empire in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Bagpipes often are played at funerals and other solemn
ceremonies involving police and firefighters. How did this
tradition begin?
</P>
<P>
   A: The practice of using bagpipes at the funerals of
firefighters and police officers began in the 19th century in
Northeast cities, particularly New York and Boston, where many of
the members came from the ranks of Irish and Scottish immigrants.
It apparently came from the use of bagpipes at funerals in the
Scottish military.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the playing of bagpipes spread from the Northeast to
cities everywhere and now is standard procedure, no matter the
ethnic descent of the police officer or firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've just learned that a friend in England has been awarded
an OBE, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, on Queen
Elizabeth's Birthday Honors List. Do you know how many people
received that honor this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: About 240. The list honors people in all walks of life _
politicians, civil servants, business people, doctors, teachers and
others _ for their contributions to their professions and to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   The honors, in descending order, are knighthood and its female
equivalent, dame; CBE (Commander of the Order of the British
Empire); OBE; and MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire).
</P>
<P>
   Double Oscar-winning actor Michael Caine was awarded a
knighthood, heading a list of celebrities in the honors list that
included Sam Mendes, director of the Oscar-winning film ``American
Beauty'' (CBE); Harry Potter author Joanne K. Rowling (OBE);
thriller writer Dick Francis (CBE); pop singer Lulu Kennedy-Cairns,
whose professional name is simply Lulu (OBE); Tina Brown,
British-born editor of New York's Talk magazine (CBE); and fashion
designer Paul Smith (knighthood), whose clients include British
Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A high school teacher recently won $1 million on ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' by correctly answering this question: Which
of the following men doesn't have a chemical element named after
him? (A) Albert Einstein; (B) Isaac Newton; (C) Niels Bohr; (D)
Enrico Fermi. The answer was Newton. My question: What chemical
elements are named after the other three?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are einsteinium (chemical symbol Es, atomic number 99);
bohrium (symbol Bh, atomic number 107); and fermium (symbol Fm,
atomic number 100).
</P>
<P>
   All three are artificially created radioactive elements. Of the
109 recognized elements, 91 occur naturally on or in Earth, almost
all of them only in compounds, Scientists produced most of the
remaining 18, as well as three more not yet recognized by the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, in particle
accelerators.
</P>
<P>
   Einsteinium was discovered in 1952 and was first produced in
laboratory experiments in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Production of bohrium was announced in 1976 by scientists at the
Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, near Moscow. Until
1997, when the element was given its official name, bohrium
commonly was referred to simply as ``element 107.''
</P>
<P>
   Named for the Italian nuclear physicist who produced the first
controlled nuclear chain reaction, fermium was discovered in 1953
by a team of American scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After the Iridium satellite telecommunications system was
shut down, it was reported that the satellites might be sent back
into Earth's atmosphere to burn up. I never saw a follow-up. Do you
know the status?
</P>
<P>
   A: Motorola Inc., Iridium's biggest investor, said in late May
it was continuing to provide maintenance services for the bankrupt
global telephone and paging company's 66 low-Earth orbiting
satellite system ``for a limited time.'' Iridium, which announced
last August that it was seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,
terminated commercial service in March.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola says the satellites are Iridium-owned assets subject to
the oversight of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District
of New York, and ``a plan is in place to decommission the system''
once the deorbiting plan is finalized. Details will be announced
publicly at that time, Motorola told Q&AMP;A June12.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: In answering a recent question about manners, Q&AMP;A cited the
famous book ``Emily Post's Etiquette'' and mentioned that it was by
Peggy Post. Who is she?
</P>
<P>
   A: The newest member of the Post family to inherit Emily Post's
role, Peggy is married to Allen Post, Emily's great-grandson. Peggy
succeeded her mother-in-law, Elizabeth L. Post.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Washington, D.C., Peggy grew up in the Maryland suburbs
of Washington and in New Orleans. After graduating from Louisiana
State University, she worked for Chemical Bank and Merrill Lynch
Relocation Management.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, Peggy has represented the Emily Post Institute by
making personal appearances at bridal shows, and in September 1995
she took over the monthly etiquette column written for Good
Housekeeping. At the same time she began expanding her
participation in preparing the Emily Post books.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever became of Linda Kasabian, a member of the Charles
Manson ``family''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kasabian has virtually dropped out of sight since the
infamous August 1969 murder spree and subsequent trial of Manson
and his cult followers.
</P>
<P>
   She was granted immunity for testifying for the state that she
kept watch outside the California residence of actress Sharon Tate
during the murders of Tate and four others, then rode with Manson
the following night as he sought new victims at random, choosing
Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in their home near Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   At last report _ and that was in 1989 _ Kasabian was living in
the Milford, N.H., area, where she was raising four children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lisa Stark has been a regular reporter on ABC Nightly News
for some time. Within the past two or three years, Betsy Stark also
has come aboard. Are they related?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Normandy beaches were named Omaha, Utah, Sword, Juno and
Gold. What do those names mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: They don't mean anything, in the sense that they were shaped
like Utah or a sword, or were the site of gold discoveries. They
simply were code names assigned by the Allies for clear
communications about target areas when the assault troops of the
combined Allied armies (American, British and Canadian) landed on
the Normandy coast June 6, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The French would have referred to the various stretches of the
Normandy coastline by their areas. What was code-named Sword would
have been the area stretching between Riva-Bella and St. Aubin, for
instance; Utah, between Isigny and Quineville.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently told us about the origin of 7Up. In a similar
vein, can you tell us how Dr Pepper got its name?
</P>
<P>
   A: A doctor was involved, but he didn't invent the drink _
which, as everyone knows, doesn't have a period in its name.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story it was invented in Waco, Texas, at
Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store. In 1885 _ the year before John
Stith Pemberton invented Coca-Cola _ Charles Alderton, a pharmacist
who worked at Morrison's, experimented on a soft drink, mixing
phosphorescent water, fruit juice, sugar and other ingredients. He
offered it to customers, one of whom jokingly called the concoction
``Dr. Pepper's drink,'' referring to Dr. Charles Pepper, the
disapproving father of a woman Morrison had been courting.
</P>
<P>
   When the drink became popular in Waco, beverage chemist Robert
Lazenby decided to participate in the development and marketing of
the new product. Lazenby agreed to go into partnership with the
owners of Morrison's drugstore to produce the beverage at his
Circle A Ginger Ale Co., also in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Alderton, meanwhile, disassociated himself from the enterprise,
opting instead to return to the pharmaceutical trade.

<P>
   Q: Has a final report been issued into the crash of the plane
carrying golfer Payne Stewart and several others?
</P>
<P>
   A: The crash investigation is continuing. Paul Schlamm of the
National Transportation Safety Board told Q&AMP;A that a final report
probably won't be issued until sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation into the Oct. 25, 1999, crash of the chartered
Learjet has centered on a loss of cabin pressure, the cause of
which remains undetermined. When the pilots were unable to correct
the situation, everyone aboard apparently succumbed to hypoxia, or
oxygen starvation.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft had taken off from Orlando and was supposed to go
to Dallas. But it flew, apparently on autopilot, until running out
of fuel and crashing in South Dakota. In addition to Stewart,
others killed in the crash were the pilot, Michael Kling; co-pilot
Stephanie Bellegarrigue; golf course architect Bruce Borland; and
Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, officials of a sports agency
representing Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Stan Drake, who used to draw the cartoon
strip ``Blondie''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Drake died on March 10, 1997, in Norwalk, Conn. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent question on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' asked:
``Where is the Sargasso Sea?'' The answer was the Atlantic Ocean.
How large is it, and what's the difference between a sea and an
ocean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Sargasso Sea covers about 2 million square miles. It has
no land boundaries separating it from the rest of the open ocean,
making a precise determination of its size impossible. But
scientists say it's an oval-shaped area in the North Atlantic
roughly between the 20th and 40th parallels of north latitude and
between the 35th and 75th meridians west of Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   It's set apart from surrounding waters only by the presence of
seaweeds that float on its surface. The name Sargasso derives from
sargaco, Portuguese for seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   Seas are smaller bodies of water within oceans, such as the
Mediterranean and the Caribbean seas, part of the Atlantic; and the
Bering and South China seas, part of the Pacific. In some contexts,
the words are interchangeable: World Book Encyclopedia says an
ocean is ``the great body of water that covers more than 70 percent
of the Earth's surface. People also call it the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The American Film Institute recently released its list of the
100 best comedy movies of all time. Where can I find this list? Can
you print the top 10 ?
</P>
<P>
   A: A link to the complete list can be found online at
www.afionline.org/. The top 10, in descending order: ``Some Like It
Hot,'' ``Tootsie,'' ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``Annie Hall,'' ``Duck
Soup,'' ``Blazing Saddles,'' ``MASH,'' ``It Happened One Night,''
``The Graduate'' and ``Airplane!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is the oldest living offspring of an American president,
now that John Coolidge has died? And can you give us some
information about that person?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower, who was born Aug. 3, 1922,
in Denver, to Dwight and Mamie Doud Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy in 1944, he served in
the Army from 1944 until resigning in March 1963, one year short of
the 20-year minimum required for pension eligibility. As Colonel
Eisenhower later explained, ``Dad had done so well in the military.
I thought it best to try another profession.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined Doubleday as an editor and researcher until 1964, when
he took a position as executive vice president of the Freedoms
Foundation in Valley Forge, Pa. In 1965 he left that job to begin
full-time research for his book, ``The Bitter Woods,'' about Allied
operations in Europe in World War II. He served as U.S. ambassador
to Belgium from 1969 to 1971, then turned again to writing and
editing. His last book was ``So Far From God: The U.S. War With
Mexico, 1846-48,'' published by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   He generally avoids publicity, but made the news most recently
last November when he was in Washington for the renaming of the Old
Executive Office Building. Its new name: the Dwight D. Eisenhower
Executive Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the members of the U.S. delegation who went with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Damascus, Syria, for the
June 13 funeral of Syrian President Hafez Assad?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department listed these names: Ryan Crocker, U.S.
ambassador to Syria; Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.); Dennis Ross, State
Department special Middle East adviser; Jesse Jackson, special
envoy to the secretary of state and President Clinton for the
promotion of democracy in Africa; Toni Verstandig, deputy assistant
secretary of state for Middle East affairs; Daniel Abraham,
chairman of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic
Cooperation; and Dr. Issam Cheikh of the National Arab-American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is totally appropriate that we pay respects to a
historic figure and that we express our condolences to the people
of Syria,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac was the only Western leader to
attend the ceremony. Assad died June 10 of a heart attack after
years of declining health.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to get a videotape copy of a program shown on
C-SPAN? I want to give my grandchildren the excellent one shown
recently about the dedication of a D-Day museum in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, C-SPAN makes such programs available on videotape. To
order ``Opening of the D-Day Museum'' by charge to a credit card,
call 1-877-662-7726 or visit C-SPAN Archives' online video shopping
site, www.c-spanstore.com/157540.html. It costs $39.95 plus $7 for
shipping. Or send a check, made out to C-SPAN Archives, to: C-SPAN
Archives, P.O. Box 66809, Indianapolis, IN 46266-6809. Be sure to

</P>
<P>
   Q: I was in the Army from July 1, 1948, to April 21, 1957. Due
to several moves, I'm unable to locate my discharge papers. I need
them to seek benefits. Where can I get replacement documents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Assuming that your records weren't among those destroyed in a
disastrous 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center in
St. Louis, you can get duplicate discharge or separation papers by
writing: National Personnel Records Center, Military Personnel
Records, 9700 Page Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63132-5100. Specify that a
duplicate separation document or discharge is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Your full name should be typed or clearly printed. The request
also must contain your signature. Include branch of service,
service number or Social Security number, and exact or approximate
dates and years of service. Use Standard Form 180, ``Request
Pertaining to Military Records,'' available from VA offices or at
the VA forms Web site (www.va.gov/forms/default.asp).
</P>
<P>
   The VA says it isn't necessary to request a duplicate copy of
discharge or separation papers solely for the purpose of filing a
claim for VA benefits. If complete information about the veteran's
service is furnished on the application, VA will verify with the
National Personnel Records Center or the service department.
</P>
<P>
   More information can be obtained from any VA office, or call
1-800-827-1000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in knowing how a member of Congress has voted
over the years on certain issues. Is such information available on
the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Project Vote Smart has information on voting records of
any member of Congress. Go to www.vote-smart.org and, in the red
box, click on Issues. Under Categories, click on Voting Records. On
the U.S. map, click on the member's state and find your person.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that with the recent closing of the last Howard
Johnson's restaurant in Massachusetts, only 29 remain in the United
States. Can you list all the locations?
</P>
<P>
   A: There actually are 26 Howard Johnson's ``full'' restaurants
in the United States, said Barbara Leverone of Franchise Associates
in Weymouth, Mass. The restaurants are in Connecticut (Darien and
Waterbury); Delaware (Claymont and two locations in Wilmington);
Florida (Key Largo, Hollywood Beach and St. Petersburg Beach);
Maine (Bangor); Maryland (Millington); Massachusetts (Greenfield);
Michigan (Bay City); Missouri (Kirkwood); New Hampshire (Nashua);
New Jersey (Asbury Park); New York (Albany, Lake George, Lake
Placid and New York City); Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh, Pittston and
White Haven); Vermont (Springfield); and Virginia (Front Royal,
Harrisonburg and Lexington).
</P>
<P>
   There also are five Howard Johnson's ice cream shops: three in
Puerto Rico and one each in Florida and Massachusetts.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro wrestling might be taking a turn toward becoming safer.
</P>
<P>
   This week, World Wrestling Federation officials asked wrestlers
to cut back on finishing moves (DDTs, Tomestone Piledrivers and
Brainbusters) that could cause opponents to land on the top of
their head. The first wrestler affected was Perry Saturn, who will
lose the Brainbuster for a Flying Elbow Drop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the New Jersey Senate has begun hearings on ``extreme
wrestling'' legislation. The bill has already passed the New Jersey
State Assembly. This is not good news for Extreme Championship
Wrestling, which is based in Philadelphia and does a dozen shows in
New Jersey. The legislation would also affect smaller New
Jersey-based promotions, Jersey All-Pro Wrestling and Combat Zone
Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last Wednesday General Electric Co.'s NBC and the WWF
completed an agreement to jointly own and fund the spring pro
football league, the Xtreme Football League. In March, NBC agreed
to buy about $30 million in new shares of WWF Class A common stock,
giving it a stake of about 3 percent in the company and half
ownership of the XFL. The eight-team XFL is scheduled to start play
in February 2001. As part of the agreement, NBC has committed to
broadcast regional and national XFL games on Saturday nights in
prime time and the XFL championship game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some WWF money may be going to ECW. The WWF has offered
conditionalloans to ECW, but the WWF is not interested in owning
ECW, according to Internet reports.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tazz will return to the ring for the WWF in July. He suffered
a partially torn tricep. Meanwhile, Billy Gunn is still looking at
a September return from a torn rotator cuff. After working in
Memphis for the WWF for the past few months, Steven Regal will
return to the ring soon.
</P>
<P>
   _ After serving a 30 day suspension for allegedly assaulting a
member of the WCW production crew, Buff Bagwell was on last week's
Nitro and should begin a return to top-face status.
</P>
<P>
   _ Want to be as fit as Chyna? Soon you will have a chance as she
will release her own fitness videos.
</P>
<P>
   _ After finishing a program at the Gret American Bash, Sting and
Vampiro are both unhappy with the WCW. Sting's month-long hiatus
after last Sunday's match means a change of gimmicks, but Sting
wants to know why they want to change something that isn't broken.
Meanwhile, Vampiro wants to be paired with someone other than the
Demon for the next month. The Demon is a low-carder at best and
could drag Vampiro down from main-event status. Vampiro also was
unhappy about being asked to beat up a woman at the Thunder tapings
because his family has a history of spousal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   _ While many wrestlers are unhappy in the WCW, their newest
acquistion, Lance Storm, should debut before July. He should join
the New Bloods and align with Shane Douglas and Chris Candido as a
former ECW team.

   Q: A recent obituary for Mark Hughes, founder of the Herbalife
Corp., said an autopsy was planned. I didn't see a follow-up about
the results. Do you have any update?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Los Angeles County coroner's office determined that
Hughes died accidentally as the result of a lethal combination of
alcohol and an anti-depressant. Hughes, 44, was found dead on May
21 in his Malibu, Calif., mansion. The autopsy was performed
because of his relatively young age.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' blood-alcohol level at the time of death was found to be
0.21 percent, nearly three times the legally defined level of
intoxication, and he had an elevated level of the drug doxepin,
said Scott Carrier, spokesman for the coroner's office. Doxepin
sometimes is prescribed for anxiety-induced sleeplessness, and it
is thought that's why Hughes was using it. Neither the alcohol nor
the drug was present in sufficient quantity to have been the sole
cause of death, Carrier added.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication of foul play or intentional overdose. On
the day of his death, Hughes attended his grandmother's birthday
party, where he consumed alcohol, according to Herbalife.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Herbalife Web site, Hughes became interested in
nutrition at 18 when his mother, JoAnn Hughes, died of an
accidental overdose from prescription diet pills. Along with
Richard Marconi, a former colleague at Slender Now, Hughes started
the multimillion-dollar Herbalife empire in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Bagpipes often are played at funerals and other solemn
ceremonies involving police and firefighters. How did this
tradition begin?
</P>
<P>
   A: The practice of using bagpipes at the funerals of
firefighters and police officers began in the 19th century in
Northeast cities, particularly New York and Boston, where many of
the members came from the ranks of Irish and Scottish immigrants.
It apparently came from the use of bagpipes at funerals in the
Scottish military.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the playing of bagpipes spread from the Northeast to
cities everywhere and now is standard procedure, no matter the
ethnic descent of the police officer or firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've just learned that a friend in England has been awarded
an OBE, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, on Queen
Elizabeth's Birthday Honors List. Do you know how many people
received that honor this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: About 240. The list honors people in all walks of life _
politicians, civil servants, business people, doctors, teachers and
others _ for their contributions to their professions and to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   The honors, in descending order, are knighthood and its female
equivalent, dame; CBE (Commander of the Order of the British
Empire); OBE; and MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire).
</P>
<P>
   Double Oscar-winning actor Michael Caine was awarded a
knighthood, heading a list of celebrities in the honors list that
included Sam Mendes, director of the Oscar-winning film ``American
Beauty'' (CBE); Harry Potter author Joanne K. Rowling (OBE);
thriller writer Dick Francis (CBE); pop singer Lulu Kennedy-Cairns,
whose professional name is simply Lulu (OBE); Tina Brown,
British-born editor of New York's Talk magazine (CBE); and fashion
designer Paul Smith (knighthood), whose clients include British
Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A high school teacher recently won $1 million on ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' by correctly answering this question: Which
of the following men doesn't have a chemical element named after
him? (A) Albert Einstein; (B) Isaac Newton; (C) Niels Bohr; (D)
Enrico Fermi. The answer was Newton. My question: What chemical
elements are named after the other three?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are einsteinium (chemical symbol Es, atomic number 99);
bohrium (symbol Bh, atomic number 107); and fermium (symbol Fm,
atomic number 100).
</P>
<P>
   All three are artificially created radioactive elements. Of the
109 recognized elements, 91 occur naturally on or in Earth, almost
all of them only in compounds, Scientists produced most of the
remaining 18, as well as three more not yet recognized by the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, in particle
accelerators.
</P>
<P>
   Einsteinium was discovered in 1952 and was first produced in
laboratory experiments in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Production of bohrium was announced in 1976 by scientists at the
Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, near Moscow. Until
1997, when the element was given its official name, bohrium
commonly was referred to simply as ``element 107.''
</P>
<P>
   Named for the Italian nuclear physicist who produced the first
controlled nuclear chain reaction, fermium was discovered in 1953
by a team of American scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After the Iridium satellite telecommunications system was
shut down, it was reported that the satellites might be sent back
into Earth's atmosphere to burn up. I never saw a follow-up. Do you
know the status?
</P>
<P>
   A: Motorola Inc., Iridium's biggest investor, said in late May
it was continuing to provide maintenance services for the bankrupt
global telephone and paging company's 66 low-Earth orbiting
satellite system ``for a limited time.'' Iridium, which announced
last August that it was seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,
terminated commercial service in March.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola says the satellites are Iridium-owned assets subject to
the oversight of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District
of New York, and ``a plan is in place to decommission the system''
once the deorbiting plan is finalized. Details will be announced
publicly at that time, Motorola told Q&AMP;A June12.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: In answering a recent question about manners, Q&AMP;A cited the
famous book ``Emily Post's Etiquette'' and mentioned that it was by
Peggy Post. Who is she?
</P>
<P>
   A: The newest member of the Post family to inherit Emily Post's
role, Peggy is married to Allen Post, Emily's great-grandson. Peggy
succeeded her mother-in-law, Elizabeth L. Post.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Washington, D.C., Peggy grew up in the Maryland suburbs
of Washington and in New Orleans. After graduating from Louisiana
State University, she worked for Chemical Bank and Merrill Lynch
Relocation Management.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, Peggy has represented the Emily Post Institute by
making personal appearances at bridal shows, and in September 1995
she took over the monthly etiquette column written for Good
Housekeeping. At the same time she began expanding her
participation in preparing the Emily Post books.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever became of Linda Kasabian, a member of the Charles
Manson ``family''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kasabian has virtually dropped out of sight since the
infamous August 1969 murder spree and subsequent trial of Manson
and his cult followers.
</P>
<P>
   She was granted immunity for testifying for the state that she
kept watch outside the California residence of actress Sharon Tate
during the murders of Tate and four others, then rode with Manson
the following night as he sought new victims at random, choosing
Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in their home near Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   At last report _ and that was in 1989 _ Kasabian was living in
the Milford, N.H., area, where she was raising four children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lisa Stark has been a regular reporter on ABC Nightly News
for some time. Within the past two or three years, Betsy Stark also
has come aboard. Are they related?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Normandy beaches were named Omaha, Utah, Sword, Juno and
Gold. What do those names mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: They don't mean anything, in the sense that they were shaped
like Utah or a sword, or were the site of gold discoveries. They
simply were code names assigned by the Allies for clear
communications about target areas when the assault troops of the
combined Allied armies (American, British and Canadian) landed on
the Normandy coast June 6, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The French would have referred to the various stretches of the
Normandy coastline by their areas. What was code-named Sword would
have been the area stretching between Riva-Bella and St. Aubin, for
instance; Utah, between Isigny and Quineville.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently told us about the origin of 7Up. In a similar
vein, can you tell us how Dr Pepper got its name?
</P>
<P>
   A: A doctor was involved, but he didn't invent the drink _
which, as everyone knows, doesn't have a period in its name.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story it was invented in Waco, Texas, at
Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store. In 1885 _ the year before John
Stith Pemberton invented Coca-Cola _ Charles Alderton, a pharmacist
who worked at Morrison's, experimented on a soft drink, mixing
phosphorescent water, fruit juice, sugar and other ingredients. He
offered it to customers, one of whom jokingly called the concoction
``Dr. Pepper's drink,'' referring to Dr. Charles Pepper, the
disapproving father of a woman Morrison had been courting.
</P>
<P>
   When the drink became popular in Waco, beverage chemist Robert
Lazenby decided to participate in the development and marketing of
the new product. Lazenby agreed to go into partnership with the
owners of Morrison's drugstore to produce the beverage at his
Circle A Ginger Ale Co., also in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Alderton, meanwhile, disassociated himself from the enterprise,
opting instead to return to the pharmaceutical trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Has a final report been issued into the crash of the plane
carrying golfer Payne Stewart and several others?
</P>
<P>
   A: The crash investigation is continuing. Paul Schlamm of the
National Transportation Safetytold Q&AMP;A that a final report probably
won't be issued until sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation into the Oct. 25, 1999, crash of the chartered
Learjet has centered on a loss of cabin pressure, the cause of
which remains undetermined. When the pilots were unable to correct
the situation, everyone aboard apparently succumbed to hypoxia, or
oxygen starvation.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft had taken off from Orlando and was supposed to go
to Dallas. But it flew, apparently on autopilot, until running out
of fuel and crashing in South Dakota. In addition to Stewart,
others killed in the crash were the pilot, Michael Kling; co-pilot
Stephanie Bellegarrigue; golf course architect Bruce Borland; and
Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, officials of a sports agency
representing Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Stan Drake, who used to draw the cartoon
strip ``Blondie''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Drake died on March 10, 1997, in Norwalk, Conn. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent question on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' asked:
``Where is the Sargasso Sea?'' The answer was the Atlantic Ocean.
How large is it, and what's the difference between a sea and an
ocean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Sargasso Sea covers about 2 million square miles. It has
no land boundaries separating it from the rest of the open ocean,
making a precise determination of its size impossible. But
scientists say it's an oval-shaped area in the North Atlantic
roughly between the 20th and 40th parallels of north latitude and
between the 35th and 75th meridians west of Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   It's set apart from surrounding waters only by the presence of
seaweeds that float on its surface. The name Sargasso derives from
sargaco, Portuguese for seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   Seas are smaller bodies of water within oceans, such as the
Mediterranean and the Caribbean seas, part of the Atlantic; and the
Bering and South China seas, part of the Pacific. In some contexts,
the words are interchangeable: World Book Encyclopedia says an
ocean is ``the great body of water that covers more than 70 percent
of the Earth's surface. People also call it the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The American Film Institute recently released its list of the
100 best comedy movies of all time. Where can I find this list? Can
you print the top 10 ?
</P>
<P>
   A: A link to the complete list can be found online at
www.afionline.org/. The top 10, in descending order: ``Some Like It
Hot,'' ``Tootsie,'' ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``Annie Hall,'' ``Duck
Soup,'' ``Blazing Saddles,'' ``MASH,'' ``It Happened One Night,''
``The Graduate'' and ``Airplane!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is the oldest living offspring of an American president,
now that John Coolidge has died? And can you give us some
information about that person?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower, who was born Aug. 3, 1922,
in Denver, to Dwight and Mamie Doud Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy in 1944, he served in
the Army from 1944 until resigning in March 1963, one year short of
the 20-year minimum required for pension eligibility. As Colonel
Eisenhower later explained, ``Dad had done so well in the military.
I thought it best to try another profession.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined Doubleday as an editor and researcher until 1964, when
he took a position as executive vice president of the Freedoms
Foundation in Valley Forge, Pa. In 1965 he left that job to begin
full-time research for his book, ``The Bitter Woods,'' about Allied
operations in Europe in World War II. He served as U.S. ambassador
to Belgium from 1969 to 1971, then turned again to writing and
editing. His last book was ``So Far From God: The U.S. War With
Mexico, 1846-48,'' published by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   He generally avoids publicity, but made the news most recently
last November when he was in Washington for the renaming of the Old
Executive Office Building. Its new name: the Dwight D. Eisenhower
Executive Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the members of the U.S. delegation who went with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Damascus, Syria, for the
June 13 funeral of Syrian President Hafez Assad?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department listed these names: Ryan Crocker, U.S.
ambassador to Syria; Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.); Dennis Ross, State
Department special Middle East adviser; Jesse Jackson, special
envoy to the secretary of state and President Clinton for the
promotion of democracy in Africa; Toni Verstandig, deputy assistant
secretary of state for Middle East affairs; Daniel Abraham,
chairman of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic
Cooperation; and Dr. Issam Cheikh of the National Arab-American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is totally appropriate that we pay respects to a
historic figure and that we express our condolences to the people
of Syria,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac was the only Western leader to
attend the ceremony. Assad died June 10 of a heart attack after
years of declining health.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to get a videotape copy of a program shown on
C-SPAN? I want to give my grandchildren the excellent one shown
recently about the dedication of a D-Day museum in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, C-SPAN makes such programs available on videotape. To
order ``Opening of the D-Day Museum'' by charge to a credit card,
call 1-877-662-7726 or visit C-SPAN Archives' online video shopping
site, www.c-spanstore.com/157540.html. It costs $39.95 plus $7 for
shipping. Or send a check, made out to C-SPAN Archives, to: C-SPAN
Archives, P.O. Box 66809, Indianapolis, IN 46266-6809. Be sure to
put the D-Day program's ID number, 157540, on the check.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was in the Army from July 1, 1948, to April 21, 1957. Due
to several moves, I'm unable to locate my discharge papers. I need
them to seek benefits. Where can I get replacement documents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Assuming that your records weren't among those destroyed in a
disastrous 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center in
St. Louis, you can get duplicate discharge or separation papers by
writing: National Personnel Records Center, Military Personnel
Records, 9700 Page Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63132-5100. Specify that a
duplicate separation document or discharge is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Your full name should be typed or clearly printed. The request
also must contain your signature. Include branch of service,
service number or Social Security number, and exact or approximate
dates and years of service. Use Standard Form 180, ``Request
Pertaining to Military Records,'' available from VA offices or at
the VA forms Web site (www.va.gov/forms/default.asp).
</P>
<P>
   The VA says it isn't necessary to request a duplicate copy of
discharge or separation papers solely for the purpose of filing a
claim for VA benefits. If complete information about the veteran's
service is furnished on the application, VA will verify with the
National Personnel Records Center or the service department.
</P>
<P>
   More information can be obtained from any VA office, or call
1-800-827-1000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in knowing how a member of Congress has voted
over the years on certain issues. Is such information available on
the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Project Vote Smart has information on voting records of
any member of Congress. Go to www.vote-smart.org and, in the red
box, click on Issues. Under Categories, click on Voting Records. On
the U.S. map, click on the member's state and find your person.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that with the recent closing of the last Howard
Johnson's restaurant in Massachusetts, only 29 remain in the United
States. Can you list all the locations?
</P>
<P>
   A: There actually are 26 Howard Johnson's ``full'' restaurants
in the United States, said Barbara Leverone of Franchise Associates
in Weymouth, Mass. The restaurants are in Connecticut (Darien and
Waterbury); Delaware (Claymont and two locations in Wilmington);
Florida (Key Largo, Hollywood Beach and St. Petersburg Beach);
Maine (Bangor); Maryland (Millington); Massachusetts (Greenfield);
Michigan (Bay City); Missouri (Kirkwood); New Hampshire (Nashua);
New Jersey (Asbury Park); New York (Albany, Lake George, Lake
Placid and New York City); Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh, Pittston and
White Haven); Vermont (Springfield); and Virginia (Front Royal,
Harrisonburg and Lexington).
</P>
<P>
   There also are five Howard Johnson's ice cream shops: three in
Puerto Rico and one each in Florida and Massachusetts.

   INTERNET-TRAFFIC (San Francisco) _ Internet commerce, that sexy
new concept revolutionizing consumerism in the 21st century, is
causing a decidedly Old World problem in San Francisco: more
traffic headaches. The reality of increasing Internet commerce is
that most products bought online need to be delivered by the likes
of UPS, FedEx, Webvan or any number of delivery companies. But in
San Francisco, where the streets are narrow and crowded with cars,
the appearance of more delivery trucks _ often double-parked _ is
snarling traffic. By RYAN KIM.

   BUSINESS/FINANCE (``f'' category)

<P>
   CAREER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ It's too bad that ``Gone in 60
Seconds'' is a movie about stealing cars. It would be a great title
for a workplace documentary. In this short-attention-span world, 60
seconds is all is takes for career opportunities _ and sometimes
careers _ to vanish. By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTROLUX-DISCRMINATION (San Francisco) _ An Electrolux Corp.
manager, demoted by a boss who called him a ``dumb . . . Indian''
and told him he was too old, has been awarded $5.25 million for
race and age discrimination. By BOB EGELKO.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-BRIEFS (Undated) _ The restyled Toyota Corolla is the first
2001 model in the company's lineup to arrive at dealerships
nationwide. Among the new features of this compact sedan are better
fuel economy. Also: Porsche names its first sport-utility vehicle
after a pepper _ ``Cayenne.'' By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III.
</P>
<P>
   LEVI-STRAUSS (San Francisco) _ Recent belt-tightening at Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. is starting to show results. The San Francisco-based
jeans maker reported Tuesday that net income had risen 48 percent
in the second quarter and that sales declines had slowed. By ALAN
T. SARACEVIC.
</P>
<P>
   MONTIEL-RESIGNS (Oakland, Calif.) _ Steve Montiel never thought
he could change the world _ just the newsrooms of America. Twelve
years after assuming the helm of a journalism organization that
helped promote minority involvement in the country's newsrooms,
Montiel is stepping down as the head of the Robert C. Maynard
Institute for Journalism Education. By ANNIE NAKAO.

<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)

<P>
   SPRINGER-DR.-LAURA (Bolton Landing, N.Y.) _ Despite coming from
opposite ends of the political spectrum, it's not surprising that
bad boy Jerry Springer would back up the righteous Dr. Laura
Schlessinger. Schlessinger's anti-gay diatribes on radio have
prompted several companies to pull advertising from her upcoming TV
show. Who's not to say that Springer's raucous talk show could be
next for an advertising ban? By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-BRENT-ROWAN (Undated) _ Guitarist Brent Rowan is one of
Nashville's most in-demand electric six-string gunslingers. He has
played on everyone who's anyone's records, including George Strait,
Shania Twain, Mark Chesnutt, Ronnie Milsap and Alabama, to name a
few. But in more than 20 years in the business, Rowan, 43, never
recorded an album of his own. Until now. By HECTOR SALDANA.

<P>
   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Undated) _ The joy of travel is being threatened
just as more and more of us are eager and able to expand our
geographical horizons. To minimize the abundant hassles, research
every trip thoroughly, utilize time-proven companies, allow for
unexpected charges and unwanted surprises. By HARRY SHATTUCK.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD (``d'' column)
</P>
<P>
   WINE-COLUMN (Undated) _ Caroline Krug's namesake winery in
France's Champagne region produces nothing but barrel-fermented
champagnes, and usually the most expensive on the market. Consider
the `88 vintage now available and you will know why. By MICHAEL
LONSFORD.
</P>
<P>
   ORGANIC-FOODS (San Francisco) _ The city of San Francisco took
one small step toward one of the strongest stances in the nation
shunning bioengineered crops _ and one giant leap into a growing
furor. Three members of San Francisco's Commission on the
Environment on Tuesday agreed to push an ordinance that would,
among other things, favor hiring food vendors who use only organic
foods during city business or during events on city property. By
DEMIAN BULWA.

   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   GLF-SENIORS-TOUR (Undated) _ The Senior PGA Tour truly has been
a boon to the baby boom generation. What began in 1980 as two
exhibitions that enabled players to parade in carts has evolved
into a tour that is competitive, lucrative and unique. The Senior
PGA Tour is offering its players $54.1 million in prize money this
year, double the amount available in 1993. By RAUL DOMINGUEZ, JR.

 &HT;    Therapy through music for Vietnam vets
 &HT;    By Rachel Kipp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ When Wayne Barker returned from serving in the
Vietnam War, he couldn't find a job. He would fill out applications
and proudly put down that he was a Vietnam veteran. But he says
that as soon as employers saw this information he wasn't hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got a job when I quit putting down that I was a
vet,'' said Barker, 45. Barker attributes this to negative feelings
many people had toward the Vietnam War and those who fought in it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to help other Vietnam veterans heal from similar
experiences, Barker formed the Vettz in 1985. Originally made up of
men who had all served in the Vietnam War, the band travels the
country playing for audiences made up of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like brothers helping brothers,'' Barker said. ``No
one else was doing it so we had to help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, the band's personnel has changed and now only lead
singer Barker, co-manager Tim Farrier of Kettering, and
percussionist (or ``concussionist,'' as he describes himself,)
Smoky LeBou of Huber Heights are Vietnam veterans. But the essence
of the band is still the same. The other members (drummer Marco
Miller, guitarist and vocalist Steve Linker, co-manager Keith
Wright, bassist and vocalist Terry Castle and guitarist and
vocalist Bob Neese) know what went on in Vietnam and have sympathy
for what their audiences _ and bandmates _ experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe through my grandfather serving in the (second) World
War, empathy comes easy,'' Linker said. ``It's such a brotherhood.
The only gift I can give is the music I play and my support. I
wasn't there but I still care.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the band gets together to practice at Farrier's house
whenever they can. The room is full of guitar cases, an old piano,
and various speakers and equipment. It is decorated with a poster
for the Vietnam War movie ``Full Metal Jacket `` and a sign of
support for men who were prisoners of war or are still missing in
action. Microphones let out squeaks and speakers are tested as the
men talk about some of the less-than-luxury hotels they have stayed
in and LeBou claims he can't make Friday's rehearsal because ``I
have nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerts offer a mix of covers and originals. Barker compares
the Vettz repetoire to traveling through time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play music that most affected men while they were in
Vietnam,'' he said. ``We also play songs from today with messages
related back to Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   They usually close with a song Barker wrote called ``The Wall
.'' During the song the audience is invited to come up and speak
the names of friends and family who died during the war. This
``roll call'' can take hours. After that, the Vettz finish up with
something more upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's therapy through music,'' Linker said. ``A lot of people
don't understand. I don't, but I feel the energy and love and hurt
and pain all wrapped into one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The music releases all the (feelings) vets need to get out,''
Wright said. ``They promote the brotherhood so people don't feel
they are the only ones. If you have ever been to a vet reunion, you
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Newest member Miller said that brotherhood extends to the band
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a show they put on and it was a very good show,''
Miller said. ``They're all so close and that's what makes the music
so good. I'm looking forward to a future with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vettz will get up early to play at 6 a.m. Friday for the
arrival of the Vietnam Memorial Moving Wall, a replica of the
memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Linker remembers visiting the full-size Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington. He was walking with Farrier when a young
girl came up to them with a letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked Tim if he was a veteran and handed him a letter,''
Linker said. ``Inside was a letter thanking him for his service. I
got choked up. You don't have to be a vet to shed a tear.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old days, when classical French cuisine was the
touchstone for the finest cooking in this part of the world, rich
sauces often accompanied rich meats and fish so it was not uncommon
to have salmon served with hollandaise. But modern palates find
that opposites are even more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   In other words something acid to provide a sharp contrast with
the richness of the fish. If a bit of sweetness is also factored in
there is a lovely balance of flavors. Balsamic vinegar and orange
juice are both sweet and acid. Sauteed onions add another sweet
note. For textural contrast with the fish, there are Bell peppers.
</P>
<P>
   A dish of noodles that are seasoned with sesame, soy and hot
pepper flavors provide their own distinctive contrast to the salmon
dish. You may want to adjust the amount of chili paste, depending
on how hot you like your food. This dish, too, provides its own
textural contrasts with the very crunchy sugar snap peas and the
soft noodles. If you like that crunch don't overcook those peas!
And if you cannot find sugar snaps you can use snow peas.
</P>
<P>
   SALMON WITH TARRAGON AND PEPPERS
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces salmon fillet
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces whole onion or 7 ounces chopped, ready-cut (1 2/3 cups)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces each red pepper, yellow pepper and green pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   Few shakes salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine orange juice and vinegar in a bowl and add salmon,
turning to coat. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chop whole onion. Heat nonstick pan large enough to hold all
the ingredients until it is hot. Reduce heat to medium-high and add
oil. Stir in onion and cook until it begins to soften and brown.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile wash, trim, seed and coarsely chop peppers; add to
onion as it cooks.
</P>
<P>
   4. Mince garlic; add and saute 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place salmon under the vegetables in the pan along with
marinade. Reduce heat to medium; cover and cook fish according to
Canadian rule: measure at thickest part and cook 8 minutes to the
inch. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings.
</P>
<P>
   COLD SESAME NOODLES

<P>
   8 ounces fresh Chinese or Italian noodles

RIOTERS SMILE FOR THE CAMERAS _ AND GET ARRESTED

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That was quite a parade of potential arrestees who rioted
outside the Staples Center after the Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA
title.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't be too hard to identify these clowns, especially when
you can stop, rewind, freeze-frame and even zoom in on their mugs.
</P>
<P>
   There was the guy in the navy pants and checkered shirt who used
something like a tire iron to smash in the right front window of
Los Angeles Police Dept. Patrol No. 666.
</P>
<P>
   The two men who threw traffic barricades onto the hood of that
same car. Another mope who was proudly wearing his Kobe Bryant
souvenir jersey as he swung a jacket filled with something like
rocks and pounded a police windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and let's not forget another Kobe fan who was wearing a No.
8 road jersey as he ran up to a burning vehicle with a large chunk
of a tree to fan the flames. Excellent kindling!
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the shirtless yahoos rocking the TV station van,
the goofs setting bonfires and the rock-tossing idiots who
occasionally halted their rampage long enough to jump for joy as
the cameras rolled.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, make sure you smile, dimwits, because you're on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   By now you'd think that looters, rioters, wilders, packs of
breast-grabbing molesters and other jokers who engage in
spontaneous, public displays of criminal behavior would have
figured out that cameras are loaded with film or videotape _ and
that nice clean images are captured on these wondrous inventions,
which means they can be caught in the act of committing crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But nope. I guess if you're so mindless that you'll attack a
limousine, manhandle women, loot stores or set bonfires in the heat
of a pack-mentality moment, you're also too stupid to realize that
all those cameras pointing in your direction could lead to your
arrest and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Los Angeles investigators will be sifting through
professional and amateur videotape of Monday night's distuburances,
even as TV stations continue to broadcast the footage and viewers
have the chance to say, ``Wait a minute, I know that idiot ...''
</P>
<P>
   And no doubt it'll lead to arrests and convictions.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's been happening over the last several days in New
York City, where police continue to arrest men who allegedly
participated in a series of assaults against women in Central Park
after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lonnie Hopson became the 17th arrest in the case when
he was apprehended at his Queens home and was charged with one
count of first-degree sexual abuse and one count of first-degree
riot. A police spokesman told the New York Times that Hopson was
identified by an anonymous caller who recognized him from a
broadcast of an amateur videotape of the assaults. Among the
identifying characteristics: The football jersey with the No. 20,
the hair braided in wide cornrows and the fat gold chain around
Hopson's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Timely tip for wilders: Dress down!
</P>
<P>
   Then again, don't. The better to ID you and nail you.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do we have video of the L.A. and New York
troublemakers, we have Web site photos as well. By Tuesday morning,
a number of sites on the Internet were burning with color photos of
several of the morons who were wreaking havoc outside the Staples
Center just a few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of years, video images and digital photos
have been used as evidence-gathering tools in a number of other
incidents, including assaults and arson at Woodstock '99; rioting
at the University of Colorado at Boulder in October of 1999; and
crimes that occurred at the Million Youth March in New York in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   When Michigan State students got out of a control in East
Lansing in March of 1999, police used videotape and photos to go
after students who participated in illegal activities, even the
seemingly harmless offense of flashing. A 19-year-old woman was
sentenced to 10 days in jail for lifting up her shirt and inciting
a crowd _ and she also suffered the humiliation of finding a photo
of her topless self, purloined from the Internet, taped to her dorm
room door by a malicious prankster.
</P>
<P>
   And a guy who danced around with pants around his ankles during
those MSU riots received 21 days in jail. Guess somebody recognized
his assets as well.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a weekend parade or a basketball championship or a
music festival (or a Cubs/Dodgers game for that matter), few people
head to the event thinking, ``I think I'll do a little rioting
tonight!'' They don't throw ``Scream'' masks or
mustache-and-glasses disguises in their backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   It just ... happens. They get swept up in the moment and put
their little brains on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, they probably wish they could forget what
they've done. But the camera always remembers.

GORE'S DANCE, TIGER'S TALENT, HILLARY'S MUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CLINTON: The first lady is on the attack in her campaign
for the U.S. Senate in New York, ripping opponent Rep. Rick Lazio
as an enemy of ``women, children and families.'' Lazio has
denounced Clinton's criticism as ``mudslinging.''
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that Clinton has decided to go negative, since
she spent nearly eight years whining about ``the politics of
personal destruction.'' If it's good enough for her enemies,
apparently, it's good enough for her.
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution: With the independent counsel's report on the
first lady's role in the Travelgate scandal likely to be made
public before Election Day, she might find some of that mud flying
right back in her face.
</P>
<P>
   PAT BUCHANAN: The ex-columnist, ex-commentator, ex-Republican
caused an uproar at the Reform Party state convention in Texas when
his supporters hijacked the party's party from supporters of
founder Ross Perot. The Perotistas are complaining that Buchanan is
conducting a hostile takeover of the party rather than merely
seeking its presidential nomination _ and their complaints seem to
be well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Once Buchanan completes the takeover, will he
have anything that's worth having?
</P>
<P>
   ROSS PEROT: Which raises another question: Does Buchanan
actually believe that Perot will let him get away with this?
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE: The guy is amazing, isn't he? In what seemed like a
matter of hours, the vice president dumped his campaign manager,
dumped his opposition to tax cuts and dumped his claim that
partially privatizing Social Security is a risky scheme. He ought
to be campaigning in a dump truck.
</P>
<P>
   All these switcheroos were part of Gore's latest attempt to
reinvent himself and create the illusion that he has something to
offer in the 2000 presidential race _ something other than timeworn
liberal bromides and tedious Clinton-Gore scare tactics from past
campaigns. It's easy for Gore to change directions, of course,
because he believes in nothing except the latest poll results.
</P>
<P>
   Gore obviously noticed that most of the polls show him trailing
Republican nominee-to-be George W. Bush in overall voter
preference, and trailing or losing ground among important voter
groups needed to construct an electoral majority. Bush has
virtually erased the Democrats' long-standing and crucial ``gender
gap,'' for example _ and that's extremely bad news for a Democratic
presidential candidate who desperately needs the votes of women to
prevail in November.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: While Gore tries this, then tries that, then
tries this again in a panic-stricken attempt to keep his campaign
afloat, Bush methodically goes about the business of laying out his
policy proposals and articulating his vision for the nation's
future. Bush's ideas are so appealing that Gore can't resist the
urge to steal them, although Gore's watered-down versions of Bush's
excellent proposals are pale imitations of the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Bush clearly has Gore on the run _ and there's no
reason in the world to believe that the situation will change. The
pundits have been predicting a too-close-to-call election, but the
contest could be shaping up as something else entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, Bush is gearing up to run away with it.
</P>
<P>
   TIGER WOODS: Some people apparently don't understand what all
the fuss is about. Here's the deal: Tiger belongs to one of the
world's most exclusive aristocracies: athletes who transcend not
only the game they play but the world of sport.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan. Muhammad Ali. Maybe Babe Ruth, once upon a time.
For a fleeting moment, perhaps, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, part of it is because Woods is a black man dominating a
sport that until about 10 minutes ago was the private property of
wealthy white guys. But it's mostly about the stuff that superstars
are made of: talent, charisma, dedication and a relentless
commitment to excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Even his opponents are awe-struck. The fuss is deserved.

&HT;     `DR. LAURA' GETS SUPPORT FROM A TV BAD BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. _ You can't say Jerry Springer
enthusiastically leapt to the defense of Dr. Laura Schlessinger.
When asked, he just sort of flinched and did what he had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't personally like her views ... but she has every right
to be on the air,'' Springer said Tuesday. ``If we start any form
of censorship because we don't like (someone's) views ... then we
are all in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum,
it's not surprising that bad boy Springer would back up the
righteous Dr. Laura, the radio physiologist-playing-psychologist
who is coming to syndicated television this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger's anti-gay diatribes (actually only a small part of
her show) have sparked a backlash in the gay community, which has
targeted the show by pressuring its potential advertisers. Several,
such as Procter &AMP; Gamble, have already backed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we see other advertisers announce that they will not pursue
sponsorship of the show, we praise them for their commitment to
fairness and to inclusive rather than divisive television
programming,'' Joan M. Garry, executive director of the Gay &AMP;
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Springer, interviewed Tuesday before he moderated a panel
discussion on judge shows as part of 39th Executive Conference of
the New York State Broadcasters Association, has to back up
Schlessinger. If such an assault on advertisers is successful,
who's not to say that Springer's raucous talk show _ entering its
10th season _ could be next?
</P>
<P>
   ``Abhorrent views fall by their own weight,'' Springer said,
``not because we silence them.''
</P>
<P>
   But is there a line? Is it OK to air anti-gay television? Then
what about anti-black shows, or talkfests which target Jews? No?
Then what about the free exchange of ideas?
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger would have had a perfect opportunity to discuss
this, at next month's gathering of television critics in
California.
</P>
<P>
   But she is not on the schedule, apparently ducking the event. So
much for personal responsibility.

</P>
<P>
   YOU BE THE JUDGE
</P>
<P>
   James Curtis, one of several jurists getting new judge shows for
the fall, was somewhat handcuffed by the question: How are you
going to make your show different from all the others?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Springer helped him out: ``Did you ever think about
throwing a bench?''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, whose ``Curtis Court'' begins this fall, and Greg Mathis
of ``Judge Mathis Court'' were part of a panel Tuesday that
examined the phenomenon of judge shows.
</P>
<P>
   The panel examined several reasons for the rise in popularity.
(``Judge Judy'' leads the pack as the third-highest-rated
syndicated show, behind ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy!'')
Springer, drawing from his own experience and that of talk radio,
posited that ``the audience has become the entertainer. We are just
watching ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis countered that ``the game show element'' plays a role:
Viewers want to guess the outcome before the verdict is handed
down. But it was newcomer Curtis who gave perhaps the best answer:
People had been amusing themselves at stockades, executions and
trials long before broadcasting even existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Court was the first entertainment,'' he said, exaggerating
only slightly. ``I think it's simply coming full circle.''

&HT;     GUITARIST, ALWAYS IN THE SHADOW OF OTHERS, CUTS DEBUT ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HECTOR SALDANA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guitarist Brent Rowan is one of the most in-demand electric
six-string gunslingers in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The native of Waxahachie, Texas, has played on everyone who's
anyone's records, including George Strait, Shania Twain, Mark
Chesnutt, Ronnie Milsap and Alabama, to name a few. He has even sat
in with Sting. All in all, Rowan's logged more than 10,000 studio
sessions on hit albums with more than 100 million in sales. But in
more than 20 years in the business, Rowan, 43, never recorded an
album of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's a peaceful, instrumental album of
finger-picked, solo acoustic guitar performances with minimal
overdubs and no band. For a guy who ``only plays electric guitar on
records,'' Rowan made his debut album, ``Bare Essentials,'' ``to
encourage people to take a deep breath.'' The message: Slow down,
we move too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to myself as much as anybody,'' Rowan admits,
alluding to his hectic _ sometimes six sessions a day _ schedule.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast is restful and relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do something totally different, something
people who know what I've done for 20 years would never expect. And
I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowan's gentle music conveys deep emotions. The wistful,
melancholic tunes, played with laid-back virtuosity by the
guitarist, invite introspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the answers we need are inside,'' Rowan says.
</P>
<P>
   The guitarist, who grew up in a Central Texas home where only
gospel and country music were allowed, arrived in Nashville in
1977, a 20-year-old kid who didn't know Eric Clapton from Jimi
Hendrix. A kindly Music Row producer gave him his first big shot on
John Conlee's ``Friday Night Blues.'' His career has ascended on an
upward trajectory from there, his resume featuring a Who's Who of
country and pop music, from Randy Travis to Neil Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   The new music on Rowan's solo album was inspired by nature and
family life. It is not a ``check me out'' record, made solely to
blow away other musicians with difficult licks. Sweet tones and
empty spaces suffice here. He credits the richness of sound on
``Bare Essentials'' to his hand-made Dillon-brand Koa wood guitar.
He says its musical spectrum is as wide as a grand piano's.
</P>
<P>
   The recording process was kept simple, too _ and old-fashioned.
No digital here. One AKG C-24 stereo microphone was all he used in
the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just moved around the mike to achieve the different tonal
things,'' Rowan says.
</P>
<P>
   The results went straight to a two-inch analog tape machine
through an API-312 pre-amplifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was analog, pure and fat until the last minute,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Slight imperfections survive. Only performance and ``feel''
counted. Rowan dislikes today's glossy studio computer fixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not real. There were squeaks on Segovia's records. That
doesn't make it bad. To me, that enhances.''
</P>
<P>
   In his other life as super session man, Rowan not only needs
extraordinary skills, but the ego to believe he's the baddest cat
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me, you bet, still does,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean he doesn't occasionally eat a slice of humble
pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes doing records, I'd play something that Eric Clapton
would have been proud of, and the producer goes, `That's a little
too rock 'n' roll.' And your heart just sinks because you know
they're really not listening. They're between phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Advice to hot young guitarists: Keep it simple; play from the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Satriani, Yngwie Malmsteen, people I really respect, play
a lot of machine gun notes and that's great. That appeals to your

&HT;     TOYOTA ROLLS OUT A RESTYLED COROLLA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The restyled Toyota Corolla is the first 2001 model in the
company's lineup to arrive at dealerships nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries of the car began late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new features of this compact sedan are better fuel
economy, which the EPA estimates is 32 miles per gallon in the city
and 41 mpg on the highway for models with five-speed manual
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Models with the three-speed automatic transmission are rated at
29 mpg city/33 highway, while the four-speed automatic gets 30 mpg
city/39 highway.
</P>
<P>
   This is Toyota's first car model with a safety release inside
the trunk to allow anyone who is accidentally locked in there to
open it and escape. Other automakers have begun installing these
releases, among them are Ford Motor Co., which put the releases in
the 2000 model Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Exterior styling has been updated on the Corolla, including
aerodynamic multireflector halogen four-beam headlights,
chrome-plated front-end trim and a lowered front bumper.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are new tail lights and, on some versions,
color-keyed body side moldings.
</P>
<P>
   Interior enhancements are designed to give more convenience and
comfort. There are new seat fabrics, push-button air recirculation
controls and, for the uplevel LE model, a rearview mirror with
integrated map lights.
</P>
<P>
   Some models with automatic transmission have dual rear cup
holders and a larger center console with a larger armrest storage
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The Corolla is Toyota's longtime compact sedan, which is second
from the bottom in price and size among the company's U.S. vehicle
lineup. The entry-level Toyota is now the Echo. Corollas are built
along with their clones, the Chevrolet Prizms, at the New United
Motor Manufacturing Inc. plant in Fremont, Calif.

   CHRYSLER UNHAPPY WITH PT DEAL
</P>
<P>
   A New York dealer who marked the sticker prices of two PT
Cruisers up $10,000 each to sell the vehicles to the U.S.
government for crash testing was criticized by DaimlerChrysler
North America President Jim Holden for charging more than the
sticker price for the hot-selling cars, the trade weekly Automotive
News reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an unfortunate mess with a salesman at a dealership
doing what he thought was cute,'' the magazine quoted Holden as
saying. ``He's embarrassed, the dealer's embarrassed, we're
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The dealer, in East Aurora, had found two of the PTs to sell to
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for front- and
side-impact crash tests. The test results are to be posted in early
July on the agency's Web site, www.nhtsa.gov.
</P>
<P>
   But the dealership was able to deliver only one of the PT
Cruisers it promised to the government. It seems the other one had
been promised to a retail customer, who turned down the
dealership's offer to split the extra $10,000 if the customer would
let the government have the car instead.
</P>
<P>
   The customer wanted the car instead of the $5,000, and the
government had to look elsewhere for its second PT, a spokesman for
the agency said. One was found at a so-far unnamed dealership in
the Midwest, but again, the government is being charged $10,000
over sticker for the car.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first one delivered to the government has been
crashed and is headed for the junk heap. Results of the
frontal-impact test that the vehicle was used for will be posted on
the NHTSA Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Holden said he believes most Chrysler dealers are selling the PT
Cruisers at sticker price. Chrysler priced the vehicles under
$20,000 to create a mass market for them, and initial consumer
response has been overwhelming. Production has not come close to
matching customer demand; waits for the PT can be six months or
more.

   PORSCHE SUV NAMED FOR A PEPPER
</P>
<P>
   ``Cayenne'' will be the name of the new Porsche-built
sport-utility vehicle that will come with a high-performance engine
and a big-league price tag, Porsche of North America has announced.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle, being developed jointly with Germany's Volkswagen,
is scheduled to go into production in 2002. Porsche hopes to sell
about 25,000 of the vehicles annually; it will be the first truck
product ever for Porsche, which has always been known in the United
States for its speedy (and expensive) little sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Why Cayenne? The name is ``synonymous with spiciness and
adventure,'' the themes for the new SUV, Porsche officials said.

&HT;     EVEN MULTIVINTAGE KRUG WORTH THE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL LONSFORD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caroline Krug's namesake winery in France's Champagne region
produces nothing but barrel-fermented champagnes, and usually the
most expensive on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The nonvintage _ oops, according to Krug, that's
``multivintage'' Grande Cuve costs as much as most other tete de
cuve vintage champagnes, and Krug's vintage champagnes are even
more expensive _ in the $150-$175 a bottle bracket - and are
characterized by a wonderful toasty quality.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heady stuff, both stylistically and financially.
</P>
<P>
   Krug was in town recently to launch the new vintage of her
champagne, and therein lies the story. Because the new vintage is
actually older than the one in current release. How's that again?
</P>
<P>
   Normally I wouldn't give so much space to a single wine,
especially one so expensive as to be beyond the financial reach of
all but a handful of wine drinkers, but the Krug story is an
interesting one. How did the French firm with the German name get
to be the ne plus ultra of bubblies?
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Krug, an ambitious, restless German, emigrated to France
in the 1830s and by 1843 was running his own champagne firm.
Champagne Krug has passed down through family hands, and although
now owned by the giant LVMH conglomerate (Louis Vuitton,
Moet-Hennessey, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Fred Joaillier, Zenith,
Veuve-Clicquot, etc.), Krug is still run by Henri Krug, as
president and winemaker, and Remi Krug, as managing director in
charge of sales and worldwide promotions. Caroline Krug, 34, is Rmi
Krug's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Krug, because of its relative small production and extremely
high prices, is unknown to many champagne drinkers. Yet it usually
sits at the head of the table in the minds of those who have tasted
it. What sets Krug apart?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Krug ferments its wine the old-fashioned way, in
oak barrels, rather than in stainless steel tanks. That these are
usually older, fairly neutral barrels is not the point. It is
expensive and time-consuming, and a fine example of attention to
tradition and detail.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that sets Krug apart is its reliance on a fair
percentage of a black grape called pinot meunier in the blends.
Many champagne-makers rely exclusively on chardonnay, a white
grape, and pinot noir, a black grape, for their wines, and some of
those are terrific champagnes. But even some other firms who also
use pinot meunier look upon it as a poor relation, one not to be
proud of. Krug harbors no such notions. Pinot meunier is critical
to Krug.
</P>
<P>
   (An interesting historical aside: One of the great Krug vintages
was the 1915, and its blend was unique. This was during the darkest
days of World War I, and conflict raged across Europe. Joseph Krug
II, who had been making the Krug wines for several years, was taken
prisoner by the Germans. So that year his wife Jeanne took over the
winemaker reins, and made the vintage wine _ but all from pinot
noir and pinot meunier, the black grapes. Because of the war, Krug
could not obtain any chardonnay from the Cote des Blancs. And the
1915 Krug became a classic.)
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: Champagne companies' bread-and-butter wines
are their nonvintage bruts. These make up the vast majority of
their production.
</P>
<P>
   And Krug is no exception. Its Grande Cuve makes up about 80
percent of its production.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas other firms cherry-pick their lots of wines and
select first the best ones for possible vintage-dating - and then
later blend their nonvintage bruts - Krug makes up its
``multivintage'' Grande Cuve first.
</P>
<P>
   The Grande Cuve (it's around $100 a bottle) is a melange of as
many as 40-plus lots from as many as seven or eight vintages, all
blended to retain the Krug toasty, complex character. The result:
Krug's Grande Cuve is usually the quality (and price) of other
firms' best vintage champagnes.
</P>
<P>
   Krug also has a vast inventory of unreleased wines, meaning that
while it's costly to hold back a wine like the 1988 vintage and
release it later, Krug can _ and does.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: It is at each champagne firm's discretion
whether to release a vintage wine, especially their top-of-the-line
champagne, and some do _ almost every year. Not Krug. But the 1980s
(and 1990) were kind to Krug. The 1985 was considered an all-time
classic at Krug. And in 1997, Krug unveiled its 1989 vintage and it
was _ and is _ a big, toasty, very full-bodied champagne. Consumers
_ those who can afford it _ love the stuff. The 1990 vintage
promises to be even better, Caroline Krug says.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1988 harvest produced leaner wines of higher acidity,
and these wines needed more time to develop. ``It's a more subtle
vintage,'' Caroline Krug said. When I talked with her in 1997, she
said it would be at least a year and a half before the '88 came
out. It was almost three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tasted the '88 three years ago, Henri thought it was
still shy.
</P>
<P>
   There was no pressure to release it until it was ready; we don't
have to follow the chronological rule.''
</P>
<P>
   But brothers and sisters, the wait was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   I asked her about the reception of the steely-but-toasty,
bracing '88 by those who have tasted the voluptuous '89, and she
said, predictably, that while some prefer one vintage (style),
others prefer the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I like the '88,'' she said. ``It's a vintage that
plays with you; it doesn't show you everything at once.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm enamored of wines with high acidity, and I found the 1988
Krug Champagne (Five Stars) marvelously complex. It displayed the
trademark buttered-toast character of Krug (from the barrel
fermentation), but also an almost lime-citrus quality and rapier
acidity. It is just now _ at 12 years of age _ beginning to come
together. And this wine belies the notion that champagnes cannot
age. This one should outlive the '89 and even the '85. If you have
a special occasion to mark the year 1988, whether a birthday,
anniversary, whatever, the 1988 Krug (and to be fair, perhaps the
1988 Dom Perignon, as well) should prove worthy of your
consideration. ``It's a vintage that will last for years,'' Krug
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly I think more consumers will prefer the '89, and that's
just fine. (Krug is handled here by Republic Beverage.)As for me,
``Waiter, I'll have another glass of the '88 Krug, please, and
thank you.''

&HT;     HASSLES CAN CRIMP THE JOYS OF TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY SHATTUCK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ I usually try to remain upbeat in this space because
... well, because leisure travel is supposed to be upbeat. Fun. A
relaxing escape from the pressures and time constraints and other
negatives of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   A happy face, that's what I aim to wear.
</P>
<P>
   But today, I'm miffed.
</P>
<P>
   I'm miffed because I sense, from my correspondence and from what
I read and hear in news reports, that the joy of travel - the very
essence of travel - is being threatened just as more and more of us
are eager and able to expand our geographical horizons.
</P>
<P>
   I'm miffed that United Airlines confined almost 200 people
inside one airplane for 8 1/2 hours at Chicago's O'Hare Airport,
waiting for clearance to take off to the East Coast, where weather
was playing havoc with routings and landings.
</P>
<P>
   Other aircraft that day made prisoners of passengers for five
and six hours. And this isn't a first.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care where the blame lies _ the airline, airport
designers who don't create enough gates, controllers,
meteorologists, the Federal Aviation Administration _ this is
unforgivable. We have a serious problem with air rage in today's
skies; is this any way to confront it?
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, passenger complaints to the
Department of Transportation about major air carriers increased 89
percent _ mirroring 1999 trends. Is anybody listening? The peak
travel season has just begun. There has to be a better way.
</P>
<P>
   How sad, too, to learn of kids inconvenienced or stranded during
much-anticipated end-of-the-school-year vacation trips because tour
promoters fail to live up to promises. These disappointments occur
too often.
</P>
<P>
   I'm miffed at the World Cruise Co. for shutting down 41 days
into its second 114-day around-the-world itinerary, requiring
passengers and crew to find ways home from Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   We wrote about the World Cruise Co. last year. So did other
travel media nationwide. It seemed such a promising idea - an
opportunity to sail from continent to continent for only about $100
per day, a fraction of the cost other lines charge for global
itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   What is it I frequently tell readers? ``If an offer sounds too
good to be true, it usually is.'' Maybe I should have seen this
coming. The Toronto-based promoters have a good track record with
Marine Expeditions, a companion company. But even as they scramble
to appease passengers inconvenienced by the abrupt ending of their
dream world cruise, these same people are now touting yet another
new endeavor: cruises to Cuba (from the Bahamas) beginning this
fall. My suggestion is to study that offer long and hard before
biting.
</P>
<P>
   The early misfortunes of Premier Cruise Lines' Houston-based Big
Red Boat III also are discomforting.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with air conditioning on the inaugural sailing were bad
enough. Then, a collision with a tugboat at the end of voyage No. 2
rendered Big Red Boat III idle and certainly isn't helping this new
family-oriented venture get off the ground - or rather, into the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how many consecutive weeks can a company afford to
keep issuing refunds and/or doling out certificates for free future
cruises?
</P>
<P>
   On a broader spectrum, I'm miffed that travelers too often
aren't told the truth about how much vacations really cost. Taxes,
fees and service charges are destroying budgets at hotels, car
rental counters, in airports and on some cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   Syd Kearney, my associate, tells about checking out of a hotel
in New Orleans a few weeks ago: ``A woman had emptied all of the
contents of her purse onto the counter and was crying and saying,
`I brought enough money to cover what you told me the room would
cost. And now you add all these other things to the bill. Why can't
you just be honest?' ''Why indeed. Look at advertisements whose
bold print reads, ``Cars $29.95 per day'' or ``Weekend special room
rate $79'' or ``Air fare sale $99 each way.'' Any chance that's
what your actual bill will total? Not after all the extra charges
are applied.
</P>
<P>
   Message to service providers: Add 25 percent, 30 percent or more
to the tariff, if you must. We know much of it is beyond your
control. Just tell us in advance so the shock won't spoil our
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Little things are bothersome, too. Or maybe they aren't so
little.
</P>
<P>
   A co-worker, in need of a passport on short notice, tested _ at
my suggestion _ the Houston Regional Passport Office's ``new and
improved'' expedited appointment system and called me on a cell
phone from the federal building to report, ``You should see this
scene. The lines are snaking out of the office and down the
hallway. Everyone here seems to have a 2:30 appointment, and there
are only two windows open. And there is no communication, nobody to
tell you what line to stand in or what the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   At least there was a line. After making several driving trips
over the past two months, I'm aghast at the number of highway rest
stops _ especially in Texas _ closed for construction. Are we just
supposed to close down our bladders, too?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'm miffed at myself for being so miffed. No, I didn't
get up on the wrong side of the bed; it's just that I want all of
us to enjoy our vacations, especially when we invest hard-earned
money and cherish the little time we have away from home for family
and new adventures.
</P>
<P>
   There are lessons each of us can learn: Research every trip
thoroughly, utilize time-proven companies, allow for unexpected
charges and unwanted surprises.
</P>
<P>
   But we also have a right to expect some degree of competence,
consistency and caring.

GORE FACES PARTY DOWNSIDE IF HE PICKS A SENATOR FOR VEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Al Gore scrutinizes at least six US senators as
possible running mates, the Democratic Party is facing a quandary
because picking a senator could undermine efforts to regain control
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   All six of the most frequently mentioned Senate prospects,
including Senator John F. Kerry, hold seats that probably would be
filled by a Republican, either through appointment or a later
special election. And that could harm Democrats' hopes of gaining
seats. If Gore picks Kerry and they win, for example, Governor Paul
Cellucci could replace the senator with a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have to be an incredibly compelling reason to pick
one particular senator to punt away a Senate seat,'' said Charles
Cook, editor of the Cook Political Report and an expert on Senate
races. ``Gore has been around Washington long enough to understand
the consequences of picking a senator and turning a seat over. I
don't think any of these people are so compelling that it warrants
that loss.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no theoretical dilemma. Similar concerns were raised
when Bill Clinton selected then-Senator Gore in 1992. A Democrat
was appointed to succeed Gore temporarily after Gore became vice
president. But in the special election two years later, a
Republican, Fred Thompson, won the seat and still holds the job.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now control the Senate by a 55-45 margin. Democrats
hope to pick up at least three seats this fall, with some optimists
in the party even hoping to regain control.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, some Gore associates said, Gore would pick a governor,
offsetting Republican nominee-in-waiting George W. Bush's argument
that Gore is too much of a Washington insider. But only 18 out of
50 governors are Democrats, providing a relatively shallow pool of
talent. Most of the governors are little-known nationally and not
considered serious prospects. The most popular choice within the
Gore campaign is Governor Gray Davis of California, but he was just
elected in 1998 and has said he does not want the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Gore campaign is considering some unorthodox
candidates, including former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. But
many possible running mates are in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Three top Senate prospects come from states with Republican
governors who could appoint a replacement for at least two years.
They are Kerry, Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator Richard
Durbin of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Senate prospects, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and
Dianne Feinstein of California, face a different complication
because they would be running simultaneously for reelection and the
vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman won the vice presidency, his Senate replacement
would be picked by the state's Republican governor. But Feinstein
faces a tougher reelection battle than Lieberman, political
analysts said. If she wins the vice presidency and the Senate race,
her Senate replacement would be picked by a Democratic governor.
But she could risk losing her Senate campaign because she would
have to spend so much time out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's press secretary, Howard Gantman, said this is ``not
an issue for her because she is running for the US Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another commonly touted prospect, Senator Evan Bayh of
Indiana, comes from a state where a Democratic governor would
appoint a replacement until a special election is held in 2002,
although Bayh's seat is not up until 2004. Thus, a Democratic
replacement could lose in the Republican-leaning state.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stu Rothenberg said the bottom line is that
Democrats ``will do whatever they feel they need to do. If they
thought John Kerry or Dick Durbin was what they needed to win, they
would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many complications, some Kerry backers are privately
suggesting that he is the best choice among the senators. The Kerry
partisans note that his term is up in 2002, and Massachusetts has a
history of electing mostly Democrats to the Senate. At worst, Kerry
backers believe, a Republican would hold the seat for only two
years. These partisans say the best-known possible Republican
contender, former Governor William F. Weld, has moved to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, is also weighing many factors as he mulls his
choice of running mates. But the senatorial calculus is not as
complex for Bush because Republicans are considered likely to
retain control of the Senate even if they lose the seat of his vice
presidential choice.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, in an interview last week, insisted he is not campaigning
to be Gore's running mate, as some have suggested. Instead, he said
an article about his prospects should read: ``Senator Kerry refused
to engage in any speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry has fueled speculation by saying he is ``flattered''
to be considered and has not ruled out accepting the job.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's biggest booster within the Gore campaign may be Michael
Whouley, a former Kerry aide who is now Gore's senior political
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that John Kerry for a number of reasons would be
a qualified candidate,'' said Whouley, who is not shy about
promoting the senator. ``John Kerry brings a lot of strengths. What
is obvious is there is a generational synergy, two Vietnam
veterans. John Kerry looks like he would be ready for the
presidency. He would have strong debating skills. He is a hell of a
campaigner, and he won the toughest Senate race of 1996 against
Bill Weld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, John Kerry would be a strong choice,'' Whouley
said. ``That is the advice I will give to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Kerry tie to the campaign is the political consulting
firm of Shrum, Devine and Donilon, which produced Kerry's
television commercials in 1996 and now works for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's biggest drawback may be geography, since New England is
already Gore's most solid region. But if geography were
all-important, Clinton of Arkansas would not have picked another
Southerner, Gore of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice for vice president is likely to hinge on what Bush
does first. Bush must select his running mate by the time the
Republican convention gets underway July 31. Gore has the luxury of
waiting another two weeks before the Democratic convention.

RIGHT CHOICE BY SUPREME COURT ON PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has ruled that we cannot solemnize public high
school football games with pregame prayers. The court ruled, 6-3,
that the Santa Fe Independent School District, near Galveston,
Texas, was wrong to let students deliver prayers before the
kickoff. In one such prayer last season, Santa Fe High School
student Marian Ward, wearing her band uniform, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have chosen to solemnize this game. And if you want to
participate, bow your heads and give thanks to the Lord. Lord,
thank you for this evening. Thank you for all the prayers that were
lifted up this week for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that you watch over each and every person here tonight,
especially those involved in the game. Just be with the fans. And
just be with each and every one of us as we go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   The court being the court, it struck down such prayers with an
insomnia-curing solemnity that left no room to blitz and sack the
absurdities. Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens,
said, ``School sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible
because it sends the ancillary message to members of the audience
who are nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of
the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents
that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delivery of such a message _ over the school's public
address system by a speaker representing the student body, under
the supervision of school faculty and pursuant to a school policy
that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer _ is not
properly characterized as private speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the 50-cent words. The court made the right choice in
the five-year-old suit brought by a Mormon family and a Catholic
family who were offended by the prayers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the whole story. What the court could not say in its
solemn trashing of solemnizing is what a seddity sacrilege pregame
prayers are.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press photo that ran in the nation's newspapers
this week of Ward praying from the public address booth as the fans
bowed their heads in the stands, had me thinking that Jesse Ventura
might actually have a point.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, the wrestling crackpot who managed to become governor
of Minnesota, offended much of the nation when he said, ``organized
religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need
strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their
noses in other people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe in God, Jesus is up there as a role model and I like
football. But anyone who confuses the holy trinity of father, son,
and holy ghost with the gridiron trinity of mayhem, manhandling and
maiming has an odd set of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   No prayer, no assembly of bowed heads, no show of reverence can
gloss over the obvious. All these students, parents, teachers,and
community leaders are in the stadium is to see their team crush the
other team. The Bible may talk about David slaying Goliath, but
please, you cannot find a single person in a typical stadium who
wants to be David at kickoff time.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Book may want us to be good Samaritans, but in
football, gracious gestures of assistance from opponents only
happen after the opponent is sufficiently secure that you are
either: A. Flat on your back, after a 10-yard-loss; B. You have had
the wind knocked out of you; C. You have a concussion; or D. You
are being wheeled off the field with torn knee cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Paul in his letter to the Ephesians, said, ``Put on the whole
armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of
the devil. For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and
flesh, but against rulers, against the authorities, against the
cosmic powers of this present evil age.''
</P>
<P>
   That would not seem to be quite the interest of college scouts
who scour the high school flesh under the armor of shoulder pads.
They are not there to pray. They are not there to find not players
who buck evil authority. They are looking for running backs with
the wiles of Tasmanian devils and behemoth linemen who pound their
opponents into a bloody pulp.
</P>
<P>
   With 24 hours in a day and seven days in a week to pray, it is
interesting to see people try to turn football stadiums into
churches. Perhaps the need to crudely overwhelm a stadium with a
prevailing religion befits the American team sport most crudely
dependent on overwhelming opponents with brute strength.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the prayers are also a cover for the obvious. You have
to admit, even if you are a football fan, that it is a stupid game.
No parent in the abstract would tell his or her son, ``Say, Johnny,
go to the corner and get your chest caved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet tens of thousands of parents do it every fall in America.
Our children are out there on the field in the American trinity of
mayhem, manhandling, and maiming. The folks in the stands pray,
probably because it ain't Jesus and the heavens who will be lifting
up their son on the next play. It will be that 6-2, 250-pound nose
tackle, straight from hell.

 TOULOUSE, France: ... 15 to 25 years?''

<P>
   Given the high stakes involved, both companies are willing to
pull out all the stops in a sales campaign, even for small
customers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most influential airlines in Asia, if not the world,
is Singapore Airlines. Last year, Boeing scored a major coup when
it persuaded the airline to swap its A340-300 fleet with 777s. The
airline agreed to buy the Boeing planes if Boeing took 15
A340-300s. Furious, Airbus said it would not service the planes if
they were resold by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tremendous validation of our product,'' said
Dickenson, who at the time headed Boeing's Asian sales unit.
``Singapore Airlines is run by very shrewd and capable business
people who have the unique ability to look around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is now trying to persuade Singapore to replace
longer-range A340-500s that are on order with a new, long-range
version of the 777 that Boeing unveiled this year. Singapore
Airlines has also expressed an interest in the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus struck back with its El Al deal. Leahy, senior vice
president of Airbus, targeted El Al even after the airline crushed
the hopes of Airbus a few years ago when it decided to stick with
Boeing rather than buy the A320.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back two years later and said they were looking at
widebody aircraft, and we were told by the government and the
airline that they would make this purely business. I said, `What
the hell, I'm a glutton for punishment,' '' Leahy recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy and a sales team flew an A330 to Israel _ a bold,
expensive proposition for a relatively small sale of about $400
million _ and showed the plane off.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, El Al's board voted unanimously to split the
order by buying the 777 as well as some medium-range A330s. The
deal was considered so pivotal that US Secretary of State Albright
lobbied the Israeli government to cancel the Airbus order and
threatened future US aid to Israel. In December, Israel froze the
contract, pending a review, which is still on-going.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said he is confident Israel will buy the planes, but even
if it does not, ``They got to know our product and found it a good
fit for El Al _ that in itself is a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   But he blasted the United States for what Airbus perceives as
diplomatic interference run by high-ranking US officials on behalf
of Boeing. ``I'm an American, I'm proud of being American, but it
is disappointing to see this administration says, `Free trade, but
only if we win.' To threaten Israel and say there could be a
problem with aid borders on hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus, Boeing's Dickenson counters, is the master at pulling
political strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Japanese leaders make an aircraft decision, the
ambassadors from France, the UK, and Germany, and sometimes Spain,
call upon them and attempt to put pressure on them by talking about
bilateral issues. We'll just leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, an industry analyst at JSA Research in Newport,
says the companies have very different strategies. ``The strategy
of Airbus is to gain market share and provide gobs of employment to
their benefactors, i.e. the governments of Europe. Boeing is quite
different. It is oriented to optimizing profit growth over the long
term. They are two very different ways of operating, and there is
just not a profit motive of any consequence at Airbus.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is composed of Aerospatiale Matra Airbus of France and
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany, with 37.9 percent share each,
BAE Systems of Britain, with 20 percent, and CASA of Spain with 4.2
percent. Its subsidies have irked Boeing, but officials in Toulouse
say the company has paid back all recent government loans.
</P>
<P>
   The officials added that Boeing reaps research and development
benefits for its commercial aircraft from its military contracts,
which Airbus contends is another kind of subsidy. Boeing's
Commercial Airplane Group brought in well more than half of the
company's $58 billion in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had the US government shelve the dispute over subsidies
in the early 1990s and a tenuous compromise was worked out. But
there is concern in Seattle and Washington over a new round of
subsidies for Airbus to develop the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the US trade representative, has stated her
concern about such subsidies and the matter is being scrutinized,
said an official from the US trade office.
</P>
<P>
   One big plus for Boeing out of Washington was last month's vote
to approve permanent normal trade relations with China. It is no
accident that Airbus and Boeing have invested millions in
facilities in China. The country represents the largest market for
new aircraft in the next 20 years, and Asia in general, according
to Boeing's long-range outlook, will see air travel needs grow at
nearly 7 percent, while the rest of the world will be under 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a huge market for us,'' said Dickenson. ``If
relations between the US and China do not go well, we will not sell
airplanes there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, analysts say, the products that
Airbus and Boeing produce are very similar and very competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The later generation 737s may not have all the bells and
whistles that the A320 series does, but they are cheaper,'' said
Nisbet.
</P>
<P>
   Massive production problems at Boeing in recent years damaged
the company and some orders went to Airbus as a result, Nisbet
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing is overhauling and becoming more efficient _ they
should be 10 to 15 percent cheaper, but they lost some of that
edge. Their planes are designed to be more efficient, have lower
operating costs while still being competitive in performance. That
is why Boeing has sold so many airplanes over the years. But Airbus
was the first with fly by wire and innovation of that sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as sitting in an airplane as a passenger, there is
very little difference in comfort, and if you are not an airplane
buff, you would not know which one you are in.''

   What a difference a plea bargain makes.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, Halle Berry was ducking cameras and
dodging reporters eager for details about her involvement in a
February hit-and-run accident in Los Angeles that left another
motorist with a broken wrist. But ever since she pleaded no
contest, and agreed to a sentence that included a $13,500 fine and
200 hours of community service, the breathtakingly beautiful
actress has been everywhere telling everyone about what happened.
Given this, it seems rather silly for Eugene Robinson,
editor-in-chief of Code, to trumpet his interview with Berry in his
magazine's anniversary issue as an exclusive; it's nothing of the
sort. (See the current InStyle.) Unfortunately, it isn't
particularly revelatory, either, except to show that Robinson is
much too smitten with his magazine. His first comment to Berry:
``We were feeling pretty honored that out of all the people you
could have talked to, you chose us first.'' Which, of course, gives
Berry the chance to stroke Robinson by saying what a fan she is of
the magazine. It's a house ad disguised as an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The accident almost doesn't come up, and when it does, it's
Berry who broaches the topic. Berry maintains that the other car
``hit me from the side, my head hits the steering wheel, and from
that point on, I remember nothing.'' And you'll learn nothing here
_ unless you're particularly interested in Robinson's observation
that Berry's Range Rover ``trumped'' his Land Rover. But then the
point of Code, which bills itself as ``the style magazine for men
of color,'' isn't the articles. It's the pretty parade of
scantily-clad chocolate beauties, which ultimately makes Code less
like GQ and more like Jet.

   With apologies to Rodgers and Hammerstein, there is nothing like
a diva. We are living in the diva boom years, with these no
sugar/all-spice females pulling all kinds of mess from
expletive-slappin' those who annoy them (Da Brat) to demanding
pink, and only pink, toilet paper in their hotel suites (Mariah
Carey). Spin's Joshua Clover salutes them all in his hilarious
feature ``Loving the Divas Locas.'' There are ratings on such
things as ``profound sense of entitlement,'' ``physical
altercation,'' and ``diva-on-diva tiff,'' but frankly the ratings
don't really matter _ if you made the list, we already know you're
as cranky as a colicky baby.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tasty tidbits: Foxy Brown once spit on Holiday Inn
employees because they did not have an iron; and Mariah, during a
recent appearance in Europe, demanded kittens and puppies to pet
during her interviews and a cheering crowd to celebrate her
arrival. Clover gives his lifetime achievement award to Lil' Kim,
the self-proclaimed ``Queen Bee,'' and yes, something must be said
for a woman who showed off her brand-new breasts by wearing that
infamous applique-on-the-nipple dress at last year's MTV Video
awards. Still, I might have voted for Mary J. Blige, the R&AMP;B (as in
rude and belligerent) queen, who once told an interviewer, ``We
need to be alone, right? Because we're going to fight, ain't we?''
Yikes!

   In the same issue, there's an informative look at the next big
Web wave _ animation. There's already a ton of stuff available (I
highly recommend the wicked animated short ``Alien Song''), but
according to writer G. Beato, it's getting more sophisicated and
creative. Cartoons of 10 to15 frames per second can be distributed
more efficiently than live-action video, and cartoons are cheap and
easy to produce. All this has given birth to several episodic
animated series available exclusively on the Web. Among the best:
JoeCartoon.com, Shockwave.com, and TheRomp.com. And no, these
cartoons aren't for kids.

   The brothers Farrelly _ Bobby and Peter _ make the kinds of
movies junior high school boys would make if they could get their
parents' permission to have a power lunch in Hollywood. They've
written and directed ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``There's Something
About Mary,'' and though they're the minds behind such scenes as
Ben Stiller's zipper mishap, and Cameron Diaz and the ``hair gel''
gag (both from ``Mary''), they come off as sane, regular guys in
Madison. They chat with Danial Asa Rose about their new film, ``Me,
Myself &AMP; Irene,'' as well as psychiatry, weak ``Irish teeth''
(Bobby's explanation as to why a childhood visit to the dentist
revealed 14 cavities), and how two guys who were never funny in
school became the biggest comedy writers in Hollywood. Says Peter:
``We were never the class clowns. Ever. We were too quiet for that.
I'm not the guy who comes up with the good one-liner. I come up
with a one-liner on the way home.'' Adds Bobby, ``That's why we're
writers. Because you can make it happen.''

TORPEDO BOAT'S RESTORERS FIGHT TO KEEP CRAFT IN WATER

   SEABROOK, Texas _ PT-309, the last still-seaworthy U.S. torpedo
boat to see action in World War II, bobs in its borrowed slip at
the Lakewood Yacht Club like an anxious sailor ready for shore
leave.
</P>
<P>
   But where it goes is a question that has created a contentious
debate between the volunteers who made it shipshape, and the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department, which owns it.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-foot, 50-ton patrol torpedo boat that saw action in the
Mediterranean Sea is considered the centerpiece for a new exhibit
at the Admiral Nimitz Museum in Fredericksburg, 250 miles away from
the salt air and seawater of the Texas Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers who spent the past six years peeling away decades of
neglect from the boat's rotted wooden hull believe that all their
work will be ruined if the state dry-docks the 309 in the Texas
Hill Country. They are pleading with the Nimitz Museum and the
Parks and Wildlife Department to reconsider the plans and allow the
torpedo boat to remain in the brackish waters of Galveston Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They honestly don't know what we're doing down here,'' said
Tim Kelley, an energy company systems scheduler, and the elected
``commanding officer'' of PT-309. ``They think we want to take it
away from them. We don't. We want to remain connected to the Nimitz
Museum, but all the master boatbuilders we've talked to say that
taking this boat out of the water will destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it will be devastated by dry rot within three to five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dolman, a historian for Parks and Wildlife, said there is
no definitive proof for that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest maintenance headache is when you have water, and
then dry cycles,'' Dolman said. ``It's better for it to be
continuously wet, or continuously dry. Not go back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is more at issue than just the drying of the PT boat's
fragile wooden hull. The volunteers have worked hard for the past
few years, painstakingly refurbishing the boat fore and aft, and in
the process they became familiar with its WWII crews and its
wartime history.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 39-member volunteer crew feels a part of the boat.
They have what the Nimitz Museum curator of exhibits and programs,
Helen McDonald, calls ``sweat equity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They poured their heart and tears into that boat. I understand
that,'' McDonald said. ``We're anxious for them to be a part of our
program here.''
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers are not so magnanimous toward the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fuller, a former Navy pilot who has volunteered hundreds of
hours and thousands of dollars of his own money toward restoration
of PT-309, said the Nimitz abandoned the PT boat while all the work
was going on, and only now that the work is nearly finished is the
museum ready to take control.
</P>
<P>
   The 309 was purchased six years ago in New York by the Admiral
Nimitz Foundation, a Texas-based museum support group. The
foundation gave the boat to the Parks and Wildlife Department,
which oversees the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 2 1/2 years, they stopped supporting it
completely,'' Fuller said of the foundation. ``I've had four
conversations with the foundation, pleading for financial
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said the Nimitz foundation paid $80,000 for PT-309, and
another $70,000 to transport it to Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, the 309's commander, estimates that it has taken more
than $750,000 in work hours, donated services and supplies to
refurbish the boat. The torpedo boat is resting in a $500-a-month
slip at the Lakewood Yacht Club, paid for by a donor.
</P>
<P>
   The crew has occasionally opened the boat to tours at nearby
Kemah, and the result has been promising, Fuller said. ``The city
of Kemah has allocated $55,000 to build a secure slip right under
the Kemah bridge on the boardwalk,'' Fuller said. ``They have 5.1
million visitors a year on that boardwalk and even if we get 1 or 2
percent of those people to pay for a tour of the boat, it will
offer a revenue stream for the boat, and for the Nimitz Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win situation if the museum lets us keep the boat
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer crew members say they are willing to staff the boat at
Kemah and other locations and provide visitors with a complete
history of PT-309, which has a war record of 20 missions under
fire, including the sinking of five enemy vessels and the capture
of an Italian torpedo boat and its crew.
</P>
<P>
   The 309's first commander, Lt. Wayne Barber, had a chance
meeting with Frank Sinatra at Toots Shore's restaurant, and the two
decided to christen the boat ``Oh Frankie,'' a name it still
carries on its hull.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the boat was decommissioned and sold as surplus
for $3,500. It was purchased by a fishing company and pressed into
service off Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saltwater she plied through daily preserved her precious
mahogany hull for more than 50 years,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nimitz Foundation bought the boat in 1994. It was
transported to Galveston, then to San Jacinto Battleground State
Park where it was dry-docked alongside the Battleship Texas for
hull restoration. It was then moved to Clear Lake where the engines
have been installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see how they could become attached to it,'' Parks and
Wildlife's Dolman said, acknowledging the acrimony that has
erupted. ``But our intent has not changed. It is to be on permanent
display in Fredericksburg. We've got a museum that focuses on World
War II, and we are planning to use the PT boat to tell an important
part of that story.''
</P>
<P>
   PT-309's wartime executive officer, William F. ``Bill''
Pleasants, counters: ``To all who served in World War II, it would
be like sending a living memorial to her grave. All the thousands
of dollars and work by volunteers will be wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolman said he will meet with the PT-309 volunteers soon to
discuss the problems, but he warns that the foundation has raised a
million dollars to display the PT boat in Fredericksburg, and
``some of that money is conditional.'' If it isn't used for that
purpose, it has to be returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place,'' he
said. ``But we'll continue to look for some wiggle room.''

AUTHOR FAULTS PAPACY FOR REFUSING TO ADMIT ERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garry Wills embraces his Roman Catholic faith but is not
enamored of church fathers in the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The church hierarchy, Wills says, has resorted to ``structures
of deceit'' to hold fast to teachings on issues ranging from the
ordination of women to the church's role in the Holocaust, that
vast numbers of lay people as well as priests and nuns do not
accept.
</P>
<P>
   The papacy in particular, in Wills's view, has been
characterized by an unwillingness to admit it could make mistakes
or bring harm to others, an intransigence that has alienated
Catholics and non-Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever topic you want to talk about _ sex, Jews, women _ it
comes down the same problem,'' said Wills, a Northwestern
University professor who lays out his arguments in his latest book,
``Papal Sin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vatican has always sought to advance the claim that church
rulers have always been right and have never erred,'' Wills, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ``Lincoln at Gettysburg,'' said in
a recent interview. ``If you start having to defend that
proposition you find yourself having to distort and suppress
information and call up false arguments from tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   While other authors have taken issue with the Vatican's stance
on individual controversial issues, Wills focuses on what he says
are systemic and entrenched attitudes and behaviors that have
caused church fathers to commit ``quiet sins of intellectual
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis believes it is this headstrong leadership style that has
contributed to the decline in the number of priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arguments for much of what passes as current church
doctrine are so intellectually contemptible that mere self-respect
forbids a man to voice them as his own,'' Wills writes. ``The very
fact that the intellectual level of the church has been raised
makes it harder for a priest to swallow the scriptural
fundamentalism reverted to by Rome when it claims that priests must
be celibate or that women cannot be priests.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Wills believes many aspiring priests are unwilling
to put themselves in a position where they would have to defend
what Wills says are dishonest teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Wills says his book is not an attack on the papacy but on the
the way the papacy has defined its role. ``My own heroes, it will
become clear, are the many truth tellers in Catholic ranks,
preeminently Saint Augustine, Cardinal Newman, Lord Acton and Pope
John XXIII,'' Wills writes. ``The truth, we are told, will make us
free. It is time to free Catholics . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He provides a scathing critique of ``We Remember,'' the
Vatican's long-anticipated document on the Holocaust issued in
March 1998. Wills writes that the document is a tortured attempt by
the authors to exonerate the church from any direct culpability or
from having promoted teachings that may have fostered a climate of
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   While Pope John Paul II lauded the document for calling ``memory
to play its necessary part in the process of shaping the future,''
Wills says the pontiff never mentions the bishops and priests who
were supportive of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may (or may not) have been extenuating circumstances for
some of these collaborators. But to pretend _ nay, to assert _ that
they did not exist is to remove ``We Remember'' from any serious
consideration as an honest confrontation with a complicated
history.'' Its `memory,' far from being useful to the cause of true
understanding that would prevent another Holocaust, is useful only
to the fiction that the Vatican wants to maintain about itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wills is equally harsh in his assessment of the church's
argument that women cannot be priests because Jesus only chose men
as his apostles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the twelve apostles were married, and the church
authorities decided they could change that _ in fact, John Paul
says that the church cannot go back to the original situation on
this point,'' Wills writes. ``Saint Peter had a wife, but no modern
priest or Pope can. Are we to say that all priests must be
converted Jews? The twelve were. Are they all to speak Aramaic? For
that matter, if we are to make the gospel situation binding now, we
should observe that the apostles were not priests themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his sober evaluation of the church's upper echelons,
Wills says the Catholic spirit is thriving wherever people,
motivated by their faith, are working on social justice issues,
whether it be fighing the death penalty or helping the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus churches I know have young people readier than I
and my friends were at their age to work on soup lines, to minister
to the inner cities,'' he writes. ``The Spirit is in them. He needs
no license from the Vatican . . .''

   --A historic Attleboro building used as a retreat for Catholic
priests but destroyed in a fatal fire last fall will not be
rebuilt, the La Salette Missionaries have decided.
</P>
<P>
   The missionaries, who are trying to raise $4.5 million to
construct a new shrine church, decided that even with insurance
they could not afford the $11 million needed to reconstruct the
stone building. The building, known as ``the castle,'' was
constructed in 1902 as a sanitarium and was later used as a
seminary and as provincial headquarters for the missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The building was destroyed in a fire last November, and a
visiting priest was killed. The fire apparently started when the
priest fell asleep while smoking a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   The Missionaries of La Salette are a Roman Catholic community of
priests and brothers who take their name from a town in the French
alps where an apparition of Mary is said to have appeared to two
shepherds in 1846.

 By ROBERT KUNZIG 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    A great guitar is like a beautiful woman _ no, really, it is.
Antonio de Torres Jurado, the 19th-century Spanish carpenter who
gave the acoustic guitar its modern form, is said to have been
inspired by the figure of a young woman in Seville.
 &HT;    Torres made the guitar much larger than it had been before,
especially in the hips, and thus made it loud enough to compete at
a time when it was rapidly losing market share to the piano. He
stiffened the vibrating top plate of the guitar, the thin and
all-important soundboard with internal struts that fanned out from
the sound hole like the pleats of a skirt.
 &HT;    Today the finest classical guitars are still made according to
Torres' basic design, by individual craftsmen toiling in
garden-shed workshops that smell of sawdust and shellac.
 &HT;    Like living organisms, no two guitars are the same, and each one
is made of living material: wood.
 &HT;    ``That's the problem,'' says physicist Joe Wolfe of the
University of New South Wales in Sydney. ``Wood is not a
predictable material.''
 &HT;    A guitar is very much like a woman, then (oh, all right, or a
man) _ but it is also, to a physicist, like a bunch of pendulums
connected by springs: It is a system of coupled oscillators.
 &HT;    The first oscillator is the string, but a plucked string doesn't
move enough air to emit much of a sound. So the bottom end of a
guitar string is attached to a hardwood bridge, which transmits the
vibration to the top plate, which transmits it to the rest of the
guitar, which transmits it to the air in and around the instrument.
Together these oscillators augment the string's feeble output and
make it audible.
 &HT;    Their coupled motion patterns are very complex, and each note on
the guitar corresponds to a particular pattern. But each vibration
pattern is made up of a sum of simpler vibrations, called modes.
 &HT;    Play an F sharp on the bass E string, for instance (or a G, or G
sharp; it depends on the guitar), and the whole instrument will
swell and contract like a balloon, albeit indiscernibly, with the
top and back plates moving a few microns closer and then apart,
roughly a hundred times a second.
 &HT;    About an octave higher _ at the fourth, fifth or sixth fret of
the D string _ the top and back plates move roughly twice as fast,
at 215 hertz or so, but now they move in parallel, forward and back
at the same time. Another octave or so higher and the bottom end of
the soundboard inflates, while the neighboring area next to the
sound hole deflates, and vice versa.
 &HT;    The soundboard is the most important source of sound on a
guitar, and so selecting the wood for it takes care. It has to be
so light that a vibrating string can move it, and stiff enough so
that it won't pollute the sound with a wobbly mess of overtones. it
is usually spruce, sometimes redwood or cedar.
 &HT;    A tree that has grown slowly on cold mountain slopes works best,
because slow growth, with its closely spaced rings, ensures more
even properties. A good luthier picking a board will flex it with
his hands and rap it with his knuckle; the sound it makes is an
indirect indication of its density.
 &HT;    But even the best luthier will not get perfectly consistent
results. ``Each piece of wood is a bit different,'' Wolfe says.
``One piece turns out to be a bit stiffer than the last piece from
the same tree. You make something exactly the same shape and size,
using the same techniques, and you measure it and one of the
resonance frequencies is up 10 hertz, and another one is down 10
hertz. And it's a completely different instrument.''
 &HT;    This lack of reproducibility makes it difficult to do a
controlled experiment in luthiery _ you can never be sure of
changing just one thing about a guitar and holding all the other
variables constant. That's one reason luthiers as a bunch are not
scientifically inclined; another is that a lone craftsman producing
only one or two guitars a month can't afford to do a lot of
experimenting.
 &HT;    ``The way guitars are made is to formula,'' says Rob Armstrong,
a luthier in Coventry, England. ``There is nobody questioning
what's going on.''
 &HT;    Armstrong is an exception; he has been helping Owen Pedgley, an
industrial designer at Loughborough University in England, design a
guitar made of injection-molded polycarbonate.
 &HT;    Another, more controversial freethinker is Michael Kasha, a
chemical physicist at Florida State University and a member of the
National Academy of Sciences.
 &HT;    Kasha got interested in guitars 35 years ago, when he looked
inside his 8-year-old son's instrument with a bicycle mirror and
was horrified by what Torres had wrought _ specifically, by the
symmetrical fan of internal struts that are glued to the inside of
the top plate.
 &HT;    ``The traditional soundboard, which was arrived at by accident
and never changed,'' Kasha explains, ``has no tuning from bass to
treble.''
 &HT;    Kasha's theory is that a soundboard vibrates in local modes: The
treble strings stimulate more vibration on the treble side of the
plate, and ditto for the bass.
 &HT;    ``People say the whole soundboard vibrates together, but it's
not true,'' he says. ``When you drive it locally, it vibrates
locally in the predominant pattern.''
 &HT;    It follows that you should be able to tune the soundboard to
respond optimally at a range of frequencies by dividing it into
resonating zones of varying diameters.
 &HT;    Torres' fan bracing doesn't do that; it divides the soundboard
into more or less equal areas. The result, Kasha says, is that many
notes are not brilliant: The fundamental frequency of a note
doesn't dominate the overtones.
 &HT;    Kasha's radically asymmetrical design, in which the struts are
in a herringbone pattern and the sound hole leers from one corner
of the guitar like the eye of a Cyclops, is designed to be
brilliant.
 &HT;    Although a few luthiers have followed Kasha's precepts, and at
least one stirring recording has been made with his guitars _ Kurt
Rodarmer's guitar version of Bach's ``Goldberg Variations'' _ Kasha
has not really shaken the Torres tradition in three decades of
trying.
 &HT;    And he certainly hasn't convinced other physicists. They
question his basic theory (``The notion that there's a bass side
and a treble side to the top plate _ there isn't any such thing,''
says Bernard Richardson, a physicist and guitar-maker at the
University of Cardiff, Wales) and fault him for publishing no
experimental evidence.
 &HT;    Lately, Kasha has been testing guitars, including those of top
luthiers, in an anechoic chamber, and he says he will soon publish
measurements that will demonstrate the superiority of his design.
One famous maker is going to be especially shocked, Kasha thinks:
``His basses are woofy. They have no fundamental at all.''
 &HT;    That particular luthier has said that the inspiration for his
successful design came to him in a dream _ which is perhaps an
indication of one of the obstacles faced by anyone hoping to
organize a scientific revolution in luthiery.
 &HT;    Last August, Kasha spoke at a guitar festival in Healdsburg,
Calif., that was attended by many luthiers.
 &HT;    ``There was a panel discussion,'' he recalls, ``and one of the
guys on the panel was a pure mystic. He said, `These are things
beyond man's ken _ only God can understand these things. We have to
go by the spirit of the music.' Well, I'm not a mystic.''
 &HT;    Even if it were possible to banish mystics, there is another
reason luthiery will always remain more of a craft than a science:
Tastes differ. Kasha may have succeeded in making guitars sound
more brilliant, but some people find his guitars loud.
 &HT;    There is no such thing as a perfect guitar, Richardson says:
``Saying that you're going to produce the perfect guitar is like
saying you're going to produce the perfect wine from a batch of
chemicals.''
 &HT;    Beauty, after all, is in the ear of the beholder.

 By ROBERT KUNZIG 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    A great guitar is like a beautiful woman _ no, really, it is.
Antonio de Torres Jurado, the 19th-century Spanish carpenter who
gave the acoustic guitar its modern form, is said to have been
inspired by the figure of a young woman in Seville.
 &HT;    Torres made the guitar much larger than it had been before,
especially in the hips, and thus made it loud enough to compete at
a time when it was rapidly losing market share to the piano. He
stiffened the vibrating top plate of the guitar, the thin and
all-important soundboard with internal struts that fanned out from
the sound hole like the pleats of a skirt.
 &HT;    Today the finest classical guitars are still made according to
Torres' basic design, by individual craftsmen toiling in
garden-shed workshops that smell of sawdust and shellac.
 &HT;    Like living organisms, no two guitars are the same, and each one
is made of living material: wood.
 &HT;    ``That's the problem,'' says physicist Joe Wolfe of the
University of New South Wales in Sydney. ``Wood is not a
predictable material.''
 &HT;    A guitar is very much like a woman, then (oh, all right, or a
man) _ but it is also, to a physicist, like a bunch of pendulums
connected by springs: It is a system of coupled oscillators.
 &HT;    The first oscillator is the string, but a plucked string doesn't
move enough air to emit much of a sound. So the bottom end of a
guitar string is attached to a hardwood bridge, which transmits the
vibration to the top plate, which transmits it to the rest of the
guitar, which transmits it to the air in and around the instrument.
Together these oscillators augment the string's feeble output and
make it audible.
 &HT;    Their coupled motion patterns are very complex, and each note on
the guitar corresponds to a particular pattern. But each vibration
pattern is made up of a sum of simpler vibrations, called modes.
 &HT;    Play an F sharp on the bass E string, for instance (or a G, or G
sharp; it depends on the guitar), and the whole instrument will
swell and contract like a balloon, albeit indiscernibly, with the
top and back plates moving a few microns closer and then apart,
roughly a hundred times a second.
 &HT;    About an octave higher _ at the fourth, fifth or sixth fret of
the D string _ the top and back plates move roughly twice as fast,
at 215 hertz or so, but now they move in parallel, forward and back
at the same time. Another octave or so higher and the bottom end of
the soundboard inflates, while the neighboring area next to the
sound hole deflates, and vice versa.
 &HT;    The soundboard is the most important source of sound on a
guitar, and so selecting the wood for it takes care. It has to be
so light that a vibrating string can move it, and stiff enough so
that it won't pollute the sound with a wobbly mess of overtones. it
is usually spruce, sometimes redwood or cedar.
 &HT;    A tree that has grown slowly on cold mountain slopes works best,
because slow growth, with its closely spaced rings, ensures more
even properties. A good luthier picking a board will flex it with
his hands and rap it with his knuckle; the sound it makes is an
indirect indication of its density.
 &HT;    But even the best luthier will not get perfectly consistent
results. ``Each piece of wood is a bit different,'' Wolfe says.
``One piece turns out to be a bit stiffer than the last piece from
the same tree. You make something exactly the same shape and size,
using the same techniques, and you measure it and one of the
resonance frequencies is up 10 hertz, and another one is down 10
hertz. And it's a completely different instrument.''
 &HT;    This lack of reproducibility makes it difficult to do a
controlled experiment in luthiery _ you can never be sure of
changing just one thing about a guitar and holding all the other
variables constant. That's one reason luthiers as a bunch are not
scientifically inclined; another is that a lone craftsman producing
only one or two guitars a month can't afford to do a lot of
experimenting.
 &HT;    ``The way guitars are made is to formula,'' says Rob Armstrong,
a luthier in Coventry, England. ``There is nobody questioning
what's going on.''
 &HT;    Armstrong is an exception; he has been helping Owen Pedgley, an
industrial designer at Loughborough University in England, design a
guitar made of injection-molded polycarbonate.
 &HT;    Another, more controversial freethinker is Michael Kasha, a
chemical physicist at Florida State University and a member of the
National Academy of Sciences.
 &HT;    Kasha got interested in guitars 35 years ago, when he looked
inside his 8-year-old son's instrument with a bicycle mirror and
was horrified by what Torres had wrought _ specifically, by the
symmetrical fan of internal struts that are glued to the inside of
the top plate.
 &HT;    ``The traditional soundboard, which was arrived at by accident
and never changed,'' Kasha explains, ``has no tuning from bass to
treble.''
 &HT;    Kasha's theory is that a soundboard vibrates in local modes: The
treble strings stimulate more vibration on the treble side of the
plate, and ditto for the bass.
 &HT;    ``People say the whole soundboard vibrates together, but it's
not true,'' he says. ``When you drive it locally, it vibrates
locally in the predominant pattern.''
 &HT;    It follows that you should be able to tune the soundboard to
respond optimally at a range of frequencies by dividing it into
resonating zones of varying diameters.
 &HT;    Torres' fan bracing doesn't do that; it divides the soundboard
into more or less equal areas. The result, Kasha says, is that many
notes are not brilliant: The fundamental frequency of a note
doesn't dominate the overtones.
 &HT;    Kasha's radically asymmetrical design, in which the struts are
in a herringbone pattern and the sound hole leers from one corner
of the guitar like the eye of a Cyclops, is designed to be
brilliant.
 &HT;    Although a few luthiers have followed Kasha's precepts, and at
least one stirring recording has been made with his guitars _ Kurt
Rodarmer's guitar version of Bach's ``Goldberg Variations'' _ Kasha
has not really shaken the Torres tradition in three decades of
trying.
 &HT;    And he certainly hasn't convinced other physicists. They
question his basic theory (``The notion that there's a bass side
and a treble side to the top plate _ there isn't any such thing,''
says Bernard Richardson, a physicist and guitar-maker at the
University of Cardiff, Wales) and fault him for publishing no
experimental evidence.
 &HT;    Lately, Kasha has been testing guitars, including those of top
luthiers, in an anechoic chamber, and he says he will soon publish
measurements that will demonstrate the superiority of his design.
One famous maker is going to be especially shocked, Kasha thinks:
``His basses are woofy. They have no fundamental at all.''
 &HT;    That particular luthier has said that the inspiration for his
successful design came to him in a dream _ which is perhaps an
indication of one of the obstacles faced by anyone hoping to
organize a scientific revolution in luthiery.
 &HT;    Last August, Kasha spoke at a guitar festival in Healdsburg,
Calif., that was attended by many luthiers.
 &HT;    ``There was a panel discussion,'' he recalls, ``and one of the
guys on the panel was a pure mystic. He said, `These are things
beyond man's ken _ only God can understand these things. We have to
go by the spirit of the music.' Well, I'm not a mystic.''
 &HT;    Even if it were possible to banish mystics, there is another
reason luthiery will always remain more of a craft than a science:
Tastes differ. Kasha may have succeeded in making guitars sound
more brilliant, but some people find his guitars loud.
 &HT;    There is no such thing as a perfect guitar, Richardson says:
``Saying that you're going to produce the perfect guitar is like
saying you're going to produce the perfect wine from a batch of
chemicals.''

DISMANTLING THE DOCTRINE OF THE INFALLIBLE POPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Latin phrase ``ad hominem'' does not begin to describe the
amount of guff and grief that Garry Wills is facing because of his
new book, ``Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit.'' The phrase means
``to the man'' and its argument is really no argument, but a demand
that neither he nor anyone else should question papal authority.
</P>
<P>
   Wills does, with crisp and coherent argument, but his critics
are sure he's wrong before they've read the book. They thus prove
his point and that of other men of faith who believed that popes
were human.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the
holder of it,'' the British Catholic historian, Lord Acton, wrote
in 1887. Wills cites Acton, Cardinal Newman, St. Augustine, and
others in illuminating how modern popes have managed to weaken the
rock on which St. Peter built the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   His chapter titles show the candor he brings to his task:
``Excluded Women,'' ``The Pope's Eunuchs,'' and ``A Gay
Priesthood.'' This latter chapter does not dwell on lurid
headlines, but argues that scandal may eventually lead the church
out of some doctrinal dilemmas: ``The admission of married men and
women to the priesthood _ which is bound to come anyway _ may well
come for the wrong reason, not because women and the community
deserve this, but because of panic at the perception that the
priesthood is becoming predominantly gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Wills is one of America's leading intellectuals, who has shone
new light on the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburg
Address, and various political figures, including John Wayne. He is
also a former altar boy and a former seminarian, but he is not an
apostate. Anyone who challenges his devoutness would be sadly
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite metaphors for less-than-devout Catholics are
passive-aggressive: lapsed, lax, fallen away, back-slider. (I
prefer the formulation of Wills's fellow intellectual, John Gregory
Dunne: ``It says RC on my dogtags.'') While critics can challenge
his piety, Wills offers a vigorous, active faith that uses logic to
dismantle the relatively recent doctrine of papal infallibility. In
the 20th century, while the world slowly embraced democracy, the
Vatican reinforced absolute papal authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humanae Vitae,'' banning birth control, was issued by Pope
Paul VI in 1968. Wills call it ``the most disastrous papal document
of the century'' and also one of the most ignored, as Italy's low
birth rate suggests. But, Wills writes, the encyclical ``is not
really about sex. It is about authority. Paul decided the issue on
that ground alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Popes are politicians, a notion that sounds heretical, but
isn't. Pope John Paul II has pursued a Sun Belt strategy by
courting Africa, Asia, and Latin America and probably not minding
if Europe and North America drift away. His papacy may end soon,
and perhaps his successor will be someone like Pope John XXIII, who
opened the windows and fumigated the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The people are the church, not the pope. That is the bold theme
of ``Papal Sin,'' echoing earlier critics of durable and loving
faith. Lord Acton was skeptical of power. After the First Vatican
Council had approved the doctrine of the infallibility of the pope,
he wrote to Mandell Creighton, commenting on the latter's history
of the papacy:
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge pope and king
unlike other men, with a favorable presumption that they did no
wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way, against
holders of power, increasing as the power increases. Historic
responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility.
Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Garry Wills, along with other doubters, will inhabit
purgatory for an eon or two. But when he gets there, he'll be in
good company. The place could be crowded with popes.
</P>

 By JACK McCLINTOCK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Belted into the seat of a Toyota Land Cruiser piloted by a
friend, 78-year-old Joan Wiffen heads for the outback on a sunny
morning. She hangs on tight as she bounces through the heavily
forested New Zealand countryside. Then, out of the car, she grabs a
walking stick and tramps through shady glades.
 &HT;    Finally she stops at the edge of rushing Mangahouanga Stream and
tentatively dips in a sneaker-shod foot. ``You have to be very
strong or totally insane to keep coming back here for 27 years.''
 &HT;    Wiffen keeps coming back because the place is full of fossils.
She fell in love with them three decades ago and has been hunting
them here ever since.
 &HT;    Wiffen never attended a university or got a single research
grant. However, professional paleontologists call this amateur
``the dragon lady'' for her work excavating the fossils of four
previously unknown sea monsters, including a voracious lizardlike
mosasaur bigger than a killer whale and as fierce as Tyrannosaurus
rex.
 &HT;    But Wiffen's contribution to the understanding of prehistory
goes well beyond unearthing frightening predators. She was the
first person to find dinosaur fossils in New Zealand. Before her
work, paleontologists thought New Zealand was one of the least
likely places for dinosaurs to have lived.
 &HT;    Wiffen never thought she'd become famous. She grew up on farms
in a conventional family and expected to become a housewife. She
did.
 &HT;    Her late husband Pont, an electronics technician who died in
1992, worked at radio stations. They lived in the country, and
Wiffen cooked, cleaned and looked after the sheep, the goats and
the two children, Christopher and Judith.
 &HT;    ``I only heard about dinosaurs when I started buying books for
my own kids,'' she says.
 &HT;    The family hobby was rock collecting. The Wiffens belonged to
rock and mineral clubs, attended night classes in geology and for
seven months in the late 1960s drove all over Australia collecting
opals, topazes, sapphires and garnets and turning them into
jewelry.
 &HT;    Then one day she bought a trilobite fossil at a roadside shop
for 50 cents. Something about the fact that this weird-looking
creature had been alive millions of years before resonated in her:
``I was hooked,'' she says.
 &HT;    She wanted to know what these creatures were, where they lived,
how they came to be and what their lives were like. With her family
in tow, she tramped all over New Zealand, collecting fossil shells
from Motunau, ammonites from Kawhia, belemnites from Port Waikato.
 &HT;    And she read. There were no universities or natural-history
museums in Hawke's Bay _ where her family lived _ so she haunted
libraries and mail-ordered textbooks and articles from journals.
She read everything from basic encyclopedias to specialized texts.
 &HT;    ``The cretaceous reptiles just caught her attention,'' says
paleontologist Gorden Bell of the U.S. National Park Service. ``She
knew there wasn't a lot of information, and she may have realized
the contribution she could make.''
 &HT;    Slowly, Wiffen became convinced dinosaurs could have lived in
New Zealand. There was fossil evidence of forests existing during
the Jurassic period _ 190 million to 135 million years ago _ and a
record of marine reptiles extending nearly that far back.
 &HT;    Snakes and marsupials hadn't evolved at the time New Zealand
split off from Gondwana _ the southern supercontinent that about 85
million years ago divided into South America, Africa and Australia
_ so those species aren't native to the two islands.
 &HT;    But dinosaurs had existed for some 150 million years at the time
of the split, so why hadn't their remains been found in New
Zealand?
 &HT;    The conventional wisdom was that dinosaurs never migrated to
Wiffen's part of Gondwana before the split, or that the climate had
turned too cold for them to survive.
 &HT;    Wiffen didn't buy it. ``I didn't know a huge amount _ nobody did
at that time in New Zealand _ but I couldn't see any reason why
they couldn't be there.''
 &HT;    So she decided to keep looking.
 &HT;    The search was expensive, so the Wiffens began seeking fossil
sites close to Hawke's Bay. Her big break came in 1972, when she
found an old geological map in the back of a village toy shop. The
map was based on oil exploring, and in a legend down one side, she
read: ``Reptilian bones in beds of brackish water in the Te Hoe
Valley.''
 &HT;    Six months later Wiffen found the site, a remote stream 70 miles
inland and 1,500 feet above sea level. The area had been an estuary
in the Late Cretaceous period. Now fossils were literally bursting
out of the rocks: fish teeth, fish scales and vertebrae, shark
teeth, shells and turtle parts. But no dinosaurs.
 &HT;    Wiffen's whole family became involved in her fossil search and
was joined by a widening circle of friends recruited as much for
brawn as dedication. Wiffen let them feel important, and they were,
but she was the one who learned the names of the bones, understood
how a marine reptile's limbs differed from those of a land reptile
and studied how to get fossils out of rocks.
 &HT;    Her gang prospected up and down Mangahouanga Stream. Sometimes
the crew blew apart the bigger rocks with dynamite, a practice
Wiffen now regards as excessive. But one such explosion in 1974
produced a major discovery _ her first mosasaur specimen.
 &HT;    Four years later she started the process of extracting the bones
from the sandstone surrounding them. For two years, Wiffen toiled
in her garage workshop, sawing at sandstone to reveal more bone,
soaking the bone in an acid bath to eat away more rock, and then
coating the exposed bone with protective resin. Then she repeated
the process until the bone was fully revealed.
 &HT;    In 1980 her long labor was rewarded with the skeleton of what
turned out to be a new genus and species of mosasaur, a massive
carnivorous marine reptile that grew to be as long as 45 feet. The
creatures had powerful sinuous bodies, broad, webbed paddles for
limbs, and long, conical, tooth-filled heads like those of
alligators.
 &HT;    Had she found nothing more than this single creature, her place
in history would be secure, Bell says. But the new genus represents
a specific, separate, unknown lineage of mosasaur and sheds light
on the development of marine reptiles in general. Before long
Wiffen had discovered three more.
 &HT;    But she wasn't just digging up sea creatures. Without knowing
it, she had also found dinosaurs. One day in 1975, Pont found a
piece of petrified wood sticking out of a football-sized
concretion. He broke the rock open with his hammer, saw nothing
interesting and turned it over to his wife. When she inspected it,
fragments of a fossil caught her eye.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was a vertebra, but I didn't know,'' she says.
``I just knew that it was different.'' She couldn't identify it
precisely, and it joined her other unidentified fossils in a locked
cabinet.
 &HT;    In 1979, she and Pont took a holiday in Brisbane and stopped at
the Queensland Museum. There she met Ralph Molnar, an American
paleontologist working as the senior curator of vertebrate fossils.
She noticed some fossil bones on his desk that looked familiar.
 &HT;    ``I have a vertebra like that at home,'' Wiffen said,
remembering the one she'd found back in 1975. ``What is it?''
 &HT;    A dinosaur bone, he said.
 &HT;    Back in Hawke's Bay, Wiffen made casts and photos of her find
and sent them off to Molnar. He phoned two weeks later. ``You've
got yourself a dinosaur.''
 &HT;    ``It was the first dinosaur found in New Zealand,'' Molnar says
today. It belonged to a theropod _ a carnivorous, large-headed
creature resembling a smaller T rex. The bone proved Wiffen's
central point _ that dinosaurs had roamed New Zealand.
 &HT;    Today nobody disputes Wiffen's conclusions. ``She put New
Zealand on the map with respect to Mesozoic reptile discoveries,''
says John Long, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Western
Australian Museum in Perth and the author of ``Dinosaurs of
Australia and New Zealand.''
 &HT;    The more Wiffen has learned, the more she sees how even the
tiniest finds improve our understanding of an ancient world.

 &HT;    Belted into the seat of a Toyota Land Cruiser piloted by a
friend, 78-year-old Joan Wiffen heads for the outback on a sunny
morning. She hangs on tight as she bounces through the heavily
forested New Zealand countryside. Then, out of the car, she grabs a
walking stick and tramps through shady glades.
 &HT;    Finally she stops at the edge of rushing Mangahouanga Stream and
tentatively dips in a sneaker-shod foot. ``You have to be very
strong or totally insane to keep coming back here for 27 years.''
 &HT;    Wiffen keeps coming back because the place is full of fossils.
She fell in love with them three decades ago and has been hunting
them here ever since.
 &HT;    Wiffen never attended a university or got a single research
grant. However, professional paleontologists call this amateur
``the dragon lady'' for her work excavating the fossils of four
previously unknown sea monsters, including a voracious lizardlike
mosasaur bigger than a killer whale and as fierce as Tyrannosaurus
rex.
 &HT;    But Wiffen's contribution to the understanding of prehistory
goes well beyond unearthing frightening predators. She was the
first person to find dinosaur fossils in New Zealand. Before her
work, paleontologists thought New Zealand was one of the least
likely places for dinosaurs to have lived.
 &HT;    Wiffen never thought she'd become famous. She grew up on farms
in a conventional family and expected to become a housewife. She
did.
 &HT;    Her late husband Pont, an electronics technician who died in
1992, worked at radio stations. They lived in the country, and
Wiffen cooked, cleaned and looked after the sheep, the goats and
the two children, Christopher and Judith.
 &HT;    ``I only heard about dinosaurs when I started buying books for
my own kids,'' she says.
 &HT;    The family hobby was rock collecting. The Wiffens belonged to
rock and mineral clubs, attended night classes in geology and for
seven months in the late 1960s drove all over Australia collecting
opals, topazes, sapphires and garnets and turning them into
jewelry.
 &HT;    Then one day she bought a trilobite fossil at a roadside shop
for 50 cents. Something about the fact that this weird-looking
creature had been alive millions of years before resonated in her:
``I was hooked,'' she says.
 &HT;    She wanted to know what these creatures were, where they lived,
how they came to be and what their lives were like. With her family
in tow, she tramped all over New Zealand, collecting fossil shells
from Motunau, ammonites from Kawhia, belemnites from Port Waikato.
 &HT;    And she read. There were no universities or natural-history
museums in Hawke's Bay _ where her family lived _ so she haunted
libraries and mail-ordered textbooks and articles from journals.
She read everything from basic encyclopedias to specialized texts.
 &HT;    ``The cretaceous reptiles just caught her attention,'' says
paleontologist Gorden Bell of the U.S. National Park Service. ``She
knew there wasn't a lot of information, and she may have realized
the contribution she could make.''
 &HT;    Slowly, Wiffen became convinced dinosaurs could have lived in
New Zealand. There was fossil evidence of forests existing during
the Jurassic period _ 190 million to 135 million years ago _ and a
record of marine reptiles extending nearly that far back.
 &HT;    Snakes and marsupials hadn't evolved at the time New Zealand
split off from Gondwana _ the southern supercontinent that about 85
million years ago divided into South America, Africa and Australia
_ so those species aren't native to the two islands.
 &HT;    But dinosaurs had existed for some 150 million years at the time
of the split, so why hadn't their remains been found in New
Zealand?
 &HT;    The conventional wisdom was that dinosaurs never migrated to
Wiffen's part of Gondwana before the split, or that the climate had
turned too cold for them to survive.
 &HT;    Wiffen didn't buy it. ``I didn't know a huge amount _ nobody did
at that time in New Zealand _ but I couldn't see any reason why
they couldn't be there.''
 &HT;    So she decided to keep looking.
 &HT;    The search was expensive, so the Wiffens began seeking fossil
sites close to Hawke's Bay. Her big break came in 1972, when she
found an old geological map in the back of a village toy shop. The
map was based on oil exploring, and in a legend down one side, she
read: ``Reptilian bones in beds of brackish water in the Te Hoe
Valley.''
 &HT;    Six months later Wiffen found the site, a remote stream 70 miles
inland and 1,500 feet above sea level. The area had been an estuary
in the Late Cretaceous period. Now fossils were literally bursting
out of the rocks: fish teeth, fish scales and vertebrae, shark
teeth, shells and turtle parts. But no dinosaurs.
 &HT;    Wiffen's whole family became involved in her fossil search and
was joined by a widening circle of friends recruited as much for
brawn as dedication. Wiffen let them feel important, and they were,
but she was the one who learned the names of the bones, understood
how a marine reptile's limbs differed from those of a land reptile
and studied how to get fossils out of rocks.
 &HT;    Her gang prospected up and down Mangahouanga Stream. Sometimes
the crew blew apart the bigger rocks with dynamite, a practice
Wiffen now regards as excessive. But one such explosion in 1974
produced a major discovery _ her first mosasaur specimen.
 &HT;    Four years later she started the process of extracting the bones
from the sandstone surrounding them. For two years, Wiffen toiled
in her garage workshop, sawing at sandstone to reveal more bone,
soaking the bone in an acid bath to eat away more rock, and then
coating the exposed bone with protective resin. Then she repeated
the process until the bone was fully revealed.
 &HT;    In 1980 her long labor was rewarded with the skeleton of what
turned out to be a new genus and species of mosasaur, a massive
carnivorous marine reptile that grew to be as long as 45 feet. The
creatures had powerful sinuous bodies, broad, webbed paddles for
limbs, and long, conical, tooth-filled heads like those of
alligators.
 &HT;    Had she found nothing more than this single creature, her place
in history would be secure, Bell says. But the new genus represents
a specific, separate, unknown lineage of mosasaur and sheds light
on the development of marine reptiles in general. Before long
Wiffen had discovered three more.
 &HT;    But she wasn't just digging up sea creatures. Without knowing
it, she had also found dinosaurs. One day in 1975, Pont found a
piece of petrified wood sticking out of a football-sized
concretion. He broke the rock open with his hammer, saw nothing
interesting and turned it over to his wife. When she inspected it,
fragments of a fossil caught her eye.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was a vertebra, but I didn't know,'' she says.
``I just knew that it was different.'' She couldn't identify it
precisely, and it joined her other unidentified fossils in a locked
cabinet.
 &HT;    In 1979, she and Pont took a holiday in Brisbane and stopped at
the Queensland Museum. There she met Ralph Molnar, an American
paleontologist working as the senior curator of vertebrate fossils.
She noticed some fossil bones on his desk that looked familiar.
 &HT;    ``I have a vertebra like that at home,'' Wiffen said,
remembering the one she'd found back in 1975. ``What is it?''
 &HT;    A dinosaur bone, he said.
 &HT;    Back in Hawke's Bay, Wiffen made casts and photos of her find
and sent them off to Molnar. He phoned two weeks later. ``You've
got yourself a dinosaur.''
 &HT;    ``It was the first dinosaur found in New Zealand,'' Molnar says
today. It belonged to a theropod _ a carnivorous, large-headed
creature resembling a smaller T rex. The bone proved Wiffen's
central point _ that dinosaurs had roamed New Zealand.
 &HT;    Today nobody disputes Wiffen's conclusions. ``She put New
Zealand on the map with respect to Mesozoic reptile discoveries,''
says John Long, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Western
Australian Museum in Perth and the author of ``Dinosaurs of
Australia and New Zealand.''
 &HT;    The more Wiffen has learned, the more she sees how even the
tiniest finds improve our understanding of an ancient world.

O'NEAL'S NAME LARGEST IN LAKER TITLE CREDITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers are a Hollywood team with
Hollywood themes, which makes it difficult to take them seriously.
It's not always clear what mode they are in: Is it animation or
based on a true story? So when someone tells you that the Lakers
have a player who is just as dominant as any center in pro
basketball history, you brace yourself for the well-timed punch
line.
</P>
<P>
   But there is none.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal stands 7 feet 1 inch and weighs 315 pounds. He
is 28 years old. He compares himself to influential figures such as
Superman and Aristotle. He plays before fans who remember watching
Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (he wouldn't have been
able to stop them, but they wouldn't have stopped him, either). He
plays before fans who remember watching Bill Russell take title
after title from the Lakers (he wouldn't have been able to stop the
220-pound Celtic, but Russell wouldn't have stopped him, either).
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal won his first NBA championship Monday night, and did it
in front of another Hall of Fame center, Bill Walton. Like the
others, Walton wouldn't have stopped O'Neal. Hakeem Olajuwon used
to post up so elegantly that you swore there was a secret ballet
being staged in his sneakers . . . Moses Malone had a biblical name
and brought a construction worker's mentality to his game . . .
Patrick Ewing . . . Robert Parish . . . George Mikan . . . David
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Scan all the names in the NBA's Big &AMP; Tall register and match
them with O'Neal's. Nothing changes. He doesn't dwarf them nor is
he dwarfed. He is a great player, a Hall of Fame player, and he
held that status long before he averaged 38 points and 16.7
rebounds in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year before the Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal, the team won
21 games. In his rookie season, 1992-93, the team won 41 games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of Hollywood in O'Neal's Lakers. Mel Gibson and
Brad Pitt cheered for them during Monday's game and Vivica A. Fox
talked with them afterward. Their owner, Dr. Jerry Buss, calls
himself an entertainer. Their coach, Phil Jackson, produced his own
version of ``Love And Basketball'' when his wife, June, asked him
to choose between her and the sport. He chose the sport. Recently,
he has also chosen to spend a lot of time with Buss's daughter,
Jeanie. (That, friends, is what you call a triangle offense.)
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and their fans know about dysfunction, too. Shortly
after the clinching, 116-111 win over Indiana, some fans began
setting cars on fire outside Staples Center. Before that, the
hottest story was Mrs. Glen Rice claiming that Jackson was using
her husband as a high-paid hostage in order to get management's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal doesn't fit into that surreal film category. The man is a
straight-up documentary. He is so strong that he sometimes
resembles the red-caped superhero whose logo is branded into his
biceps. One of the funniest scenes from the Finals occurred in Game
5 when Travis Best tried to foul O'Neal flagrantly. The
5-foot-11-inch guard apparently wanted to take O'Neal down. But he
flopped to the court instead. O'Neal looked over the fallen fouler
as if to say, ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar averaged 24.6 points, 11.2 rebounds, and 3.6
assists in his career. Before this season, in which he averaged
29.7 points, 13.6 rebounds, and 3.8 assists, O'Neal's career
numbers were 27.1, 12.2, and 2.5.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal cried after the Lakers won their first title since
1987-88. He was a big man, crying in his mother's arms. He said he
has held his emotions in for a long time, and he is tired of
hearing his critics say what he can't do. He is correct in
defending himself. There are areas in which he is certainly
medicore _ like rapping. But the rap about other areas of his game
are unfair.
</P>
<P>
   No one, absolutely no one, in the NBA can guard him. The game
has changed dramatically, so you won't see O'Neal score 100 points
as Chamberlain did in 1962. He could probably average 50 a night,
even with his poor free throw shooting, but the Lakers wouldn't win
as much. You could put him on the worst team in the NBA right now
and that team would become capable of winning a title. Yes, even
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Lakers executive Jerry West remodeled his team in the
summer of 1996 so O'Neal could join it. Now the Lakers can say they
have won titles in seasons that began in the 1970s, '80s and '90s.
Their former rivals, the Celtics, stopped competing for
championships in the Arsenio Hall era.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russell's career free throw percentage: 56.1.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's: 53.6.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's: 51.1.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's: 76.9 (but he did have small hands).

</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize, until they play with him, how much he
makes you better, how much easier the game is when he is on the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox said that after O'Neal's 41-point, 12-rebound
performance in Game 6. Fox played 14 minutes in that game and made
one shot. But the shot was O'Neal-inspired and significant. Fox was
being guarded by Reggie Miller, who was trying to decide between
playing closer to Fox or cheating back on O'Neal. Fox faked a pass
to O'Neal. Miller moved back slightly. Just as Miller made the
wrong decision, Fox released a shot beyond the 3-point arc and made
it. The Lakers had a 94-90 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fox knows how easy it is to play with O'Neal because it is
proven that other players disappear when the Big IPO _ he calls
himself that, too _ is not on their side.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Magic went to the finals in 1995. That season, perimeter
shooter Dennis Scott made 44 percent of his shots. With no O'Neal
in the 1996-97 season, Scott made 39 percent of his shots.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Indiana coach Larry Bird sat in his temporary
coach's office for more than an hour. He was miserable. Earlier, he
had said of O'Neal: ``He's the most dominating player in our
league. He's just so dominating that they have an opportunity here
to do something great for a number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point the great actor, Jack Nicholson, talked with Bird.
But what was there to say? O'Neal is an atypical Hollywood story.
When you watch him, you expect the credits to roll and reveal the
following:

AS SUMMER HITS, TEAM IS BEACHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What now, Boston? Pedro Martinez has succumbed to the
fate that has met so many Red Sox hurlers before him. He was beaten
by the New York Yankees in a game that was badly needed for morale.
The Yankees reached him for three homers in a 3-0 victory over the
staggering Sox.
</P>
<P>
   And so the SS Jimy appears headed into another one of those
Perfect Storms that have splintered Sox boats so many times. Nitwit
sports radio ought to be fun around here today. How do you spell
P-A-N-I-C?
</P>
<P>
   Memo from Red Sox management: Any Sox fan hurt jumping off the
bandwagon must get team approval before surgery or risk having
their contract voided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't panic,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``It's not the
right thing to do in my mind. That's what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   As June games go, this was one the fans felt they had to have.
The Sox were reeling. They'd just given up 22 runs in the worst
Fenway beating in club history. Wounded players were stacked like
cordwood in the trainer's room. The Blue Jays were breathing down
their necks, threatening to drop Boston into third place.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox Nation was nervous. Monday's 22-1 beating ignited
flashbacks of the Boston Massacre of '78. The ghoulish presence of
Don Zimmer in the Yankee dugout wasn't helping any. In a cruel
quirk of the calendar, the dreaded fall was coming on the cusp of
summer and Boston fans were rightfully scared.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro would make everything right, they figured. Pedro would put
the planets back in line. Pedro would slay the hated Yankee dragon
and restore pride and confidence to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out six consecutive Yankees in the early innings
Tuesday night. He gave up only five hits and one walk while fanning
nine. He threw 118 pitches, 76 for strikes. But not even the magic
of Pedro is enough to overcome a salami-bat offense, Wendell ``Send
'Em In'' Kim, two more infield errors, and that old Yankee
dominance that has haunted us for so many months, years, decades,
and centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams, and Paul O'Neill hit solo homers
off Pedro, and Boss Steinbrenner laughed from his club box as the
Yankees conquered the Red Sox before another packed house at
ancient Fenway. It's now an aggregate 25-1 over two days with Pete
(2-6) Schourek and Brother Ramon (6.08 ERA) lined up against the
world champs for the next two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only tell (the fans) to be patient,'' said Pedro, who
saw his ERA skyrocket past Bob Gibson to 1.18. ``We're gonna snap
out of it and hopefully do better. We have plenty of time, we have
plenty of talent and plenty of people willing to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but the Townies have lost 13 of 19, Pedro has dropped two
straight to the Yanks, and Boston may need Bobby Sprowl and Oil Can
Boyd on the hill at SkyDome this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end of the world,'' said Trot Nixon, looking like
his dog just died. ``But these games against the Yankees are a
little more magnified than others. For me, possibly I'm trying too
hard. Little things in this game can mess with your mind, and with
some of us, it might be messing with our minds out there. But
everybody in the clubhouse cares and cares a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it's depressing when Pedro is unable to pull the Sox
from the abyss, but how much can one man do? In six of Pedro's 13
starts, his teammates have not scored a run in the first five
innings. It's hard to win without any runs. Anybody wish John
Valentin were still around? Wilton Veras clearly is not ready to be
an everyday player in the majors. He's a nice prospect who never
hits the ball hard and looks increasingly skittish in the field.
And now Nomar has bungled two balls in two nights. Yeesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a team,'' Pedro reminded the panic-striken media
throng. ``We go down together and stand together. We're all
struggling, but it's just a bump in the road. We have to keep
playing and find our way out.''
</P>
<P>
   He bristled when it was suggested that the Sox might be
pressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question that doesn't belong in here,'' said the ace.
``We all lose and win. That's not pressing, not with me and my
teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   The mark of these Red Sox under Williams has been that they
don't get too high or too low. They have the correct mentality for
a 162-game hardball marathon. But that approach is being tested now
as never before. They have the look of a rusty 1987 Toyota chugging
uphill just before the wheels come off. These Sox need help, and
it's past time for Boy Wonder Dan Duquette (still harder to find
than Whitey Bulger) to do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like these kids, they can play,'' said ultimate company man
Williams. ``I can only talk about the players that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro added, ``Whatever help this team can get, I would like to
be here, but I think this team is good enough to win, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful. The light from Pedro's star is truly blinding, but it
cannot illuminate an entire franchise.

OSLO'S MODERN ART LOOKS BEYOND `THE SCREAM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO _ Before heading off to Norway, I asked some local curators
about the contemporary art scene there. They offered to tell me
about Stockholm and Helsinki, about the wonderful new museums in
those cities by Rafael Moneo (Stockholm) and Stephen Holl
(Helsinki.) Those I'd already seen.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Oslo? What happened there after the only
Norwegian artist most of us have heard of, Edvard Munch, of ``The
Scream'' fame? The only contemporary Norwegian artist anyone seemed
aware of was Odd Nerdrum, and primarily because his posh New York
gallery, Forum, regularly places full-page ads for his
Son-of-Old-Master canvases in glossy American art magazines. I saw
a couple of Nerdrums in Oslo's Astrup Fearnley Museum, and odd they
were indeed, unsettling updates of Rembrandt and Caravaggio, the
masters he's mastered. He makes paintings of subjects like ``Woman
Killing Injured Man'' and ``Man with a Woman's Head.'' He's a
flamboyant and controversial figure. To me, his art is creepy and
contrived.
</P>
<P>
   Nerdrum ``is a very public and active figure in Norway,
important in creating interest in art,'' says Per Bjarne Boym, the
director of Oslo's National Museum of Contemporary Art. Boym
expresses his own opinion of Nerdrum through a roundabout route.
``I took the initiative to do a Smithson show here,'' he says,
referring to the American ``Earthworks'' artist Robert Smithson,
most famous for his ``Spiral Jetty'' in Utah's Great Salt Lake.
``It's a different perspective from Nerdrum.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum Boym leads and the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern
Art are just around the corner from each other, in one of Oslo's
oldest areas, near the harbor and castle and the quarter of the
city built by King Christian IV in 1624 after a devastating fire
destroyed much of the rest. The two museums have related goals:
Both attempt to integrate contemporary Norwegian art into the
international scene. There's also a current attempt to integrate
Norway into the rest of Scandinavia, through that increasingly
common tactic, the biennale. Cities from Istanbul to Johannesburg
to Havana now have them; Norway's, the ``Momentum Festival of
Contemporary Art,'' restricts itself to Nordic artists. On view
through July 2 this year, ``Momentum'' is being held in the
lakeside town of Moss, a 45-minute train ride from Oslo. (It opened
after I'd already left the country, alas, so I didn't get a look at
it.)
</P>
<P>
   I did, though, get a good look at the 10-year-old National
Museum of Contemporary Art, which is funded by the government, and
at the 7-year-old Astrup Fearnley, which is privately funded by
family foundations established by shipowners Thomas Fearnley and
Nils Astrup, both also descendants of the 19th century Norwegian
landscape painter Thomas Fearnley. The museum, housed within the
sleek modern office building owned by the Astrup Fearnley company,
is vaguely ship-like in design, alluding both to family business
and Viking heritage, with an elevated walkway and prow effect and
enviably handsome galleries of various shapes and sizes. They house
both permanent installations from the considerable collections and
temporary shows.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Contemporary Museum, it split off from the National
Gallery a decade ago, moving into the erstwhile Bank of Norway
building, a stately Art Nouveau structure. Boym, who says ``there's
a very strong situation in Norwegian contemporary art at present,''
wants to move out _ to a new, purpose-built facility behind the
existing National Gallery, so the two collections can be reunited,
each putting the other in context. Besides, says Boym, sounding
like museum directors the world over, the current building is far
too small to show much of what his museum owns. The target date for
the opening of the new one is 2005, pending parliamentary approval
in this fall's session.
</P>
<P>
   The Contemporary Museum's collections, which now number 4,500
works, used to be entirely Norwegian. Now, almost 15 percent of the
objects are by foreigners. Boym has recently acquired a work by US
video sculptor Bill Viola, and the museum owns a spectacular video
by Yugoslavian-born Marina Abramovic, a tower of five monitors, all
showing human hands scrubbing away at a skeleton, as if it could
never be clean enough. Under the Contemporary Museum's auspices,
Jenny Holzer projections have also appeared on the ski jump built
for the Lillehammer Olympics and on Oslo's City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The temporary show I caught at Astrup Fearnley was by the
eminent Norwegian photographer Tom Sandberg, whose large, blurry,
black and white photographs of shadows observed through a veil of
raindrops, or the backs of babies' heads, are fragile and
apparition-like _ especially those that are unframed and tacked
directly on the wall, as if they'd grown right out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The impressive mix at Astrup Fearnley also includes major works
by such international stars as Gerhard Richter, Damien Hirst, and
Anselm Kiefer. Richter's glorious triptych ``River'' surrounds you,
like Monet's last paintings. Hirst, the Bad Boy of British
sculpture, is represented by ``Mother and Child Divided,'' one of
his finest works, a cow and calf, each sliced down the center, each
half floating in formaldehyde in a glass vitrine. Even sadder than
the division of the individual animals is the separation of mother
and child. You have to squeeze yourself between the halves of this
piece, but it's worth the effort, so rich and varied are the
exposed innards. Hirst comes in for a lot of ridicule and protest;
in this piece, he's a poet of the macabre.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer, too, is a poet, one of the towering figures of
contemporary art. His ``The High Priestess'' is permanently
installed in a sanctuary-like space in the depths of the museum. A
vast steel bookcase, it is filled with 126 gigantic lead books,
wrinkled and crumpled, spitting out forbidding wire frizzes,
seeming to contain _ and guard _ the secrets of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have mixed feelings on seeing the same two dozen
internationally celebrated artists in every contemporary museum on
every continent I visit, although, for me, Kiefer is almost always
worth traveling any distance. But the international contemporary
museum experience often boils down to which museum boasts the best
Frank Stellas, and which best displays them. It's a contest of
quality, quantity, and setting.
</P>
<P>
   So it's wonderful to ``click'' with an artist I'd never heard
of, which is what happened to me at the ``Terje Bergstad: Images _
Signs'' show recently at Oslo's Contemporary Museum. Bergstad, now
61, is virtually unknown outside Norway, and exhibits rarely,
largely because his life has been spent in and out of hospitals
with what Boym calls ``mental and physical illness that has
debilitated him through the drugs he has to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone, especially any foreigner, will see Munch in Bergstad:
Both are suffering souls finding solace in nature. But Bergstad
seems to me an authentic voice, although his Oslo retrospective,
covering work from the 1960s to the present, met with mixed
critical reaction, partly because of its somber Munch-ishness.
</P>
<P>
   Bergstad works primarily on paper, which gives his art
fragility, and with the most basic materials. Darkness is his
hallmark, and some works are so smudgy that you can barely tell a
nude from a landscape. His series of ``Cathedrals'' has more in
common with the dark, rugged outlines of Rouault than with the
cathedrals of Monet. Some of Bergstad's cathedrals sag, as if about
to collapse. A couple of them are on blackened, coarse, wrinkled
burlap, as if drowned by dirt and soot.
</P>
<P>
   Like Munch, Bergstad is obsessed with deathbed and sickroom
scenes, which light cannot penetrate even through there are large
windows in the rooms. He's made a series of highly intuitive
drawings, on scraps of paper, of patients waiting in doctors'
offices. He's also obsessed with the forests of Telemark,
traditional home of trolls, and draws and paints its cottages,
farms, and lakes with thick, jagged lines. During his hospital
stays, he listened to radio reports of atrocities historic and
modern, at Terezin and Soweto, and made series on those themes, the
imagery askew, the faces disembodied, sometimes drawn on brown
paper that looks like grocery store bags.
</P>
<P>
   Bergstad had a single US show, in a New York gallery in 1967,
when he was exhibited as ``promising.'' The promise was fulfilled;
the career was not. Next February, the McMullen Museum of Art at
Boston College will mount a Munch show. It would be wonderful if
some other area institution would seize the opportunity to restage
the Bergstad show at the same time: There's already a handsome
catalog translated into English.

HE'S WELL ON HIS WAY TO BEING ABLE TO RETIRE AT 55 OR 60 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I am single and intend to work until I am 60. I have other
savings for emergencies and to purchase of a home. My 401(k) will
be my only retirement savings. Will I have enough to retire at 60?
What about at 55? Should I reallocate my 401(k) investments? What
would be the advantage of a Roth IRA as an alternative to funding
my 401(k) to the same extent?
</P>
<P>
   M.O., Weymouth, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You would probably be in good shape to retire at 55, and
certainly at 60. The numbers can be a little elusive, since I am
simply plotting out the growth of your 401(k) with the current
balance and contributions. In reality, if you continue your
retirement savings as a percentage of earnings, the expected
accumulation would rise as your earnings rise, and over 30 or 35
years that would make a very big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here's the math based on current contributions. If you
earned average 10 percent investment returns, you would have
$1,999,008 at age 55 and $3,342,214 at age 60. Those numbers sound
nice, but here's the shocker: You are now living on $48,400 a year
_ your income less your retirement savings. If inflation runs at
3.5 percent a year for 30 years, you will need $135,848 to buy what
$48,400 buys today; after 35 years, the figure would rise to
$161,345.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulation at age 55 would provide an income stream
sufficient to maintain your lifestyle, but there would not be
enough left over to provide capital growth to protect you against
the inflation of your retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   So why did I say you probably could retire comfortably at 55?
Because as your income rises, so would your contributions. These
additions should generate sufficient additional accumulation to put
you in a much brighter situation than the one spelled out above.
</P>
<P>
   Your 401(k) allocations are OK, but not much more. I find no
record of a Fidelity Enhanced Index fund, and am guessing that what
you hold is the Fidelity Spartan Total Market Index fund, which has
about 2,300 stocks _ basically the Standard and Poor's 500 plus a
sampling from the smaller-cap universe.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that since index funds are market-cap weighted,
the broader market index funds remain almost thoroughly dominated
by the large-cap domestic funds. For that reason, I'd suggest you
drop the total market index offering and seek out direct
participation in different market sectors. Among the available
offerings you listed, I would suggest 15 percent positions in each
of the Putnam Small Cap and International offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as you can see, your expected accumulation in the
401(k) will be substantial, so you won't be in a position to face
significantly reduced taxes in retirement. So there is only one
situation in which the Roth IRA would not be a good idea, which is
if a reduction in your 401(k) contributions would cause a reduction
in your employer match. If you can reduce your contributions to the
401(k) by $2,000 a year without affecting the employer match, I
suggest you do open Roth IRA accounts, beginning with a holding
such as Vanguard Health Care fund, and then in the following year
using Fidelity Select Technology fund, thereafter alternating your
investments between the two.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Almost 11 years ago, I bought 40 shares of Harley-Davidson at
$25 a share. Through subsequent purchases, five stock splits, and
reinvestment of dividends, the position has grown to 4,228 shares.
My dilemma is what to do with the investment. I do not need the
money. Should I sell some shares and diversify? What do I do with
the capital gains? Selling would be difficult, since I have become
fond of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Sun Lakes, Ariz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I can understand why you hesitate to sell. I calculate that
your base cost for your initial purchase of 40 shares comes out to
$2.23, after adjusting for the five two-for-one stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   Since I can't estimate your overall base cost without knowing
the full sequence of subsequent purchases and reinvestments, I
can't estimate your capital gains exposure, but when you look at a
14-year chart for the stock, the path is dominantly upward, with a
few dips showing fairly quick recoveries. The result, of course, if
that you would face substantial capital gains taxes upon any sale.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a clear idea of your overall portfolio, but from
what you have written it seems likely the HDI position represents a
very substantial percentage. If that's the case, it seems to me a
good idea to diversify. One thing you may be able to do is isolate
some purchases that have not seen terrific growth levels.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you bought shares in early 1999, you might have
a few purchases that were made in the low $30s. As this is written,
the stock has a $35.69 per share market value, down from a 52-week
high of $46.63 achieved at a spike in the stock in mid-April. If
you were to sell some shares with a fairly high base cost, your tax
burden would not be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important that when you isolate those shares with the
highest base cost, you specify to your broker in writing when you
make your sale order what specific shares you are selling,
identifying them either with a certificate number or the precise
date of purchase. If you do not make such a specification, the IRS
follows the FIFO rule _ the first shares that went into your
portfolio will be deemed the first out, and thus you will be back
to those shares with the $2.23 base cost.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing you can do to diversify is to discontinue your
participation in the dividend reinvestment plan. I know it's not a
lot of money, with the current 0.2 percent yield working out to
only $422 a year, but if you were to sell some of the more
expensive shares and put the proceeds into a broadly diversified
mutual fund, the Harley dividends would provide a steady, if slow,
rate of additions to the diversified account.
</P>
<P>
   As for holding onto a large percentage of the stock, it doesn't
seem too terrible on the surface. Growth prospects for Harley are
strong, with projected earnings of $1.06 per share for this year
comparing nicely to the 86 cents earned in 1999. In the current
market, such a growth rate seems to me to justify its
price-to-earnings ratio of 38.5, compared to a 32.5 PE for the
Standard and Poor's Index.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the key words in that last sentence are ``in the
current market,'' and an old bear such as myself is pretty spooked
by a market with a 32.5 PE for the broad large-cap index. For that
reason, I would get as close as you can without serious tax
consequences to getting the HDI position reduced by about half.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I enclose a list of my 401(k) plan allocations and the
alternatives available. Should I make any changes?
</P>
<P>
   J.G., Quincy, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would suggest a few. Except for the Overseas fund, your
holdings are in large-cap US stocks. I would reduce the positions
in Blue Chip Growth and Magellan by 5 percent each, putting that 10
percent in Fidelity OTC, a fund with a mid-cap growth-oriented
portfolio. The fund typically invests in a fairly risky portfolio _
61 percent in technology stocks, according to the latest
Morningstar Mutual Funds report _ but since your time frame is so
long, you should be willing to face that risk.
</P>
<P>
   The other change I would suggest is with the Fidelity Freedom
2020 holding. The various Freedom funds simply invest in other
Fidelity funds, with the portfolio makeup targeted to the date in
the fund's name. The shorter the target date, the more the fund
moves to conservative, yield-oriented holdings. The longer the
target date, the more aggressive the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Since you anticipate retiring in 2030, it seems Fidelity Freedom
2030 would be a better choice than Freedom 2020. What's the
difference? Not a great deal. Each spreads its assets among 16
Fidelity funds, but Freedom 2020's fixed-income holdings make up 22
percent of the portfolio, while the Freedom 2030 fund has only 15.5
percent on the fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   But the heavier stock position of the 2030 fund can spell a
noticeable difference in results. Last year, Fidelity Freedom 2020
produced a 25.3 percent gain, while Freedom 2030 had a 28.5 percent
total return. Over 30 years, differences such as that will really
add up.

AN OUTSIZED DEBATE OVER THE A3XX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Airbus and Boeing have competitive planes from 100
seats to more than 350 seats, but Boeing is alone in the 400-plus
seat market with the 30-year-old 747.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's monopoly in this jumbo jet market has more than
irritated Airbus executives in Toulouse, France. Consortium
officials say privately that they need to build its A3XX if only to
prevent Boeing from maintaining a vise grip on that market.
</P>
<P>
   Some Airbus officials say that with no competition at the high
end, Boeing can use profits from the 747 to lower the cost on
airplanes where the two companies do compete _ a charge Boeing
officials say is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus and Boeing agree there is a market for such a large plane
_ and Boeing chairman Phil Condit is actively pushing a stretched
version of the 747-400, known as the 747X _ but they disagree on
how large a market there is. Boeing says there is a need for about
365 planes that seat more than 500; Airbus says it is more than
1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is unwilling to spend billions on developing a new
airplane for such a small market. Airbus officials say development
costs of the A3XX will be at least $12 billion, but they think the
cost is worth it. Their planes would sell for more than $200
million each and have a lower operating cost than the 747-400.
</P>
<P>
   Emirates Airlines and Singapore Airlines have said they would
buy the airplane, but Airbus last month indefinitely postponed a
board meeting to possibly decide whether to proceed with the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus officials have said that Cathay Pacific, Virgin Atlantic,
Air France, and FedEx are interested in the plane as well.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, however, believes that the future of air traffic will
involve much more point-to-point traffic with smaller aircraft
seating 200-300 people. They point to the North Atlantic as an
example of what will happen in the Pacific. Indeed, United Airlines
has said that if it merges with US Airways, it will begin nonstop
Asian service from several eastern cities, including Boston. It is
that type of routing, Boeing officials say, that lessens the need
for a 600-seat jet.
</P>
<P>
   The 747 was built in the late 1960s, when the industry was
highly regulated. Airlines were told where they could fly, how
frequently they could fly, and what they could charge. The only way
to increase profit was to increase the number of seats, hence the
need for the 747.
</P>
<P>
   But with deregulation, routes that were unthinkable a short time
ago became commonplace. For example, in 1987 there was one daily
flight from Chicago's O'Hare Airport to Europe. Today, according to
Boeing, there are 21.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and many Boeing officials fear a plane the size of
the A3XX would result in a downturn in the airline industry. They
reason that in order to fill the seats, the airlines would lower
costs, which would reduce yields across the board. As a result,
with lower profits airlines would be less inclined to buy
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, filling the 747 can prove to be a challenge. Boeing has
sold more than 1,200 in the last 30 years. Tower Air, which ranks
19th on the list of airlines with the most 747s, filed for
bankruptcy protection earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 747 is a marvelous airplane, but it is the quickest way to
go broke if you don't fill it up,'' said Joseph W. Ozimek, Boeing's
Commercial Airplane Group director of product marketing, in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus senior vice president John Leahy stopped an interview in
Toulouse to take a private call from FedEx chairman and chief
executive Frederick W. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later, Leahy called the reporter back into his
office and said with a smile, ``It's fair to say the A3XX came up
in that conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said that Airbus ``has 60 percent of the market where we
do compete and once we get the A3XX on line it will become very
obvious _ Airbus will have better than half the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to make sure we are not equal, but I think it will
stabilize and we and Boeing will drift back and forth. It is a
duopoly. Airlines like that and it will be stable.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Leahy think of Boeing's concern that there is not
enough demand for such a large plane to invest billions in research
and development?
</P>
<P>
   ``I genuinely appreciate the fact that they put their little
hostilities toward Airbus behind them and are now trying
desperately to save us from ourselves.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TOULOUSE, France _ It began almost as a patriotic last stand:
European countries banding together to create a consortium to crack
America's complete dominance in commercial aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Airbus Industrie created the world's first
twin-aisle, twin-engine airplane, the A300 Airbus. Since then, the
company has been an innovator in the use of computers to design and
manufacture airplanes. Bankrolled by European governments, Airbus
was the first to introduce fly-by-wire controls _ where electrical
signals convey the control commands from the pilot to wing flaps,
rather than mechanical devices _ saving on maintenance costs and
reducing the weight of airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it seems, the Boeing Co., which rode the 707, 727,
737, and 747 to supremacy in manufacturing commercial jet
airplanes, is in the middle of a 15-round battle to maintain its
crown, and the last few rounds have been going to challenger
Airbus. The European manufacturer landed a punishing blow last
year: For the first time, it took the majority of orders for new
aircraft _ a $50 billion market _ away from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in market share from 19 percent in 1995 to 55 percent
last year reflects a stunning success. And Airbus has grabbed more
than market share; it has captured Boeing's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based aerospace giant is now using computers to
design its planes and fly-by-wire technology. And it is creating
other services (such as pilot training, a rapid high-technology
distribution system for spare parts, and after-market engineering)
and even new airplane models (two new long-range 777s and a
stretched 767).
</P>
<P>
   Because Boeing is so important to the US economy _ it is the
nation's leading exporter _ some sales competitions have been
accompanied by intense diplomatic pressures. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright lobbied Israel to reconsider purchasing Airbus
aircraft for the first time for its national airline, El Al, even
though the country also said it would buy Boeing. Just having some
Airbus aircraft at El Al, which had been all-Boeing, was a symbolic
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The competition has also resulted in ill will as obvious as the
roar of a jet engine. Officials from both companies are often heard
deriding the talent and product of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been battling Airbus for almost as long as they have
been in business, and make no mistake, they are formidable
competition,'' said Larry Dickenson, who began his career with
McDonnell Douglas, came to Boeing in 1986, and was promoted this
year to senior vice president of sales and marketing in Boeing's
commercial airplane group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have come a long way. Are they on a par with Boeing?
No,'' he said, punctuating his answer with a defiant snort.
</P>
<P>
   Some airline executives disagree. Airbus has won several
converts because their airplanes share the same cockpit design,
which reduces training and maintenance costs. Swissair officials
said the ability to have pilots certified to fly both single-aisle
and widebody aircraft will save the airline as much as 20 percent
of its flight-crew costs. Furthermore, Airbus's single-aisle family
of aircraft _ the A318, A319, A320 and A321 _ have a fuselage that
is several inches wider than Boeing's venerable 737 and the 757,
which some analysts say makes the Airbus planes more comfortable
for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue, the well-financed, low-cost start-up operating out of
New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, chose the A320
over Boeing 737 aircraft and has firm orders for 40 of the
airplanes and options for another 43. That decision surprised many,
including JetBlue founder and chief executive David Neeleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an all-Boeing team. . . but when it came down to it,
the A320 was superior,'' Neeleman said in a recent interview. ``Our
business plan was to use 737s, but every airline that we talked to
that was operating the two side-by-side all basically said they
would not consider buying another 737.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus's success last year came predominantly in the
single-aisle market _ 408 of its 476 orders were for the A320
family. Of Boeing's 391 orders, 95 were wide-bodies, which are more
expensive. The company sold 35 747-400s, 37 767s, and 23 777s.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other airlines, such as Midway and Aloha, that
chose the 737 over the A320. And Delta flies only Boeing airplanes
and the new 737s will compete head-on with the A320s on the
Boston-New York-Washington shuttle this year.
</P>
<P>
   With its recent success in the single-aisle market, Airbus seems
poised to risk at least $12 billion _ much of it coming from
European governments _ to build the A3XX, a superjumbo with 550 to
650 seats. The A3XX would compete directly with Boeing's last
stronghold, the 747, which is the only plane with more than 400
seats. While Boeing insists there is only a small market for such
enormous planes, it is spending more than $1 billion to stretch the
747 so it can hold 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Because Airbus is not publicly traded (the company is moving to
become a publicly held corporation), it is impossible to
financially compare the two companies or determine to what extent
government loans to Airbus have gone unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   What is obvious, however, is the ill will between the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Toulouse, the city in southwestern France that is home to
Airbus headquarters, Boeing products are derided as old-fashioned,
outdated and costly; executives of the American company are viewed
as arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   At Boeing headquarters, Airbus airplanes are dismissed as old
(the fuselage design has not changed), uncomfortable, and costly.
Boeing executives view Airbus Industrie as a company propped up by
subsidies and run by executives who try to jam products into a
reluctant market rather than respond to market needs, and who will
raise phony safety issues in an effort to gain market share.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives become almost apoplectic when talking about a
recent Airbus ad for the A340, which has four engines and competes
with the twin-engine 777. Over a photograph of a wind-whipped
menacing sea and an A340 in the upper-right corner, the copy reads:
``If you're over the middle of the Pacific, you want to be in the
middle of four engines.'' And in smaller type, ``It's always
reassuring to have the redundancy option of four engines rather
than two. Especially when you're a long, long, long way from
home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a bogus controversy,'' said Ishanne Mounir, a regional
marketing director for Boeing, who points out that four-engine
aircraft, like the A340 and 747, have a much higher turnback rate
because of engine problems than the twin-engine 777 and the
twin-engine 767.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn said the ad _ which is no
longer running _ was not intended to question safety but rather to
point out the cost efficiency of a four-engine airplane, which does
not have to conform to routing known as ETOPS. Such routes require
two-engine planes to always be within three hours of a suitable
airport.
</P>
<P>
   It is an argument Boeing officials don't buy, because the
curvature of the Earth makes most ETOPS routes similar to
four-engine routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are people in France who believe in the Flat
Earth Society, but I don't know why they would do this unless they
were trying to sell airplanes by fear,'' said Joseph W. Ozimek,
director of product marketing, in a recent interview in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials note that their planes _ even fly-by-wire 777
aircraft _ give pilots more control than Airbus aircraft, which
limit the amount of pitch and roll no matter how hard a pilot turns
or dives an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the differences in the jets are subtle. As a result,
sales campaigns to airlines are carefully planned and orchestrated
with analysts, financial planners, engineers, pilots, and sales
executives contributing to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not like a discretionary income purchase where you walk
in and kick the tires and drive out of the showroom with a new
plane,'' said John Leahy, the hard-charging American who heads
Airbus sales efforts. ``These campaigns take a year, two years. If
I brought something over here from America, it is the team
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing's Dickenson says the support system that comes with
an airplane acquisition is critical. ``At the end of the day, this
is a people business. Buying an airplane is like getting married,
it is a question of whom do you want to deal with for the next 15
to 25 years?''

&HT;     60 SECONDS IS ALL IT TAKES TO MAKE OR BREAK A CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's too bad that ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' is a
movie about stealing cars. It would be a great title for a
workplace documentary.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so maybe the film with Nicolas Cage and Angelina
Jolie will do a wee bit better at the box office, but at least the
workplace documentary could have a decent plot and believable
characters. In this short-attention-span world, 60 seconds is all
is takes for career opportunities, and sometimes careers, to
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how that single minute can change your career:
</P>
<P>
   _ Job hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Think of your resume this way: As soon as your prospective boss
picks it up, someone else lights the bottom of the resume on fire.
In a couple of seconds, the boss will notice the flames. Will he
try to smother them, or just toss the whole thing into the trash
and let it burn itself out?
</P>
<P>
   That is why it is so crucial to tailor your resume to the job
you're applying for. What is the single most important reason you
should be hired for that particular job? It ought to be obvious as
soon as someone picks up the resume. It also ought to be obvious
from the first paragraph of your cover letter.
</P>
<P>
   If you're e-mailing a resume in response to an ad, make sure
your resume includes the same buzzwords listed in the ad. In this
case, the flaming resume test may be done by a software program,
which will weed out applicants who don't list the necessary
buzzwords among their qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   The reason networking is so important is that it lets you
survive the flaming resume test. If the potential boss already
respects you, or you come highly recommended, your resume won't be
nearly as important as your job interview.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the first minute is crucial in any interview, but
sometimes candidates never get that far because they flunk the
preinterview. A lot of companies might narrow the field to maybe 15
candidates, then have the prospective boss or an assistant call
them to ask a few questions. Only a handful will end up having a
``real'' job interview.
</P>
<P>
   That is why you already have to have your act together when you
send in that resume. How will you make a good impression if the
employer does call? What happens if you're harried, or your boss is
standing right in front of you when the call comes in? Do you have
private voicemail, or would you be in an awkward situation if your
prospective boss left a message with a co-worker?
</P>
<P>
   What if you get called at home? What kind of message is on your
answering machine? Is your 5-year-old screening your calls? Does
your spouse know that any person calling from XYZ Corp. is not a
telemarketer?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like your answers to some of these questions, you
might be better off having a cell phone and listing that number on
your resume. And unless you're incredibly glib, rehearse a couple
of potential conversations so you are prepared.
</P>
<P>
   _ Communication.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that in every conversation, you have only 60 seconds to
make your point. With busy people, you'll be lucky to get even half
that. Have you learned how to get to the point quickly without
being abrupt?
</P>
<P>
   If you send your boss an e-mail, does she have to wade through
three paragraphs to get to your one-sentence question? Can people
leave you a voicemail message quickly, or do they have to wade
through a two-minute greeting first?
</P>
<P>
   When you're providing e-mail or voicemail messages for people,
make every second count. Is the subject line in your e-mail
helpful, or could it be confused with spam? If you leave a
voicemail message, will the person have to wait three minutes to
hear your phone number?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly some topics deserve more than 60 seconds, like
President Clinton's State of the Union Address. On the other hand,
you can read Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address aloud in
less than two minutes. What exactly do you have to say that is more
important than the Gettysburg Address?
</P>
<P>
   _ Your reputation.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lifetime to build a reputation, but 60 seconds is
more than enough time to destroy one.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that if you are ever tempted to do something unethical.
Or even if you're angry at a customer or a colleague or an employee
_ or a family member. The immediacy of today's world makes it easy
to do something productive in 60 seconds, but it makes it equally
easy to do something destructive.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you're tempted to do something in anger, hold
off for a minute. It just might be the best 60 seconds that you'll
ever spend.

A $1,300 JACKET? DAMN RIGHT!

<P>
   See the movie. Buy his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   During the filming of ``Shaft,'' which grossed more than $21
million over the weekend, Samuel L. Jackson had 65 costume changes.
</P>
<P>
   Although a range of designers contributed to the movie's
wardrobe, Giorgio Armani created the signature sartorial look,
dressing detective Shaft in a black three-quarter-length leather
jacket, a high mock-neck wool sweater, wool pants, and lace-up
leather boots.
</P>
<P>
   Armani's so-called ``Shaft jacket'' has raw-cut edges and
unfinished seams. It is in stock at some Emporio Armani stores for
$1,298. The Boston outlet carries only the women's version of this.
However, a different men's overcoat and leather pants for about
$600 each will be coming soon. Can you dig it?
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, wardrobe reflects the inner changes of the title
character. Shaft is also seen in a longer black leather jacket
designed by Versace (tagged in a Newbury Street store for $1,814),
which is worn over a Gianfranco Ferre gray wool knit turtleneck
subtly striped with black, along with wool gabardine flat-front
pants by Armani and Kenzo boots. This is Shaft's ``classic'' look.
</P>
<P>
   During his underground phase, Shaft's style turns more street
casual, and he wears dark, mysterious colors that befit his mood.
But the look is still high fashion, from the top of his bald pate _
capped in a knit number by Missoni _ right down to his Miu Miu
ridge-soled olive police shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Shaft emerging later in the movie is dressed in
suedes, as if to say the character is softer, more approachable.
</P>
<P>
   An Emporio Armani spokeswoman said skullcaps and mock necks
would be available soon, along with a post-Monica velvet beret
($98), similar to the one Vanessa Williams wears in the flick.

<P>
   If the thought of spending $1,298 on a Shaft jacket is enough to
make you sweat, relax.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new wrinkle in the use of Botox, otherwise used to
diminish lines around the eyes and forehead.
</P>
<P>
   For about $1,000, dermatologists can inject both flanks with the
toxin, produced by the same bacteria that, if ingested in large
amounts, causes bacillism.
</P>
<P>
   The result: No sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It interferes with the transmission of the signal between
certain nerves and certain . . . muscles or sweat glands,'' says
dermatologist Rachel Herschenfeld. ``When the nerves can't send the
signal, the muscle can't contract or the sweat gland won't produce
sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment can also help patients with severely sweaty palms
or foreheads. Those procedures cost less because a smaller amount
of Botox is used.
</P>
<P>
   However, the injections, which last a few months, aren't
recommended for the occasional sufferer and are not covered by
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very useful for people who have a problem,''
Herschenfeld said. ``It's amazing. It's fabulous.''

   Those cringing at the thought would surely rule out liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do when looking jiggly in that clingy sundress is
not an option and pantyhose simply cannot be worn with sandals?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of cutting the feet off your nylons, and having them
roll up to your knees, buy footless stockings, which have become
popular with the open-toe shoe trend. They often come in two
lengths: Midthigh and just-below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   When the summer is over, switch to fishnets, the leg covering a
la mode, especially in nude colors.
</P>
<P>
   Italian women _ even the most business-minded and matronly among
them _ have been loyal to fishnets for the better part of a decade
because they offer just enough covering with texture.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion, which has finally migrated to this country, is
being pushed as a serious alternative hosiery, not as a vampy
nightclub accessory. Although that works, too.

   Erwin Pearl on Newbury Street has a new line of hand-painted
French enamel dog _ and cat _ pins. Prices range from $75 to $100.
Breeds range from pugs to Labradors. They also sell stands to
display the pins as works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Five percent of the retail price goes toward the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. &QL;

<P>
   In his decades-long affair with maps, Ed McNierney has scoured
library book sales for yellowed charts, covered walls with maps,
and even surveyed the hiking trails near his Groton home.
</P>
<P>
   But when the 40-year-old software developer brought thousands of
the most detailed maps to the Web, he stumbled on a solution to the
woes of outdoor enthusiasts and others who follow the nation's
charted territory.
</P>
<P>
   McNierney's brainchild, Topozone.com of North Chelmsford, Mass.,
has managed to stitch together seamlessly 58,938 oddly sized and
mismatched topographic maps produced by the US Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Widely used by hikers, surveyors, and geologists, the federal
agency's maps provide crucial information on elevations,
positioning, and landmarks such as old schoolhouses and cemeteries.
But here's the catch: As users jump from map to map, they quickly
discover that the edges often don't line up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bought all of the USGS maps, laid them out on a
football field and tried to tape them together _ they wouldn't
fit,'' said McNierney, executive vice president of Maps a la carte
Inc., which owns Topozone.com. ``They're curved at the edges. Some
come in squares. Some come in rectangles. Some come in different
scales.''
</P>
<P>
   The tiny firm's technology has attracted the attention of
Mapquest.com Inc., a top online mapping site that has become a
favorite of Road Warriors. Mapquest.com gives visitors free access
to street maps and offers specific directions, including the
``fastest'' and ``shortest'' routes between two points. With
Topozone.com's technology, the big mapper also will be able to lead
people into the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies, including map giant DeLorme Publishing Co.,
offer topographic maps on CD-ROMs that cost up to $100. But
Topozone.com may be the leader in its niche, according to several
US Geological Survey and industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Topozone.com isn't the only site that offers
topographic maps, the quality of its maps and site search tools
appear to be more advanced, they said. At Topozone.com, users can
search for maps by longitude and latitude or by plugging in the
specific names of towns, cemeteries, mountains, or even geysers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find anything else quite like it,'' said David
Terrell, marketing manager for the US Geological Survey data center
in Sioux Falls, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Maps a la carte likely will find a formidable
rival in Maptech Inc., which has included topographic maps on its
site. But Maptech's online strengths tend to the nautical area, so
it may be a better bet for boaters than hikers, said Matt
Rosenberg, a geographer who writes for About.com.
</P>
<P>
   McNierney and his chief executive, Bill Everett, are former
executives at Eastman Kodak Co.'s software subsidiary in Billerica,
Mass. McNierney left in 1998, and followed by Everett a year later.
</P>
<P>
   As late as last September, the two executives weren't sure
whether their love of maps and McNierney's ``noodling'' on the
computer would translate into a viable business. ``It wasn't until
we got it working that we convinced ourselves,'' McNierney said.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Topozone.com site opened last November, it has
drawn hundreds of thousands of visitors, including a few who have
surprised the executives. The odd mix has included cemetery
associations as well as hobbyists searching for old railroad tracks
and radio towers.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogists seeking links to their ancestors also have raced to
the site. Don Hickman, a retired computer programmer who lives in
Des Moines, said he managed to find his great-great grandfather's
cemetery while perusing Topozone.com. ``I was just surfing the map
around where they lived . . . and there it was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Topozone.com's technology also has been embraced by recreational
sites such as Trails.com and Alloutdoors.com. They either have
incorporated Topozone.com's tools or provided links to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Even the experts at the US Geological Survey, which never
managed to make its maps customer-friendly, are tickled. The
agency's employees were among the first to rush to the Web site _
to see their own maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they want to do is fine by us,'' said Terrell, of the
US Geological Survey. ``If the opportunities make some people rich,
that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened to McNierney and Everett. So far, the
business has managed to bring only $50,000 in revenue, mainly from
advertising and licensing fees. But the executives hope to grow the
company much faster now that they have $500,000 in seed funding and
another $1 million investment from Navitrak International Corp., a
Canadian mapping company.
</P>
<P>
   Executives say they do not plan on charging consumers to print
out screen maps displayed on the Topozone.com site. Instead, they
plan to make money by charging consumers for software that can be
used to access better quality maps from the site (without the
annoying banner advertisements that show up on the screen
printouts).
</P>
<P>
   Everett believes Topozone's business model gives customers the
ability to access the most recent maps available, without having to
pay for updates, as they do with maps on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our model is completely different,'' Everett said. ``We give
away the data and sell you the software.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two executives seem gleeful about their prospects,
they can't help looking over their shoulders. They may have caught
giants Maptech and DeLorme by surprise, but they wonder who's
mapping the next technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably worry more about the next two guys working out of
their garage,'' said McNierney.

PARTIES DIVIDE WHEN POLITICS, MARKETS MEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We usually write about markets and leave the subject of politics
to our colleagues in other parts of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   But we've been struck this year by how frequently markets and
politics are colliding. On a wide range of issues _ Social
Security, Medicare, the budget surplus, Microsoft _ the central
question is: How much faith do you have in markets and how much
faith do you have in the government?
</P>
<P>
   On all these issues and even a few others, Al Gore and the
Democrats find themselves in a different place along the spectrum
than George W. Bush and the Republicans. ``The Democrats generally
believe a little more government is better, and the Republicans
generally prefer to leave a little more to the market,'' said Mark
Zandi, chief economist at RFA Dismal Sciences, Pennsylvania
forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the two parties is not as large it once was. A
decade of prosperity and a booming stock market have pushed the
Democrats to embrace free-market capitalism in a way they never
would have in the past. Last week 65 Democrats in the House of
Representatives even voted to abolish the federal estate tax, an
act of heresy that must have had Tip O'Neill rolling over in his
grave.
</P>
<P>
   But if the gap between the parties is smaller, it is still
critical. ``To me the differences come through loud and clear,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics in
Waltham. ``The question is: what role or how big a role will the
federal government play in our lives and in our economy?''
</P>
<P>
   Take Social Security. Bush has proposed letting individuals
invest a portion of their Social Security contribution in stocks or
bonds. Gore wants to leave the program alone, arguing that Social
Security recepients should not be subject to the vagaries of the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is hedging his bets. This week he unveiled a
supplemental retirement plan that would let Americans _ you guessed
it _ invest a portion of their savings in the stock market. Bush
promptly accused Gore of being a copycat and hypocrite. ``It raises
a question of what Al Gore believes in,'' said a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the end the two plans are different. Bush is willing to
trust the market to improve Social Security. Gore wants Social
Security to remain a government guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   On Medicare, both parties are in favor of adding a drug benefit
to the health insurance plan for seniors. The Republicans, as the
New York Times put it, ``want more choices and options for
beneficiaries, a larger role for private insurance companies, and a
smaller role and lower costs for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats fear that too great a reliance on the market will
leave seniors at the mercy of insurance companies that only want to
cover the healthy. The Republicans fear that too great a reliance
on government will lead to price controls on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to use the surplus to pay down debt, beef up Social
Security and Medicare and provide a modest tax cut. Bush wants a
bigger tax cut on the theory that surplus money left in Washington
will wind up being spent on bigger government.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has yet to surface as a campaign issue but it could.
``The Microsoft case represents a watershed event in antitrust
policy,'' said Mark Zandi. By pursuing the breakup of a company
because it stifles innovation, rather than because it pushes up
prices, the Clinton administration has taken antitrust to a new and
more aggressive level, according to Zandi.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hasn't said much about the case, but it is not too hard to
imagine him suggesting that he'd prefer to let the market rather
than government decide Microsoft's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline is another issue with the potential to pop up on the
campaign trail. Nationally gas prices are over $1.60 a gallon; in
some places in the Midwest they are over $2 a gallon. Energy
specialists blame some of the price hikes in the Midwest on new
federal environmental regulations that have created tight supplies
in certain markets.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too much of a stretch to picture Bush blaming the problem
on the ``big government solutions'' of the Clinton-Gore
administration?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes government regulation,'' conceded Robert Reich, a
former member of the Clinton administration, now a professor at
Brandeis. But Reich says there is still a constituency for
government programs ``that don't leave people vulnerable to the
random ups and downs of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Will that kind of philosophy prevail in November? Or are voters
ready to put their trust in the markets and George W. Bush? Stay
tuned.

`CHICKEN RUN' CREATORS HAVE ANIMATED TIME JUST FOWLING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Growing up in Great Britain in the '70s, Peter Lord
and Nick Park didn't have to look far for comic inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we are the Monty Python kids,'' says Park, who joined
Lord to co-direct the upcoming claymation comedy ``Chicken Run,''
which is voiced by Mel Gibson and could be this summer's `Toy
Story.`
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Lord imitated the work of Python trouper Terry
Gilliam, who assembled the bizarre artwork on the group's zany
television show. Lord eventually became a cell animator, which he
found slow, painful and ``not very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he discovered the joys of claymation, ultimately
creating a British version of Gumby called Morph. That impressed
his future partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always secretly dreamt of creating characters that would
become household names,'' Park says. ``When I first met Pete, he
had a badge on his lapel off his TV character Morph...I just
thought, `How cool is that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, the two teamed up to produce ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit,''
an Oscar-winning series of stop-action animated shorts known for
fluid action sequences and dry wit.
</P>
<P>
   That same British humor permeates ``Chicken Run,'' a
feature-length claymation film that remakes ``The Great Escape,''
casting chickens as the prisoners. In the film, which opens Friday,
the birds must break out of an egg farm before they're turned into
pot pies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a British sensibility,'' Park says, ``playing on
the minimal and the deadpan and the mundane.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lord and Park are top animators, ``Chicken Run''
presented some unique challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the fat, round bodies that prevent chickens from flying
_ a major point of the story _ also makes them difficult to
re-create as puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy clay bodies wouldn't stand up for long on spindly chicken
legs, so the animators came up with a compromise. The chickens'
heads and the wings were made of a claylike substance called
Plasticine, but the bodies were actually latex stretched over
silicone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have some kind of skeletal structure inside the
chicken as well, to keep up their weight,'' Park says. ``So you
have this kind of ``RoboCop`-style armature ... the animator has to
grab hold of the puppet and force it or tweak it.''
</P>
<P>
   Every chicken was created in two scales. About 300 larger ``A
scale'' models were used when the chickens were interacting with
each other, while 130 smaller, ``B scale'' models were employed
when they were dealing with Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy, the humans who run
the chicken farm.
</P>
<P>
   The puppets were produced using a special brand of Plasticine,
concocted by Aardman, a model animation studio co-founded by Lord
and David Sproxton in 1972. The color of each bird was selected and
blended in a converted chewing-gum machine in the studio. The
molded feathers were hand-painted in a painstaking process that
took up to a day for each chicken.
</P>
<P>
   The scarves and necklaces worn by the chickens serve a dual
purpose: giving each bird an individual personality and hiding the
seams of their detachable heads. Filmmakers also created about 60
interchangeable beaks, which were used to express different vowels
or consonants and allowed the chickens to look like they are
actually speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The attention to detail is incredible: The knitting carried by
one chicken was created with cocktail toothpicks and thread, while
Mrs. Tweedy's cardigan was knitted by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive is the Aardman style of animation, which
requires repositioning the chickens up to 24 times per second of
film. Even when 28 sets were operating simultaneously, the goal was
to produce about 10 seconds of film per day.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the fluid motion that has made Aardman famous,
animators used both video and digital cameras, constantly checking
for continuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was up to Nick and me, the whole film would have been a
horrendous tangle,'' Lord says. ``We employed dozens of people to
sort it all out. Each of us had a continuity person at our shoulder
always saying to us, `You can't put that chicken there.'''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the technique is showcased in a dance sequence _
dubbed ``Flip, Flop and Fly'' by the filmmakers _ that has multiple
characters moving at different speeds on different levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We relied on the fantastic energy of our animators,'' Lord
says, noting that he asked them to do things that he would have
never done as an animator.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock running down on the movie, Park adds, they
decided to do close-ups, which they thought might be easier to
animate. But the economical move didn't pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even on close-ups, there were always at least sort of 12
chickens in the background that all had to be expressing themselves
and moving in some way or another,'' Park says.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the filmmakers feel like they produced something
that crosses boundaries between realism and cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're operating in a twilight world,'' Park says. ``You've got
the gritty reality of live action ... but we can be cartoony
because it's clay. It's a strangely real but magical kind of
illusion.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internet commerce, that sexy new concept
revolutionizing consumerism in the 21st century, is causing a
decidedly Old World problem in San Francisco: more traffic
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of increasing Internet commerce is that most
products bought on line need to be delivered by the likes of UPS,
FedEx, Webvan or any number of courier services. But in San
Francisco, where the streets are narrow and crowded with cars, the
appearance of more delivery trucks _ often double-parked _ is
causing traffic snarls that are sure to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   It has made an already congested city even more gridlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing the trucks that double-park,'' said Ashley Ryles,
38, who commutes to the city from Danville. ``When you come down
Fifth or Fremont (streets), the whole right lane can be taken with
delivery trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivery companies defend their work, saying they are helping
traffic, not hindering it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking people off the road who would be going to the
grocery store,'' said Amy Nobile, a spokeswoman for Webvan, a
door-to-door grocery deliver service. ``It can be seen as a
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the drivers, although sometimes double-parked, are
usually very quick and do not spend unnecessary time while parking.
Nobile said that if consumers weren't using Webvan, many of them
would be on the streets, double-parking while doing errands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they'd be double-parking all of Saturday if it
weren't for Webvan,'' Nobile said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all drivers buy her logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't consider them taking more traffic off the street,''
said Pete Haffner, 22, of Glen Park. ``Those trucks take up more
room than cars, and people usually find a parking spot during a
grocery run.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, San Francisco, the city with the second-highest
density in the nation, always has had to deal with delivery trucks
that double-park. The city has a shortage of curb-side parking, and
more commuters keep driving to work as part of a technology-fueled
hiring boom.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers say the situation has gotten worse in the
past couple years because of increased e-commerce deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers seem to suggest they are right. According to
Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based technology
research company, $20.2 billion was spent over the Internet last
year, and $38.7 billion is expected to change hands on the Web this
year. By 2004, $184.5 billion is expected to be spent on line,
according to Forrester.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a small percentage of the products that can be
downloaded onto a computer, the bulk needs to be delivered, said
Chris Kelley, an analyst with Forrester.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more experienced consumers get with purchasing on line,
the more they will purchase, and the larger their purchases will
be,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said that if the crush of delivery trucks became too much
for some urban areas, delivery companies might opt to extend their
hours or might consider having customers pick up their products at
a depot for a reduced price.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see more creative ways to get products to the
consumer,'' Kelley said. ``But you'll see some increased traffic
along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hamdun, San Francisco's acting director of parking and
traffic, agreed the rise in on-line retail has made traffic worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person's convenience is another person's inconvenience,''
Hamdun said. ``With the expansion of e-commerce, it just makes it
that much more important for our department to come up with
solutions for double-parking.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his department, which tickets double-parked delivery
trucks, was looking at other measures to ease the flow of traffic.
In July, the department will begin doubling fines for
double-parking on 15 key transit lines. Within 60 days, parking
officials also will be testing extended truck loading zones that
will accommodate larger trucks that can't fit into existing loading
zones.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the road, the department is considering plans to
restrict downtown deliveries, either during certain hours or on
specific thoroughfares. Such a program, which would involve the
cooperation of businesses and the delivery companies, would not get
under way for some time, Hamdun said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department recognizes that the streets have been a little
more congested lately, and we're trying to do something about it,''
he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Currently, UPS is the biggest deliverer of Internet goods with a
commanding 55 percent share of the market. The U.S. Postal Service
follows with 32 percent, and FedEx is third with 10 percent of
e-commerce deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   UPS spokeswoman Angela McMahon said the company delivers about
13 million packages per day, 1.5 million more than two years ago.
She said much of that increase has come from Internet purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generally understood that UPS has benefited from the
growth in e-commerce,'' McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   She said there was not much the company could do about traffic
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a delivery company, we just deliver packages,'' McMahon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some commuters still blame delivery truck drivers for not
trying harder to lessen the congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there's a parking space two or three spots down,
(delivery truck drivers) won't park there,'' said Smita Gupta, 33,
a Palo Alto architect who works in San Francisco. ``They just stop
right in front and double-park.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, however, said UPS did not encourage double-parking by
its drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In finding places to park, UPS's policy is to avoid
double-parking whenever possible, and in some cases we have
adjusted delivery schedules when loading zones were more
available,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the crunch on the street is likely to get worse as
more people flock to on-line buying. That is, unless technology can
produce a solution, said 48-year-old Dave Byers of Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to be able to download groceries by modem,'' he
said, ``and then we're all set.''

   HARARE _ In an election in which Hitler and Stalin are fighting
on the same side, it is no wonder that Zimbabwe's 5.5 million
voters _ who go to the polls this weekend _ are a little confused.
</P>
<P>
   Uniquely in the history of elections, Zimbabweans will have the
choice between candidates whose names have been borrowed from a
panoply of world figures. President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF), in power for 20
years and determined to stay there, has amassed all the baddies.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them is Chenjerai Hitler Hunzvi, a parliamentary
candidate and leader of the war veterans who have occupied more
than 1,000 commercial farms in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International claims the Polish-trained medical doctor
has a torture chamber at his practice in a Harare hospital. Dr.
Hunzvi, who insists his middle name should not be used in inverted
commas because he received it at birth, has a deputy called Agripa
Gaba.
</P>
<P>
   Also among Zanu-PF's candidates is the boxer-turned-promoter
Stalin Mau Mau _ a combination that draws both on Soviet and Kenyan
terror.
</P>
<P>
   And there is not just punch in Mau Mau's name; the corpulent
candidate is a former commonwealth flyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Zanu-PF's war veterans at one point used a spokesman
called Peace, both the ruling party and their warriors seem more
comfortable with scary names.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, President Mugabe likes to remind us that during the
struggle against white rule, the former Rhodesian leader, Ian
Smith, referred to him as the ``Black Hitler'' or ``Stalin.''
</P>
<P>
   As if fate had played a hand, the most fearsome name the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change has to offer is that of
its economic spokesman, Eddie Cross _ an affable man.
</P>
<P>
   Among the spokesmen for the MDC's leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, are
Silent Dube, Learnmore Jongwe and Moses Nyarota.
</P>
<P>
   His political adviser recently emerged from the shadows of
humility and his name is

   HARARE _ In an election in which Hitler and Stalin are fighting
on the same side, it is no wonder that Zimbabwe's 5.5 million
voters _ who go to the polls this weekend _ are a little confused.
</P>
<P>
   Uniquely in the history of elections, Zimbabweans will have the
choice between candidates whose names have been borrowed from a
panoply of world figures. President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF), in power for 20
years and determined to stay there, has amassed all the baddies.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them is Chenjerai Hitler Hunzvi, a parliamentary
candidate and leader of the war veterans who have occupied more
than 1,000 commercial farms in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International claims the Polish-trained medical doctor
has a torture chamber at his practice in a Harare hospital. Dr.
Hunzvi, who insists his middle name should not be used in inverted
commas because he received it at birth, has a deputy called Agripa
Gaba.
</P>
<P>
   Also among Zanu-PF's candidates is the boxer-turned-promoter
Stalin Mau Mau _ a combination that draws both on Soviet and Kenyan
terror.
</P>
<P>
   And there is not just punch in Mau Mau's name; the corpulent
candidate is a former commonwealth flyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Zanu-PF's war veterans at one point used a spokesman
called Peace, both the ruling party and their warriors seem more
comfortable with scary names.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, President Mugabe likes to remind us that during the
struggle against white rule, the former Rhodesian leader, Ian
Smith, referred to him as the ``Black Hitler'' or ``Stalin.''
</P>
<P>
   As if fate had played a hand, the most fearsome name the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change has to offer is that of
its economic spokesman, Eddie Cross _ an affable man.
</P>
<P>
   Among the spokesmen for the MDC's leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, are
Silent Dube, Learnmore Jongwe and Moses Nyarota.
</P>
<P>
   His political adviser recently emerged from the shadows of
humility and his name is

<P>
   The fate of Slobodan Milosevic remains a conundrum for all, not
least for the Yugoslav president himself. He has successfully clung
to power for more than a decade _ despite repeated predictions of
his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is so chaotically divided that Milosevic's hold
on power is shaken but scarcely stirred.
</P>
<P>
   The West, eager to find an incentive for Milosevic to give up
the reins, now seems ready to cut a deal whereby the Serb leader
would find asylum outside Yugoslavia _ in Russia, say, or Greece.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of precedents for such a comfortable
retirement. From Idi Amin, in Uganda, to the Haitian dictator Baby
Doc Duvalier, the tradition has long been that a departing dictator
finds luxury elsewhere _ in Baby Doc's case, in the south of
France.
</P>
<P>
   Another argument in favor of allowing Milosevic an easy way out
is that he could get especially nasty if he knew his back was
firmly against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic believes that any future democratic government in
Belgrade would deliver him up to the war crimes tribunal at The
Hague, there can be no advantage for him in a handover of power.
Instead, he might turn his gun on himself (both his parents
committed suicide).
</P>
<P>
   Or _ an outcome that many Serbs now expect _ he might stoke one
final apocalypse before going down in a Ceausescu-style hail of
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted assassination this week of Vuk Draskovic, Serbia's
main opposition leader, serves as a reminder that political
violence is never far away.
</P>
<P>
   The discreet offer of a safe haven seems attractive _ and more
defensible than the French luxury that was enjoyed by Duvalier. It
would offer Milosevic an incentive to give up power peacefully, a
considerable prize.
</P>
<P>
   Such an outcome would, however, create a raft of new problems.
It would create new bitterness in Serbia, where the current
animosity toward the West for its harsh treatment of Serbia could
give way to even greater bitterness if, when Milosevic goes, the
West turns soft on the chief author of Serbia's misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, too, such a deal would undermine the principle that
has been established in recent years _ that, following the
establishment of the International Criminal Court, dictators can
expect no mercy when they are brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge must be a disincentive to future dictators. To
break the principle for Milosevic's sake would make a mockery of
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Milosevic to justice will be enormously difficult.
Permitting a peaceful retirement would be easy _ but wrong. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Gang members involved in human trafficking forced
some of the victims of the Dover truck tragedy to march towards
Britain at gunpoint, according to the cousin of one of the 58 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Chen, 20, who believes his 19-year-old cousin, Chen Lin,
was among those found dead by customs officers in a tomato truck in
the early hours of Monday, said the victims were charged
$22,000-$25,000 and promised a flight into the U.K.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were herded like cattle during a four-month trek
from their homes in the Fujian province of southern China through
Beijing, Moscow, the Czech Republic, and then on to the
Netherlands, where they boarded the truck.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch police arrested a man in Rotterdam Tuesday as British
police revealed that all those who died were aged between about 20
and 30 and had suffered respiratory failure.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said that his cousin had been allowed to make telephone
calls throughout the journey and had last called from Zeebrugge,
saying he was coming over to England on Sunday night. He said his
cousin's family are sure he is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are quite sure he was on that lorry because they have not
heard anything from him since Holland.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his cousin had left the city of Jiangle, in Fujian
province in February because he was being persecuted as a Roman
Catholic. ``His mother is devastated,'' he said. ``She was in tears
on the phone. Both the father and the mother were crying as we
talked about what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his cousin's family had had to borrow from relatives and
moneylenders to raise the fee. It would take them five years to pay
off the debt, despite losing their son.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said his cousin had reported that the traffickers had guns
and used the threat of force to make the refugees undertake the
arduous journey.
</P>
<P>
   They had been told they would be flying to the U.K. but, once
they began the overland journey, they found they had no choice but
to press on.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin and a friend, also 19, had reached Holland in a small
group and then been pooled with others to make up the 60 who were
then to climb into the truck bound for Dover.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said of his cousin: ``He was an ordinary boy with hopes for
the future.'' &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It evoked images of the cattle trucks in which so
many Jews died while being transported to concentration camps
during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty people, 56 men and four women, crammed into the back of a
truck, clawing at the walls, fighting for air. And when the doors
were finally opened at Dover's Eastern Docks in the darkness of
Monday morning, all but two were dead.
</P>
<P>
   As Jack Straw, Britain's home secretary, vowed to stamp out the
``evil'' trade in people-smuggling, the full horror of the victims'
journey from Zeebrugge on Sunday began to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Details emerged from hospital sources of a brief conversation
the survivors, both men, had had with an interpreter. Under police
guard at an undisclosed Kent hospital and still traumatized by
their ordeal, they described the moments of panic as their air
began to run out.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital source said: ``They were all clawing at the inside
of the back door. They said it was very dark inside the trailer so
they were tripping over dead bodies as they tried to make their way
to the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they banged on the doors and shouted at the top of
their voices, but eventually they had to give up through weakness.
They had no idea how many of the people with them had died until
they got to the hospital this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the survivors and the Dutch driver of the vehicle know how
long they had been packed into the tiny space on one of the hottest
days of the year. It is likely the survivors would also have died
had it not been for the driver's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Although the driver was under arrest Monday night, it is
understood detectives are not automatically assuming he knew what,
besides tomatoes, he was carrying. ``It could have been loaded
before he arrived to pick it up,'' said one officer. ``We simply
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   As post-mortem examinations began, it was reported that the
driver had paid for his passage from Zeebrugge aboard the P&AMP;O
European Pathway in cash. Most companies have billing accounts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It is understood that at the P&AMP;O Stena Line office in Zeebrugge
the driver gave the owner's name as Van Der Spek Transporten at an
address in Terbregtseweg, Rotterdam but could not provide some of
the details of the truck. He said the company would provide them
later.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;O Stena Line said it had not dealt with a company by that name
before and had no company account. These combined factors are
thought to have been enough to arouse the suspicions of Customs at
Dover.
</P>
<P>
   The driver took the 7:30 p.m. sailing from Zeebrugge, arriving
in Dover around midnight. Customs and Excise officers say the truck
passed through immigration but was stopped by a team of four
officers because it fitted ``a certain profile.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   An average of 4,000 trucks pass through the port of Dover each
day and only 4 percent are stopped by Customs. Although they
refused to discuss the specific profiling criteria used to check
suspected vehicles it is thought the method of payment rang the
most alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-meter (60-foot) Dutch-registered Mercedes truck, bearing
the name Van Der Spek on the side, was diverted into customs
inspection bay nine. The back doors were sealed and airtight but
inspectors opened them to conduct a search.
</P>
<P>
   What they found has left them in shock. Nigel Knott, a Customs
spokesman, said: ``It was a refrigerated lorry but the
refrigeration was not in operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were pallets of tomatoes inside. At first two of the
officers went inside, then they were joined by the other two.
Nothing could have prepared them for what they found.''
</P>
<P>
   They discovered piles of bodies hidden among the cargo. And then
began the grim task of checking for survivors. The customs officers
called for ambulances but vital signs were found in only two men.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital source said: ``One of the men said it was like an
angel had been sent from heaven when the back door of the lorry
trailer was finally opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they were brought here they were both extremely
dehydrated and very weak. We managed to patch them up pretty
quickly by giving them lots of fluids but I think the psychological
torment will stay with them for the rest of their lives.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The customs officers who made the find were told to stay off
work Monday and have been offered counselling. An international
search is under way to try to identify the victims, their country
of origin and the people behind their deaths. The police would say
only that they were Oriental, although it is understood that a
Chinese interpreter has been used.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the number of people involved, police believe a big
organized operation may be behind the trafficking operation. In
some cases, criminal gangs are known to charge foreigners up to
$48,000 to get them into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pugash, a Kent police spokesman said: ``Movements of such
numbers of people don't happen by accident so we have to assume an
organized criminal element is involved. We have had incidents
before where lorries have been stopped carrying more than 10
illegal immigrants, but they survived, there has never been
anything on this scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the survivors, who were later moved to an
undisclosed police station, were under armed guard, he replied:
``We are taking all the precautions you would expect us to, their
physical injuries are not bad, but they have been through a very
traumatic time so we are taking medical advice on when we can talk
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Forensic science specialists were examining the truck and the
freight area and appeared to take away a number of the pallets
behind which the human cargo was hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Two pathologists were conducting the examinations but results on
all 58 victims are likely to take a few days to complete. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In Dover itself sadness over the deaths was in short supply.
Many people feel besieged by the influx of illegal immigrants and
asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   One driver, who asked not to be named, said: ``Good riddance.
It's 58 less for us to support. We're sick of it round here. My
poll tax has gone up by (pounds sterling)3 ($5.00) a month to
support these people.''

   RACE-PLANTATION (NATCHITOCHES, La.) _ At the south edge of the

rows of live oaks, the cabins had been forgotten by many and
ignored by most. There was almost nothing left _ except the stories
of the slaves who once lived in them. By Ginger Thompson. (6500

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It evoked images of the cattle trucks in which so
many Jews died while being transported to concentration camps
during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty people, 56 men and four women, crammed into the back of a
truck, clawing at the walls, fighting for air. And when the doors
were finally opened at Dover's Eastern Docks in the darkness of
Monday morning, all but two were dead.
</P>
<P>
   As Jack Straw, Britain's home secretary, vowed to stamp out the
``evil'' trade in people-smuggling, the full horror of the victims'
journey from Zeebrugge on Sunday began to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Details emerged from hospital sources of a brief conversation
the survivors, both men, had had with an interpreter. Under police
guard at an undisclosed Kent hospital and still traumatized by
their ordeal, they described the moments of panic as their air
began to run out.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital source said: ``They were all clawing at the inside
of the back door. They said it was very dark inside the trailer so
they were tripping over dead bodies as they tried to make their way
to the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they banged on the doors and shouted at the top of
their voices, but eventually they had to give up through weakness.
They had no idea how many of the people with them had died until
they got to the hospital this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the survivors and the Dutch driver of the vehicle know how
long they had been packed into the tiny space on one of the hottest
days of the year. It is likely the survivors would also have died
had it not been for the driver's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Although the driver was under arrest Monday night, it is
understood detectives are not automatically assuming he knew what,
besides tomatoes, he was carrying. ``It could have been loaded
before he arrived to pick it up,'' said one officer. ``We simply
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   As post-mortem examinations began, it was reported that the
driver had paid for his passage from Zeebrugge aboard the P&AMP;O
European Pathway in cash. Most companies have billing accounts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It is understood that at the P&AMP;O Stena Line office in Zeebrugge
the driver gave the owner's name as Van Der Spek Transporten at an
address in Terbregtseweg, Rotterdam but could not provide some of
the details of the truck. He said the company would provide them
later.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;O Stena Line said it had not dealt with a company by that name
before and had no company account. These combined factors are
thought to have been enough to arouse the suspicions of Customs at
Dover.
</P>
<P>
   The driver took the 7:30 p.m. sailing from Zeebrugge, arriving
in Dover around midnight. Customs and Excise officers say the truck
passed through immigration but was stopped by a team of four
officers because it fitted ``a certain profile.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   An average of 4,000 trucks pass through the port of Dover each
day and only 4 percent are stopped by Customs. Although they
refused to discuss the specific profiling criteria used to check
suspected vehicles it is thought the method of payment rang the
most alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-meter (60-foot) Dutch-registered Mercedes truck, bearing
the name Van Der Spek on the side, was diverted into customs
inspection bay nine. The back doors were sealed and airtight but
inspectors opened them to conduct a search.
</P>
<P>
   What they found has left them in shock. Nigel Knott, a Customs
spokesman, said: ``It was a refrigerated lorry but the
refrigeration was not in operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were pallets of tomatoes inside. At first two of the
officers went inside, then they were joined by the other two.
Nothing could have prepared them for what they found.''
</P>
<P>
   They discovered piles of bodies hidden among the cargo. And then
began the grim task of checking for survivors. The customs officers
called for ambulances but vital signs were found in only two men.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital source said: ``One of the men said it was like an
angel had been sent from heaven when the back door of the lorry
trailer was finally opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they were brought here they were both extremely
dehydrated and very weak. We managed to patch them up pretty
quickly by giving them lots of fluids but I think the psychological
torment will stay with them for the rest of their lives.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The customs officers who made the find were told to stay off
work Monday and have been offered counselling. An international
search is under way to try to identify the victims, their country
of origin and the people behind their deaths. The police would say
only that they were Oriental, although it is understood that a
Chinese interpreter has been used.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the number of people involved, police believe a big
organized operation may be behind the trafficking operation. In
some cases, criminal gangs are known to charge foreigners up to
$48,000 to get them into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pugash, a Kent police spokesman said: ``Movements of such
numbers of people don't happen by accident so we have to assume an
organized criminal element is involved. We have had incidents
before where lorries have been stopped carrying more than 10
illegal immigrants, but they survived, there has never been
anything on this scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the survivors, who were later moved to an
undisclosed police station, were under armed guard, he replied:
``We are taking all the precautions you would expect us to, their
physical injuries are not bad, but they have been through a very
traumatic time so we are taking medical advice on when we can talk
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Forensic science specialists were examining the truck and the
freight area and appeared to take away a number of the pallets
behind which the human cargo was hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Two pathologists were conducting the examinations but results on
all 58 victims are likely to take a few days to complete. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In Dover itself sadness over the deaths was in short supply.
Many people feel besieged by the influx of illegal immigrants and
asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   One driver, who asked not to be named, said: ``Good riddance.
It's 58 less for us to support. We're sick of it round here. My
poll tax has gone up by (pounds sterling)3 ($5.00) a month to
support these people.''

&HT;     JUDGE AWARDS $5.25M TO IN RACE, AGE BIAS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An Electrolux Corp. manager, demoted by a boss
who called him a ``dumb . . . Indian'' and told him he was too old,
has been awarded $5.25 million for race and age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Orrick said the vacuum cleaner
company shrugged off the complaint by William L. McAlvain, manager
of its Santa Rosa branch, as well as allegations of discrimination
from many other employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electrolux's near-complete failure to investigate
discrimination complaints in general is appalling,'' Orrick wrote
in a ruling filed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McAlvain, an American Indian, was 53 when he was hired as a
manager trainee in 1989. He was soon promoted to manager of a
series of branches selling Electrolux products and compiled a
respectable record, generally equaling or exceeding sales of other
managers at those branches, Orrick said.
</P>
<P>
   He also received numerous company awards, including a $10,000
award for sales by newly hired employees on his staff in 1994, his
last full year with Electrolux. His branch was 15th highest in such
sales out of about 500 in the nation, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   After he finished relocating a branch office from Redding to
Santa Rosa, however, McAlvain was told by his supervisor in January
1995 that the area vice president, Allen Lawson, wanted him
replaced by a younger man. McAlvain, then 58, called Lawson, who
swore at him, called him a ``dumb ... Indian,'' and told him,
``You're too goddamn old. You can't cut it anymore,'' according to
testimony quoted by Orrick.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson repeated his slurs in several subsequent phone calls,
Orrick said. McAlvain complained to Gary Griffin, the company's
vice president of sales, who told him he didn't care what Lawson
did as long as he was productive. Griffin actually had not even
talked to Lawson, and did not refer McAlvain's complaint to anyone
else in the company, in violation of Electrolux's stated
discrimination policy, Orrick said.
</P>
<P>
   A day or two later, McAlvain found his office locked when he
reported for work. He found another job about three weeks later but
was still suffering from depression and humiliation when the case
went to trial this April, Orrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson was later fired for verbally abusing employees. He and
other Electrolux supervisors said McAlvain was demoted for poor
performance, statements that Orrick described as transparently
false.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the rare case where there is direct evidence of
unlawful discrimination,'' said the judge, who presided over the
non-jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said McAlvain had not shown any financial loss, but was
entitled to $250,000 for emotional distress and $5 million in
punitive damages. That may be enough to get the company's
attention, said McAlvain's lawyer, Karl I. Mullen, who has filed
several discrimination suits on behalf of Electrolux employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem they've had for a long time,'' Mullen said.
``They've done nothing to try to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin L. Keith, lawyer for the Virginia-based company, was away
from his and unavailable for comment.

   LABOR _ AFL-CIO President John Sweeney is planning to hold a
series of town hall meetings around the country to contrast the
records of Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Gore on labor
issues. The publicity tour, designed to gin up support for Gore
among labor voters, comes as Gore confronts a revolt among
Teamsters and United Auto Workers unions over China trade
legislation. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader meets with Teamsters
president James Hoffa Thursday to seek the Teamsters' endorsement.

   MICHIGAN _ Analysts say that Michigan usually leans slightly
toward the Democrats in presidential elections but nobody's sure
what to expect this year. Both Democrats and Republicans are
licking their wounds and trying to mend fences. The UAW _ with more
than 400,000 active and retired members _ would like to shove
Democrat Al Gore, who's supposed to be labor's candidate, right up
the tailpipe of the nearest Chevrolet, Plymouth or Ford. It's hard
to tell which issue has made the UAW more angry _ Gore's support
for granting China normal trade status or his rants against the
internal combustion engine. Republicans, meanwhile, are trying to
get back together after Sen. John McCain creamed Gov. George W.
Bush in the Republican primary. The healing was moving smoothly
until McCain backers claimed they got the shaft when it came to
picking delegates to the Republican National Convention. McCain got
so angry that he said he wouldn't return to the state. For the time
being _ and the dust still is settling _ Bush seems more solid with
his Republican base in western Michigan than Gore is with labor and
African-Americans in Detroit. ``Reagan Democrats'' in the Detroit
suburbs _ who voted for Ronald Reagan and then switched back to
Bill Clinton _ likely will have the last word and they're still
deciding. (Hershey, Dayton Daily News). 60.

   MICHIGANBAR _ This booming, suburban Detroit county is home to
thousands of the ``Reagan Democrats'' who switched parties to put
Ronald Reagan in the White House. Many, but not all, returned to
their roots to help Democrat Bill Clinton win two terms as
president. This year the county also became a hotbed of ``McCain
Republicans,'' the potpouri of voters who gave George W. Bush a
surprise tumble in Michigan's Republican presidential primary. Both
parties are courting these all swing voters. Meanwhile, the county
is awash in scandals of its own. Among other things, the Democratic
sheriff, in office for 24 years, was convicted of rape. We talk
with auto workers, senior citizens, college students, educators and
others from the county. (Hershey, Dayton Daily News). 20.

   CUSTOM-FURNITURE (Undated) _ For anyone unsatisfied by the
styles, quality or general similarity of mass-produced furniture,
or frustrated by the prices of vintage furniture, commissioning a
piece produces furniture specific to your tastes and needs. In some
cases, it is an opportunity to work with an architect or designer
on a project smaller than a house or an interior. In some cases, it
solves a problem that couldn't be solved with existing furniture.
Commissioning custom work can be comparable to the cost and
delivery time of more expensive, mass-produced items. And it's
cheaper than antiques. By William L. Hamilton.

   SLEEPING-PORCH (Undated) _ Just outside the door of my writing
room here in Hollywood there is a collage of snapshots my mother
put together for a family reunion some years back. The snapshot
that catches my eye every time was taken when I was about 6. My
brother Frank and I were asleep on a couple of cots on my
grandparents' sleeping porch, sheets thrown back exposing our
scrawny little bodies, the fetid darkness of a Washington D.C.
summer night visible through the screened walls of the porch. We
spent every summer sleeping on a screen porch in those days, when
air conditioning was an exclusive feature of the movie theater
downtown, nowhere in evidence in our home or the homes of anyone we
knew. The sleeping porch was something we looked forward to, when
the heat and humidity would finally build to the point that the
cots would be dragged out and once again we'd be exposed to the
elements _ cooled, if only slightly, by an itinerant breeze, sung
to sleep by the insistent nighttime chatter of cicadas. By Lucian
K. Truscott IV. (475 words)

 A TRUE COUNTRY MUSIC FAN HAS SOUTHERN ROOTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   For several months, I've been dating a girl who lives in Baton
Rouge, La. Not only is she the first Southern girl I've dated, but
she does something I've never seen before. Whenever we're in her
car, she reaches for the radio, hits a button for one of the
country stations on preset and starts singing along. Now, I've
lived in a lot of cities _ Chicago, New York, Los Angeles,
Nashville, Seattle _ and met a lot of people. But this is the first
time I've spent time with anybody who sings along with
country-music radio. Even in Nashville, where the people who
manufacture the music live, rock 'n' roll, rap or alternative
country reigns in cars. Country radio listening, in general, is
strictly business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like many of my friends, I love country music. We
listen to Willie Nelson, Merle &UR; 9 &LR;  Haggard, Hank Williams, George
Jones, Johnny Cash, Loretta &UR; 10 &LR;  Lynn and all the great lesser-known
Texans like Townes &UR; 11 &LR;  Van Zandt &UR; 12 &LR;  and Jimmie &UR; 13 &LR;  Dale
Gilmore &UR; 14 &LR; . But we're city folk and musical intelligentsia. This
is music we like, not music we live or grow up to. It's definitely
not the country my Baton Rouge girl listens to. Sure, she likes
most of the above _ she was even named after a Waylon &UR; 15 &LR;  Jennings
song. But that's her parents' music. Country to her is Jo &UR; 16 &LR; 
Dee &UR; 17 &LR;  Messina &UR; 18 &LR; , Tracy Lawrence, Faith Hill (but not pop songs
like ``This Kiss''), Diamond Rio, Steve Wariner &UR; 19 &LR; , and that one
song by Shedaisy &UR; 20 &LR;  about a girl breaking up with her boyfriend
and taking the cat but leaving the litter. When she's in the mood
for more classic country, she listens to the Judds, George Strait,
Pam Tillis &UR; 21 &LR; , early Reba &UR; 22 &LR;  McIntyre &UR; 23C &LR;  and that Nitty &UR; 24 &LR; 
Gritty Dirt Band song about fishing in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out with her, I've come to realize that, although at the
very least 60 million records are sold each year by such
contemporary country acts, not one person I know in any position of
cultural authority whatsoever can truly say they like the genre. So
what's the problem? The genre or us?
</P>
<P>
   Let's start by taking a look at us. To simplify things, we like
music that we can relate to. This may be music that triggers a
connection with our past _ reminding us of, say, the Beatles songs
that we grew up with. It may simply be music that we've been
socialized to like by friends and colleagues. Or it may be music
that offers an escapist fantasy _ from the thug posturing of
gangsta &UR; 25 &LR;  rap to the hard drinking, hard living and heartbreaking
of classic country. But there is no cultural reinforcement in
Northern cities for listening to contemporary country pop. Our
friends don't listen to it, we didn't grow up on it and there isn't
a radio station in Manhattan that plays it. Overall, it seems like
canned, manufactured cliche &UR; 26 &LR; . We may be able to enjoy
Britney &UR; 27 &LR;  Spears singing ``I'm not that innocent'' as a guilty
pop pleasure, but when it comes to Shedaisy &UR; 20 &LR;  and its cat litter
we shut our ears.
</P>
<P>
   My epiphany came when my girlfriend bought me a Steve
Wariner &UR; 19 &LR;  CD. ``Listen to `Small-Town Girl,''' she insisted. It
was probably one of the cheesiest songs anyone's ever asked me to
listen to. The singing was over-sentimental and the music, full of
synthesizer stabs, was trite. But then there were the lyrics, about
a man who married a country girl and brought her back to a
skyscraper apartment in the city, where she has hot coffee waiting
and country radio playing every night after he comes home from a
hard day at work. ``There ain't &UR; 28 &LR;  nothing like the love of a
small-town girl,'' ran the chorus. They were the most hackneyed
lyrics in the world, but I loved them. Because I understood that
the song was her, singing to me.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I was able to connect the song with my life and the
things I cared about, and it opened up a door to the music. Though
country has a large audience in the north, it's important because
it remains a regional music, affirming the identity of those who
live in a country within a country: the South, home to a race of
very proud people often made to feel like second-class citizens
culturally. It is a very different place from the North. In the
South, they walk around every day with the identity of Southerner.
In the North, we're simply Americans; we don't realize we're
Northerners until we're in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as evidence of a changing South, most pop country is
about middle-class small-town life, or town-and-country, as Pat
Quigley &UR; 29 &LR; , the president of Capitol Records, likes to call it.
When the music comes across as more backwater and rural, it is
usually with the intention of further distinguishing itself from
the entertainment of the city. For example, Tim McGraw &UR; C &LR;  sings:
``You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute/ But there are
some things you can't do within those city limits/ There ain't &UR; 28 &LR; 
no closing time, ain't &UR; 28 &LR;  no cover charge/ Just country boys and
girls getting down on the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of criticisms we often apply to contemporary country is
as much a cliche &UR; 26 &LR;  as the music is accused of being. Detractors
say it's slick, soulless and manufactured. There is no twang, no
weepy steel guitar, no connection to legends like Hank Williams.
Whose standards are we judging it by? We don't expect rockers to
keep playing ``Rock Around the Clock'' and ``Blue Suede Shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   I certainly don't want to defend the music, but I do want to
make the point that many people don't understand it. We want our
hicks to remain hicks. But the hick musical savant is largely a
myth: many of the aw-shucks &UR; 30 &LR;  performers on the Grand Ole &UR; 31 &LR; 
Opry &UR; 32 &LR;  show 60 or 70 years ago were well-educated entertainers
playing a vaudevillian part. Today, country has evolved into an
industry that in many ways is much more sophisticated than rock,
rap, even most pop. It exists in a small, centralized and very
complex world. When record labels restructure and consolidate,
there is massive bloodshed at the rock and pop labels while the
country divisions are generally left alone. The simple reason is
that most New York and Los Angeles executives don't understand that
world. It doesn't work the same way. It's not based on talent
scouts signing artists to labels. There are other components that,
while they exist in the pop world, are the lifeblood of country:
songwriters, publishers and studio musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Great country hits are generally not written by a singer; they
are shopped for and bought in the closest parallel modern music has
to Tin Pan Alley. Listen to country radio and pay close attention
to the lyrics. They are meticulously written and thought out.
Vagueness will not do here: only clearly stated sentiments
calculated to appeal to the broadest swath of the American public.
(The most blatant example: the Chely &UR; 33 &LR;  Wright chorus ``I'm a
single white female looking for a man like you.'')
</P>
<P>
   I suppose in the Big City we think we're too smart to fall for
this. We have a snobbish attitude toward pop country, which in many
ways is the same attitude we have toward the South. When I moved to
Nashville for a short time, most of my New York friends turned up
their noses on hearing the news and laughed: ``What are you going
to do there?'' The answer: ``Well, think of it as spending a year
abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling around Tennessee, I entered a world with its own
regional cuisine and its own music. I came back with the
realization that we can never really appreciate country in the same
way country folks do. At best, we can appreciate it the way we
listen to the Buena &UR; 34 &LR;  Vista Social Club: admire it from a
distance, enjoying its intrinsic value but oblivious to its context
and relationship with quotidian life.
</P>
<P>
   If you disagree, go buy an album by the best-selling group
Montgomery Gentry. It's called ``Tattoos and Scars,'' and has been
on the country charts for over 60 weeks. On the cover you'll see
two hairy, beefy, mullet-topped good ole &UR; 31 &LR;  Kentucky boys who like
to wear leather overcoats with black cowboy hats. Inside, you'll
hear some strange attempt to package slick Nashville pop with
bad-boy Southern rock.You'll listen to it once, then set it aside,
shaking your head and saying, ``This is not for me.'' That's not
musical elitism: I don't like it either. It wasn't made for you or
me. It was made for people who don't like us.

A SOUTHERN THROB IN A NORTHERN HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 (Editors: Also see COUNTRY-MUSIC-NATIVE)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   I'm not entirely sure how I became
a hick. I don't flatter myself by claiming to be anything close to
the genuine item. I grew up on Long Island (OK, Great Neck),
listening to the Beatles and Stones like everyone else. I'm not
unfamiliar with classical music; I know my way around Miles Davis
and John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins and Thelonious Monk.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But as my increasingly embarrassed children can attest, when it
comes to music these days, I'm alarmingly close to all country all
the time. So as I do the usual suburban dad things, with Steve
Earle or the Dixie Chicks, George Jones or Emmylou Harris, pedal
steel and dobro and creaky Appalachian harmonies being drowned out
by the THUMP-THUMP-THUMP of the hip-hop or dance music coming from
the Jeep Cherokee stopped at the same light, it's hard not to
wonder what's wrong with this picture. I may be a faux hick, but
I'm a committed one, and even I can't entirely explain how things
worked out this way.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the first person I ever met who listened to country
music. It was my boss at my first newspaper job in Ypsilanti, Mich.
Ypsi, like Bakersfield, Calif., was a mangy Southern kingdom in
exile, full of expatriates working at the Ford and GM plants and
dimly lit, famously rowdy bars full of beefy, gimlet-eyed guys
named Sonny, Lester and Earl. Finding out my boss listened to
country music was like finding out about some really embarrassing
aspect of his sex life. I tried to put it out of my mind, but I
couldn't. I'd see him walking around the newsroom and look at him
as if he were some geek with three heads.
</P>
<P>
   If I'd thought about the music, instead of the cultural cliches,
it wouldn't have seemed so odd. After all, before the Beatles
changed the world, the first music I really got excited about was
the sound-alike folk music of the 1960s, the Kingston Trio, the
Limeliters, the Brothers Four, the Mitchell Trio. They were all
preternaturally clean-cut, homogenized creatures of the interregnum
between the '50s and the '60s who took the rough edges, twang and
grit _ everything that made it matter _ out of acoustic Southern
music and sold it for mass consumption. When the Beatles sang ``Act
Naturally'' or the Stones sang ``Wild Horses,'' it sounded fine to
me, even if I would have gagged at the thought of listening to Buck
Owens. The group from that time that most resonated with me, and
still does, was the Byrds, built around the ex-folkies Roger
McGuinn, David Crosby and Gene Clark and the ex-bluegrass mandolin
player Chris Hillman.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the group's mix of rock and folk veered off
naturally into hard-core country and bluegrass like Porter
Wagoner's ``Satisfied Mind,'' which popped up incongruously on the
group's ``Turn, Turn, Turn'' album. The Byrds looked and seemed too
cool to be carrying the hick gene, so, if anything, their forays
into country seemed like a knowing, hip affectation, a cool '60s
goof on the inhabitants of the lower orders. Still, there was
something there that spoke to richer worlds than the teen-age
posturing of rock 'n' roll in the rootsy jangle of McGuinn's
12-string, the ragged edges of the harmonies, the exhilarating
bluegrass flourishes of Hillman's ``Time Between'' and ``Girl With
No Name'' or the hilarious pop-country hybrid of `` Spaceman.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, somewhere along the line, I sort of got it. Like a lot of
'60s types, the first real country music I listened to was the
Byrds' ``Sweetheart of the Rodeo,'' a brilliant exercise in
commercial suicide in which Gram Parsons took the twang from the
fringes to the heart of the group's music. It included hard country
classics like the Louvin Brothers' ``Christian Life,'' the
country/soul of William Bell's ``You Don't Your Water'' and
memorable originals like Parsons' ``Hickory Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, it sounds every bit as soulful and
compelling as it did then. Parsons later went on to do inspired and
original cosmic cowboy turns with the Flying Burrito Brothers and
on his own, burn himself out and become the first alt.country
martyr when he died in 1973 at the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Byrds and Parsons did was to meld the restless
energies and alienation of the '60s generation with the unaffected,
quintessentially American longing and alienation of country. It was
grown-up in a way rock could never be, rebellious in a way
Nashville never wanted to be and true to something both ancient and
contemporary in the American experience. Though I didn't think of
it that way at the time, it was both musically and spiritually a
bridge from the self-indulgent elitism of the 60s to the real world
and a reminder of how fine the line was between the approved lefty
music and politics of Woody Guthrie and the scorned righty music
and politics of Merle Haggard.
</P>
<P>
   I moved to Texas in the mid-70s, picking up a stiff dose of the
woozy progressive country of Jerry Jeff Walker and Ray Wylie
Hubbard, the rockabilly of Joe Ely and the prairie heartache of
Willie Nelson, and then to Atlanta, where learning a little about
Nashville seemed a part of my job, covering the South for The New
York Times. It was the time of country's biggest commercial
breakthrough, with Garth Brooks selling more records than anyone in
America. For a while Nashville seemed to capture, for better or
worse, the moment _ the Reagan-Bush-era triumph of heartland
culture over coastal culture _ much as Motown captured its moment
in the 1960s. Working on a book about how much the country had been
influenced by the South, I hung out in Nashville for a week or so
and then drove across Mississippi, from the casinos of the Delta to
the casinos of the Gulf Coast, living mostly on bottled water and
Sun chips.
</P>
<P>
   My background music was the country smorgasbord I'd picked up in
Nashville _ the pop-country of Faith Hill before she went all pop
and became Shania Twain's rival for Country Super Babe; the
honky-tonk of David Ball; a rockabilly album no one else seems to
have heard by James House; the plaintive, literate Appalachian folk
of Iris DeMent; a terrific Merle Haggard tribute album, and my
favorite at the time, the cranky, Okie country rock of the
Tractors. A lot of it was wretched, like Tim McGraw, Clay Walker,
John Michael Montgomery and the prefabricated Nashville hunks in
hats on the radio, the 90s version of the sound-alike folk acts of
the 60s. But it almost didn't matter. I drove along Highway 61 in
the 100-degree heat, throwing the empty water bottles in the back
seat of my rental car, wondering if I'd ever have so much fun
again. After that, for the first time in my life, I reflexively
searched for the country station on the radio and headed straight
for the country section of the record store. I was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   For a while I thought of my listening habits as a transitory
eccentricity I'd soon outgrow. I thought it would end when I
finished my book, and then when I moved back to New York a few
years later. But for now, it feels like a part of the post-genetic
code you pick up as you live your life. Every now and then the
frequency fades out, like a too-distant radio signal, the twang
just grates, and I listen mostly to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But then, invariably, the signal locks back in, and I'm back to
the off-the-reservation alternative country, whatever that is, of
Steve Earle, Buddy Miller or Robbie Fulks or grand masters like
George Jones. It's pretty eclectic fare, not the mass-produced
Nashville of the radio, but one part Byrds and the Band, one part
Hank Williams and Merle Haggard _ pretty much the tastes of someone
who came to country through Gram Parsons, not Loretta Lynn. It's a
suspect pedigree, but it's all I've got.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to see my immersion in twang as a waste of limited
mental disc capacity. Here I find myself periodically forgetting
familiar phone numbers and the names of people I work with, and my
head is full of useless knowledge about which obscure CDs Gurf
Morlux played guitar on. But maybe I shouldn't be surprised.
There's not much out there for grownups to listen to. Hip-hop?
Hyper-emoting tabloid divas? Horrible thrashing post-Nirvana
teen-age rock? Yuck. I guess we all get to choose our turf in the
new Balkanized music market, and the alt.country diaspora is mine.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably generic and personal reasons for my
predilection toward twang. Country has traditionally been music for
middle-aged adults with grown-up bruises and scars. When Pete
Townshend sang, ``Hope I die before I get old,'' he was mouthing
the primal trope of music meant to be of, by and for kids. It no
longer strikes me _ and I assume him _ as such a swell idea. When
George Jones sings, ``I've had choices/ Since the day that I was
born/ There were voices that told me right from wrong/ If I had
listened, I wouldn't be here today/ living and dying with the
choices I made,'' it rings true. I guess I could listen to Stephen
Sondheim, who writes pretty smart songs about adults, too, but for
now I'll stick with George Jones.
</P>
<P>
   One of the triumphs of the contemporary
roots/alternative-country music is to mix the frazzled, dog-eared
wisdom of country with an edgy, Keroucian energy that has made this
stuff vaguely _ sigh _ hip. After all, Steve Earle, the godfather
of neo-twang, was featured along with the literateurs at the New
Yorker's celebration of its 75th anniversary last month. Even the
name of his new album, ``Transcendental Blues,'' bespeaks a
sensibility a tad less rustic than, say, Ernest Tubb or Lefty
Frizzell.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, back here in the land of the enlightened, I guess I
miss my time in the South. I think sometimes of an article the
Texas writer Larry L. King wrote in a 1975 special issue of The
Atlantic Monthly devoted entirely to the state. He reminisced about
the mythic Texas of his youth, and he paid homage to an unspoiled
stretch of desolate West Texas highway. Driving there, he wrote, he
found himself in a mental time warp, back in Old Texas ``under a
high sky where all things are again possible and the wind blows
free.'' He wrote of putting the heavy spurs to his trusty Hertz or
Avis steed, and flying lickety-split down the road, ``scattering
roadside gravel like bursts of buckshot.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds a lot like my highway satori in Mississippi. I spent
much of my life wandering out to places like Wink, Alpine and
Marfa, Texas, but now I'm one of the drones on the train platform,
catching the 7:48 each morning from Chappaqua. Ferrying the kids
around over the weekend or before school, I no longer even control
the music in the car. My daughter, who for a time I brainwashed
into thinking that rock 'n' roll was Mary Chapin Carpenter singing
``I Feel Lucky,'' is still ecumenical enough to appreciate the
Dixie Chicks but now insists on the radio station Z-100, which
means I hear Britney Spears and 'N Sync more than I hear Steve
Earle. My son wants to listen to Imus in the morning, and if we're
taking one of his friends along somewhere he issues a stern warning
about not embarrassing him by playing any of ``that stuff'' in
public. My wife's from the South, but she's anti-twang, too. Even
if suburban dads escaped to the neighborhood bar at night, I doubt
there's one anywhere nearby with Patsy Cline or Ray Price, Vince
Gill or George Strait on the jukebox, so that's no option either.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a little lonely up here, but I do my best. Scattering
roadside gravel like buckshot isn't quite my thing. But when I'm
alone in my trusty old Volvo, tooling around the dusty byways of
Westchester County from the A&AMP;P to the BJ's, from the Home Depot to
the Old Navy, I crank up my twang, imagine myself under a high sky
where all things are possible and go flying lickety-split down the
road.

A TRUE COUNTRY MUSIC FAN HAS SOUTHERN ROOTS

 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For several months, I've been dating a girl who lives in Baton
Rouge, La. Not only is she the first Southern girl I've dated, but
she does something I've never seen before. Whenever we're in her
car, she reaches for the radio, hits a button for one of the
country stations on preset and starts singing along. Now, I've
lived in a lot of cities _ Chicago, New York, Los Angeles,
Nashville, Seattle _ and met a lot of people. But this is the first
time I've spent time with anybody who sings along with
country-music radio. Even in Nashville, where the people who
manufacture the music live, rock 'n' roll, rap or alternative
country reigns in cars. Country radio listening, in general, is
strictly business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like many of my friends, I love country music. We
listen to Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Hank Williams, George
Jones, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn and all the great lesser-known
Texans like Townes Van Zandt and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. But we're
city folk and musical intelligentsia. This is music we like, not
music we live or grow up to. It's definitely not the country my
Baton Rouge girl listens to. Sure, she likes most of the above _
she was even named after a Waylon Jennings song. But that's her
parents' music. Country to her is Jo Dee Messina, Tracy Lawrence,
Faith Hill (but not pop songs like ``This Kiss''), Diamond Rio,
Steve Wariner, and that one song by Shedaisy about a girl breaking
up with her boyfriend and taking the cat but leaving the litter.
When she's in the mood for more classic country, she listens to the
Judds, George Strait, Pam Tillis, early Reba McIntyre and that
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band song about fishing in the dark.

regional cuisine and its own music. I came back with the
realization that we can never really appreciate country in the same
way country folks do. At best, we can appreciate it the way we
listen to the Buena Vista Social Club: admire it from a distance,
enjoying its intrinsic value but oblivious to its context and
relationship with quotidian life.
</P>
<P>
   If you disagree, go buy an album by the best-selling group
Montgomery Gentry. It's called ``Tattoos and Scars,'' and has been
on the country charts for over 60 weeks. On the cover you'll see
two hairy, beefy, mullet-topped good ole Kentucky boys who like to
wear leather overcoats with black cowboy hats. Inside, you'll hear
some strange attempt to package slick Nashville pop with bad-boy
Southern rock.You'll listen to it once, then set it aside, shaking
your head and saying, ``This is not for me.'' That's not musical
elitism: I don't like it either. It wasn't made for you or me. It
was made for people who don't like us.

 &HT;    Six recipes for winning window boxes
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some ideas never grow old.
</P>
<P>
   Take the window box.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to give your house a little personality _ both from
indoors and out _ these container gardens make a statement that
says, ``Welcome.'' If you're a townhouse or high-rise dweller tight
on space, they offer a solution to your gardening frustrations. And
if outdoor watering bans have forced you to curtail yard work, they
can be an even more practical option.
</P>
<P>
   Save money by designing your window box with a mix of evergreens
and annuals. By including a foundation of ivy, a small boxwood or
other shrubs, you'll need only to swap out the annuals from season
to season for a new punch of color.
</P>
<P>
   That's important, because window box materials can be expensive.
You can go as simple as a homemade wooden box, for less than $10,
or as high end as metal hayracks, which sell for $50 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   After selecting a box, decide where it will go _ in sun or
shade. That will help narrow your plant selections.
</P>
<P>
   Planning is important, but don't forget to be spontaneous. Have
a little fun with your box.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, Home &AMP; Garden asked three Atlanta-area gardening
experts _ David Ellis, Marcia Weber and Harriet Kirkpatrick _ to
cook up two window boxes each, one for sun and one for shade. Their
``kitchen'' was Habersham Gardens, an Atlanta garden center, where
they had access to a candy shop of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Check out their recipes on these pages. Give them a try _
keeping in mind, of course, that some of the best cooks never use a
recipe.

   &QR;  For good scale, the planted window box should be 25 percent of
the height of a short window or 20 percent of the height of a tall
one.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure your window box has drainage holes along the front,
not the back, so that water won't drain against the house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose a material that complements your house; likewise, use
plants that complement ones in the garden.

COLONIAL FANTASIES: WHEN THE EMPIRE HAS NO CLOTHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nous champions le bikini mais pas la nudite!'' So I recall
hearing a Club Med staff member bark at me in the summer of 1966 as
I lay sunning on a white sand beach on the Tunisian island of
Djerba. An Ella Fitzgerald tape was playing in the background. I
was the only American staying at a camp full of young French.
Naturally, my fellow holiday makers wanted to berate me about
Vietnam. I just wanted somebody to rub oil on my back.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered seeing French Indo-China on old maps. But I knew
nothing about that region's history, and very little about European
colonialism, for that matter, apart from its role in my country's
formation. Not until much later could I connect the dots between a
war against the Commies in a faraway jungle and Club Med's
delightful fantasy of primitive life on a South Pacific island.
Now, after reading Patricia A. Morton's new book, ``Hybrid
Modernities'' (MIT Press), I can see that Club Med's fake grass
huts were part of the greater global village, not an escape from
it.
</P>
<P>
   Morton, an architecture historian at the University of
California, Riverside, takes as her subject the International
Colonial Exposition held in Paris in 1931. The event was sponsored
by the French government and staged in the capital's poor, eastern
quarter. It was conceived as a celebration of the colonial system
and therefore a justification for it. Though primarily devoted to
French colonies, the exposition also included sections on
territories ruled by the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States,
Portugal, Germany, Denmark and Italy. Pavilions for individual
colonies were executed in indigenous architectural styles. Native
colonials were imported to perform music and dance, to demonstrate
craft techniques and to provide living simulations of local color.
These displays were juxtaposed with official French pavilions
designed in the classically derived Art Deco style.
</P>
<P>
   The fair's organizers touted the authenticity of the
reconstructed native architecture. A previous expo, held in 1890 at
the foot of the new Eiffel Tower, had also included pavilions on
the French colonies, but these had been designed as imaginary
pastiches of exotic styles. In 1931, the organizers invoked the
authority of accuracy _ of science, that is to say, thus intimating
that what visitors saw was objectively true. Extending this hint to
the expo's overall design, a visitor might conclude that the
cultural superiority of France to its colonies was self-evident.
The layout conveyed in spatial terms that European civilization
occupied an advanced position to which other peoples could, as yet,
only aspire.
</P>
<P>
   Morton defies the caricature of the post-modern cultural critic.
At no point does she deny the objectivity of science or the
positive uses to which it has been put. Her target is the
transformation of science into unscientific myth. Like
``Orientalism,'' Edward Said's blast against Western ways of
looking at Eastern ways of life, Morton's book unmasks the
attitudes behind common Occidental rituals. Reversing the
anthropological lens, she scrutinizes the Western habit of
scrutinizing others. At the Colonial Exposition, this habit was
given a habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Morton studies in detail how the fair's ostensibly authentic
pavilions actually deformed the originals on which they were based.
The Cambodian pavilion, for example, was a Westernized version of
the Angkor Wat, reconfigured in an axial Beaux Arts composition.
Inside, there were galleries arranged in the traditional enfillade
of the classical Western museum. These were filled with display
cabinets for ethnological artifacts. (The actual Angkor Wat has no
inside.) Outside, instead of indigenous jungle foliage, the temple
sat in a terrace paved with modern glass blocks: a skylight for the
galleries underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, despite the accuracy of its reproduced sculptures, the
temple was a deformed membrane separating the inner and outer
halves of a thoroughly Parisian space. An Enlightenment virtue
(exactitude) was used to lend credibility to a shameful cause
(colonial exploitation). This is what Morton means by hybrid
modernities. The intention of the expo was to emphasize the
separation _ the difference _ between France and its colonies. The
result was the reverse: a display of '30s decorative motifs. It
placed three-dimensional panels of exotic styles in an art moderne
frame. The claims of accuracy, authenticity and objectivity
diverted attention from the warped perspective of the whole.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight is 20/20. But the 1931 Expo was criticized in its own
time for the same reasons Morton identifies. French Communists
thought it glorified the exploitation of workers overseas. The
Surrealists saw it as a perfect example of the way modern
civilization flattens the sacred dimension of everyday life. Morton
devotes nearly a chapter to a counter-exposition organized by the
Surrealists to coincide with the state event.
</P>
<P>
   This production was staged in the empty Constructivist building
designed by Melnikov for the Soviet Union for the 1925 Paris
Exposition des Arts Decoratifs (the fair from which the term Art
Deco was derived). To contradict the idea that the West represents
rationality, the Surrealists drew on the twin poles of their
thought: the Freudian subconscious and the Marxian belief in social
emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural exhibitions were directed by Louis Aragon. They
included African, Oceanic and American tribal artifacts that had
been collected by Tristan Tzara, Andre Breton and Aragon himself.
Wall placards bore inscriptions from Karl Marx. Roman Catholic
figurines and ladies' hats from Parisian designers were displayed
as symbolic equivalents to tribal fetishes.
</P>
<P>
   This chapter raises Morton's book above the level of a diatribe
against colonial abominations. Instead, it becomes a tribute to
Surrealist tradition. As is more widely understood today than at
any time since the 1940s, the Surrealists regarded their paintings
and writings not as aesthetic objects but as catalysts for cultural
change. Thus the ``counter-expo,'' while containing no Surrealist
paintings, was an ideal Surrealist work: temporary, collective,
dialectical, fusing political and psychological realms.
</P>
<P>
   As Morton points out, the organizers of the official expo might
have included European work that was influenced by exposure to
tribal artifacts. After all, it was in 1914 that Picasso first
depicted African masks in his work. By 1931, Josephine Baker had
been the toast of Paris for six years, fashion and interior design
depicted primitivist themes and a romantic mythology of colonial
life was already well established. Dashing aviators, the French
Foreign Legion, Jean Gabin, travel posters, slippers in the sand:
these images were already integral to the French imagination.
</P>
<P>
   They were not, however, to be seen at the Colonial Exposition,
because the purpose of the event was to affirm the segregation of
France from its colonies, not to reveal that the two had already
begun to interbreed. Despite the intention, the expo produced the
opposite effect. From an anthropological and even an aesthetic
point of view, the expo demonstrated cross-fertilization. Behold
the Angkor Wat with glass block tiles. Thirty-five years later, in
post-colonial times, the expo has morphed into Club Med, with
sarong-draped youths, drinking Cokes purchased with plastic beads,
railing against American imperialism on a North African beach.
</P>
<P>
   Morton sees the expo as a microcosm of Greater France. She
writes, ``The Exposition occupied a `middle region' of experience
where the norms, rules, and systems of French colonialism both
emerged and broke down, unsustainable because of their internal
contradictions.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the expo could be faulted not simply because
colonialism was immoral, but because it was absurd. This was the
lesson of the Surrealist show as well. If it was absurd to exhibit
Paris fashions in an anthropological setting, it was no less
ridiculous to promenade religious artifacts in an ethnographic
setting. The Surrealist objective was to show that the official
expo was itself Surrealistic. Their outlook, a natural response to
the internal contradictions of modernity, remains a useful approach
for exposing the inner conflicts of our day.

   New York, 2000. Low crime, high times. Last March, police
officers issued 220 summonses to owners of small shops in lower
Manhattan. The Chinese merchants were charged, among other things,
with violating a set of design restrictions issued in 1975 by the
New York City Department of City Planning. This program, called
Little Italy Risorgimento, focused on the design of storefronts
along Mulberry and other streets in Little Italy. It was a
precursor of what would later be called contextual zoning,
legislation intended to preserve the existing character of New York
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delights of the San Gennaro Festival should be the rule,''
stated a document outlining the design regulations for the new
Little Italy special district.
</P>
<P>
   I shuddered when I read that sentence 25 years ago. At the time,
New York was just awakening to the full horror of the festival
marketplace going up at South Street Seaport. But at least that
maritime theme park was quarantined. Now the pestilence had broken
out on a real city street. Since then, there has arisen an entire
industry for branding streets with mix-and-match colors, lighting,
signage, street furniture and other techniques adapted from
suburban malls.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Little Italy was not just a matter of taste. As
in Paris, it was a question of internal contradiction. Though the
new zoning was promoted in the name of diversity, it actually
reflected a desire for sameness. A seasonal festival should become
The Rule. Only approved colors could stand for The Character of
Little Italy. Illuminated arches overhead should unify the street.
The contradiction became more evident with the police crackdown on
the Chinese merchants. Not only had they failed to represent the
approved ethnicity. They also dared to show that diversity exists
even among themselves. Since context is a matter of time as well as
place, the police were destroying the very tissue the design
guidelines were supposed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   We could see this as Italo Calvino might: Marco Polo imagining
the legendary cities of Cathay while remaining behind in Venice.
After all, it's not very useful to appraise contextual zoning on
purely aesthetic grounds. Once you accept that city streets should
be branded, it doesn't make much difference which colors are
chosen. Blue, green or orange, the twinkling lights, storefronts or
banners will look the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Surrealist critique remains as available as the formalist
one. It is perhaps the most useful method we have for revealing the
values at work in environments constructed in the name of
civilization: a Tahitian village in Tunisia, a Cambodian temple in
Paris, or a freeze-dried street festival at our feet.

 &HT;    Do it yourself window box
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like all container gardens, window boxes can be planted from
scratch each spring and fall or, like a wardrobe, updated with a
few changes.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Kirkpatrick, an Atlanta home and garden stylist, prefers
to start with a foundation of evergreen plants and build on that
with annuals that can be replaced with new bursts of color and
texture as the old ones fizzle out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always decide what colors I want to use first, then go to
the plant store with no preconceived notion of what to buy,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She aims for a mixture of plants that will cascade over the
sides, provide height in the back and supply mass in the center.
She also shoots for a contrast in leaf sizes and textures, some
solid and some variegated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also fun to go in and start from scratch,'' said David
Ellis, an Atlanta garden designer.
</P>
<P>
   A fun way to jazz up a hayrack, he said, is to cover it in sheet
moss, poke holes in the sides and insert trailing plants. Examples
include petunias, scaevola and lantana for sun and ivy,
plectranthus and asparagus fern for shade.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Weber takes things a step further. The horticulturist
accents her boxes with small ornaments for a three-dimensional
effect. By placing an object or piece of furniture in front of the
box, you can design an interesting vignette.
</P>
<P>
   Still don't know where to begin? Here's how Kirkpatrick does it:
</P>
<P>
   STEP 1
</P>
<P>
   Using a metal hayrack, lay a cocoa liner inside the form, in
this case, sheet liner. Before trimming the edges, fill the rack
about halfway with soil. Avoid compaction by using a light,
all-purpose growing mix instead of heavy potting soil. Mix in a
slow-release granular fertilizer, such as Osmocote.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 2
</P>
<P>
   Trim the liner's edges even with the form. Finish adding the
potting mix and wet it thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 3
</P>
<P>
   Start with a foundation of plants that will remain constant
throughout the seasons, such as ivy. In this case, Kirkpatrick used
a hanging basket of ivy and broke it into three smaller plants.
Baskets are great, she said, because the plants are fuller and
typically less expensive than those sold in individual pots.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 4
</P>
<P>
   Place tall plants, such as Boston fern, in the back of the
window box. Before planting, she douses the rootball in a bucket of
water to moisten the soil.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 5
</P>
<P>
   Fill in the center of the box with medium-size plants. Angle the
rootballs slightly forward so that the tops of plants are more
visible. Aim for a mix of dark green, chartreuse and white foliage
to provide contrast. Finally, add color where it's needed. Water
daily during dry spells and feed every one to two weeks with a
water-soluble fertilizer.

&HT;     AFTER 20 YEARS, SENIOR TOUR IS VIBRANT AND LUCRATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAUL DOMINGUEZ Jr.  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senior PGA Tour truly has been a boon to the baby boom
generation.
</P>
<P>
   What began in 1980 as two exhibitions that enabled players to
parade in carts has evolved into a tour that is competitive,
lucrative and unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior PGA Tour is offering its players $54.1 million in
prize money this year, double the amount available in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With so much money at stake, the days when Sam Snead and Billy
Casper could stage a competition that put the ``friend'' in
friendly rivalry are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now PGA Tour legends such as Tom Watson, Hale Irwin and Tom Kite
must work hard to keep pace with players like Dana Quigley, Allen
Doyle and Walter Hall, who had little to no professional careers
before joining the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The players still are friendly to each other, but even Chi Chi
Rodriguez says, ``it's a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven players have earned more than $4 million on the
tour, and at least 10 more players should join that list by the
close of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin is the leading money winner, having earned $10.7 million
in six seasons compared to the $5.9 million he picked up in 14
years on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned into a highly, highly competitive tour,'' Raymond
Floyd said. ``When it started, it was more of an exhibition to
bring some of the older guys out, have some camaraderie and service
corporate America somewhat. None of us imagined how popular it
would be received with corporate America and with television.''
</P>
<P>
   All Senior PGA Tour events will be broadcast on cable or network
television next year for the first time ever. The average purse in
the 36 full-field events is $1.3 million, the total amount awarded
for the 11 tournaments in 1982.
</P>

   The SBC Championship, which concluded Sunday at The Dominion in
San Antonio with Doug Tewell claiming a one-stroke victory, awarded
$1.1 million, and the purse is expected to increase another
$300,000 to $400,000 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not playing for all this money and giving all this
money to charity _ last year, $11 million _ just by accident,''
said Hal Seward, Senior PGA Tour vice president of tournament
business affairs. ``It's because it's a good product, people like
to come out and watch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it as successful as the PGA Tour? No, but it doesn't have
to be and it's not supposed to be. It's found its niche and it's
successful and it continues to grow every year.''
</P>
<P>
   While the growth has been lucrative, it also has come at a
price.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior PGA Tour started innocently in 1980 with two events
and became a full-fledged league in 1984 for players who are at
least 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Senior PGA Tour staples such as Casper and Gay Brewer seldom
play because they have dropped so far down the all-time money list.
They only participate when dozens of players elect not to play in
an event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the camaraderie we used to have and the fun we used to
have,'' Rodriguez said. ``The regular tour is the same way, it's
all a business. The guys who used to play this tour when I started
were ex-caddies. Now they are all bean counters; they come out of
college. I miss Casper, (Gene) Littler, Gay Brewer _ that laugh
that (Brewer) had _ I miss Arnie (Palmer).''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is players such as Hall and Doyle who are instilling
dreams in everyday golfers, generating greater interest and raising
the talent level on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I like are the guys that have a second
opportunity,'' Floyd said. ``The guys that were not very good
players or did not have much of a career on the regular tour or
might have been a club pro or in some cases worked in other fields
or were amateurs. That's an embellishment to this tour when you see
people like that that come here and are very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The influx of PGA Tour members who are turning 50 in addition to
players from other fields allows the Senior PGA Tour to regenerate
every few years.
</P>
<P>
   The money title has gone from Don January to Trevino to Jim
Colbert to Irwin to Bruce Fleisher over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the senior tour has gone through a natural evolution
that would happen to any organization,'' Seward said. ``I think it
has been a good evolution. Now it is a balance of being able to see
your heroes that you may have grown up with still compete at a high
level, but it's also a business and it's competition.''
</P>
<P>
   While many fans attend events to see favorites such as Trevino,
Rodriguez and Gary Player, it is the competition that is attracting
PGA Tour stalwarts like Floyd, Kite, Watson and Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a very competitive,'' Floyd said. ``Guys work
out, they work hard, they eat properly and they're practicing. When
the first guys started this tour, that was not the way it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evolved into a highly competitive tour and I think, as a
result of that, the bar has been raised and that's why we're seeing
the winning scores out here are so low. I think the field staff is
starting to recognize that and they are starting to set these golf
courses a little bit more difficult.''

<P>
   Three of the four scoring records set by a field were set in the
past four years. The lowest scoring average for a field was set in
the '97 Emerald Coast Classic (69.442).
</P>
<P>
   Because its members are getting better and the field deeper with
talent, Floyd said the Senior PGA Tour must prep its courses with
thicker rough and extend the course's length. The only other way to
toughen the 54-hole events is to expand them to 72 holes, which
most say won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too successful with the two pro-ams,'' Floyd said. ``I
think if we pull one of those pro-ams away from corporate America,
it might not be as successful. It's not broke, so let's don't go
try and fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   While legends in other sports are limited to old-timers' games
and autograph signings, their peers in golf are competing for
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Although his business ventures limit his schedule now, Palmer
has been playing professionally since 1954. Player has competed
since 1953, and Jack Nicklaus since 1961. Their contemporaries in
other sports _ Johnny Unitas, Stan Musial, Bill Russell _ have long
since retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandfathers and fathers can bring their boys and their sons
and daughters out here for Father's Day and let them see one of the
great personalities in golf,'' Seward said. ``They get to
understand what the guy does versus taking them to see a Hall of
Fame athlete in another sport who hasn't played in 30 years and try
to explain to the kid how great this guy was and what he used to
do. I think that's unique.''

&HT;     PANEL SEEKS TO PROMOTE ORGANIC FOODS OVER ENGINEERED CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Taking a slap at bioengineered crops, three
members of San Francisco's Commission on the Environment are
pushing legislation that would favor hiring vendors who use only
organic foods during city business or during events on municipal
property.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ordinance also calls for the city to urge federal
regulators to require manufacturers to clearly label all
genetically modified foods on store shelves, and even place a
moratorium on the sale of the food until they are ``thoroughly
researched'' for possible risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do more than just some fluffy public-awareness
campaign,'' said commissioner Parin Shah. ``We still feel like
there are a lot of unanswered questions about these foods.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation, which also urged the school district to
serve organic lunches, came after a meeting of the commission's
Planning and Policy Committee. The full, seven-member commission
will review the proposed ordinance July 17, and then the governing
Board of Supervisors would have to consider the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ordinance comes amid growing debate over
genetically altered foods, which have flourished in the past
decade. Last year, for example, half of American soybean crops were
bioengineered.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists call them ``Frankenfoods,'' claiming not
enough testing has been done to ensure the foods are safe for
consumers and questioning whether they harm the soil where they
grow. Proponents argue the crops are regulated, produce high
yields, reduce pesticide use and offer potential health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   France and some other European countries also are concerned
about the import of bioengineered food from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   No one spoke against the proposal during public comments on
Tuesday. But Lance Hastings, director of state affairs for the
Grocery Manufacturers of America, said after the hearing that he
strongly opposes it. He is concerned that the bioengineering debate
is ``starting with the assumption that these things are unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This resolution says, `Stop what you're doing and don't move
forward,''' said Hastings, who was at the meeting to speak on
another agenda item. ``If you can add nutrients to foods, that's a
good thing. That is often forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the Berkeley, Calif., school district became the
first in the nation to line its cafeteria menus with organic foods
in a program targeting elementary and middle school students who
also do some of the planting and harvesting.

HATE CRIME LAWS SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas had no hate crimes law on the books when James Byrd Jr.
was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck. Nor did Wyoming
when Matthew Shepard was tied to a fence and beaten to death. And
that, Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy and others claim, is why a
federal hate crimes law must be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crimes that are motivated by hate really are fundamentally
different,'' Clinton said on Monday after meeting with Byrd's
sister and nephew, ``and I believe should be treated differently
under the law.'' Kennedy, chief sponsor of the broad hate crimes
measure that passed the Senate on Tuesday, argued that it would
help ``define what this nation ought to be _ that is, a nation that
is going to be free from discrimination, hatred, and bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton and Kennedy believe that an applicable hate
crimes law might have prevented the Byrd and Shepard murders. How
then do they explain Buford Furrow? California, like 41 other
states, already has a hate crimes law, but that didn't stop Furrow
from opening fire last August on a group of Jewish children in a
Los Angeles community center, then killing a Filipino-American
letter carrier. Illinois's hate crime law didn't deter Benjamin
Smith from a shooting spree that left nine people wounded and two
dead _ all Jewish, black, or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton and Kennedy keep invoking Byrd and Shepard
because they believe that a hate crimes law would have ensured that
the murderers in those cases were vigorously prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But that can't be it, either. Of the three men who so savagely
killed Byrd, two have been sentenced to death and one is to spend
the rest of his life behind bars. Both of Shepard's killers have
also been sentenced to life. One of them, Aaron McKinney, was
facing a death sentence when Shepard's parents proposed a deal _
two life sentences in exchange for a permanent gag order that
prevents McKinney or his lawyers from ever appealing the verdict or
discussing the case in public. In the Buford Furrow case,
meanwhile, federal prosecutors in California are seeking the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   So what is it about the Byrd and Shepard atrocities that
Clinton, Kennedy, and the others are convinced requires a vast
expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction? The sheer, shocking
evil of those attacks? Undoubtedly what happened in Jasper, Texas,
and Laramie, Wyo., were horrors to freeze the blood. But were they
more horrible than John Wayne Gacy's serial murder of 33 young men
and boys in the 1970s? Than Timothy McVeigh's butchery in Oklahoma
City, which sent 168 innocents to their deaths? Than the mailed
bombs Ted Kaczynski used to kill three people and leave 23 others
wounded and maimed? Those, too, were abominations of heart-stopping
brutality _ yet none would qualify as a ``hate crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy argues that hate crimes are in a category of their own.
They ``wound not only the individual, but they also wound and scar
a community,'' he said on the floor of the Senate. Of course that
is true, but it is true of all violent crime. Every murder _ every
rape _ every mugging _ victimizes more than just the victim
himself. Which gives you the worse scare _ the robber who pulls a
gun on your neighbor up the street or the bigot across town who
beats up a stranger because of his color, religion, or sexual
orientation, which happens to be the same as yours?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had enough of Matthew Shepard cases,'' Kennedy says.
``We have had enough of the kinds of vicious murders based on
race.''
</P>
<P>
   What can this mean? That we have not yet had enough of cases in
which men who (itals)aren't(unitals) gay are tied to a fence,
beaten, and left to die? That we have not yet had enough of murders
that (itals)aren't(unitals) based on race? Is it only certain kinds
of murders of which we have had enough?
</P>
<P>
   Of course Kennedy _ who knows from sad experience what murder
can do to a family _ would never consciously claim that some forms
of murder are more acceptable than others. But that is the
unmistakable implication of his words. More important, it is the
unmistakable implication of hate crimes laws.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way around it: A law that cracks down harder on
criminals who harm members of certain groups by definition goes
easier on those who target victims from other groups. If a gang of
skinheads decides to crack some black or Jewish skulls, Kennedy's
bill would empower federal prosecutors to go after them. If they
decide to simply crack skulls at random _ or to go after illegal
immigrants or fat people or dwarfs or businessmen _ Kennedy's bill
leaves them alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equal protection of the laws must apply to all Americans,''
Kennedy said during the Senate debate. ``That's what this is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   No, what this is all about is precisely the opposite. Equal
protection means telling all would-be criminals that they will be
punished fully, regardless of the identity of their victims. The
bad bill passed by the Senate declares that some victims are more
deserving than others. That is not a message that should be allowed
to stand.

UNLEASHING NEW POLITICAL VOICES

 By KEVIN MERIDA  
 &HT;    You rarely see them quoted in news stories. Their advice is not
sought by candidates running for state or national office. For the
most part, they research and publish in obscurity. Thus, we hardly
hear from some of the most brilliant political minds in the country
and their work is not widely disseminated. They are the nation's
Black political scientists, with expertise ranging from American
government to the politics of hip-hop.
 &HT;    ``At least give us a say,'' says Robert T. Starks, a political
scientist at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago.
 &HT;    Michael Preston, an expert on urban and racial politics at the
University of Southern California, agrees. ``If Jesse Jackson is
running, everybody wants to talk to you. If Bush and McCain are
running, nobody wants to talk to you,'' he says.
 &HT;    Linda Faye Williams, associate professor of government and
politics at the University of Maryland, put it this way. ``Many
journalists don't know any Black experts, period. So, what you
really see are the same old people quoted over and over.''
 &HT;    There also is a pecking order in academia that limits the
exposure of many Black scholars.
 &HT;    ``Unless you're at one of those Ivy League schools and you're
Comel West or Skip Gates, you're likely to be overlooked,''
Williams says.
 &HT;    The insights of the country's Black political intelligentsia
were on full display in Washington recently at the National
Conference of Black Political Scientists' annual meeting. They
discussed the growth of Black nationalists as a political force,
judicial politics, race and the digital revolution. The group is an
outgrowth of a 1969 meeting in Baton Rouge, La., where 35 Black
political scientists met to share problems they faced in their
work. They later agreed that Blacks needed their own organization.
In May 1970, they held their first meeting.
 &HT;    Joseph McCormick, a political scientist at Howard University and
an expert on Black public opinion research, says we are now on the
fifth generation of Black political scientists. They first taught
at Black colleges in the late 1940s and early '50s. Some of the
pioneers are still sharing their knowledge: Twiley Barker, an
expert in judicial politics at Howard, and Jewel Prestage, a
political science professor at Prairie View, and one of the first
Black women to earn a doctorate in political science.
 &HT;    McCormick views the development of the conference in the context
of the two periods in which Black organizations sprouted. The first
period, 1905-12, produced such groups as the NAACP, the National
Bar Association and Black fraternities.
 &HT;    ``Black people were responding to segregation,'' McCormick says.
 &HT;    In some cases, they were trying to combat the forces of White
supremacy. In others, they were responding to being excluded by
White professionals.
 &HT;    The second period, the '60s and early '70s, produced groups
whose missions were rooted in the Civil Rights Movement and the
Black Power struggle. ``We took the position that we needed to
speak in a more authentic voice, define issues for ourselves.''
Some Black professional groups _ sociologists, economists, to name
a few _ operated within the mainstream groups. Black political
scientists chose to break away.
 &HT;    It is more than ironic that almost all of the Black groups have
``national'' in their names.
 &HT;    ``They didn't get American because all of the White folks
monopolized that,'' McCormick points out, referring to such
examples as the American Historical Association and the American
Political Science Association.
 &HT;    In the millennium's first political season, it is long past time
for Black political scientists to get their due. The media should
focus on Nick Nelson, an expert on Black mayors at Ohio State,
Sarita McCoy, who has worked on the Black gender gap at the
University of Chicago and F. Carl Walton, chairman of the
conference's program on electoral and legislative politics.
 &HT;    This year the organization decided to compile a directory of
Black political scientists, including their areas of specialty and
contact numbers for U.S. media outlets.
 &HT;    Then, instead of seeing the same old tired mugs on the political
talk shows, and the same old predictable comments in news articles,
we might finally be treated to some fresh faces and some new
voices.

   &UR; By TIM GIAGO (NANWICA KCIJI) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Way out here in the hinterlands I believe we have a much better
perspective on America than those living right next to the
powers-that-be on the banks of the Potomac or in the city
considered to be the center of the universe _ New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Indian reservations we often are puzzled at problems
that should have simple solutions and yet become unsolvable because
of the nature of politics. For instance, there appears to be a real
problem among the voters in New York State about the senate
candidacy of Hillary Clinton. There is also a question of why she
is still with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   I always believed that the way politicians solve the problems of
their home states in the house or the senate is by the political
connections they have established among their peers in Washington.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to seek out the problems and
needs of any state. So why are New Yorkers so concerned that
Hillary is not a native New Yorker? They didn't raise such a ruckus
when another outsider, Robert F. Kennedy ran for the senate seat in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that many New Yorkers are attaching all the baggage
of Bill Clinton to the apron strings of Hillary? How many voters
really cared if Franklin D. Roosevelt loved Eleanor and if he did,
why?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton proved to be a very poor husband to Hillary in one
respect: he cheated on her. Hillary forgave him his transgressions
and continues to love him. Hasn't that ever happened in the
families of those who would chastise her for this? I would think
she should be admired and respected for holding her marriage
together in the face of such public ridicule. At one time in my
life I wish I had had her courage.
</P>
<P>
   I have observed Hillary to be a caring, compassionate and honest
person. Isn't that what leadership is all about? The wolves of
Washington did everything in their power, honestly and dishonestly,
to discredit her and she survived. And in my mind, she came out of
it a much better person. If I was a New Yorker I know I would vote
for her.
</P>
<P>
   Who has the power in America: the people or the special
interests? Of course the answer should be the people, but that
answer is much too simple. We sit out here in Indian country and
see the power and money brokers control the government. Politicians
cannot survive without money. They get the bulk of their money from
the special interest groups. The National Rifle Association and big
oil for instance, have some politicians in their hip pockets. What
does that tell us about the land of the free and the home of the
brave?
</P>
<P>
   It's like a Catch-22. Politicians will not install campaign
reform because they need this glitch to get re-elected. And yet the
people who vote want campaign reform but they keep electing people
to office who have the power to bring about reform and will not. It
is a national disgrace to see a George W. Bush raise millions to
get elected or a Bill Clinton raise millions for his party even
though he can never run for president again. What it tells the
young people out here is that money makes the world go around.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with gun control laws. States with the toughest
gun laws, Massachusetts for example, have reduced the death by gun
shot wounds among children by 50 percent. Coincident or reality? I
own a hunting rifle and I would not mind at all having to register
it or get a license for it or get a trigger guard installed. If I
wanted to buy another rifle I wouldn't mind having to go through a
background check to get it whether it took one week or two months.
What's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we have never had an American Indian boy or girl walk
into a school and gun down teachers and fellow students. This seems
to be the dominion of teenage white boys.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the subject, I polled a few of my friends and relatives
on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and asked them who they
believed Al Gore would pick as a running mate. The person most
mentioned out here in Indian country is Sen. Tom Daschle, (D-S.D.)
Just thought I'd throw that in just in case it becomes a reality.
You can then say you read it here first and it could prove how
astute us country folks can be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it doesn't, one can always say that the hicks out
here in the hinterlands really don't know a darned thing about the
real world.

 By KEVIN MERIDA  
 &HT;    You rarely see them quoted in news stories. Their advice is not
sought by candidates running for state or national office. For the
most part, they research and publish in obscurity. Thus, we hardly
hear from some of the most brilliant political minds in the country
and their work is not widely disseminated. They are the nation's
Black political scientists, with expertise ranging from American
government to the politics of hip-hop.
 &HT;    ``At least give us a say,'' says Robert T. Starks, a political
scientist at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago.
 &HT;    Michael Preston, an expert on urban and racial politics at the
University of Southern California, agrees. ``If Jesse Jackson is
running, everybody wants to talk to you. If Bush and McCain are
running, nobody wants to talk to you,'' he says.
 &HT;    Linda Faye Williams, associate professor of government and
politics at the University of Maryland, put it this way. ``Many
journalists don't know any Black experts, period. So, what you
really see are the same old people quoted over and over.''
 &HT;    There also is a pecking order in academia that limits the
exposure of many Black scholars.
 &HT;    ``Unless you're at one of those Ivy League schools and you're
Comel West or Skip Gates, you're likely to be overlooked,''
Williams says.
 &HT;    The insights of the country's Black political intelligentsia
were on full display in Washington recently at the National
Conference of Black Political Scientists' annual meeting. They
discussed the growth of Black nationalists as a political force,
judicial politics, race and the digital revolution. The group is an
outgrowth of a 1969 meeting in Baton Rouge, La., where 35 Black
political scientists met to share problems they faced in their
work. They later agreed that Blacks needed their own organization.
In May 1970, they held their first meeting.
 &HT;    Joseph McCormick, a political scientist at Howard University and
an expert on Black public opinion research, says we are now on the
fifth generation of Black political scientists. They first taught
at Black colleges in the late 1940s and early '50s. Some of the
pioneers are still sharing their knowledge: Twiley Barker, an
expert in judicial politics at Howard, and Jewel Prestage, a
political science professor at Prairie View, and one of the first
Black women to earn a doctorate in political science.
 &HT;    McCormick views the development of the conference in the context
of the two periods in which Black organizations sprouted. The first
period, 1905-12, produced such groups as the NAACP, the National
Bar Association and Black fraternities.
 &HT;    ``Black people were responding to segregation,'' McCormick says.
 &HT;    In some cases, they were trying to combat the forces of White
supremacy. In others, they were responding to being excluded by
White professionals.
 &HT;    The second period, the '60s and early '70s, produced groups
whose missions were rooted in the Civil Rights Movement and the
Black Power struggle. ``We took the position that we needed to
speak in a more authentic voice, define issues for ourselves.''
Some Black professional groups _ sociologists, economists, to name
a few _ operated within the mainstream groups. Black political
scientists chose to break away.
 &HT;    It is more than ironic that almost all of the Black groups have
``national'' in their names.
 &HT;    ``They didn't get American because all of the White folks
monopolized that,'' McCormick points out, referring to such
examples as the American Historical Association and the American
Political Science Association.
 &HT;    In the millennium's first political season, it is long past time
for Black political scientists to get their due. The media should
focus on Nick Nelson, an expert on Black mayors at Ohio State,
Sarita McCoy, who has worked on the Black gender gap at the
University of Chicago and F. Carl Walton, chairman of the
conference's program on electoral and legislative politics.
 &HT;    This year the organization decided to compile a directory of
Black political scientists, including their areas of specialty and
contact numbers for U.S. media outlets.
 &HT;    Then, instead of seeing the same old tired mugs on the political
talk shows, and the same old predictable comments in news articles,
we might finally be treated to some fresh faces and some new
voices.

   &UR; By TIM GIAGO (NANWICA KCIJI) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Way out here in the hinterlands I believe we have a much better
perspective on America than those living right next to the
powers-that-be on the banks of the Potomac or in the city
considered to be the center of the universe _ New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Indian reservations we often are puzzled at problems
that should have simple solutions and yet become unsolvable because
of the nature of politics. For instance, there appears to be a real
problem among the voters in New York State about the senate
candidacy of Hillary Clinton. There is also a question of why she
is still with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   I always believed that the way politicians solve the problems of
their home states in the house or the senate is by the political
connections they have established among their peers in Washington.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to seek out the problems and
needs of any state. So why are New Yorkers so concerned that
Hillary is not a native New Yorker? They didn't raise such a ruckus
when another outsider, Robert F. Kennedy ran for the senate seat in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that many New Yorkers are attaching all the baggage
of Bill Clinton to the apron strings of Hillary? How many voters
really cared if Franklin D. Roosevelt loved Eleanor and if he did,
why?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton proved to be a very poor husband to Hillary in one
respect: he cheated on her. Hillary forgave him his transgressions
and continues to love him. Hasn't that ever happened in the
families of those who would chastise her for this? I would think
she should be admired and respected for holding her marriage
together in the face of such public ridicule. At one time in my
life I wish I had had her courage.
</P>
<P>
   I have observed Hillary to be a caring, compassionate and honest
person. Isn't that what leadership is all about? The wolves of
Washington did everything in their power, honestly and dishonestly,
to discredit her and she survived. And in my mind, she came out of
it a much better person. If I was a New Yorker I know I would vote
for her.
</P>
<P>
   Who has the power in America: the people or the special
interests? Of course the answer should be the people, but that
answer is much too simple. We sit out here in Indian country and
see the power and money brokers control the government. Politicians
cannot survive without money. They get the bulk of their money from
the special interest groups. The National Rifle Association and big
oil for instance, have some politicians in their hip pockets. What
does that tell us about the land of the free and the home of the
brave?
</P>
<P>
   It's like a Catch-22. Politicians will not install campaign
reform because they need this glitch to get re-elected. And yet the
people who vote want campaign reform but they keep electing people
to office who have the power to bring about reform and will not. It
is a national disgrace to see a George W. Bush raise millions to
get elected or a Bill Clinton raise millions for his party even
though he can never run for president again. What it tells the
young people out here is that money makes the world go around.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with gun control laws. States with the toughest
gun laws, Massachusetts for example, have reduced the death by gun
shot wounds among children by 50 percent. Coincident or reality? I
own a hunting rifle and I would not mind at all having to register
it or get a license for it or get a trigger guard installed. If I
wanted to buy another rifle I wouldn't mind having to go through a
background check to get it whether it took one week or two months.
What's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we have never had an American Indian boy or girl walk
into a school and gun down teachers and fellow students. This seems
to be the dominion of teenage white boys.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the subject, I polled a few of my friends and relatives
on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and asked them who they
believed Al Gore would pick as a running mate. The person most
mentioned out here in Indian country is Sen. Tom Daschle, (D-S.D.)
Just thought I'd throw that in just in case it becomes a reality.
You can then say you read it here first and it could prove how
astute us country folks can be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it doesn't, one can always say that the hicks out
here in the hinterlands really don't know a darned thing about the
real world.

LATINO VOTER TURNOUT CRITICAL IN NOVEMBER

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    It would be the largest number of Latino votes ever cast in a
U.S. presidential election: 6 million.
 &HT;    And the number could go even higher still.
 &HT;    Led by the efforts of the Southwest Voter Registration Project
and the U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, Latino groups and
activists across the country are mounting ``Latino Vote 2000,'' an
aggressive campaign to register hundreds of thousands of Hispanic
voters in the coming weeks and months.
 &HT;    Latino voter-drive efforts are not new. What is new is that
election-day turnout this fall by Latinos might well decide
countless local, state and federal races _ including the
presidency.
 &HT;    Raising the stakes even higher are predictions that an
unprecedented number of Latinos may shift their support from
Democratic to Republican candidates.
 &HT;    Vice President Al Gore and the Democrats still have strong
support among Latinos, but Texas Gov. George W. Bush is making real
headway. If he plays his cards right, I think he could match _ or
even exceed _ the nearly 40 percent support that Reagan received
from Latinos in his 1984 landslide re-election.
 &HT;    With Republicans holding just a six-seat majority in the House,
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle know just how critical a
Latino swing vote could be. And a strong victory by Bush can only
help down-ticket candidates, namely those in voting districts where
Latinos abound.
 &HT;    Consider the results of a recent survey by the Tomas Rivera
Policy Institute, a national think-tank that studies Latino
political trends. The non-partisan group found that in three Los
Angeles-area congressional districts each candidate's margin of
victory in 1998 was smaller than the number of registered Latino
voters who did not cast a ballot.
 &HT;    Put another way, a higher turnout by Latino voters could very
well have meant victory for the losing candidate.
 &HT;    For instance, Republican Congressman James Rogan, a member of
the House team that fought for President Clinton's impeachment, was
re-elected in California's 27th District by 6,800 votes in 1998.
Yet 21,000 registered Latino voters did not cast a ballot,
according to Matt Barreto, a Tomas Rivera researcher.
 &HT;    This tells us that getting Latinos registered to vote is only
half the battle. Along with voter registration drives, Latino
leaders of every political ilk should be mounting get-to-the-polls
drives.
 &HT;    Incidentally, it isn't that Latinos don't care about elections.
It's just that for most of our nation's history, our vote hasn't
really mattered to the cast of mostly non-Latino politicians
running for office.
 &HT;    Things could be different this year. The trends are all tilted
in the right direction. Latinos today are better educated. More
Latinos are starting new businesses, moving into management jobs
and even taking roles in the upper ranks of corporate America. And,
most significantly, there are simply more Latinos _ about 31
million by the latest estimates.
 &HT;    As a result, the growth in the number of Latinos who have
registered to vote has been striking. Juan Andrade, head of the
U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, says the number of registered
Latino voters nationwide jumped by 164 percent from 1976 to 1996,
compared to 31 percent in the general population.
 &HT;    Latino voter-registration efforts received an unexpected boost
in the 1990s in the wake of ``anti-Latino'' initiatives, according
to Russell Jauregui, an attorney in Pasadena, Calif., and a former
volunteer organizer for Southwest Voter.
 &HT;    Most Latino voters angrily rejected the sharp conservative shift
in Congress on the issues of welfare and immigration legislation
during the Gingrich years. And several California ballot
initiatives managed to wound the GOP image in the Latino community.
 &HT;    As a result, hundreds of thousands of Latino voters had little
trouble deciding to pick Democrats over Republicans in 1996 and
1998. Clinton, for instance, won more than 70 percent of the Latino
vote in 1996.
 &HT;    But there isn't a similar ``negative force'' pushing Latinos to
the polls this campaign season, Andrade said. Ironically, that has
some Latino leaders worried. While they appreciate the GOP's
kinder, gentler attitude toward our community, many Latinos may
feel that because the ``threat'' has subsided they can stay home on
election day.
 &HT;    ``We need another Pete Wilson,'' jokes Andrade, referring to the
former California governor who still draws the wrath of many
Latinos for his support of a ballot initiative barring illegal
immigrant children from public schools.
 &HT;    Hopefully, Latinos won't need another Pete Wilson to get us to
the polls in November. Latinos should know that with 6 million-plus
votes to wield in the general election, politicians across the
country and the political spectrum will think twice before
repeating Wilson's mistakes. All we have to do now is cast our
ballots.

 By DERRICK K. BAKER  
 &HT;    Solely because I have been robbed at gunpoint, an interminable
episode years ago that scared me nearly to death, my opinions about
the absolute necessity of background checks for people who want to
buy guns are not up for debate.
 &HT;    A certain firmness to your convictions results when the cold
barrel of a Saturday-night-special has been pressed to your sweaty
temple and you've been admonished by some weasel about how easy it
would be to scatter your teen-age brains over the storage room of a
variety store.
 &HT;    That searing flashback aside, while the U.S. Justice
Department's success in blocking 204,000 of the more than 8.6
million prospective gun sales last year won't in any way ultimately
stop guns from falling into the hands of criminals, it's reasonable
to guess that within that number of blocked sales lay more than a
few sub-moronic dolts who had no business having access to guns.
 &HT;    To paint a more detailed picture about the positive and
immediate effects of the Brady Act, which was instituted in
February 1994 and required the background checks, last year the
number of purchase rejections numbered 536,000 out of nearly 22.3
million applications. That's a lot of law-abiding citizens and
certified nut jobs alike who might have had his or her former
co-workers squarely sighted in the crosshairs that are the mind's
eye.
 &HT;    Moreover, numbers from the Department of Justice reveal that
state and local police rejected an even higher percentage of
would-be gun buyers than the FBI: The rejection rate among state
and local agencies was 3 percent compared with 1.8 percent for the
FBI.
 &HT;    Is this to imply that the Barney Fifes of the country are more
efficient in keeping guns out of the hands of evildoers than the
highly trained bunch at the FBI?
 &HT;    As a matter of fact, President Clinton and his minions long have
contended that the states are better equipped than the FBI to
conduct background checks, but some states don't want to pay the
costs.
 &HT;    According to the Justice Department, all state agencies had
access to computer databases that record past felony convictions,
and many accessed databases with other disqualifying information
such as fugitive status, court restraining orders, mental illness
and domestic-violence misdemeanor convictions.
 &HT;    The counter contention is true _ that all too often, criminals
don't walk into Billy Bob's Gun Shop to purchase a gun to rob a
7-Eleven or the 80-year-old church deacon. But far too many guns
purchased by law-abiding citizens end up without serial numbers and
in the hands of Pookie Jenkins, who gets a cheap thrill sticking up
people who look and live like him.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, here's a memo to the reluctant decision makers in
those states reluctant to pay for background checks: Take a second
_ and close _ look at your moral compass, before too many
legislators like yourself wind up the victims of violent crimes
committed with guns possessed by some of the very same people who
would have been blocked.
 &HT;    Joining those legislators is the National Rife Association, that
conglomeration of mostly self-righteous ostriches who can't see the
forest for the trees, who want more enforcement of existing gun
laws.
 &HT;    Who better than them to have a problem with accepting the rather
direct correlation between application rejections and the decrease
in firearm-related crimes since 1992?
 &HT;    Granted, the use of firearms has fallen from 31 percent in all
violent crimes eight years ago to 25 percent just two years ago.
But a crime is a crime, and we can reduce the frequency of those
crimes, particularly if we enjoy life.
 &HT;    So if I sound a bit angry at those who would fight the
productivity and constitutionality of background checks for
prospective gun owners, please bear with me. My anger and cynicism
and incredulity have something to do with being among the millions
of Americans who've had the experience of staring life _ and death
_ squarely in the face, courtesy of a firearm.

even exceed _ the nearly 40 percent support that Reagan received
from Latinos in his 1984 landslide re-election.
 &HT;    With Republicans holding just a six-seat majority in the House,
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle know just how critical a
Latino swing vote could be. And a strong victory by Bush can only
help down-ticket candidates, namely those in voting districts where
Latinos abound.
 &HT;    Consider the results of a recent survey by the Tomas Rivera
Policy Institute, a national think-tank that studies Latino
political trends. The non-partisan group found that in three Los
Angeles-area congressional districts each candidate's margin of
victory in 1998 was smaller than the number of registered Latino
voters who did not cast a ballot.
 &HT;    Put another way, a higher turnout by Latino voters could very
well have meant victory for the losing candidate.
 &HT;    For instance, Republican Congressman James Rogan, a member of
the House team that fought for President Clinton's impeachment, was
re-elected in California's 27th District by 6,800 votes in 1998.
Yet 21,000 registered Latino voters did not cast a ballot,
according to Matt Barreto, a Tomas Rivera researcher.
 &HT;    This tells us that getting Latinos registered to vote is only
half the battle. Along with voter registration drives, Latino
leaders of every political ilk should be mounting get-to-the-polls
drives.
 &HT;    Incidentally, it isn't that Latinos don't care about elections.
It's just that for most of our nation's history, our vote hasn't
really mattered to the cast of mostly non-Latino politicians
running for office.
 &HT;    Things could be different this year. The trends are all tilted
in the right direction. Latinos today are better educated. More
Latinos are starting new businesses, moving into management jobs
and even taking roles in the upper ranks of corporate America. And,
most significantly, there are simply more Latinos _ about 31
million by the latest estimates.
 &HT;    As a result, the growth in the number of Latinos who have
registered to vote has been striking. Juan Andrade, head of the
U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, says the number of registered
Latino voters nationwide jumped by 164 percent from 1976 to 1996,
compared to 31 percent in the general population.
 &HT;    Latino voter-registration efforts received an unexpected boost
in the 1990s in the wake of ``anti-Latino'' initiatives, according
to Russell Jauregui, an attorney in Pasadena, Calif., and a former
volunteer organizer for Southwest Voter.
 &HT;    Most Latino voters angrily rejected the sharp conservative shift
in Congress on the issues of welfare and immigration legislation
during the Gingrich years. And several California ballot
initiatives managed to wound the GOP image in the Latino community.
 &HT;    As a result, hundreds of thousands of Latino voters had little
trouble deciding to pick Democrats over Republicans in 1996 and
1998. Clinton, for instance, won more than 70 percent of the Latino
vote in 1996.
 &HT;    But there isn't a similar ``negative force'' pushing Latinos to
the polls this campaign season, Andrade said. Ironically, that has
some Latino leaders worried. While they appreciate the GOP's
kinder, gentler attitude toward our community, many Latinos may
feel that because the ``threat'' has subsided they can stay home on
election day.
 &HT;    ``We need another Pete Wilson,'' jokes Andrade, referring to the
former California governor who still draws the wrath of many
Latinos for his support of a ballot initiative barring illegal
immigrant children from public schools.
 &HT;    Hopefully, Latinos won't need another Pete Wilson to get us to
the polls in November. Latinos should know that with 6 million-plus
votes to wield in the general election, politicians across the
country and the political spectrum will think twice before
repeating Wilson's mistakes. All we have to do now is cast our
ballots.

 By DERRICK K. BAKER  
 &HT;    Solely because I have been robbed at gunpoint, an interminable
episode years ago that scared me nearly to death, my opinions about
the absolute necessity of background checks for people who want to
buy guns are not up for debate.
 &HT;    A certain firmness to your convictions results when the cold
barrel of a Saturday-night-special has been pressed to your sweaty
temple and you've been admonished by some weasel about how easy it
would be to scatter your teen-age brains over the storage room of a
variety store.
 &HT;    That searing flashback aside, while the U.S. Justice
Department's success in blocking 204,000 of the more than 8.6
million prospective gun sales last year won't in any way ultimately
stop guns from falling into the hands of criminals, it's reasonable
to guess that within that number of blocked sales lay more than a
few sub-moronic dolts who had no business having access to guns.
 &HT;    To paint a more detailed picture about the positive and
immediate effects of the Brady Act, which was instituted in
February 1994 and required the background checks, last year the
number of purchase rejections numbered 536,000 out of nearly 22.3
million applications. That's a lot of law-abiding citizens and
certified nut jobs alike who might have had his or her former
co-workers squarely sighted in the crosshairs that are the mind's
eye.
 &HT;    Moreover, numbers from the Department of Justice reveal that
state and local police rejected an even higher percentage of
would-be gun buyers than the FBI: The rejection rate among state
and local agencies was 3 percent compared with 1.8 percent for the
FBI.
 &HT;    Is this to imply that the Barney Fifes of the country are more
efficient in keeping guns out of the hands of evildoers than the
highly trained bunch at the FBI?
 &HT;    As a matter of fact, President Clinton and his minions long have
contended that the states are better equipped than the FBI to
conduct background checks, but some states don't want to pay the
costs.
 &HT;    According to the Justice Department, all state agencies had
access to computer databases that record past felony convictions,
and many accessed databases with other disqualifying information
such as fugitive status, court restraining orders, mental illness
and domestic-violence misdemeanor convictions.
 &HT;    The counter contention is true _ that all too often, criminals
don't walk into Billy Bob's Gun Shop to purchase a gun to rob a
7-Eleven or the 80-year-old church deacon. But far too many guns
purchased by law-abiding citizens end up without serial numbers and
in the hands of Pookie Jenkins, who gets a cheap thrill sticking up
people who look and live like him.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, here's a memo to the reluctant decision makers in
those states reluctant to pay for background checks: Take a second
_ and close _ look at your moral compass, before too many
legislators like yourself wind up the victims of violent crimes
committed with guns possessed by some of the very same people who
would have been blocked.
 &HT;    Joining those legislators is the National Rife Association, that
conglomeration of mostly self-righteous ostriches who can't see the
forest for the trees, who want more enforcement of existing gun
laws.
 &HT;    Who better than them to have a problem with accepting the rather
direct correlation between application rejections and the decrease
in firearm-related crimes since 1992?
 &HT;    Granted, the use of firearms has fallen from 31 percent in all
violent crimes eight years ago to 25 percent just two years ago.
But a crime is a crime, and we can reduce the frequency of those
crimes, particularly if we enjoy life.
 &HT;    So if I sound a bit angry at those who would fight the
productivity and constitutionality of background checks for
prospective gun owners, please bear with me. My anger and cynicism
and incredulity have something to do with being among the millions
of Americans who've had the experience of staring life _ and death
_ squarely in the face, courtesy of a firearm.

&HT;     HEAD OF MAYNARD INSTITUTE TO LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANNIE NAKAO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Steve Montiel never thought he could change
the world, just the newsrooms of America.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after taking over a journalism organization that
helped promote minority involvement in newsrooms, Montiel is
stepping down as the head of the Robert C. Maynard Institute for
Journalism Education.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel, 52, said he would remain as president and chief
executive officer of the Oakland-based institute until Sept. 5. The
institute provides training and services to promote diversity in
news media content, staffing and business operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to dig deeper into a project or two in a way that I am
not able to while leading an organization,'' said Montiel, who will
continue to serve on the board of the institute. ``I'm very
interested in journalistic storytelling that helps us see ourselves
and our communities whole.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the ultimate goal of the institute's founders _ among
them the late Robert C. Maynard, former publisher of the Oakland
Tribune _ when they revived a summer journalism boot camp for
minority journalists in 1976 that had ended at Columbia University
two years before.
</P>
<P>
   Relocated to the Graduate School of Journalism at the University
of California at Berkeley, the program trained minorities in the
summer and sent them to newspapers across the country as reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1976 and 1989, the institute trained more than 200
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 journalists also have graduated from the institute's
editing program during its 20 years at the University of Arizona.
The program recently relocated to UC-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   And another 300 news professionals have participated in the
institute's five-week Management Training Center program at
Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 2,000 journalists and news executives have
been involved in Maynard Institute programs.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel was a young Associated Press reporter when he applied to
become city editor for the institute's first class of reporters in
1976 in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   A Vietnam War correspondent for Pacific Stars and Stripes, the
native of Tucson, Ariz., became a founding member of the institute,
which incorporated a year later.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first members of the California Chicano News Media
Association, Montiel's work with the institute reshaped his
thinking about diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were already thinking and talking about the impact the
reporters coming through the summer program could have in the next
century,'' he said. ``Boy, it was a life-changing experience for me
to be around people who thought that big.''
</P>
<P>
   That optimism wasn't misplaced, Montiel said, citing graduates
who have had an impact in the news business.
</P>
<P>
   At least two alumni of Maynard programs are publishers of
newspapers _ Dorothy Bland, publisher of the Coloradoan in Fort
Collins, Colo., and Alexis Scott, publisher of the Atlanta Daily
World.
</P>
<P>
   Others are executives: Carolina Garcia, managing editor of the
San Antonio Express-News; Milton Coleman, deputy managing editor at
the Washington Post; and Evelyn Hsu, associate director of the
American Press Institute.

   Hsu, a former reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle and the
Washington Post, is also directing the Poynter Institute's new high
school journalism program. She credited the institute's founders
for her success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like having really brilliant and inspiring
people believe in you,'' said Hsu, a Maynard Institute board
member. ``It paves the way for your accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Other graduates continue to report, including Mireya Navarro, a
reporter and former Miami bureau chief for the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe my career to the institute,'' said Navarro, a former San
Francisco Examiner reporter. ``They got me fresh out of college and
gave me these incredible standards, and I'm grateful for that. It
also provided us with this wonderful network of people who shared
that boot camp experience. We still run into each other. It really
feels like family.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ What had started as a bad day turned even
worse when the shaggy-haired man pointed one nicotine-stained hand
at my face, held my crisp American dollar bill in the other and
shouted ``Counterfeit!''
</P>
<P>
   I had stepped inside Paris Boutique, a small shop off Mother
Teresa Street, the main drag in Kosovo's capital, to buy a new
dress and other clothes after concluding my luggage was lost, not
merely ``delayed,'' as the airline insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a pair of pants to supplement the clothes I was wearing
_ the only ones I had for my two-week reporting trip _ was a trial
in itself. But exchanging my dollars for German Deutsch marks, the
preferred currency in Kosovo, turned into an inquisition lacking
only hooded judges.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking my $100 bill twice and then rubbing Benjamin Franklin's
face on the inside of his wrist, like a perfume insert from a
fashion magazine, the money-changer insisted that traces of paint
had rubbed off, proving I was a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counterfeit! It's counterfeit!'' he shrieked until I poured
out my story of how my luggage had been lost between Moscow and
Macedonia. The saleswomen, who had warmed to me after discovering I
was a dyed-in-the-wool American, scolded him for his rudeness
toward a citizen of the country that played a major role in NATO's
defeat of the Serb military last year.
</P>
<P>
   His face suddenly softening, the money-changer offered me a
generous exchange rate if I'd mail a letter to basketball great
Michael Jordan for him. ``He's my hero,'' the paunchy man said.
``He's the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   My encounter with the currency specialist-cum-Chicago Bulls fan
was merely the beginning of my tour through Kosovo's gray economy.
Thanks to lost baggage, I learned how honest citizens eat, clothe
themselves and eke out a living after two years of war with the
Serb army had unraveled their lives. I also learned how slowly
traditional gender relations change in this nominally Muslim
country.
</P>
<P>
   These Kosovars are not part of the prostitution or drug rings
that thrive in this Connecticut-sized province set between Albania
and Serbia, arguably Europe's most criminalized societies. Still,
necessity forces them every day to take advantage of Kosovo's black
market to ease life in a war-battered region where electricity runs
part of the time and food supplies depend on the season.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are
unemployed, pushing a large number to the edge of poverty. The
United Nations is the largest employer, and officials admit it will
be years before investment generates new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen take advantage of the porous U.N. administration to
smuggle in vegetables from Italy, construction materials from
Turkey and shoes from Spain without paying duties and to resell
them without paying taxes _ crimes that technically make almost all
consumer goods part of the black market.
</P>
<P>
   A whiff of illegality hangs over downtown Pristina, from the
bootleg Marlboros hawked by 10-year-old boys for US$1.50 to the
pirated Jennifer Lopez and Dr. Dre CDs sold for US$2 on almost
every corner _ including on the sidewalk in front of the U.N.
police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But, law-enforcement officers are too overworked to crack down
on petty economic crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you bust a kid earning pennies to take home to his
family?'' said Bruce Lloy, spokesman for the U.N. police force in
Kosovo. ``We're better off focusing our resources on the serious
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For me and for most people in Kosovo, the underworld of
drug-trafficking and other heavy-duty crime _ the ``serious stuff''
_ swirls out of sight. Night after night, I'd walk alone from
Pristina's Internet cafe to a bar then home after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   My translator's family thought my schedule was a bit crazy _ a
reaction that revealed more their views about what woman should do
after dark than their fear of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Long-standing cultural values have melted a bit, however. Shops
brim with the latest American fashions, including pink hot pants,
high wedge-shaped black heels and snug halter tops. Not at all what
I thought women in a Muslim country would wear.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my original fears that I wouldn't find any clothes for
sale in Kosovo _ ``Who goes shopping in a war zone?'' I thought _
quickly turned to fears that I wouldn't find anything suitable for
reporting, only street walking.
</P>
<P>
   But two days and five or six stores later, just in time for my
interview with the head of Kosovo's largest political party, I
finally found the right item _ a sleeveless, bright blue printed
cotton dress long enough to be modest in an interview yet hip
enough to wear to a restaurant. All for 42 German marks, or $21
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to look good is to feel good,'' Alma, a 22-year-old
saleswoman dressed in khaki cargo pants and a black polyester tank
top, told me as I handed over my cash. ``You've got to go out,
laugh with friends, or else life just becomes work, cooking and
sitting in an old apartment where you don't have electricity half
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Having already spent a week's worth of evenings typing notes and
washing my grimy clothes by hand under candlelight, I knew exactly
how she felt.

 &HT;    ALLEGED U.S. SPY JAILED IN RUSSIA RAISES COLD WAR FEARS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The wife of an alleged American spy pleaded with
Russian officials Wednesday to free her jailed husband in a case
reminiscent of superpower relations during the Cold War's iciest
years.
</P>
<P>
   A shroud of official silence surrounds what Moscow-based
diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, have called a highly
unusual case that comes at politically sensitive time in
U.S.-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Cheryl Pope visited her husband, Edmond Pope, a
retired U.S. Naval intelligence officer, for the first time since
his arrest here on April 3. Trembling and struggling to hold back
tears, she insisted that her husband, now a businessman, was
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to see him yesterday and we embraced. The first
thing he said to me was 'I'm innocent,' and I said, 'I know you
are,''' she said. ``I would just like to ask (Russian President
Vladimir) Putin to please look at my husband as an individual, and
to see there's a mistake being made here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Pope said she knew little about her husband's business in
Russia or the charges against him. She said her brief conversation
with him in the waiting room at Lefortovo prison, a Soviet-era jail
used by the KGB to hold political prisoners, concentrated on family
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told each other we loved each other very much, and that we
would stay a strong family,'' Cheryl Pope said, adding that she
told him that their infant grandson had taken his first steps.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has yet to release a detailed explanation
of the charges against Pope. The Federal Security Service, the
successor agency to the KGB and the organization Putin ran last
year before running for president, has simply said the American is
charged with stealing ``state secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether President Bill Clinton raised the Pope
case during his visit to Moscow earlier this month. Clinton's
meetings were largely devoted to defense issues, especially
Russia's concern over U.S. plans to developing a controversial
national missile defense (NMD) that could alter the 1972
Anti-ballistic Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, a veteran traveler to Russia, runs CERF Technologies
International, a consulting firm based in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Before his arrest, he was working in Moscow with a weapons
company called Russian Technologies to help market Russian torpedo
technology to international buyers, according to copies of business
plans and correspondence between Pope and the company made
available to Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The technology has been described by defense analysts as
unclassified and already for sale on the world arms markets.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in Moscow said the Pope case deviates from the usual
practice in alleged espionage incidents in Russia. Usually, a
suspected spy is deported immediately, not jailed for long periods
of time, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian defense analyst Vladimir Rudenko said Pope's arrest
could be a by-product in a long-running battle between Russian
weapons companies, a murky world run by former Soviet military
figures and KGB agents that brings in billions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's election as president in March has resulted in a
reshuffle of figures throughout the government as well as the
weapons sector. Russian Technologies became a casualty of the
jockey for power, and was disbanded in April, Rudenko said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have mistakenly landed in the middle of something
over his head,'' Rudenko said of Pope.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., was denied access to Pope during a
visit to Moscow one week ago. Like Pope's wife, Weldon claims the
former naval officer was not a spy but merely a businessman who
openly bought technology and sought joint ventures with Russian
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA has assured me that he is not one of theirs,'' Weldon
said.

CUTTING THE BACH CHOIR DOWN TO SIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On this 250th anniversary of the death of Bach or in any other
year, there can be few musicological questions more pressing than
that of how the composer's music sounded when it was being
performed for the first time, week after week, under his direction
in St. Thomas' Church in Leipzig, Germany. Light is now being shed
on this subject by one of the leading practitioners of early music,
the English conductor Andrew Parrott, in performances, recordings
and a book, ``The Essential Bach Choir'' (University of Rochester
Press).
</P>
<P>
   Parrott takes up the story from the American scholar Joshua
Rifkin, who, nearly 20 years ago, caused a stir in the world of
early music by suggesting that Bach's B minor Mass, ``St. Matthew
Passion'' and cantatas were not the choral masterpieces everybody
had always taken them to be. They were still masterpieces, for
sure. What Rifkin was doubting was that they were intended to be
choral music as listeners then knew it.
</P>
<P>
   In Rifkin's view, what Bach meant by ``chorus'' was not a throng
of enthusiastic singers but rather a set of soloists. Since Bach's
choral movements generally have four vocal parts _ soprano, alto,
tenor and bass _ just four singers would be required to perform
them. In works that have two choirs, the number would be eight.
</P>
<P>
   This notion that the ``St. Matthew Passion,'' for instance,
might be sung by just eight singers was revolutionary when Rifkin
broached it at a conference in Boston in 1981, and the controversy
has rumbled on. Parrott, in his book, is out to end it. He includes
Rifkin's paper _ which, astonishingly, has never been published
complete before _ and adds the evidence of his own exhaustive
research to present a strong and fascinating case.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott's argument rests principally on the primary evidence:
the performance materials surviving from Bach's musical household,
produced by the composer's numerous offspring and equally numerous
apprentices. These young people had to copy, from Bach's score, the
parts that the instrumentalists and singers would need to read as
they played and sang. And it turns out that in virtually every
case, only one part exists for each line in a choir.
</P>
<P>
   If one wants to imagine that more than four singers were
involved _ or eight in works for double choir _ then one has to see
these singers as clustered together, perhaps three of them reading
from one part. This setup is unlikely, according to Parrott,
because the parts that Bach's children and assistants wrote out do
not consistently indicate changes from choral sections to solos, in
which the presumed second and third singers would have had to stop
singing. One might add that the parts, several of which are
reproduced in Parrott's book, appear too casual, fine and detailed
to have been read by more than one person.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting evidence includes pictorial representations of
musical performance from Bach's time, none of them showing singers
(or instrumentalists, for that matter) sharing copies. Parrott also
cites references to choral singing in various documents, most of
which suggest that choirs in Baroque Germany generally had one
singer for each part or, at most, two.
</P>
<P>
   But the most crucial document of all is one that comes to us
from the hand of Bach himself, the memorandum he lodged with the
Leipzig Town Council in 1730: what he called a ``brief yet highly
necessary outline of a properly constituted church musical
establishment, with some sober reflections on the decline of the
same.'' This, too, Parrott incorporates in his book complete, in
the original German and in translation.
</P>
<P>
   As director of music at St. Thomas' School, Bach was responsible
for the choirs of four Leipzig churches, and three of those choirs
had to be musically proficient, the fourth singing only chorales.
Each choir, he stipulates, ``must have at least three sopranos,
three altos, three tenors and as many basses.'' Four would be
better. But as he immediately explains, this was to provide for
illness: a common occurrence, ``as the prescriptions written by the
school doctor for the apothecary must show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bach was thus asking the city to provide for choirs of 12
singers (16 in his dreams), but only so that, barring epidemics,
there would always be enough to perform works with eight vocal
parts. What is not clear _ since Bach was writing for the
councilors of Leipzig, not for musicians nearly 300 years later _
is whether he would have expected all 12 singers to perform a piece
with four parts (the standard for the Sunday cantatas) at times
when the apothecary was not so busy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as he miserably concludes, he did not have that luxury.
In 1730, when he was writing, only 17 singers under his
jurisdiction were musically able, so the school could hardly have
done more than send a choir of four to each of the three churches
where elaborate music was performed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no reason for professional musicians now to
be constrained by the deteriorated conditions of musical Leipzig in
1730, and Parrott risks putting the music on a fast to imitate what
Bach considered starvation. The evidence of the parts and of other
contemporary documents, written and pictorial, is not entirely
conclusive: the pictures are too few; the documents (like Bach's
statement) had their own purposes. And it seems plausible that if
Bach had had what he wanted _ choirs of 12 or even 16 _ he would
have wanted everybody to sing, even in a four-part composition.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the important support for musical choices must come
not from the archives but from the sound. And the sound of
Parrott's performances _ here recently with the New York Collegium,
and on a Sony Classical CD with his own Taverner Consort and
Players in the ``Trauer-Ode'' and two motets _ is compelling proof
that his ideas work.
</P>
<P>
   Choirs of soloists balance and blend beautifully with a
period-style chamber orchestra. They sound well, even in a
relatively large church. Phrasing and texture can be lighter, the
effect, as Eric Van Tassel puts it in his liner notes for the
recording, ``more personal and, in a way, more human.''
</P>
<P>
   And at one point in the ``Trauer-Ode,'' as recorded here, the
advantage of the four-person choir becomes startling. The tenor
sings a short recitative, then he alone _ not clumped into a
faceless group _ leads his companions into the ensuing chorus. More
than all the arguments, the moment makes the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that Parrott, in his book, should appeal not
to such musical value but instead to a merely reproductive
correctness, writing that his is ``the mode of performance which
... best reflects Bach's own practice.'' For one thing, if that
were to be the criterion, then Bach choirs would have to be all
male.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his reforming zeal is understandable. If, as he points
out, the great quartets of Haydn and Beethoven had always been
performed by string orchestras, performances by just four players
would be revelatory. So is his gentle, touching and musicianly
Bach.
</P>
<P>
   This is, to be sure, not the only way. Other conductors will go
on using choirs on the scale Bach might have hoped for, rather than
of the size he had. Most important of all, choirs of schools,
churches and amateur societies, through which most of us came to
feel the glory of Bach for the first time, will go on performing
the ``St. Matthew Passion'' with crowds of singers, the more the
merrier.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott, though, is vindicating a real alternative.

`CYBERSELFISH': ACCUSING SILICON VALLEY OF A HEART OF COAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paulina Borsook is fed up with Silicon Valley. But the area's
instant millionaires and outrageously priced houses are not the
reason for her fuming. It is the ideology behind the technology
industry that really has her miffed.
</P>
<P>
   Those emotions come screeching through in Borsook's book,
``Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian
Culture of High-Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Borsook, a journalist and former contributing writer for Wired
magazine, has written an irreverent (and sometimes
incomprehensible) rant on what she sees as the hypocrisy of today's
technology leaders. They don't like big government, they don't like
regulation, and they wish that Uncle Sam would just leave them and
their market-driven economy alone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Borsook points out over and over again, government money
and federal regulations have made Silicon Valley what it is today.
Federal grants sponsored university research that has been
translated into scores of Internet and computer products.
Regulations have ensured that the banking system is ``relatively
fraud free.'' And the defense industry, don't forget, brought the
Internet into existence in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government,'' she writes, ``has made Silicon Valley a fine and
dandy, safe and regularized place to make scads of money.''
Internet moguls who do not realize this, Borsook writes, are
nothing better than ``privileged spoiled teen-agers.'' To those who
are tired of the hype emanating from Northern California in the
past five years, the Bay Area bashing in ``Cyberselfish'' may be a
welcome relief.
</P>
<P>
   The book also presents an insider's view of how high-tech
culture has evolved in the past decade. Borsook, who lives in Santa
Cruz, has been observing and interacting for years with the area's
computer programmers, software engineers, cryptographers and
venture capitalists. One chapter focuses on Wired and the
personalities that gave the magazine its libertarian bent. The
chapter also reveals some of the frustration felt by women who
wrote for Wired in the mid 1990s, women who bemoaned how a magazine
that considered itself in the vanguard could in fact be nothing
more than a geek's twist on the old boy network.
</P>
<P>
   But if you plan to accompany Borsook on this 256-page romp, be
prepared to take a deep breath. Reading the book is like charging
blindly through an obstacle course. Paragraphs are filled with so
many asides, hyphenated words, parenthetical clauses, dashes and
asterisks that you are left virtually panting at the end of each
sentence. That is, if you get to the end of the sentences at all.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is Borsook's argument against a free-market
society in which feeble people are pushed aside without any
consideration of their potential as creative human beings:
</P>
<P>
   ``The hypersensitive maladaptive no-commercial-potential
individuals, the runts of the litter, and the defective members of
the species can _ because as humans and not planaria we can value
things not just of momentary food/shelter/mate-status-enhancing
enticement _ create the best of what makes us remotely human.''
</P>
<P>
   Have you given up yet?
</P>
<P>
   Her arguments, too, require some patience. The apparent
selfishness of the technology community is at the heart of the
book, so Borsook tries to paint a picture of dot-com billionaires
keeping all their money to themselves. Yet in reviewing data on
philanthropy in Silicon Valley, she leaves questions dangling and
relies on what seems to be less-than-rigorous research.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she writes that in the mid-1990s, the percentage of
corporate profits devoted to corporate philanthropy in Silicon
Valley dropped. But she quotes statistics collected in 1997 and
earlier. What has happened in the past three years, when many
companies became even more flush? If recent statistics were not
available, surely an analysis of companies' annual reports could
have helped fill in the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   The drop also raises questions. Borsook writes that 1.14 percent
of profits in 1993, and 0.92 percent in 1997, were used for
philanthropy. That does not sound like a steep decline, but there
is no way to imagine otherwise because readers are given no points
of comparison in other industries.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, in fact, that corporate contributions, as a share
of earnings, have been declining for a few decades among U.S.
companies. Data from The Conference Board, a nonprofit research
group, shows that the numbers dropped from 2.36 percent in 1986,
the highest percentage in the past 50 years, to 1.1 percent in
1997. So, yes, Silicon Valley companies look slightly stingier, but
the drop may be the result of larger national trends not related to
libertarianism, like the research group's finding that companies
are starting to give more non-cash gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Borsook makes other arguments that sound more solid. The
software industry, she writes, often congratulates itself for
donating thousands of packages of software to schools and nonprofit
groups. Yet the donations are often no more than marketing drives
that come with a bonus: they provide companies with useful tax
deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the impossible sentences and undeveloped arguments, the
book does raise broader questions that are worth asking about the
libertarianism of the high-tech industry. If the ideology behind
American corporations becomes more and more libertarian, if voters
agree that Internet companies should be left alone and then decide
to apply that concept to other corporate interests, what does that
mean for the social institutions that make up our communities? Will
people turn further and further away from schools, from hospitals,
from less-than-computer-literate people who need a hand?
</P>
<P>
   Borsook does not have the answers. But at least she raises the
questions. ``We can only marvel,'' she writes, ``and be afraid.''

&HT;     LEVI STRAUSS REPORTS BETTER PERFORMANCE IN 2ND QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. says that net income rose 48
percent in the second quarter and that sales declines slowed in the
same period, indicating that recent belt-tightening at the jeans
maker is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with where we are in our business
turnaround,'' said Philip Marineau, the company's president and
chief executive. ``We are doing what we said we would do to
stabilize the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of our sales decline has slowed, gross margins are
up, our net income is rising and we are decreasing our debt,'' he
said. ``In addition, we have maintained strict and effective cost
controls.``
</P>
<P>
   Net income in the quarter ended May 28 rose to $45 million from
$30.4 million a year earlier, while sales declined 6 percent to
$1.15 billion from $1.23 billion in the year-ago period, an
improvement from the 15 percent decline in net sales reported for
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Product innovation and marketing initiatives contributed to the
improved sales trend, the privately held company said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter gross margin, which reflects the profitability of
sales, rose to 42.4 percent compared with 40 percent in the second
quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals such as Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Calvin Klein Inc. have
been taking sales from Levi Strauss in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   That forced the company to restructure its operations over the
past 12 months, a move that included significant job cuts at its
headquarters in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts saw the second quarter figures as a sign that business
was turning around at Levi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales declines are decreasing, and they are managing their
inventories with discipline, and that is having an impact on gross
margins,'' said analyst Todd Slater of Lazard Freres &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Total debt stood at $2.3 billion at quarter's end, down from
$2.67 billion six months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The action that we've taken to improve profitability has
worked,'' said Bill Chiasson, the company's chief financial
officer. ``At the same time, I don't want people to think we're all
the way back. We expect to see improvement every season. It may
take a year, maybe a year and a half, to get where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiasson said new products are helping the company attract young
buyers. Those products include a line of freight jeans, corduroys
and hip-huggers. Many of those products were introduced first in
Asia and Europe, where they are selling strongly, said Chiasson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to create a buzz in the marketplace,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Roth IRA still not widely understood
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lot of experts believed Roth individual retirement
accounts would be a big hit by now.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A Roth IRA offers a tremendous tax break for people who can put
away $2,000 a year and let it grow. It has big advantages for
people who are planning how they will pass their money along to
their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   But only 7 percent of U.S. households own Roth IRAs. Research
suggests that most of the money in those accounts came not from
newly inspired savers but from stock market gains and rollovers
from other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised at some of the questions I get about it,'' said
William J. Kring, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. ``There
is a lot of confusion out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Befuddlement is not the only reason Roths are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that many families are putting their retirement
dollars into the more attractive 401(k)s.
</P>
<P>
   That's because most employers match a portion of what their
employees put into the plans. ``Faced with a choice, they're
following the money,'' said Dallas Salisbury, president of the
Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Income limits separate other families from Roth accounts. At the
low end, there may not be enough money for investments. In a recent
survey, 23 percent of respondents told EBRI that they couldn't
afford to save. That was the most common reason.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, both traditional and Roth IRAs have income
ceilings that discourage or ban IRA contributions. To add to the
confusion, limits are different for traditional and Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   But for many other families, the blocks are emotional. They
arise from attitudes, not from legal restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth IRA doesn't offer an immediate tax break. ``That turns
them off,'' said Kring. ``Until someone explains it, they just
don't see the benefit. It's hard to understand the value of coming
out tax-free 30 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the major attractions of a Roth: When you
withdraw the money, you pay no income taxes at all. If your
investments have been compounding for several decades, the tax
break will be huge.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional IRAs do provide a deduction for your contribution.
But that benefit disappears if your income exceeds certain amounts.
</P>
<P>
   If you can get a deduction for a full contribution of $2,000,
you will save $560. That assumes the middle-class tax rate of 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether you would rather grab the $560 now or
take the Roth and escape taxes on a much larger amount later.
</P>
<P>
   People believe that Congress will realize how much money is
involved and cancel the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that five or 10 years from now they might say, `This
program is too expensive. Let's stop,' '' Kring said. ``I don't
believe they will roll back the benefits for people who have
already taken advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with traditional IRAs. The program is still
there, but income limits have made it less attractive to new
savers.
</P>
<P>
   People just don't understand Roth IRAs. ``As long as the law
stays as complicated as it is, which discourages advertising by
financial institutions and discourages understanding by consumers,
we're going to have relatively low utilization,'' Salisbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the IRS instruction booklet about IRAs is 84 pages long.
But the basics of Roth IRAs are fairly easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   You can contribute up to $2,000 a year as long as you have that
much in earned income and your income is below certain limits. If
you are married filing jointly, the ceiling is $160,000. If you are
close to that limit, check the details.
</P>
<P>
   You get no tax deduction now. But you owe no taxes later,
assuming you held the account for at least five years and you are
now at least 59 1/2 years old. There are loopholes, including
death, disability and first-home purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You are not required to start taking the money out after age 70
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Some families just haven't made the commitment to save.
</P>
<P>
   In the EBRI's survey, half the respondents who are not saving
for retirement said that they could save $20 a week , but they are
not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand the magic of compounding and how quickly
assets can grow if you just save consistently,'' said Salisbury.

<P>
   Roth investors have lower financial assets ($100,000 vs.
$150,000).
</P>
<P>
   But Roth investors have tucked away more of their assets in
their IRAs ($40,000 vs. $34,000).

solves a problem that couldn't be solved with existing furniture.

brother Frank and I were asleep on a couple of cots on my
grandparents' sleeping porch, sheets thrown back exposing our
scrawny little bodies, the fetid darkness of a Washington D.C.
summer night visible through the screened walls of the porch. We
spent every summer sleeping on a screen porch in those days, when
air conditioning was an exclusive feature of the movie theater
downtown, nowhere in evidence in our home or the homes of anyone we
knew. The sleeping porch was something we looked forward to, when
the heat and humidity would finally build to the point that the
cots would be dragged out and once again we'd be exposed to the
elements _ cooled, if only slightly, by an itinerant breeze, sung
to sleep by the insistent nighttime chatter of cicadas. By Lucian

GPS COLLARS: A NEW WAY TO TELL WHEN THE COWS COME HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By SHELLY FREIERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to capture the cowboy mystique, wealthy executives
from high-tech companies are grabbing up land in the Texas Hill
Country between San Antonio and Austin and stocking it with cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People buy plots on subdivided ranches, and where they should
have two cows they'll have 20, plus two horses, three or four sheep
and some chickens,'' said Dr. Lew Hunnicut, an assistant professor
of range and animal science at Southwest Texas State University in
San Marcos. ``It takes a minimum of 25 to 30 acres to support a cow
in Texas Hill Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicut is using global positioning system technology and
digitized mapping in a study designed to find out exactly where
cows will graze.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred acres of ranch land doesn't mean 200 acres of
grazable land, he explained. The brush a rancher sees on the range
may hide rocky ground or rich clay-based soil that is fine for
grazing. So clearing the brush over rocky ground doesn't make sense
because cattle won't walk over it to feed on prairie grasses.
</P>
<P>
   By analyzing grazing patterns, Hunnicut hopes to offer new
ranchers information on where to clear their land for cattle and
what to leave as habitat for wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   He and Dr. Bob Lyons, a range extension specialist at Texas A&AMP;M
University, have begun a research program that uses GPS-equipped
collars developed to track wild animals to pinpoint exactly where
on a 4,200-acre research ranch cattle are eating, chewing their cud
or resting.
</P>
<P>
   The GPS unit records longitude and latitude every 15 minutes.
The points of data showing a cow's position are downloaded and
overlaid onto two types of maps to interpret where the cows are
grazing. One is a map illustrating soil types, and the other, using
infared images taken from 20,000 feet, shows which part of the test
ranch has thick vegetation and which is rocky.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Hunnicut hopes to use maps like those generated in
the study as an education tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to convince someone not to use 40 percent of their
ranch for grazing,'' he said. ``A lot of Hill Country isn't good
for cows because of the rock and brush. The maps can help ranchers
visualize the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The GPS collars, which weigh about a pound, are made by Lotek
Wireless of Newmarket, Ontario. They are very rugged, designed for
use with wild animals like elephants, wildebeest, wolves, reindeer,
bears and mountain lions, said Leszek Meczarski, the product
manager for GPS items at Lotek.
</P>
<P>
   The units are waterproof and can withstand the shock of running
animals and being banged against rocks or trees, he said. The GPS
devices are one-size-fits-all, and they are fitted onto the various
animals using customized collars. Lotek even makes tiny GPS units
that are imbedded in fresh-water and saltwater fish for marine
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Each GPS collar in the cattle study, which costs about $5,000,
must be removed weekly to recharge the batteries and download the
data via a cable to a computer. The collars made for tracking wild
animals typically have a one-year battery life and a transmitter
for sending data to an overflying aircraft. They cost about $2,000
more. They also have a release mechanism that can be triggered with
a radio signal so the animals do not have to be captured to
retrieve their collars.
</P>
<P>
   The cow collar is a vast improvement over the traditional tool
for data collection in agricultural studies: graduate students.
``We could have used grad students to walk around and follow the
cows,'' Hunnicut said. The problem is that when cows see one of the
white pickup trucks from the school, they walk toward it hoping for
a treat (hay or food pellets with corn), thus changing their
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the collars, we can plot their movement without human
intervention,'' Hunnicut said.
</P>
<P>
   The study uses four collars, rotated among the cows so that the
grazing choices of the entire herd are reflected in the data.
Still, a graduate student leaves the pickup truck behind and goes
out on horseback twice a day to see if the collared cow is with the
herd or off by herself and to take notes on behavior to validate
the GPS data.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicut meets with cattle owners, environmentalists and new
landowners as part of the university's agricultural extension
program. Some of these newer ranchers eagerly attend so-called
master naturalist classes to learn how to care for their land, but
others will need convincing with cow grazing maps, spreadsheets and
charts.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle study study may help boutique ranchers, but Texas'
traditional ranchers already know what their cattle are doing and
where they will eat.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Kiker, an eighth-generation rancher in the Beaumont area
of southeast Texas, can rattle off the protein and nutritional
content of rice and grasses he plants in his pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Kiker, who interrupted his soybean planting and set his tractor
on idle to answer questions in a short interview by cell phone,
agreed with Hunnicut that the soil is the key: ``When you find a
spot that grows good grass you know it. I know where the cows eat
the most.''

<P>
   Scrolling the food wires the other day, I came across the
counterpart to this column that runs in The Miami Herald.
Coincidentally, the column I saw was about ``cookies in a jar'' _ a
subject we covered a couple of weeks back. The recipes, though,
were not the ones we had run. So, here are some bonus recipes from
Miami.

   And no, we don't mean a pedicure for your sandal-destined
tootsies.

<P>
   It's marinades _ seemingly an army of them _ marching across
grocery store shelves. Lawry's, KC Masterpiece, Paul Prudhomme and
Stubb's all have products to coat and tenderize food. Even
companies not known for barbecue or spices have entered the arena.
A.1. Steak Sauce and French's also have products in the category.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of factors'' driving the trend, says John
Barrows, director of communication for Nabisco, A.1.'s corporate
parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer want convenience, so we're giving them a marinade in
a ready-to-use format. It takes some of the guesswork out of making
their own,'' Barrows says.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our own part at A.1., we recognized that half of all
steaks consumed are marinated, but there was no marinade designed
especially for steaks on the market. Most are designed for poultry
and white meat. So it was natural for the No. 1 condiment in steak
to grow in the marinade direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco's research also revealed that consumers often reach for
a bottle of Italian salad dressing to douse their meat. So A.1. is
available in an Italian herb variety as well as a hickory flavor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using more acid in the formula, A.1. has
seriously punched up the herb content of its marinade _ the bottle
is almost green with seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers who make their own steak marinades use a hefty
splash of Worcestershire sauce. Because French's produces
Worcestershire sauce, the company went in a different direction
with its Grill &AMP; Glaze line designed for chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Bender, spokesperson for French's Grill &AMP; Glaze, says a
lot of what drove the formulation was chicken consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken consumption has jumped from 60-some pounds per person
a year to about 80 pounds per person a year,'' Bender says. ``None
of the marinades on the market were geared specifically to chicken.
We used a plastic squeeze bottle for convenience and because it's
familiar to consumers because of our mustard.''
</P>
<P>
   French's has pumped up its convenience factor by giving
consumers the option of not marinating, but simply brushing the
product onto chicken. Or, if the cook has an extra 20 minutes,
using Grill &AMP; Glaze for marinating and basting.
</P>
<P>
   Lawry's, known for years for its Seasoned Salt and dry flavoring
pouch mixes, was the first big boy to produce bottled marinades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted something that could flavor a lot of things, not
just proteins, which we had covered,'' says Vicki Gagliano,
consumer test-kitchen manager for Lawry's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use fruit juices in our marinades, which gives big, bold,
robust flavors without being heavy like barbecue sauces. And
because there's no fat, that appeals to people, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use our marinades on vegetables, say one of those big
portobello mushrooms, and eat it like a burger. That appeals to a
lot of the younger people who are steering away from meat.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottled marinade category is so new, despite the plethora of
products, that even the industry association, the Association for
Dressings and Sauces, doesn't have tracking numbers. However, the
latest A.C. Nielsen tracking numbers, according to Lawry's, show
that the marinade category has grown 98 percent over last year's
same-period sales.

<P>
   Some of the varieties you'll find in area stores and what each
goes best on.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Brand: KC Masterpiece, a big name in barbecue sauce
</P>
<P>
   Varieties: Honey Teriyaki, Original BBQ
</P>
<P>
   Recommended for: Meat, seafood, chicken
</P>
<P>
   Price: $2.89 for 16 ounces
</P>
<P>
   What we thought: Very thick marinades seem almost to ``enrobe''
the food instead of seeping into it. We find the BBQ flavor
redundant _ why not use barbecue sauce?

   Recommended for: Meat, seafood, chicken
</P>
<P>
   Price: $1.99 for 12 ounces
</P>
<P>
   What we thought: Nice and hot; good thin consistency; a little
goes a long way; best on ``big'' food like beef, lamb and pork
chops.

</P>
<P>
   What we thought: This was one of the first mass-marketed bottled
marinades. We liked it when it was introduced a couple of years
ago, and we still like it. This year's new citrus flavors are kicky

KEEPING CHAT ROOMS LIVELY AND HUCKSTER-FREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By SALLY McGRANE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you make sure that Ringer and Joanna get to discuss the
worst episodes of the television series ``Charmed'' without getting
spammed by trolls _ hatemongers, teen-agers spouting profanity,
pornography hucksters and the just plain rude? At Mighty Big TV, a
Web site that dishes up sarcastic recaps of television shows, as
with many Internet forums, the job of keeping online debate
coherent and spam-free falls to discussion board moderators.
</P>
<P>
   In the online world, portals, Internet service providers,
consumer goods companies, sports teams and sites dedicated to
everything under the sun have areas where people can exchange
ideas. According to Jupiter Communications, an Internet market
research firm, more than half of all major sites use some sort of
chat function. Discussion boards, where people post thoughts on a
particular topic or question in long-running conversations that can
span hours, days or weeks, are a popular conversation-enabling
format (others include real-time chat rooms and private or
semiprivate club rooms).
</P>
<P>
   The job of a discussion board moderator falls somewhere between
virtual playground monitor and online cocktail party host.
Moderators have to prevent abusive, anonymous writers from using
the boards as graffiti walls and make sure that, say, vendors of
teeth-whitening toothpaste don't use discussions to promote their
product.
</P>
<P>
   Moderators also deal with subtler challenges: they try to ensure
that people posting messages have interesting conversations. They
have to smooth ruffled feathers when one person offends another.
They have to urge the overzealous to tone it down without killing
the conversation. And they have to remind people to use spell
check.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bunting and Tara Ariano founded Mighty Big TV
(www.mightybigtv.com) last September, after meeting on another
discussion board. (They worked on the site for more than a year
before meeting in person). At Mighty Big TV's ``talk back'' forums,
visitors can discuss things like Ally McBeal's hair (there is a
forum topic called Hairiffic) and weigh in on their least favorite
participant on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunting and Ariano read every posting on the site _ about 300 a
day. ``We have pretty strict rules of engagement, in terms of what
we allow to be posted,'' Bunting said. ``You can't attack someone
ad hominem, we don't allow too much cursing, and anyone espousing a
bigoted viewpoint is booted. There's zero tolerance for hate
speech.'' When they decide to boot someone, Bunting and Ariano use
software that erases all messages by the offender.
</P>
<P>
   People sending hate messages ``aren't told they're being booted,
they're just booted,'' said Ariano. On the other hand, ``if there's
a user who's annoying the regulars, we might send an e-mail _
`please check spelling, don't attack the old guard.' People usually
settle down. The regulars correct the newbies, and it's usually not
something where we have to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Big TV has a core of 150 to 200 people who keep the site
on their screens all day, Bunting said.
</P>
<P>
   Ariano makes no bones about what it takes to keep the
conversation on a discussion board at a desirable level. ``You have
to be actively elitist,'' she said. ``In a room in the real world,
you can control who comes in. On the Internet, anyone can wander
in, and if you let someone who has nothing interesting to say stick
around, they get comfortable, and they never get any smarter. If
someone comes in and says, ` 'N Sync Rules,' then forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Mighty Big TV has successful message boards, Ariano
said, is that the community members know that there are people
actually running it. ``It's not a faceless entity,'' she said.
``Sites with no moderators have no conversations. In our case,
people know who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, sometimes even moderators have to take time
off, and when they do, trouble can start. Bunting recalled a time
when both moderators were on vacation, and someone with an obscene
handle, or online name, signed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``So little Mr. Puerile started spamming the site with lurid and
not particularly anatomically accurate things he was going to do,''
Bunting said. ``But the regulars flamed him and ignored him.'' When
the moderators returned from vacation, they deleted his posts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Williams moderates the Table Talk discussion boards
for Salon.com, the online magazine. She said the site was designed
to encourage discussion board participants to read all the other
posts on a particular board before they join the discussion. ``As a
host, I go into conversations and if I see something interesting, I
try to be really responsive,'' she said. ``I find positive
reinforcement works better than negative reinforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussion boards develop into strong communities, and fostering
this community is part of Williams' job. ``We've had a lot of
people go through really major stuff in their lives, and they get
through it with the help of people on Table Talk,'' she said.
Moderating, she said, is ``not just a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are real people with real feelings,'' she added. ``It's
not just a case of `did somebody say a bad word,' but an issue of
the subtleties of what people are feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also sometimes has to deal with people who become
obsessed and spend inordinate amounts of time on the discussion
board. ``Sometimes I send an e-mail saying gently, `Maybe you
should try turning off your computer for a few hours,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At eDiets, an online weight-loss site where members pay monthly
fees and can turn to one of 36 discussion boards for advice and
support, Shelly Waltman, manager of community services, said she
and her staff sometimes join the discussion groups under other
names to encourage discussion or response to members' questions.
``Basically, one of the jobs of the moderators is that if someone
is posting and asking for a reply, they answer,'' Waltman said,
``so that everyone has at least one response. I will sometimes go
in under another name to write encouraging notes to people, but 95
percent of the time we're doing it under our own names.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeding discussion using other names can lead to trouble,
though. Karen Ahn, who writes Mighty Big TV's wrap-up of MTV's
``Real World'' and moderates the discussion boards pertaining to
the show, used to be a moderator at another Web site. Part of her
job was to go into the site's discussion area secretly, using a
fake name, and start conversations. Another moderator once
approached her alternate identity and asked if she wanted a job _
as a moderator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get that `ignore the man behind the curtain,' Wizard
of Oz feeling,'' Ahn said. ``By the end I was putting in weird
acronyms that would spell out nasty things. I was so aggrieved at
having to post messages that I knew couldn't spark any genuine
dialogue, since I wasn't a `genuine' community member _ I was being
paid to post! It all seemed so cynical and ultimately
self-defeating.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in which a corporate employee moderates a
discussion board can eate an odd power dynamic, she added. ``You
elect yourself lord-mayor. These people didn't know me, they didn't
elect me to monitor their discussion _ it was just because I was a
salaried employee that I had control.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderators point out that a key difference between the online
world and the offline world is that online there are no facial or
verbal cues. ``There have been times when I've said something I
considered light-hearted and it's been taken the wrong way,''
Williams said. Sometimes, without face-to-face interaction to keep
people in check, tempers can flare. Then it is the job of the
moderator to calm things down. Waltman gave an example from the
eDiets site: ``When people type in capital letters it really gets
to some people. We have to go in there and say, `Are we really here
to discuss capital letters?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bunting said the moderators' power can be seductive. ``You have
to be willing to incur the wrath of the users,'' she said. ``But
you also have to rise above the pettiness. You can't get in that
last dig and then close the thread.''

A PLACE TO PEEK INTO LOST LUGGAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time I was waiting for my luggage at the airport, I saw
a cracked leather valise stuffed so full that it might have
actually encased a live pig. The frenzied way someone had wrapped
twine around the bulging case suggested a disturbing record of
attempted escapes.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as the valise traveled around the baggage carousel, I
changed my mind. It must have contained something more valuable:
Otherwise why bother with those additional strips of electrical
tape across the locks? After all the other suitcases had been
claimed, I decided that it must have belonged to a smuggler
apprehended at the gate before he could reclaim his uncut diamonds.
Or ivory tusks. Or unpasteurized French cheese.
</P>
<P>
   I am fascinated by the mystery of other people's luggage,
especially their unclaimed luggage. The glamour tends to fade if
the owner shows up and turns out to be the same man who sat a row
ahead in economy and begged the flight attendant for extra salted
nuts. But luggage that is never reunited with its owner always
contains the thrill of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   So when I learned last week about an online shopping site called
Unclaimedbaggage.com, where you can actually buy the contents of
unclaimed suitcases, there was no way I could resist
(www.unclaimedbaggage.com). This was something far more tantalizing
than the usual discards at a garage sale or thrift store. Here was
a rare legal opportunity to riffle through personal items that
still had value to their owners at the time they were separated by
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an archaeological dig in the sense that you see a
cross-section of the culture when you open up suitcases: the kinds
of clothes people are wearing, the books they're reading, the
keepsakes they bought on vacation,'' said Bryan Owens, the owner of
the Unclaimed Baggage Center, which operates both the Web site and
a block-long retail store in the Appalachian foothills of
Scottsboro, Ala. `We've been doing this for 30 years, and we have
long-term, exclusive contracts with many of the major carriers.
It's anything you could imagine, although certain things we don't
sell. We have an agreement with the FDA to destroy prescription
drugs, for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   Recovering from my disappointment over the prescription drugs, I
went to the site's Click on the Suitcase feature to learn about
some of the more unusual items that Unclaimed Baggage has collected
over the years. The list included two that had once concealed rolls
of money: a Barbie doll (luckily the buyer's daughter pulled off
the head by accident, revealing $500 inside the torso) and a
``perfectly ordinary soap on a rope'' that had been hollowed out. I
was ready to buy. Judging from the home page, which announced
``lost treasures from around the world,'' Owens is familiar with
the psychology of shoppers like me. The site asked: ``What do you
imagine a wealthy retired couple might have packed to go to Hawaii?
An expensive camera?'' What would the finely tailored corporate
executive flying back from Moscow have had in his suitcases? An
elegant cashmere top coat? Gold cuff links?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, I thought. That's exactly what I would expect!
Forgetting for the moment that most suitcases are more likely to
harbor items that fall into less savory categories _ like hair
care, underwear and tweezers _ I eagerly clicked on Let's Shop. I
arrived at 40 categories of merchandise, from Cigars to Jewelry to
Women's Closet, in which a total of 344 different items were
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody's used cigars? That brought me up short for the same
reasons that are causing goose bumps on your arms right now.
</P>
<P>
   But when I examined the nine items for sale in that category,
they didn't look used at all. In fact, they were all new: an
unopened five-pack of Muriel Air Tip regulars for $1, a new
portable pouch called the Humi to keep cigars fresh for $3, a
package of pipe filters for $1.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Owens, he acknowledged that most of the items
online were new and in fact came from unclaimed shipments of cargo,
things like unworn bedroom slippers, brand-new baby bottles and
unused film that had been lost in transit. Nothing from that finely
tailored corporate executive after all, no suits in the women's
closet section and certainly no used Barbies or rope soaps.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said he thought that it would be unfair to sell online
shoppers many used items because it was difficult to examine them
closely enough online to determine if they met standards of
cleanliness. The FAQ section on the site did pose the pertinent
question ``Is it clean?'' (Answer: the store launders or dry-cleans
all applicable articles of clothing.) So while the Internet site
does sell some mysteries _ like the 40.95-carat emerald offered for
$14,750, which would easily enable you to meet the $25 minimum for
Internet purchases _ most of the online offerings betrayed no hint
of their owner's personality.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I decided that the online site was not really a
place to shop, but more like one of those mystery bags with a
question mark stamped on it that you used to get from a vending
machine after you paid 50 cents to take a chance on finding
treasure. It was a lot of fun, though, to click on the Peek in the
Bag feature and see the receipt from a recent purchase: ``Kenneth
Cole women's shoes $59.40, novelty birthday candles $1, lefty
scissors three at 25 cents each.''
</P>
<P>
   No pigs, though.

 SURVIVING `SURVIVOR': Lawyer Voted Off Hit TV Show Lives to
Tell  of It  
 By JONATHAN CURIEL  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ She ate three yellow, wiggling bug larvae for
the sake of her group. She endured the enmity and contempt of a man
old enough to be her grandfather. And in the end _ on national
television, before an audience of 23 million _ Stacey Stillman was
rejected by people she considered her friends.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, Stillman's ups and downs were captured on the
hit CBS reality series ``Survivor,'' until last week, when the San
Francisco lawyer was shown being voted off Pulau Tiga, an island in
the South China Sea off the coast of Borneo. Gone was Stillman's
chance to win $1 million. In its place: a $4,500 consolation prize
from CBS and an opportunity to explain what went wrong on a program
that has 10 episodes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was OK with being voted off,'' Stillman says in an interview
at a San Francisco coffeehouse. ``That's the game. ... And getting
a free trip to Borneo and to have the experience _ it's worth going
through all this on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   By her own admission, Stillman often came across on ``Survivor''
as uptight and spoiled. CBS producers focused on her trying
moments, editing out scenes where she laughed and joked with
members of her ``Tiga Tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Stillman, 27, accepts being stereotyped, even though it means
she is getting hateful e-mail messages from viewers. One person
said she was ``worse than Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly OK with the way they're representing me as the
sort of Heather Locklear-`Melrose Place' bitch,'' Stillman says.
``What did I expect? I knew they cast me as the lawyer. So they
were totally playing in to the stereotype.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest volume of e-mails, she says, has come from friends
of Rudy Boesch, the retired 72-year-old Navy SEAL from Virginia
with whom Stillman clashed on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're calling me a brat and saying, `How dare I say things
about their buddy, the SEAL,' '' she says. ``I'm just, `Grow up. He
signed up for this show and that's the way it is. And he said worse
things about me than I said about him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On the second show, a tired and hungry Stillman told the CBS
cameras that Boesch was a ``liability to us. We've all seen him
eating extra food. He's opening goods without asking anybody.'' On
that same show, Boesch said, ``Me and her wouldn't get along if we
were friends on the outside. She's too prim.'' The next week,
Boesch led the majority of Tagi Tribe members who forced Stillman
off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hawk, the 38-year-old truck driver from Wisconsin who
became the ``matriarch'' of the Tagi Tribe, also voted Stillman off
the island _ a betrayal that still seems to rankle Stillman. At one
point during the series, which was filmed from March 13 through
April 20, Hawk told Stillman that she wouldn't vote against her. On
the second episode, Stillman even won an ``immunity challenge'' for
her tribe by eating beetle larvae faster than a member of the rival
``Pagong Tribe'' _ a feat that she thought would earn her greater
respect and allegiance from Hawk and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an element of purposeful deception'' with Hawk,
Stillman says. ``But I also think Sue really believes she is not
doing anything untoward toward anybody. She changes her mind a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stillman won't say what happens next in the series, which has a
Web site (www.cbs.com/survivor) &LR;   &LR; that profiles all the
contestants &LR; , &LR;  and details each episode after it airs.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 16 contestants signed a $5 million gag order, which
means that they have to pay the network $5 million if they
prematurely reveal who gets kicked off the island or who wins the
big prize. Stillman's close friends have tried to coax information
out of her, even plying her with booze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get her liquored up and tell us,'' says Zack
Bodner, a friend of Stillman's who watched the first show with her.
</P>
<P>
   While Stillman admits that ``I was a little more candid about my
fellow castaways in their presence than I have been in the media,''
she hasn't broken the gag order. Even her mother didn't know that
Stillman was going to be voted off at the climax of last
Wednesday's airing. ``The whole show hinges on what happens next,''
Stillman says. ``The (gag order) is totally understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Pulau Tiga, Stillman stayed in that part of the
world for five weeks, committed to keeping her early exit a secret
from her colleagues at work. (Stillman's firm gave her a seven-week
leave to participate in the show.)
</P>
<P>
   Stillman traveled around Borneo and Thailand _ mostly by herself
_ and got her diving certificate on Sipadan island in Malaysia, at
a resort that made international headlines two weeks later because
of a terrorist attack. Muslim rebels kidnapped 21 people at the
resort, including diving instructors Stillman knew. ``I feel
terrible about it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman has been back at work for almost two months. She says
her appearance on ``Survivor'' has helped her law career, giving
her a higher profile at her firm, where she works in the business
and technology division helping companies incorporate, merge and
acquire other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know who I am now,'' Stillman says. ``In a large firm,
it's really who you know and what connections you make. And word
gets passed down informally.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds that people at work have been ``in total support of me
and think this is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Media attention has also cascaded on Stillman in the past week,
which has included appearances on CBS' ``Late Show With David
Letterman'' and ``The Late, Late Show With Craig Kilborn,'' where
she met her childhood idol, actor Rick Schroder (``he knew who I
was!'').
</P>
<P>
   She also has been recognized on the streets of San Francisco.
During a break in the interview, when Stillman put quarters in a
parking meter, several people pointed at her. ``They said, `That's
the chick from ``Survivor,'' ' '' Stillman says. ``I just turned
around and said, `Hi.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Other castaways can't talk frankly about their experiences until
their fates are resolved on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky,'' Stillman says. ``I know a lot of them are
frustrated because they can't talk yet. ... There will come a time
when Sue and Rudy have their say about me, which is why I'm trying
to temper my remarks about them. I really don't have anything
personal against them.''

ROCKS, NOT BULLETS, NOW FLY ACROSS THE ISRAEL-LEBANON BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel _ Armed with a slingshot, a walkie-talkie and a
pistol tucked into his pants, a Hezbollah guerrilla across the
fence in Lebanon let another stone fly Wednesday toward a
mesh-covered Israeli army post on the outskirts of this northern
border community.
</P>
<P>
   What had once been a frontier lookout point for Israeli visitors
was closed off with coils of barbed wire. The ground was strewn
with rubble heaved in recent weeks from the Lebanese side, where
burnt out buildings and barriers in an abandoned Israeli base were
covered with with anti-Israeli graffiti and posters for Hezbollah,
or the Party of God.
</P>
<P>
   Rocks regularly sail over the fence these days at Israeli
farmers from Metulla who work in apple orchards that stretch to the
border. Vehicles have been hit and irrigation systems smashed,
disrupting work in recent weeks, although no one has been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers patrolling the border are under strict orders
not to fire unless they are fired upon, and it has been only
stones, not bullets, that have crossed the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a month after Israel withdrew its troops from southern
Lebanon, the frontier between the countries remains free of gunfire
but unsettled. The line of Israeli withdrawal, certified by the
United Nations but disputed in some points by Lebanon, is still
being checked by U.N. teams. In the meantime, Hezbollah guerrillas,
not Lebanese or U.N. soldiers, face the Israelis along the
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all our land is not liberated we will continue fighting,
and we want our prisoners released,'' one warned near the border
fence Wednesday, echoing the pledge of his movement's leader, Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is visiting the Middle
East, was in Israel Wednesday to try to iron out the reported
violations of the withdrawal line, and after meeting him, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said he expected the matter to be settled in 24
to 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who met Nasrallah in Lebanon on Tuesday, noted the
``restraint, responsibility and discipline'' of Hezbollah, which
has not fired across the border since the Israeli withdrawal, and
he asserted that U.N. peacekeepers would be posted on the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will move the troops to the border,'' he said, adding that
Lebanese officials had indicated to him that they, too, would soon
send their troops to southern Lebanon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the meantime, life in Metulla is ``anything but routine,''
said Herzl Boker, the local council's security officer. Farmers
take roundabout routes to their orchards and work in the early
morning to avoid the stone-throwing, but are often are forced to
leave, he said. Recently, he added, the army discovered an
attempted entry through the fence, but the intruders fled back to
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one to talk to right now on the other side,'' Boker
said. ``The minute the Lebanese army and the United Nations arrive
and take control, it will be possible to stop the vandalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Avi Rauner, who has apple and pear orchards near the border
fence, said he had cut back his work there to avoid the daily
shower of stones. Yet compared to the warfare that used to rage
across the border between Hezbollah and the Israeli army, ``the
situation is quiet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected that when the army left Lebanon, Hezbollah would
take over and that mobs would loot what was left behind,'' he said.
``But in a few weeks, U.N. and Lebanese forces will come. This is
only temporary.''

RICHTER LEAVES, AND SIDEKICKERY GOES WITH HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By JAMES BARRON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is the day after his last appearance on ``Late
Night With Conan O'Brien'' _ a day that a more predictable type
might describe as ``the first day of the rest of my life.'' Nothing
so shopworn comes from Andy Richter. He takes stock in his own way,
doing a kind of ``In the Year 2000'' routine about where he is and
where he is going (but without the flashlight under his chin or the
squeaky falsetto refrain).
</P>
<P>
   ``For Conan,'' he says in the vaguely Midwestern voice that
launched a thousand ad-libs in the night, ``the show was a dream
come true. I was more of a hired gun. I was never going to be it.
I've done this every day in front of a live audience for seven
years. Now I'd like to go off into the woods with a camera, fake
beards, armor, Roman centurions and Elizabethan hoop skirts, talk
in accents, do 20 takes, edit it for a week and watch it without a
laugh track.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of postmidnight shenanigans, Richter has given
up his place as the trusty No. 2 on ``Late Night'' to go it alone
and concentrate on his acting career. But breaking out of the
``Late Night'' orbit has not lofted him beyond supporting-player
status _ not yet, anyway. In his first post-``Late Night'' role, he
is once again playing somebody's buddy: Richard Gere's hunting
companion in the Robert Altman film ``Dr. T. and the Women''
(which, for the record, has no fake beards, armor, Roman centurions
or Elizabethan hoop skirts). He will also appear, again in a
supporting role, in a new movie starring Chris Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Richter has been gone only a few weeks, but already couch
potatoes miss him. He was the last of the old-fashioned sidekicks,
and for now, anyway, there are no plans to replace him on ``Late
Night.'' And virtually no other show has a guy in a suit whose main
responsibilities are to serve as the host's Greek chorus and to
slide over when the guests start arriving. His fans say he
single-handedly redefined what was once a television staple: the
role of the sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob had Howdy Doody, after all, and Dave Garroway had a
chimpanzee. As television's evolution continued, the sidekicks
became human. Groucho Marx had George Fenneman on the quiz show
``You Bet Your Life.'' Late at night, Jack Paar had Hugh Downs in
the 1950s, Joey Bishop had Regis Philbin in the 1960s, and Johnny
Carson, of course, had the grand master of second bananas, Ed
McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed McMahon made Tonto look like a three-dimensional
character,'' said Robert J. Thompson, professor of film and
television at Syracuse University. ``He was there to reflect the
glory of Johnny. You get into this ironic age, where Letterman and
Conan are so self-conscious of these kinds of formats, and the
sidekick takes on a very different air.''
</P>
<P>
   Letterman chose not to have a sidekick in the traditional sense.
He banters with his bandleader, Paul Shaffer, but Shaffer is more
of a foil than a sidekick. O'Brien has a bandleader, too _ Max
Weinberg, who is perhaps better known as Bruce Springsteen's
drummer. But it was left to Richter to reinterpret the sidekick's
place, doing the Ed McMahon job while simultaneously making fun of
it.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a kind of comedic Siamese twinning, a dialogue
between near-equals rather than the relationship of omnipotent host
and fawning subordinate that Carson and McMahon perfected (though
it must be noted that Richter always lost the staring contests with
O'Brien). ``It was so much less planned than anyone knows,''
Richter said. ``Our rhythms were good together. We'd been doing
bits around the office, just impromptu bits'' before the program
went on the air. From their off-camera improvisation, Richter
understood how they could work together: ``He's trilling, I'm the
bass note.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sidekick was not a role he had been looking for _ he had
joined the program expecting to do comedy sketches, not sit at the
right hand of O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they started out, nobody knew what to do with this guy
Andy,'' Thompson said. ``He wasn't your typical sidekick. He was
heavier back then, and Conan was like mainstream entertainment's
sidekick already _ never been on a show, been to Harvard, came out
of left field, the kind you always expect to work as a supporting
character but not be the guy in and of himself. Andy seemed to be
coming from the planet Pluto for a while. It took a long time for
people to get used to him. In the core demographic for Conan, which
is college students, the anti-Andy sentiment was very, very strong
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, some NBC executives were also anti-Andy in the
program's rocky first couple of seasons, though Richter credits
O'Brien and the show's producers with not telling him that his
perch next to O'Brien was precarious. Good thing, too. ``It was
asthough Andy was inventing himself as he went along,'' Thompson
said, ``and by the time he left, he was one of the big appeals.
Many college students were more likely to send a fan letter to Andy
than to Conan.'' No less an authority on hipness than Janeane
Garofalo told Entertainment Weekly magazine last month that ``his
appeal is off the charts.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin, too, sounded like a true fan. ``He may be the last
official sidekick,'' he said of Richter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The role has changed considerably since I did that,'' Philbin
said. ``Now they're more a part of the show than just a prompter.
In those days, you were there to make the host look good and that
was the job, take it or leave it. I would come out in the opening
segment and prompt Joey Bishop with my own observations about
things, knowing that he would have a punch line. He was a great
counterpuncher and that was what he wanted me to do, and I did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter, Philbin said, ``had more to do than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most important element of Richter's job description was
the same _ and it was paramount for McMahon as well. ``I understood
that my job was to support Johnny Carson,'' he wrote in his
autobiography, ``For Laughing Out Loud'' (Warner, 1998). ``I didn't
tell the jokes, I set up the jokes. I didn't get the laughs, I
helped him get the laughs. Johnny and I never discussed this; we
didn't have to. We were smart enough to see how well our
relationship worked.'' McMahon said he had to undergo on-the-air
behavior modification to preserve that relationship. ``At times I
had to consciously stop myself from responding to something he
said,'' McMahon wrote. Before he went on the air with Carson, ``I'd
always had my own shows, I'd always been free to say whatever
popped into my mind. But after a few weeks I had slipped quite
comfortably into the role of straight man, his second banana.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Downs had played a similar role when Jack Paar was the host
on ``Tonight,'' but like Richter on ``Late Night,'' he found
himself caught up in a relationship that was evolving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as an announcer's job,'' Downs said. ``I started
out just saying, `Here's Jack Paar.' In fact, I think at first I
was only heard. Then I think they put a camera on me turning it
over to him. Then he took to calling me over to the desk. Then the
format was established: when he brought the first guest out, I'd
move over to the sofa. He felt insecure and wanted me there by him
and would ask me questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Downs had another responsibility besides making the host feel
comfortable, one that was never in Richter's portfolio: in his day,
announcers did the commercials, live. There were no breaks while
the commercials rolled, leaving the band to perform for the studio
audience and the host to light up a cigar, as Letterman often did
before his heart surgery. Unintentionally, the commercials often
became funnier than anyone had bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, I was standing, waiting to do this commercial,'' Downs
said. ``I was going to demonstrate this can opener. I had a number
of tin cans. Katharine Murray was on. Paar complimented her. Paar
said to her, she had a good figure. She said, `Destiny has shaped
my end.' Paar threw it to me and I went into the commercial, which
began, `No matter what size or shape can you have, the Reliance can
opener can handle it.' I got about that far and I was finished.
</P>
<P>
   As for Richter, having reinvented the sidekick's role and stayed
with ``Late Night'' until it established itself as popular and
profitable, why step aside?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any real plan as to how long I would be on the
show,'' Richter said. ``If you'd asked when we started, I would
probably have said, `I can see about seven years,' and that's
exactly what we've done. It's not just the form. There are other
things _ it became a cumulative effect: I became tired of doing a
show every day. There's this pressure where you never feel you've
done any one item justice because there's this
slap-it-together-and-get-it-out-the-door feeling to the work.
That's the way it was: Did we say all the lines right? Did the
camera get the shot of the parrot? Yeah? OK, we're done, on to the
next thing. Could we do it any better? It's pretty slapdash when
you're working so hard and putting out so much.''
</P>
<P>
   So why not simply take a sabbatical? ``Yeah,'' Richter sighed.
``People have said to me, `Why don't you take leaves of absence
like Max Weinberg does?' Springsteen's tour is pretty reliable in
terms of the dates and when it's going to happen. But if you get
hired for a movie and they say, `We need you for two weeks,' that
can stretch to five weeks just with the natural flow of shooting
the film. I can't say I'm going to be gone next month and when the
month's ending, say: `They're going to need me another week and a
half. The show you were writing for two guys, you've got to scrap
that.' It would make the writers write two different shows. I
couldn't do that.''

CUTTING THE BACH CHOIR DOWN TO SIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On this 250th anniversary of the death of Bach or in any other
year, there can be few musicological questions more pressing than
that of how the composer's music sounded when it was being
performed for the first time, week after week, under his direction
in St. Thomas' Church in Leipzig, Germany. Light is now being shed
on this subject by one of the leading practitioners of early music,
the English conductor Andrew Parrott, in performances, recordings
and a book, ``The Essential Bach Choir'' (University of Rochester
Press).
</P>
<P>
   Parrott takes up the story from the American scholar Joshua
Rifkin, who, nearly 20 years ago, caused a stir in the world of
early music by suggesting that Bach's B minor Mass, ``St. Matthew
Passion'' and cantatas were not the choral masterpieces everybody
had always taken them to be. They were still masterpieces, for
sure. What Rifkin was doubting was that they were intended to be
choral music as listeners then knew it.
</P>
<P>
   In Rifkin's view, what Bach meant by ``chorus'' was not a throng
of enthusiastic singers but rather a set of soloists. Since Bach's
choral movements generally have four vocal parts _ soprano, alto,
tenor and bass _ just four singers would be required to perform
them. In works that have two choirs, the number would be eight.
</P>
<P>
   This notion that the ``St. Matthew Passion,'' for instance,
might be sung by just eight singers was revolutionary when Rifkin
broached it at a conference in Boston in 1981, and the controversy
has rumbled on. Parrott, in his book, is out to end it. He includes
Rifkin's paper _ which, astonishingly, has never been published
complete before _ and adds the evidence of his own exhaustive
research to present a strong and fascinating case.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott's argument rests principally on the primary evidence:
the performance materials surviving from Bach's musical household,
produced by the composer's numerous offspring and equally numerous
apprentices. These young people had to copy, from Bach's score, the
parts that the instrumentalists and singers would need to read as
they played and sang. And it turns out that in virtually every
case, only one part exists for each line in a choir.
</P>
<P>
   If one wants to imagine that more than four singers were
involved _ or eight in works for double choir _ then one has to see
these singers as clustered together, perhaps three of them reading
from one part. This setup is unlikely, according to Parrott,
because the parts that Bach's children and assistants wrote out do
not consistently indicate changes from choral sections to solos, in
which the presumed second and third singers would have had to stop
singing. One might add that the parts, several of which are
reproduced in Parrott's book, appear too casual, fine and detailed
to have been read by more than one person.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting evidence includes pictorial representations of
musical performance from Bach's time, none of them showing singers
(or instrumentalists, for that matter) sharing copies. Parrott also
cites references to choral singing in various documents, most of
which suggest that choirs in Baroque Germany generally had one
singer for each part or, at most, two.
</P>
<P>
   But the most crucial document of all is one that comes to us
from the hand of Bach himself, the memorandum he lodged with the
Leipzig Town Council in 1730: what he called a ``brief yet highly
necessary outline of a properly constituted church musical
establishment, with some sober reflections on the decline of the
same.'' This, too, Parrott incorporates in his book complete, in
the original German and in translation.
</P>
<P>
   As director of music at St. Thomas' School, Bach was responsible
for the choirs of four Leipzig churches, and three of those choirs
had to be musically proficient, the fourth singing only chorales.
Each choir, he stipulates, ``must have at least three sopranos,
three altos, three tenors and as many basses.'' Four would be
better. But as he immediately explains, this was to provide for
illness: a common occurrence, ``as the prescriptions written by the
school doctor for the apothecary must show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bach was thus asking the city to provide for choirs of 12
singers (16 in his dreams), but only so that, barring epidemics,
there would always be enough to perform works with eight vocal
parts. What is not clear _ since Bach was writing for the
councilors of Leipzig, not for musicians nearly 300 years later _
is whether he would have expected all 12 singers to perform a piece
with four parts (the standard for the Sunday cantatas) at times
when the apothecary was not so busy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as he miserably concludes, he did not have that luxury.
In 1730, when he was writing, only 17 singers under his
jurisdiction were musically able, so the school could hardly have
done more than send a choir of four to each of the three churches
where elaborate music was performed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no reason for professional musicians now to
be constrained by the deteriorated conditions of musical Leipzig in
1730, and Parrott risks putting the music on a fast to imitate what
Bach considered starvation. The evidence of the parts and of other
contemporary documents, written and pictorial, is not entirely
conclusive: the pictures are too few; the documents (like Bach's
statement) had their own purposes. And it seems plausible that if
Bach had had what he wanted _ choirs of 12 or even 16 _ he would
have wanted everybody to sing, even in a four-part composition.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the important support for musical choices must come
not from the archives but from the sound. And the sound of
Parrott's performances _ here recently with the New York Collegium,
and on a Sony Classical CD with his own Taverner Consort and
Players in the ``Trauer-Ode'' and two motets _ is compelling proof
that his ideas work.
</P>
<P>
   Choirs of soloists balance and blend beautifully with a
period-style chamber orchestra. They sound well, even in a
relatively large church. Phrasing and texture can be lighter, the
effect, as Eric Van Tassel puts it in his liner notes for the
recording, ``more personal and, in a way, more human.''
</P>
<P>
   And at one point in the ``Trauer-Ode,'' as recorded here, the
advantage of the four-person choir becomes startling. The tenor
sings a short recitative, then he alone _ not clumped into a
faceless group _ leads his companions into the ensuing chorus. More
than all the arguments, the moment makes the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that Parrott, in his book, should appeal not
to such musical value but instead to a merely reproductive
correctness, writing that his is ``the mode of performance which
... best reflects Bach's own practice.'' For one thing, if that
were to be the criterion, then Bach choirs would have to be all
male.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his reforming zeal is understandable. If, as he points
out, the great quartets of Haydn and Beethoven had always been
performed by string orchestras, performances by just four players
would be revelatory. So is his gentle, touching and musicianly
Bach.
</P>
<P>
   This is, to be sure, not the only way. Other conductors will go
on using choirs on the scale Bach might have hoped for, rather than
of the size he had. Most important of all, choirs of schools,
churches and amateur societies, through which most of us came to
feel the glory of Bach for the first time, will go on performing
the ``St. Matthew Passion'' with crowds of singers, the more the
merrier.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott, though, is vindicating a real alternative.
</P>

 SPY SOFTWARE PUTS HOME PCs UNDER SURVEILLANCE  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers are digital, and in their world everything is either
on or off, one or zero, black or white. Real life is analog, with
varying degrees of good and bad, right and wrong, and shades of
gray. If our world were binary, it would make it much easier to
condemn programs like Spector and eBlaster.
</P>
<P>
   Spector, a $49.95 Windows program from SpectorSoft
(www.spectorsoft.com), is snoopware. It's the computer equivalent
of a VCR that secretly records everything that shows up on a
computer screen _ every piece of e-mail, every Web page, every
instant message, every program and file opened, every keystroke and
every password or credit card number.
</P>
<P>
   Many people entrust their most intimate and sensitive
information to their computers. So snoopware makes possible the
computer equivalent of reading other people's private diaries,
opening their mail, going through their garbage, scanning their
bank statements and portfolios, cracking their safes, tapping their
phones and peeping through their windows, all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Spy software has been around for years, but until recently it
was complicated and expensive. It has been used primarily by
government and law enforcement agencies and large corporations.
Spector, eBlaster and similar programs, like Cyber Snoop and the
007 Stealth Activity Recorder and Reporter, are now being marketed
directly to consumers, and their easy availability and low cost has
profound implications for personal privacy.
</P>
<P>
   SpectorSoft, the company that created Spector, said the software
had originally been designed to allow parents to spy on their
children to make sure that they were not visiting inappropriate Web
sites, engaging in dangerous conversations in chat rooms or
otherwise doing things they ought not be doing.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short time the software has been on the market,
parents have not turned out to be the main customers. Instead,
according to the company, the program has found an enthusiastic
audience among tens of thousands of suspicious spouses, distrustful
bosses and private investigators who specialize in human
weaknesses, especially those that are exacerbated by the
temptations of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it is a program that runs on an operating system of
distrust and secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   In the program's ``stealth'' mode, only the person who installed
the program knows that it is running in the background. Later, when
the target of the surveillance is not around, the Spector
recordings can be played back by entering a secret combination of
keys and then a password. The program does not show up in any
directory and does not impede the normal operation of the computer.
Spectorsoft says the program is undetectable, even by
computer-adept teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The program's supporters argue that it can provide a parent with
early warning when a child is on drugs or is suicidal, that it can
illuminate the truth in a relationship that may be based on lies
and that it can catch people who are using the computer to do bad
things.
</P>
<P>
   These programs are not to be confused with Web filters like Net
Nanny and SurfWatch, which are intended to prevent children or
employees from gaining access to pornographic and other types of
undesirable sites on the Internet. Rather, programs like Spector
are designed to spy on people who mistakenly think that what they
do on the computer is private.
</P>
<P>
   In promoting the Spector program, SpectorSoft offers customer
testimonials that read like a dreary synopsis of the Jerry Springer
show's greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   One customer described her experiences with Spector in a phone
interview from Nashville, Tenn., but to protect her privacy, she
did not want her name to be used. She said she had installed
Spector on her home computer and discovered that her husband was a
regular visitor to pornography sites and sex-related chat rooms on
the Internet. To her horror, she said, Spector replayed messages he
had sent to women he had met online, proposing dalliances and
bragging about extramarital relationships that spanned their 15
years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The husband did not know that his computer had been bugged until
last month, the woman said, when her divorce lawyer showed him
dozens of pages of printouts, captured keystroke by keystroke and
time-stamped by Spector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spector is no different than going out and hiring a private
investigator,'' the woman said. ``All it is is a more sophisticated
way of doing something women and men have done for centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor James, manager of Eye Spy, a spy equipment store in
Olathe, Kan., said one of his customers had installed Spector on
his wife's computer. The man said the program had captured her
e-mail exchanges with her boyfriend, revealing not just their
affair but also the boyfriend's desire to physically harm the
husband, James said.
</P>
<P>
   According to James, when the woman was confronted with the
evidence, she agreed to a divorce, left town and gave up custody of
the children without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Fowler, president of SpectorSoft, recalled another case in
which a private investigator, hired by a woman to check out her
fiance, put the software on the man's computer and discovered that
he was a philanderer. The marriage was called off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And here is where the use of the technology may cross the line
from morally ambiguous to morally reprehensible, if not also
illegal, behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Spector's newest program, eBlaster, was created for people who
want to spy on computers to which they do not have regular access.
It works like Spector, hiding in the background and recording
on-screen activities, but it then surreptitiously sends a log of
the activity via e-mail to any address specified by the person who
installed the software.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the licensing agreement, which few people ever take the
trouble to read, is a passage requiring the user to promise not to
install or use the software on a computer without the knowledge of
the computer owner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Spector, eBlaster ($59.95) does its work remotely.
Recording a screen shot every 30 seconds, as Spector does, would
create unmanageable e-mail messages. Instead, eBlaster just sends
the highlights. Or lowlights, as the case may be. The reports can
be sent as frequently as every 15 minutes when the person being
spied upon is connected to the Internet. The program does not leave
an e-mail trail and does not automatically dial the Internet
through the modem, which would alert the user that something was
amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said he had created eBlaster in response to requests by
Spector customers. Some were fearful of being caught while
reviewing the Spector playbacks on the target computer; the woman
in Nashville said her husband had threatened her when he found her
near his computer. Some were parents who wanted to monitor their
children's computer activities from work when the children were
home alone. Some were lovers in long-distance relationships. Fowler
said one parent had wanted to install it on the computer that would
go with his child to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never advise anyone to put it on a computer that isn't
owned by them,'' Fowler added quickly. And despite popular demand,
he said, he would never create a version that could be installed on
a computer remotely, as a Trojan horse program or virus can.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a skilled hacker would be able to send the program to
someone else's computer, perhaps as an e-mail attachment.
</P>
<P>
   In default mode, Spector captures a gray-scale picture of the
computer screen every 30 seconds. If the user so chooses, it can
capture screen shots in full 32-bit color as often as once a
second. It can also capture keystrokes, which is useful in
revealing passwords. On many screens, passwords are displayed as
asterisks instead of clear text, but with keystroke playback, the
passwords can easily be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The default setting records 24 hours a day, beginning when
Windows is first loaded, but it can be adjusted to fit the target's
schedule, becoming active after work or after school. The recorded
files are stored on a special area of the hard disk, one that does
not show up on the directory. By default, the program stores up to
50 megabytes of data, about five days' worth, before recycling the
disk space.
</P>
<P>
   With standard hard disk sizes now in the multiple gigabytes (a
gigabyte is about 1,000 megabytes), it is possible to track a
user's actions for weeks. Playing back the computer record is as
simple as using a VCR. Click on Play, and the screen shots are
played back in slide-show fashion. The speed can be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think that they are sly because they encrypt their
secret files and protect them with passwords, but Spector sees
everything, including passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid? The default hot-key combination to call Spector out of
the shadows is Crtl-Alt-Shift-S, all held down at the same time.
(The hot keys for eBlaster are Ctrl-Alt-Shift-T.) Or you can search
your hard disk for TPS file extensions, which is where Spector
stores its screen shots. It takes minimal computer knowledge to
change the hot keys and file extensions, or to set up a password,
but according to James, the spy shop manager, many of his customers
are not exactly computer wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they seem troubled by the difficult moral, ethical and
legal questions that Spector raises.
</P>
<P>
   Snoopware has raised some questions for privacy experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my reading of different state statutes, it is not
clear if it is illegal or not,'' said Mike Godwin, a lawyer who is
the author of ``Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital
Age'' (Times Books, 1998). ``But this is fundamentally an ethical
and moral discussion, and not fundamentally a legal one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have a general-purpose tool that has all sorts of
potential for abuses. And that raises an important social question:
Now that we have the technology to make it easy for people to
violate someone else's privacy, even for the best of reasons
sometimes, do we as a society promote it, tolerate it or forbid
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Godwin said he believed that programs like Spector needed some
regulation. ``If someone ever installed this software on my
computers in my home without my permission or knowledge,'' he said,
he would take them to court.
</P>
<P>
   Simson L. Garfinkel, author of ``Database Nation: The Death of
Privacy in the 21st Century'' (O'Reilly &AMP; Associates, 2000), also
stopped short of condemning spy software. ``The issue isn't that
these programs exist,'' he said. ``These programs have existed for
years. What's new here is that they are coming into the mainstream.
It's yet another example of why we need national data protection
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Spector's proponents argue that those tactics are
warranted if the software saves a child from harm or uncovers
illegal or immoral activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no sympathy for people who would try to claim that two
wrongs don't make a right,'' said the woman in Nashville who spied
on her husband. ``Spector helped save my life. How dare anyone say
to me that what I did was wrong? When you're searching for truth
and your spouse is doing everything he can to cover up, you depend
on programs like Spector.''

</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, June 25)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The late Nikita Khrushchev was shrewd
and bombastic, but he was not prescient about which type of
government would triumph in the lengthy communism-vs.-capitalism
conflict known as the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Khrushchev bluntly told the capitalist nations:
``Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury
you.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years thereafter, that declaration represented the
Soviet Union's goal in its ideological and political dispute with
the United States and its democratic partners. In 1962 Khrushchev
tried and failed to place nuclear missiles in Cuba as a threat to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   History was not on the side of the communists. They did not bury
us. Instead, communism _ with help from America and its allies _
buried itself.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to this majestic city, founded by Peter the Great in
1703 as his window on the West, confirms that at least part of
Russia is prospering in the wake of dramatic changes initiated more
than a decade ago by Mikhail Gorbachev and continued by Boris
Yeltsin. Many of the barriers that once inhibited freedom of
movement and choice have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders no longer are foisted on the people by a
ruling oligarchy. They are elected by the people.
</P>
<P>
   Ships fill St. Petersburg's harbor. Tourists jam the Hermitage,
with its magnificent art collection running the gamut from
Rembrandt to Picasso. Visitors from the West fill the city's ballet
theater, restaurants and boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity of wealth seen on a visit to the enormous, elegant
palaces that once housed high-living Russian czars tends to explain
why Russia, with millions of poor people, was ripe for revolution
in 1917 when the Bolsheviks took over.
</P>
<P>
   What is not well explained is why the revolutionaries felt it
necessary to kill Czar Nicholas II and his family that year and
place tight controls on freedoms that were enjoyed in other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Petersburg, only memories remain of the terrible German
siege of 900 days during World War II when the city was called
Leningrad after V.I. Lenin, the father of the Soviet Union and the
fanatical leader of the communist movement. The siege, which ran
from 1941 to 1944, failed when the frigid Russian winter and the
Red Army finally proved too much for the invading Germans. But it
is commemorated in a park where 900 trees have been planted.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings that were destroyed during that tragic period have
been rebuilt, and St. Petersburg abounds in architectural gems.
Russia, which continues to have many problems, is making strides
that were not possible in the days of absolute communist control.
</P>
<P>
   What we see in Russia and its neighbors that border the English
Channel, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea is that change is an
indispensable part of life. Nothing lasts forever.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Le Havre, France's second largest port, was
decimated by German and allied bombs during World War II. Local
citizens recall that only one building was left standing and that
80,000 people were homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Le Havre is a vigorous port city that shows no signs of
the disaster that befell it more than a half century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some distance down the Normandy coastline from Le Havre,
visitors return to the beaches where the allies invaded France in
June, 1944. It was there that the blood of heroes left its
indelible mark on history. It was there that the mighty military
offensive that ended with the defeat of Adolf Hitler's Germany
began.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors still marvel at Western Europe's dramatic rebirth in
the wake of history's most devastating war. The rejuvenation began
with the U.S. Marshall Plan in the late 1940s. At that time,
America announced its readiness to provide substantial financial
aid to the countries suffering great destruction if they would
determine their needs and work together. They did exactly that and
the results were spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   The United States offered to include its wartime ally, the
Soviet Union, in the Marshall Plan, but dictator Josef Stalin
rejected the offer and persuaded Soviet satellites to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   That was a colossal mistake. Had the Soviet Union participated,
the world would have been a very different place.
</P>
<P>
   Russia now is striving to catch up with America and her allies,
but despite its dramatic improvement in recent years, it has a long
way to go.
</P>
<P>
   The strides that now are so evident in St. Petersburg could have
been taken decades ago. That is a part of history that Khrushchev
failed to understand.

A CITY REBELS AGAINST STATE STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although ``local control'' means little for huge districts like
New York City's, most American schools are run by elected boards
that are expected to reflect community goals. But if states set
standards, as they are now doing, the most important role of local
boards disappears.
</P>
<P>
   In Pasadena, Calif., a school board has bucked the trend, voting
defiantly last week to adopt its own science standards rather than
the state's.
</P>
<P>
   Local control has its downside. Boards may set low standards, or
learning may take a back seat to job protection. But local control
also has benefits. Districts can pioneer better methods that get
copied nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Schools benefit if a state-imposed curriculum is wise. But they
can suffer if standards are flawed or unsuited to local need.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena's vote is noteworthy because experts often depict
American science education as a mile wide and an inch deep, with
students memorizing disconnected facts. While standards in some
states address that concern, those in others do not. California,
for example, now expects third graders to know that matter consists
of more than 100 types of atoms listed on the periodic table, and
that energy comes from the sun as light.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year-olds can ``know'' facts like these, but few can
understand them. Yet California considers the standards high,
because pupils could not previously regurgitate such information.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena is a Los Angeles suburb with mostly minority and poor
students. But it is also home to the California Institute of
Technology, where 15 years ago the faculty began to develop for the
district a curriculum that teaches children to ``think like
scientists'' rather than memorize facts they don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Discarding textbooks, Pasadena uses kits of material for
experiments. While one fifth-grade class creates electric circuits
to light a bulb, another investigates crayfish. These lead to
teaching about conductivity and anatomy. Students write their
observations and hypotheses, and describe their experiments in
journals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasadena schools superintendent, Vera Vignes, says science
is best taught by engaging pupils' natural curiosity with
``hands-on'' activity. They can then relate this experience to the
underlying concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum is nationally admired. Urging Pasadena to
maintain its approach even if it differs from state standards, Dr.
Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences,
contrasted Caltech's methods with usual teaching that asks only for
word recognition that is easy to test on multiple-choice or
fill-in-the-blank exams.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Teaching the New Basic Skills'' (Free Press, 1996),
Richard J. Murnane and Frank Levy praise Pasadena for teaching true
scientific method. At the meeting last week where the school board
adopted its own science standards, students and teachers testified
of coming to love and learn science from ``inquiry-based'' lessons,
and parents described how children linked writing, math and
science.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the school board vote invites trouble. Pasadena may do
poorly on science tests now being developed by the state, and
suffer sanctions as a result. Certainly students could excel on
topics they understand from collecting data and testing hypotheses.
But because Pasadena emphasizes depth, not breadth, there may be
topics where students have little experience, and here they could
do worse than others in California.
</P>
<P>
   The district now plans its own assessments, including student
presentations, written accounts of experiments and multiple-choice
tests, that can show whether claims made for kit-based instruction
have merit. Although the highly acclaimed program is over a decade
old, there are as yet no external measures of the understanding
that pupils gain _ a strange lapse for dissident educators
challenging state standards.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Dee Romney, a community activist and school board opponent,
said she found it astounding that Caltech had not assessed the
program objectively. ``It is counterintuitive to the very nature of
science,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the district moves to develop its own evaluations, it
must convince the community that these should carry more weight
than state exams. If students do better on district assessments
than on California's standardized tests, the board may have to
mobilize political support to continue the program.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Vignes says, the district is now planning outreach
activities, like science fairs where parents will be judges. ``We
have a lot of work to do with parents,'' she acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena's challenge to the state is complex. While California
standards could harm Pasadena instruction, elsewhere state
standards could improve what previously passed for science
teaching. It's probably better to memorize correct facts than wrong
ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Pasadena is not the only innovative district that believes
state standards limit learning. If other districts also rebel, they
could challenge the faulty notion that combining local control,
high standards and more state accountability is an easy matter.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lt. Gov. Rick Perry and Attorney General John
Cornyn rallied Wednesday to defend the state's ``honor'' and the
death penalty sentence for convicted murderer Gary Graham, who is
scheduled to be executed today for a 1981 Houston murder he says he
did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Their joint press conference at the Capitol was a response to
calls from high-profile celebrities such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson
and Bianca Jagger of Amnesty International to postpone Graham's
execution, as well as mounting national criticism of the state's
use of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Texas is being showcased by some for political
reasons as not such a fine place,'' Perry complained. ``I will
continue to stand up for this state. I will continue to defend
Texas' honor in every way that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Cornyn were joined by state Rep. Terry Keel, R-Austin,
a former Travis County sheriff, and former state Rep. Allen
Hightower, a Democrat who spent 12 years as chairman of the House
Corrections Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, like Perry, said he was not speaking up on behalf of
Gov. George W. Bush, whose presidential campaign has attracted new
and often critical attention to the state's use of the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally felt it was important for us to be able to
explain, again, what type of super due process that criminal
defendants are entitled to and in fact receive _ and in fact Mr.
Graham has received _ in reviewing their cases,'' Cornyn said of
Texas death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn criticized the ``confusion'' and ``disinformation'' that
he said were ``based on political agendas by people outside of the
state to make it look like the Texas system is not fair. The Texas
criminal justice system is fair _ and Mr. Graham did get a fair
trial and has gotten fair review'' by courts of appeal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general also defended the state's efforts to uphold
the conviction of Calvin Burdine, who has complained that his
lawyer slept through long stretches of the 1984 Harris County trial
that ended with him convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not condone lawyers sleeping through trial, we do not
condone it,'' Cornyn said, explaining his office's defense of the
conviction of Calvin Burdine. But the state's position is that the
defendant has the burden to show that a new trial might result in a
different verdict.

<P>
   CLYDE, N.Y. _ Sitting in Pete's Diner, talking about his beloved
hometown, Kenneth DiSanto makes the plan sound plausible, even
probable. Of course this forlorn little village will transform
itself from plain old Clyde, smack in the middle of nowhere, to
Clyde-on-the-Erie, historic site and tourist magnet.
</P>
<P>
   Step outside onto Glasgow Street, however, and the obstacles to
that plan become plain.
</P>
<P>
   Just for starters, you cannot actually get to the Erie Canal
from three-block-long downtown Clyde. Railroad tracks run between
the water and the village; freight cars rumble through every 20
minutes or so. Nor can you get from the canal into Clyde; the only
dock, on the far side of a bridge, cannot accommodate anything much
bigger than a rowboat.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clyde, halfway between Rochester and Syracuse, is
pinning its hopes for the future on the canal that first gave it
life back in the 1820s.
</P>
<P>
   So are dozens of other communities in upstate New York. They are
being egged on by the federal government, which since 1996 has been
pushing a ``canal corridor initiative'' to redevelop the historic
canal for tourism and recreation _ and has given out almost $240
million in grants and loans to help pay for the efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to live in a chapter in a history book,'' said
Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development (and a
possible future candidate for governor). But, he said, remaking and
marketing the canal will promote ``tourism, jobs, energy and
optimism, and the quality of life of the locale.''
</P>
<P>
   Across New York state, there are hundreds of villages and towns
of 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 souls, stranded in history as well as
geography. Places that once had a reason for being _ a railroad
stop, a turnpike gate, a waterfall to drive a mill _ are struggling
to survive in the age of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In Clyde, ``our game plan has been to find a reason for
existence,'' said DiSanto, who is, among other things, chairman of
the village's Industrial Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Clyde similar to many upstate communities, said Susan
Christopherson, a professor of urban planning at Cornell University
who has studied the canal redevelopment program. So does its
separation from the canal itself. ``In many cases, it ran adjacent
to the downtown business district,'' she said. ``It wasn't directly
connected to downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Some communities along the canal are more prosperous than Clyde,
and more urban; many in western Wayne County, for example, where
Clyde is, have become suburbs of Rochester. But ``Clyde is fairly
typical of most rural downtowns'' in central New York, said Barbara
Harper, director of the Wayne County Economic Development
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that there is not a whole lot here: Pete's, of
course, and the Trackside Deli, a Key Bank branch, antiques shops
and a cute little flower shop. For shopping there's a hardware
store, the Clyde Bargain Center and Messinger's Variety Store, an
old-fashioned five-and-dime that sells housedresses and hairnets
when its 91-year-old proprietor can make it to the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde has a leafy little town green, too, with a bandstand and
fountain. You have to look closely to realize that the statue of
George Washington has lost its nose, or that the fancy little roof
on wooden supports labeled ``Clyde's Famous Mineral Spring'' covers
only a pipe with a soda can smashed into it.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say exactly how many people still live in Clyde.
Locals put the population at 2,400, but last year's Census Bureau
estimate is about half that. In any event, Clyde is so small that
it has only one telephone exchange, and people tend to identify
themselves by the year they graduated from Clyde-Savannah High.
</P>
<P>
   And for some of those people, the canal remains a real part of
life, even today. Take Brian Howell, who worked on the last
steam-powered vessel to ply the Erie. That was only 15 years ago _
and Howell, who works for the State Canal Corp., is only 34 (class
of 1984).
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the canal was all the reason Clyde needed for
being. When the canal opened in 1825, it provided for the first
time transportation through the spine of mountains that runs down
the eastern United States. Wheat could come east, widgets could go
west, and people could move both ways, on barges drawn by mules.
Clyde was the first stop for westbound barges that had pushed for
hours through the malaria-infested Montezuma Swamp. Not
surprisingly, mule drivers got off to have a drink in one of
Clyde's taverns.
</P>
<P>
   There were shoe shops and clothing shops, and, in time, a fancy
hotel, a racetrack, two newspapers, two train stations, three
graveyards, at least four churches and a home-grown marching band.
The biggest house in town belonged to the owner of the glass
factory, which turned out handmade Mason jars.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad brought Abraham Lincoln, who in 1861 spoke a few
words to a crowd gathered in Clyde. In the 1880s, it brought the
Italian workers whose names are now borne by almost everyone in
town.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Clyde continued
to prosper. ``If I had to be transported back in time, it would be
to the 1930s,'' said R. Hugh Miner, the town historian and
publisher of the monthly Crossroads Advocate. In this agricultural
area, even the Depression was not so bad, he said, ``and this was a
very close-knit community.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask George L. Storto, who says he is related to everyone in
town (his father owned an ice cream parlor). A member of the
Clyde-Savannah High class of 1948, Storto left Clyde in 1957 and
ended up in Arizona, working for a big insurance company. And he
married a woman from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Someday you have to show me that little town you're
from, because you talk about it and dream about it,''' Storto said.
In 1995, he and his wife came back to Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Storto is part of what may be Clyde's secret weapon: a group of
well-traveled, well-to-do retirees who are determined to save the
place they still love. They include DiSanto and Richard DeVito, who
both retired from Xerox, and Rudolph A. DeLisio, who retired from
General Electric (classes of '56, '51 and '41, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   They knew Clyde before the GE plant closed and eliminated 350
jobs in the early 1960s. Even though some other businesses have
moved in _ Parker Hannifin, which makes industrial hydraulic
equipment, and Thomas Electronics each employ well over 100 people
_ Clyde seemed to lose something, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Property values fell, absentee landlords moved in, and so did a
lot of people receiving welfare or disability payments. There is
not much for poor or young people to do in Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, things began to change. By a narrow margin, Clyde
elected a new mayor, Steven Groat, a photographer, who shared many
of the retirees' ideas and frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   The retirees formed a sort of Save Clyde Committee, and with
Groat they persuaded a class of landscape architecture students at
Cornell to draw up a plan to renovate downtown Clyde. And it began
to seem possible that Clyde could serve as an antiques center, a
place where people floating down the canal or visiting Montezuma
(now a wildlife refuge popular with bird watchers) could browse and
buy.
</P>
<P>
   Groat began applying for government grants and loans, and has
brought more than $1 million into Clyde. Some of the money has gone
to a new water system; some was to be spent on a new park and dock
on the far side of the Erie, which have not yet been started
because the bids came in too high.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the residents of Clyde did a little boot-strapping;
75 of them kicked in $1,000 each toward a limited partnership. The
money has gone to buy what the retirees describe as the three worst
buildings in town, all on Glasgow Street, and now they are trying
to find the cash to renovate the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Fantastically ornate tin covers 14-foot ceilings in an old
drugstore that Kevin Sipple is turning into an elegant antiques
shop (``no junk,'' he said firmly). A 50-year-old retired police
officer from outside Rochester, Sipple is pulling up the tile floor
of his 1853 building to expose the tongue-and-groove maple.
Upstairs, he has installed a new kitchen and bathroom in a
one-bedroom apartment he hopes to rent out.
</P>
<P>
   Down the block, in a building DiSanto owns, is a similar tin
ceiling, as well as an elaborately paneled and mirrored wall dating
back to the days when the place was Wood's barbershop. For the past
year, Darrell Marriott, a 35-year-old former quarterback at
Clyde-Savannah High, has been running the Olde Erie Hair Shoppe
there, giving $8 haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   DiSanto owns another building, the old Stoetzel's bakery, and
has restored the huge brick oven in the back room, hoping to turn
the place into a restaurant. The upper two floors may someday
become a bed and breakfast. Right now, Clyde lacks even a motel.
</P>
<P>
   Another construction project may soon begin a few blocks away,
where the town historical society plans to turn the old Baptist
church facing the park into a new museum and meeting hall.
</P>
<P>
   These developments may seem minor, but they have not been
embraced by everyone. Groat, 48, gave up the mayor's office to run
for county legislator but lost; his efforts to enforce zoning and
building codes made him unpopular in some quarters. And he admits
that he and the retirees may have tried to change too much, too
soon. ``Trying to do something here is difficult,'' he said. ``I
don't want to say that I shoved it down their throats, but I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Caprilla, the new mayor _ who was also mayor before Groat
_ said residents were not opposed to the redevelopment plan, but
worried that it might increase their taxes, or change the nature of
the village. ``As much as people want to see the canal improved,''
he said, ``they're afraid of a flock of tourists coming to Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not seem to be a looming problem. More pleasure boats
are using the lock near Clyde _ traffic rose by 8 percent between
1997 and 1999 _ but fewer than 1,100 cruised through last year. And
while DiSanto's Industrial Development Corporation has lured
several small businesses _ and about 30 jobs _ to Clyde in the last
four years, they are in manufacturing, not tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But those job gains may not be unrelated to Clyde's
improvements. Professor Christopherson is working on a new study
for the federal government that suggests that improving amenities
for tourists may also draw other kinds of businesses looking for
good recreational opportunities for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   In Clyde, anyway, jobs sometime seem beside the point. What
people keep coming back to is the search for a reason for being. As
Miner, the historian, puts it, ``The whole idea of the Erie Canal
for us is that we're hoping to regain some identity.''

WEB SITES MAKE IT HARD TO PEDDLE HOT RENOIRS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The price was just too good to be true. When a man came into
Lewis Bobrick's gallery in Denver recently trying to sell antique
Navajo rugs for next to nothing, Bobrick worried that the rugs
might be stolen. While the man waited in his store to see if there
was a buyer for the unique rugs, Bobrick went to the Antique Tribal
Art Dealers Association Web site (www.atada.org), where photographs
and descriptions of stolen tribal artifacts can be posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just really suspicious they were stolen,'' Bobrick said
of the rugs, which were potentially worth thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Bobrick's suspicions were confirmed when he learned through the
site that the rugs had been stolen from a gallery in Arizona two
weeks earlier. Although the man left the store before Bobrick could
call the police, Bobrick made calls to other gallery owners in the
area, and the man was arrested at another gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Kahn, co-director of David Cook Fine American Art in
Denver, used the site last fall when two men tried to sell Navajo
rugs to her at a low price. ``It's definitely the first place I go
if someone comes into our shop and there is something fishy about
the deal,'' Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always ask the source of the objects. If they are evasive
or don't seem to know the value, then we become suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Theft of artwork, artifacts and antiques is an international
problem and not, of course, limited to tribal works. Other less
specialized sites offer similar theft-alert services.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the Art Loss Register, www.artloss.com, a database
service that tracks international missing valuables like paintings
and antiques and says it has helped recover more than 1,000 items
since its inception in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes a section about artwork that was lost during
the Holocaust, a lost-and-found page where visitors can read about
the successful recovery of some artwork, and photographs _ which
can be enlarged for better viewing _ of each currently missing
object.
</P>
<P>
   A theft alert page on another site,
www.fineanddecorativeart.com, allows viewers to scroll through a
list of missing property. Among the items listed are an oil
painting stolen from a home in Ireland last February and a
communion service setting taken from a church in Massachusetts. A
few of the postings even offer a description of the suspect _ the
culprit in the theft of an heirloom replica stove in Ohio is
described as ``a woman 5 feet 10 inches, dark hair, ice green eyes,
a boney looking face and low raspy voice.'' (The stove replica is
worth $5,000 to $10,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Major thefts are listed at the FBI's National Stolen Art File
(www.fbi.gov/majcases/arttheft/art.htm) and at Interpol's Cultural
Property Program site (www.usdoj.gov/usncb/culturehome.htm). Among
the listings at the FBI site are a Renoir painting and a
Stradivarius violin.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a page dedicated to one of the most audacious
museum thefts of recent times, the robbery at the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990. Works by Manet, Degas, Rembrandt
and Vermeer worth several hundred million dollars were among those
stolen by two men, posing as Boston police officers, who tied up
the museum's security guards and took the video surveillance tape
with them when they left.
</P>
<P>
   While no single Indian-art theft can match the Gardner Museum
robbery in magnitude, there are plenty of smaller thefts noted on
the tribal art dealers' site. The list includes images and
descriptions of Hopi bowls and jars stolen from a California
museum, Navajo rugs stolen from a residence in Wyoming,
photogravures by the Indian photographer Edward Curtis missing from
a gallery in Washington and dozens of other American Indian
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Antique Tribal Art Dealers Association (ATADA) is a
membership organization, any individual or business can post a
notice about lost or stolen goods, and officials at the site have
previously posted notices on the behalf of the Zuni Pueblo in New
Mexico and the Hopi Indians when they learned of thefts of tribal
art.
</P>
<P>
   There is no fee to post a theft alert on the site, and a gallery
owner in New Mexico who lost goods to thieves last month said that
was quite a saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent about $800 to make some color brochures that we could
give out,'' said the theft victim, Al Anthony Jr., owner of the
Adobe Gallery in Albuquerque. ``It didn't cost anything but a
little time to post the pictures on our own site or Atada.''

ARCHBISHOP ALAN DE LASTIC, 70, CHRISTIAN LEADER IN INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   India's most prominent Christian leader, Alan de Lastic, the
Roman Catholic archbishop of Delhi, was killed Tuesday night in a
car crash in Poland, where he had been been praying at Krakow's
shrine to the Black Madonna following a working visit to Rome. He
was 70.
</P>
<P>
   De Lastic's death deals a blow not only to India's Christian
minority, now under attack by Hindu militants, but also to Indian
human rights organizations of all faiths. An outspoken defender of
Christian rights in a Hindu-majority nation, he was president of
the Catholic Bishops Conference of India, a position that lent
weight to his human rights activities at a time when Indian
churches are being destroyed by mobs and priests and nuns have been
murdered in several Indian states.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop was the founder of the United Christian Forum for
Human Rights. On Wednesday, the forum's convenor, John Dayal, said
in a telephone interview from New Delhi that de Lastic was ``the
voice of the Christian community and a natural leader of the entire
human rights movement in India.''
</P>
<P>
   In April in New York, Indians in the United States presented to
the archbishop and Dayal, a writer, the first Graham Staines
International Award for Human Rights and Communal Harmony, named
for an Australian missionary doctor who was burned to death in his
car with his two young sons last year in the eastern Indian state
of Orissa. A Hindu militant has been charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Christians account for only 2.5 percent of India's 1 billion
people, but have played a leading part in providing health and
education services that many other Indians consider superior to
those supplied by the government. Christianity, which was first
brought to India from the Middle East in the 1st century and was
later bolstered by Western missionaries who often converted
disadvantaged Hindu outcastes, has long been an integral part of
Indian life.
</P>
<P>
   Religion, however, has always been close to the surface of
politics in India, a constitutionally secular nation _ most often
where Muslims are concerned. In recent years, with a Hindu
nationalist-led government in power in New Delhi, militant Hindu
organizations that had been focusing mainly on Muslim targets also
began a campaign against Christin conversions by Indian priests,
and have introduced ``re-conversion'' ceremonies carried out with
varying degrees of intimidation, Indian Christians say.
</P>
<P>
   De Lastic had lately been discussing the new problems faced by
Christians with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a moderate
leader among Hindu politicians. Wednesday in New Delhi, after he
heard of the archbishop's death, Vajpayee called a meeting of
Christian church leaders The prime minister called de Lastic ``a
man of God who had dedicated his life to the service of
humankind.''
</P>
<P>
   De Lastic's readiness to publicly protest attacks by Hindus
wherever they occurred drew some criticism from non-Catholic
Christian groups in India.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangalore, professor K.E. Eapen, a lay leader of the Mar
Thoma church, India's oldest Christian community, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday that many members of his church were
concerned that the archbishop's strident defense of Christian
conversions may have played into the hands of Hindu militants. When
Pope John Paul II visited India last November, he added fuel to the
controversy by also advocating conversions.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Oil on the political fire

<P>
   OIL ON THE POLITICAL FIRE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush voiced support today for the Federal Trade
Commission's probe of soaring gasoline prices, but he put most of
the blame on the White House's failure to convince foreign crude
producers to ``open the spigots.'' In Los Angeles, Bush said, ``I
do think it's fair to have the FTC investigate,'' adding that the
results would be ``healthy.'' Bush didn't accuse the Clinton
administration or Al Gore of demagoguing the issue by launching the
probe, but the former Texas oilman did insist that it's the
administration's job to pressure the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Nations to increase oil output.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO YOU CALL A NON-ENDORSING ENDORSEMENT?
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring his brawny union's disenchantment with Al Gore,
Teamsters chief James P. Hoffa will join Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader in Los Angeles on Thursday to make a ``special
statement ... concerning the 2000 presidential election.'' A
Teamsters spokesman said Hoffa doesn't plan at that time to endorse
Nader. The United Auto Workers has hinted it also may support Nader
for his opposition to ``corporate globalization.'' The Teamsters
and UAW pointedly abstained last October when the AFL-CIO voted to
give Gore an early endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   THE TRUTH, TEXAS-TOAST STYLE
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has issued a warning to George W. Bush: ``The Texas
Truth Squad is coming.'' The group of workers from Texas will
appear at labor-sponsored meetings around the country to try to
sully the governor's reputation by talking about problems in Texas
that include education, health care and the treatment of farm
workers. The union leaflet says the truth squad will note that
Texas ranks the lowest among all states in the percentage of people
who have health insurance and near the bottom in College Board
scores. The first event is to be held in Philadelphia on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   PLOWING FERTILE GROUND
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore went to Iowa today and proposed exempting more family
farms and small businesses from estate taxes. While attempting to
carve out his own piece of a Republican campaign issue, Democrats
warn that eliminating the tax would blow a hole in the budget and
mainly benefit the rich. Instead, Gore proposed increasing the
exemption for small businesses and farmers _ currently up to $2.6
million _ to $5 million, meaning, he said, that 90 percent of the
nation's farmers would not owe estate taxes. Gore: ``Some on
Capitol Hill believe we should completely repeal the estate tax and
give a massive tax break to the wealthiest Americans. They want to
give away the store to those who already own the shopping center.''
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS AND QUAKERS
</P>
<P>
   Political protesters are saying they won't foment a repeat of
violence that erupted after the Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA
title the other night, but they fear police may use the riot as a
pretext to bully them away from the Democratic convention. Shawn
McDougal of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker social
service movement, and other planners promise boisterous and
disruptive rallies, but maintain their groups won't try to hurt
anyone or destroy property. And the LAPD insists it won't impede
the protests as long as the activists remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   LOW-BUDGET CAMPAIGN COVERAGE . . .
</P>
<P>
   ABC News, citing cost concerns, has pulled out of a pool
arrangement where three networks had shared camera coverage of
George W. Bush and Al Gore. ABC had joined with CBS and Fox News
Channel to share camera coverage of the campaign. But with interest
in the candidates at an ebb now and relatively few public
appearances, ABC found it wasn't worth the expense, said
spokeswoman Su-Lin Nichols. ABC is using its own cameras to cover
some events and relying on affiliates for others, she said. The
network currently has just one producer, without a correspondent or
camera crew, traveling full-time with each candidate. CBS and NBC
have yet to announce their plans, but are expected to scale back,
also.
</P>
<P>
   . . . WITH A WAY TO STAY IN THE GAME . . .
</P>
<P>
   ABC has invited Al Gore and George W. Bush to participate in a
one-on-one televised conversation shortly after Labor Day. The
network said it wanted as little participation as possible from a
moderator so the event doesn't look like a formal debate. So far,
the two candidates have agreed only to three fall debates sponsored
by the Commission on Presidential Debates. But, ``if you can have
them talk to each other directly, it will become less adversarial
and less debate-like,'' said ABC News president David Westin.
Campaigns keep such tight control on all aspects of personal
appearances that Westin's idea might be a tough sell, said ABC
anchor Peter Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND STILL KEEP MONDAY NIGHT SAFE FOR FOOTBALL
</P>
<P>
   ABC, in its dialing down of convention coverage in prime time,
doesn't plan to pre-empt two preseason NFL games. The network says
it will go ahead with the San Francisco 49ers-New England Patriots
on the Republicans' opening night, July 31, and Los Angeles
Rams-Tennessee Titans on the Democrats' opening night, July 14. But
news division chief David Westin says they'll provide coverage
during halftime. What's that come to, 10 minutes worth?
</P>
<P>
   BUT YOU KNOW HOW CREATIVE ACCOUNTING CAN BE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush broke through the $90 million fund-raising mark
last month. Bush, reported having $7.1 million in his campaign
account at the end of May, has raised $650,000 so far this month,
and has another fund-raiser Friday in Alabama. Al Gore reported a
bank balance of $8.3 million, and expects an additional $1.3
million in federal matching funds. After the national conventions,
each candidate will receive $67.6 million in federal funds for the
general election and cannot raise any more money except to cover
legal and accounting costs.
</P>
<P>
   PHYSICIST CHALLENGING BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   John Hagelin, the quantum physicist who founded the Natural Law
Party, is challenging Pat Buchanan for the Reform Party's
presidential nomination and the right to spend the party's $12.6
million in federal campaign money. In addition to running as the
Natural Law nominee, Hagelin said he's qualified to have his name
placed on Reform Party's mail ballot. Ever since Buchanan left the
Republican Party last year, he has been taking over the Reform
Party, winning the biggest share of delegates. But a two-thirds
majority at the national convention can overturn the mail-in voting
results.
</P>
<P>
   ZEROING IN ON MINORITIES . . .
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials announced the start of a radio and TV
ad campaign intended to appeal specifically to African-American and
Hispanic voters. Al Gore's health care proposals, including a
patients' bill of rights plan, are the focus of ads intended for
African-Americans. The ads for Hispanic voters, with Gore speaking
Spanish, touch on education and preserving Social Security. The
African-American spots will be broadcast in 17 states, while the
ads for Hispanics will air only in Florida, Illinois, New Mexico
and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND SHOWING UP AT CONVENTIONS
</P>
<P>
   With the bruising battle for Hispanic voters heating up, Al Gore
and George W. Bush both are scheduled to address Hispanics at
national conventions over the next two weeks: the League of United
Latin American Citizens, in Washington, next week, and the National
Council of La Raza, in San Diego, over the July 4th holiday.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH ISSUE OVERSHADOWS EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   Controversy over Texas' death penalty stalked George W. Bush as
he tried to court California voters with a plan to spend $2.3
billion in federal money to boost students' math and science
scores. In Cupertino, Bush refused to take a question about Gary
Graham, the Texas convict scheduled for lethal injection Thursday,
then skipped a planned news conference. Under Texas' weak-governor
system, Bush has no power to spare Graham's life unless the state
Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends it. But in Los Angeles
today, he defended his state's legal system as ``fair and just''
and said there's no need for a moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD THING HE LIKES TO TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore broke off his much-interrupted ``prosperity tour'' in
Kentucky to hasten back to Washington for a Senate vote on hate
crimes, but his potential tie-breaking vote as president of the
Senate wasn't needed. The legislation to expand the hate-crimes law
passed 57-42. It was the fifth time this year that Gore seized upon
close calls in the Senate to underscore his position on key issues
that divide him with George W. Bush. And it was the fifth time his
vote wasn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOYS OF SUMMIT
</P>
<P>
   Whether by grace or by happenstance, the two contenders for
retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg's seat are practically neighbors on
the crest of the Watchung Mountains in central New Jersey, and both
are regarded as local boys. Jon Corzine, the multimillionaire bond
trader and liberal Democrat, lives in the rich north side of
Summit, while Rep. Bob Franks, the journeyman moderate who founded
the Summit High School Young Republicans while he was in school,
now has a home in a kind of suburb of a suburb at Berkeley Heights,
the next town over. Their proximity is both a source of local pride
and a lesson in the evolving politics of New Jersey, a state that
grows more suburban by the year and whose politics seem to be
following the people out of old urban traditions into something
new.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE AGAINST A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR
</P>
<P>
   As Al Gore scrutinizes at least six senators as possible running
mates, the Democratic Party is facing a quandary, because picking a
senator could undermine efforts to regain control of the Senate.
All six of the most frequently mentioned Senate prospects _ John
Kerry of Massachusetts, Bob Graham of Florida, Richard Durbin of
Illinois, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Dianne Feinstein of
California and Evan Bayh of Indiana _ hold seats that probably
would be filled by a Republican, either through appointment or a
later special election. ``There would have to be an incredibly
compelling reason to pick one particular senator to punt away a
Senate seat,'' said Charles Cook, editor of the Cook Political
Report and an authority on Senate races.

   Dell Planning to Offer Digital Audio Receiver
</P>
<P>
   Making its first foray into consumer electronics _ but still
tethered to the personal computer _ the Dell Computer Corp. said
Wednesday that it was preparing to introduce a PC-based digital
audio receiver that would allow MP3 and WMA music files stored on a
personal computer to be played through a home stereo system or in
any room of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dell receiver, which is expected to go on sale at
www.gigabuys.com in August for $249 (or $199 when bought with a
Dell Dimension computer), is a small, radio-style box that uses an
HPNA (Home Phoneline Networking Alliance) version 2.0 or Ethernet
network to tap into the digital music files stored on a personal
computer. An HPNA 2.0 network card for the PC costs between $50 and
$70, depending on the manufacturer. It allows the digital audio
receiver to pull MP3 songs and playlists, managed by either Music
Match or Real Audio software, into the receiver through a home's
existing phone jacks. The receiver itself can be plugged into the
home stereo's RCA jack to fill the house with music, or it can be
set up with an optional $99 set of Acoustic Research speakers to
bring the PC music to any room where music is wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's new audio appliance shares the same basic design as S3
Inc.'s Rio Digital Audio Receiver, which was demonstrated last
month, but unlike the Rio, the Dell has a retro-style radio control
panel. The Rio music appliance will be sold in consumer electronics
and computer retail stores later this summer for $299.95, which
includes the receiver, an HPNA 2.0 network card, two phone cords
and an RCA cable.
</P>
<P>
   Babel Expansion
</P>
<P>
   Babel Fish, the popular computer-based translator owned by
AltaVista, is expanding the number of languages it offers. In
addition to the original five language pairs (all of which include
English), users of Babel Fish (babelfish.altavista.com) can now
translate Russian to English, French to German and German to
French. Babel Fish has added World Keyboard, which can write with
the native characters of six languages, including Cyrillic letters.
</P>
<P>
   A Site Offers to Send E-Mail With Complaints or Praise
</P>
<P>
   Wiley Brooks was frustrated when he wanted to complain to a
restaurant chain by e-mail about an undercooked hamburger. ``It
wasn't easy to get a valid e-mail address,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that frustration has come TellThemNow.com
(www.tellthemnow.com), a Web site that Brooks said would make it
easier to send electronic complaints or compliments to corporate
leaders, politicians, journalists and celebrities. TellThemNow.com
is similar to some other Web sites, like the recently opened
eComplaints (www.ecomplaints.com).
</P>
<P>
   Brooks hopes that his service will increase the odds that the
e-mail messages will actually be read. At the heart of the service
is a directory of about 600,000 e-mail addresses. Nine employees
compiled the list by scanning Web sites with special software, by
purchasing directories and by using, as Brooks put it, ``the
old-fashioned way: making phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Addresses can be found by using either the site's search engine
or directories organized by category.
</P>
<P>
   Once a user finds an address, he or she can compose a message on
a form at the site. Before sending off the note, the user must
assign it to one of five categories, from ``highly positive'' to
``highly negative.''
</P>
<P>
   TellThemNow holds all the messages until late in the evening,
when the day's messages for each recipient are bundled. The site
adds a breakdown _ by percentage and number _ of the tone of the
messages in the package, based on the users' self-assigned
rankings. The bulk packaging, and an attached mini-opinion poll,
give messages ``a little more voice'' than if they had arrived
singly, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   During the first month and a half of the site's operation,
Brooks said, politicians have tended to receive an even number of
positive and negative messages.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, about 70 percent of celebrity messages are ``very
positive,'' leading Brooks to speculate that they are fan mail. He
added that the company did not examine the contents of any message.
</P>
<P>
   But what are the odds that Britney Spears will actually read
your e-mail note if it is sent through TellThemNow?
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' makes a modest claim: ``For the most part, it would be
about the same as if you sent a snail-mail letter and you have the
actual, correct address.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Quite as High as an Elephant's Eye
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that on a hot July day in a Midwestern
cornfield, you can hear the corn growing. Whether or not that is
true, Web surfers can watch corn as it grows on an Iowa farm.
</P>
<P>
   CornCam presents fresh images every 15 minutes from a cornfield
near Prairieburg, Iowa (www.IowaFarmer.com/corncam/corn.html).
Viewers can check regularly to see how much the crop has grown
since it was planted in late April. (It is not quite as high as an
elephant's eye.)
</P>
<P>
   The site includes information about the field (it was planted on
April 30 without tilling, a method that conserves soil) and links
to many other corn sites, including one dedicated to the Corn
Palace in Mitchell, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   CornCam is operated by Iowa Farmer Today, a weekly newspaper,
which is seeking sponsors for a SoyBeanCam.
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether a PaintDryCam is in the works.

IN-FLIGHT, GLOBALSTAR, QUALCOMM PLAN INTERNET SERVICE FOR PLANES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The Internet will take to the clouds early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based In-Flight Network, a maker of airline
entertainment systems which is a joint venture between News Corp.
(NWS:NYSE) and Rockwell Collins (ROK:NYSE), announced Wednesday
that it partnered with Globalstar (GSTRF:NASDAQ) and Qualcomm
(QCOM:) to bring broadband Internet access to airline travelers.
Globalstar, based in Bermuda, and Qualcomm, based in San Diego,
began developing the technology earlier this year, and in the last
two weeks tested a prototype in flights across North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done very, very quickly'' said Mac Jeffery, a
spokesperson for Globalstar. ``It worked brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although pricing has not been established, don't expect it to be
similar to inflight telephones, which usually charge exorbitant
rates. The aim is to provide low-cost access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to completely mirror how it works on the ground,''
said Jeff Wales, the chief executive of In-Flight Network, in an
interview. The target audience is well-traveled business people,
who would be able to plug their laptops into an outlet at their
seat and access the same services they use on the ground. ``This is
literally a breakthrough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In-Flight Network plans to offer lab demonstrations of the
Internet and email service to aviation and airline industry
representatives in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement follows on the heels of similar plans
by Boeing (BA:NYSE) to bring Internet access to its planes. Dubbed
Boeing Connexion and announced in April, the company also hopes to
launch its inflight Internet system sometime next year. Boeing,
based in Seattle, partnered with CNN, Loral, Alenia, Matsushita,
Mitsubishi and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing projects the business of supplying Internet access to
airline passengers to reach $70 billion in revenue over the next 10
years. Boeing's system is already available for private jets, and
will be installed on commercial airlines in late 2001. Initially,
only North American flights will be eligible to offer Boeing's
service.

YOU, TOO, CAN ROCK ON AT SEATTLE'S NEW HANDS-ON MUSIC MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Fricke doesn't want people to be awed when they walk into
Experience Music Project (EMP), the massive new celebration of rock
'n' roll opening in Seattle this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the building itself is amazing: A fluid, brightly colored,
curving space that suggests smashed electric guitars, designed by
Frank Gehry, renowned for the Guggenheim Museum in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, there are thousands of artifacts, from a suit worn by
Notorious B.I.G. to Eric Clapton's famous ``Brownie'' guitar to the
world's largest collection of Jimi Hendrix memorabilia, all brought
to you via Microsoft co-founder, multibillionaire Hendrix fanatic
and amateur guitarist Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   But Fricke, one of EMP's senior curators, says he's not going
for jaw-dropping glitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anyone to think, `I could never do that.''' he
says. ``We're celebrating creativity in American popular music, and
the whole idea is creating a place to celebrate music and the
people who make it and all that surrounds it. We hope the response
will be, `That's amazing _ I want to go buy a guitar and learn to
play.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is because the Experience Music Project is far more
interactive than Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Opening to
the public Friday with a weekend orgy of music that includes shows
by Metallica, Dr. Dre, Patti Smith, Alanis Morissette and James
Brown, EMP is all about taking the history of American pop music
out from behind the glass and thrusting it into the hands of its
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Paul Allen is behind this and he comes from a
technology background, we were pushed to include true interactive
technology from the ground up, with everything we were doing,''
Fricke says.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be given a hand-held computer and headphones,
which will provide information during a museum tour and give access
to custom audio clips at different stops.
</P>
<P>
   If you stop at the ``Is This the First Rock 'n' Roll Record?''
exhibit, for example, you can punch in a video of R&AMP;B legend Big
Jay McNeely talking about his music and playing a song. If you are
interested in a particular piece in this exhibit, such as his
saxophone, you can punch in a number and see McNeely talking about
the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of EMP's interactive mission is the Sound Lab. In
the Jam-O-Drum area, visitors can beat rhythms on a giant drum head
with psychedelic graphics lighting up the room. On Stage re-creates
the feeling of being onstage at a rock concert; visitors can play
guitar, bass, drums and keyboards, sing with the help of a
TelePrompTer and be cheered on by a virtual audience.
</P>
<P>
   There also are the Music Instrument Platforms, which are set up
with guitar, bass, drums and keyboards. A novice musician can, in a
few minutes, learn to play, for example, ``Louie Louie.'' More
proficient players can learn more difficult songs. If you go with
friends, all of you can play along _ with help along the way. There
are three rooms set aside just for improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for hip-hop fans _ visitors can be shown how to
scratch on turntables. And guests can go back home and take
interactive guitar instruction online via www.emplive.com: Every
weekday a famous guitar lick is posted, with instructions about how
to play it.
</P>
<P>
   On Mondays, visitors can participate in a live guitar lesson
using the licks from the previous week. The Web site also features
a peek at three of the museum's exhibit areas (Northwest Passage,
Guitar Gallery and Jimi Hendrix) and access to museum archives.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits at Experience Music Project are different from the
Rock Hall. In Cleveland, says Fricke, exhibits are based on
personalities, often people inducted into the hall. In Seattle,
they are based on ``a story line and building around it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is This the First Rock 'n' Roll Record?'' area, he says, is
based on the years 1938-1956, when blues, country, gospel and R&AMP;B
came together to make protean rock. One item is an upright bass
used by Fred Maddox of the Maddox Brothers and Rose, who merged
hillbilly and boogie in the late '40s and early '50s; Fred's
slapping style on the bass was a direct antecedent of Bill Black's
bass style on early Elvis records. Which is why Fricke tracked down
the bass.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not to say that EMP is in competition with the Rock
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all anxious to have a spirit of partnership,''
says Bob Santelli, who is leaving the Rock Hall to become EMP's
deputy director of public programs. ``I think both institutions
take different paths to get to the same destination. The Hall
preserves and celebrates the history of the music, and EMP is there
to celebrate the creativity that goes into the music.''
</P>
<P>
   They will be trading artifacts back and forth; both will send
people on a travel program to various places around the country
where musical history was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we know each other's missions,'' Santelli says.
``People make pilgrimages to the Rock Hall _ I want that to happen
at EMP, because what you can experience there is like nothing else
happening in the world.''

NEWMONT MINING TO ACQUIRE BATTLE MOUNTAIN GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH RUBENSTEIN   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newmont Mining (NEM:NYSE) announced Wednesday that it will
acquire Battle Mountain Gold (BMG:NYSE), consolidating both
companies' strategic land positions in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Newmont will exchange 0.105 share for each of Battle Mountain's
230 million shares in a deal the companies expect to be completed
this fall. The companies predicted that the merger will generate
savings of about $30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Newmont, based in Denver, plans to develop and drill on Battle
Mountain's land in Phoenix, located within 30 miles of Newmont's
Lone Tree complex in Nevada. The property had year-end reserves of
5.7 million ounces of gold and 430 million pounds of copper
--reserves Newmont believes, along with the reserves at Battle
Mountain's adjacent holdings, could increase significantly. Newmont
will also acquire property in Canada, Bolivia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a thorough review of the Phoenix project, which is the
prime attraction for us, we concur with Battle Mountain Gold's
management that it is one of the best undeveloped gold properties
in North America,'' Ronald C. Cambre, Newmont's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Newmont expects to save $25 million to $30 million by using in
Phoenix surplus mining equipment from the Mesquite mine in
California and Mule Canyon in Nevada, where deposits are being
mined out. It plans to eliminate smelting costs, reduce
transportation charges and increase recovery rates for gold and
copper by processing gold and copper concentrate from Phoonix
through its Lone Tree autoclave.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Houston, Battle Mountain was formed as a spinoff of
Pennzoil in 1985 and merged with Hemlo Gold Mines in 1996.

THE RETURN OF THE AMIGA, A DESKTOP CULT CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the little computer that won't. Die, that is. For years,
the little Amiga, a machine regarded highly but not widely, has
been considered all but extinct.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new chapter in the life of the Amiga, a computer that
spent years being shunted from foster home to foster home, it has
finally found an owner who is determined not only to keep it alive
but also to make it thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Bill McEwen, a 38-year-old former truck driver,
bought Amiga's remaining assets, and earlier this month his freshly
minted Amiga Inc. released a software developers' kit for
programmers writing applications for a new version of the Amiga
operating system. Those applications will run on a new Amiga that
is expected to be on the market by the end of the year. Like the
old Amigas, the new one promises a lean operating system (that
boots up quickly) and good graphics.
</P>
<P>
   As Amiga loyalists go _ and they are a fanatical bunch who make
Apple partisans look apathetic _ McEwen came late to the fold. But
he is determined to see the Amiga operating system make its way
onto computers, personal digital assistants and cell phones
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refer to it as the VW bug,'' McEwen said. ``It was so
popular because it was functional, it did what it was supposed to
do, and ahead of its time in so many ways, and then they brought it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first Amiga was introduced in 1985, when a memorable
demonstration of ``Boing,'' a red and white bouncing ball, showed
off the machine's ability to handle color, animation and sound, it
has been cherished by its owners. Andy Warhol was among its early
fans. Lemmings, Sensible Soccer and Sim City games all started out
on the Amiga.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer failed to attract a critical mass, and for
years it has been considered a quaint relic of the personal
computing past.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7 million Amigas have been sold worldwide (compared with
the 475 million machines running Microsoft's Windows, and 31
million Macintoshes, according to Dataquest, a market research
company). And of those, some 500,000 are still used, with varying
degrees of ardency, said Andrew Korn, editor of Amiga Active, a
British magazine that is one of dozens of publications dedicated to
the topic of the Amiga.
</P>
<P>
   The computer has a small but fiercely loyal following,
especially in Europe. Amigans, as they call themselves, hold up the
computer, with its streamlined operating system, as the antithesis
of today's PCs, which they consider to be bloated with code. While
the Windows operating system can need as much as 400 megabytes of
disk space, the new Amiga operating system will take only 5
megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Korn said that at Amiga trade shows around the world _ attended
by anywhere from 500 to 2,000 Amigans _ he had seen people with
their heads shaved and dyed in the red-and-white checkered pattern
of the original Boing ball, which has become the computer's de
facto logo. He has seen people with Boing tattoos and people in
double-breasted, custom-tailored red-and-white checkered suits.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to raw computing power, the Amiga is an anemic
little machine. Still, it continues to show up in surprising
places. The actor Dick Van Dyke owns three. NASA uses them, and so
does a small cadre of Disney animators.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke said he bought his first Amiga in 1991 and quickly
became hooked. ``I just plugged it in and turned it on and started
doing animations,'' said Van Dyke, who uses his Amiga for 3-D
animation and special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke said he had Amiga bumper stickers on his car and
regularly drove to Los Angeles from his home in Malibu to attend
meetings of the small but active local users group. ``We're
rabid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Korn said, ``Like with car owners, there are a lot of people who
love the machine, but the reason is because of what they can do
with it rather than what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   After Commodore, Amiga's parent company, folded in 1994, it sold
its Amiga computer line to a German computer retailer, Escom AG.
But there, too, the computer languished and production stopped
altogether when Escom went bankrupt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, prospects brightened when the PC manufacturer Gateway
bought Amiga and promised to bring out a new, more powerful
computer. McEwen said Gateway had mostly been interested in Amiga's
40 or so valuable patents, for video and sound card technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway hired McEwen, a large, lumbering man who went into
computer sales after leaving his family's trucking business in the
mid-1980s, as its chief evangelist for the Amiga. McEwen had not
owned an Amiga before but was immediately smitten and soon came to
consider himself one of the clan.

LIST OF `SURVIVOR' WANNABES TOSSED BUT NOT FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a show like ``Survivor'' succeeds on a mainstream network,
the copycats descend like moths to a bright idea. Remember all the
game shows that surfaced and quickly withered after ``Who Wants To
Be a Millionaire'' proved that Americans would watch a prime-time
game show?
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of ``Survivor,'' there'll be plenty more voyeuristic
``reality'' programming, which, if anything, proves MTV knew what
it was doing by putting ``The Real World'' and ``Road Rules'' on
about 30 times a day.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the sincerely flattering imitation will make it
to air. Strange as it seems, programming executives are a choosy
lot, and from a Dumpster beneath a burned-out streetlight in
Burbank come these recently discarded plans to combat _ with
similar-sounding knock-offs _ the unexpected success of CBS's
summertime hit. Appearing after each working title is the show's
premise and the apparent reason the idea was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serve Ivar's.'' Premise: Sixteen patrons, marooned inside a
Seattle seafood restaurant, are forced to eat fried clams for three
months. Reason rejected: Risk of repeated exposure to tartar sauce
has never been completely studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subscriber.'' Premise: Sixteen women must sign up for a year
of O, the Oprah Magazine, and count the total number of references
to Ms. Winfrey. Reason rejected: Nobody can count that high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imbiber.'' Premise: Sixteen people living on a traffic island
in St. Louis must drink a six-pack a day without going to the
bathroom. Champion holder of water wins a kidney transplant or cash
equivalent. Reason rejected: Fluctuating price of kidneys on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godiva.'' Premise: Sixteen partially naked women race 16
completely naked horses on a South Seas beach. Winner gets a
lifetime assortment of pricey chocolates. Reason rejected:
Chocolate activists protest mistreatment of bon-bons in tropical
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contriver.'' Premise: Sixteen writers are locked in a room and
forced to come up with fresh, new ideas for a TV sitcom. First to
suggest Betty White as the wacky neighbor becomes network
president. Reason rejected: No current openings at the networks.
(Concept could be revived for midseason schedule, though.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Fiber.'' Premise: Sixteen contestants in a Winnebago test
the All Raisin Bran Diet for 16 weeks. Reason rejected: Government
scientists fear lethal gas buildup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low Fiver.'' Premise: Sixteen executives, stuck in a board
room with nothing but a Power Point presentation on sexual
harassment, must refrain from high-fiving their colleagues when the
moderator tells sexist jokes. Reason rejected: Moderator gets
better-paying job as host of ``The Man Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saab/Volvo.'' Premise: Sixteen people spend a winter rotating
the tires of well-to-do Swedes. Fastest tire changer wins a trip to
Norway. Reason rejected: Swedes change their own tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revive Her.'' Premise: Sixteen college boys spend spring break
in Hawaii practicing CPR on former ``Baywatch'' babes. Reason
rejected: Too many contestants injured during chest-compression
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``MacGyver.'' Premise: Government agent must rescue 16 Americans
from an island prison using nothing but a toothpick, a used teabag
and some dental floss. Reason rejected: Too implausible.

 UNDATED: the clan.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But after two years and a series of false starts, a new Amiga
failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, it looked as though the end had finally come.
That's when McEwen and most members of Gateway's small Amiga team
lost their jobs and plans for resurrecting the computer were
scrapped yet again. The Amiga did not fit with the company's
``evolution and strategic direction,'' said John Spelich, a
spokesman for Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   McEwen put a finer point on it. ``Amiga was baggage to Gateway's
main business,'' he said. ``It wasn't an asset in their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   So passionate had McEwen become about the computer that he
quickly proposed to Gateway that he buy what remained of Amiga's
assets. It took him a month to raise the money to buy the rights to
the Amiga name; the remaining Amiga inventory, which consisted of
some 17,000 machines in Germany; and a worldwide distribution
channel already in place. Gateway kept the patents and licensed
them to McEwen. The price for everything, McEwen said, was ``in the
millions.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwen now has a staff of 20 in an office in Snoqualmie, Wash.,
east of Seattle. All but two employees got their start in computers
with Amigas, he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   McEwen recruited his director of technical support, Gary Peake,
directly from the ranks of the most serious users. Peake, 48, who
uprooted his family from Houston to work for McEwen, presides over
Team Amiga, a vocal group of stalwart fans who provide technical
support for other Amiga users and developers.
</P>
<P>
   Peake also owns one of the three Amiga computers that can be
found at the Snoqualmie headquarters. The rest of the office has
PCs, which can run with the new Amiga operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The spacious quarters leave plenty of room for expansion, and
McEwen plans to fill every square inch. He is currently seeking
second-round financing for his new venture.
</P>
<P>
   McEwen keeps a copy of the Bible on his desk at all times.
``Every so often a little inspiration helps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He travels to Amiga trade shows around the world. At a recent
show in Dusseldorf, where he went to show off the new software
developers' kit, some 1,800 people attended his presentations.
</P>
<P>
   McEwen said he had no plans for Amiga itself to build a new
machine. He is negotiating with a third-party hardware manufacturer
that will build a new desktop computer by using readily available
graphics chips, network cards and other components. The new
machine, which McEwen said would be priced at around $700, will be
called the Amiga One. ``I'm starting over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if you're in the United States looking for an
Amiga to buy, you won't have an easy time of it. That is because
most of the existing inventory conforms to European, not American,
video formats.
</P>
<P>
   But McEwen said he was far more interested in promoting the
Amiga operating system than any piece of hardware. To that end, he
has teamed up with a software company in Reading, England, to
overhaul the original operating system.
</P>
<P>
   McEwen said the new system was so versatile that it could be
adapted to operate not only on desktop computers but also on Web
appliances and cell phones. McEwen said a number of consumer
electronics companies were interested in the new Amiga operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will run on a lot of different hardware,'' Korn said.
``Software written for it will run on whatever the underlying
hardware is.''
</P>
<P>
   Amiga's new operating system also runs existing Amiga
applications through emulation software.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Hunt, a 34-year-old software engineer in Huntsville, Ala.,
who runs a Web site devoted to Amiga support, said the latest
developments had inspired optimism but also caution among his
fellow Amigans. ``It's hard when you've been sitting here for 15
years, waiting for the thing to take off like you knew it could,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, McEwen said, he is determined not to
disappoint the likes of Hunt. ``When the Amiga came out the first
time, it was revolutionary and that's what we're setting out to do
again,'' he said. ``It will work. There's no doubt in my mind that
it will work.''

 &HT;    Lang's latest frolicks with groovy melodies
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pasty-skinned Canadian K.D. Lang is the last person you would
expect to be frolicking in the sunny sun of Southern California.
But on this new CD, she has raised the Venetian blinds, tacked up
some flower power posters on the wall and tossed the gloom and
melancholy of her recent works out the picture window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invincible Summer'' finds Lang in the role of a love-struck,
junior high ingenue, circa 1967. These 11 tunes are lifted straight
from the groovy, innocent days when Burt Bacharach, the Turtles and
the Mamas &AMP; Papas defined the sounds of summer _ breezy melodies,
Herb Alpert horns, bah-bah-bah background vocals, Jimmy Webb
strings. Like Shelby Lynne, who recently resurrected the Memphis
soul sounds of that often-dismissed era, Lang has mined the best
elements of the early days of hippie pop/rock, before the harder
edges of FM radio strip-mined the legitimacy out of jukebox music.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the arrangements draw from the kind of sweetly
innocent, piano/horn melodies that sent America seeking the way to
San Jose, Lang infuses the material with contemporary touches, such
as dribblings of techno keyboard beeps and harmonies that stray
beyond the three chords of most let's-grow-bangs music. On tracks
such as ``When We Collide,'' she dips into the orchestral
experimentation of the Beatles at their most excessive ``Day in the
Life'' studio explorations. ``Only Love'' is an electronic version
of the James Bond theme, ``You Only Live Twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely, Lang sounds like the mood singer of her ``Constant
Craving'' era, weaving hypnotic vocals over the period music like
someone aimlessly drifting on a bright, plastic pool float. It's
fresh in a remotely nostalgic kind of way, entrenching Lang in her
mid-career as Sade for the hip.

   Listening to the Jazzyfatnastees debut is something like lying
on a table, readying yourself for a massage. Atmospheric singers
coo out of the speakers, accompanied by a twinkling keyboard (``The
Wound'') or a sensual tug at a cello string (``Sail the Seas'').
Songs pass. And alas, the masseuse never comes. As pleasant and
melodious as Tracey Moore and Mercedes Martinez's vocals are _
particularly on the spare, '60s soul throwback ``Breakthrough'' _
and as lyrically purposeful as they try to be _ none of this nicely
produced CD ever really digs in and connects.

   Maintaining what is likely one of the weakest work ethics in
popular music, cult icon Alex Chilton (formerly of the Box Tops and
Big Star) resurfaces every few years with another collection of
charmingingly tossed-off R&AMP;B covers. This ``Set,'' which includes
versions of ``Oogum Boogum'' and ``You's a Viper,'' was recorded in
a single February day in 1999. It sounds like it was the day after
a long night out. Chilton's famously flimsy voice is at its
thinnest, and the band takes what can only be called a hands-off
approach to tuning. If you heard some no-name group at a frat party
play like this, you'd probably leave. Coming from a bona fide rock
legend, though, it sounds ragged and right.

 &HT;    Courage brings exciting cinema out of closet
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Gay Pride Week in Atlanta, making it a good time to reflect
on how far gay and lesbian cinema has come. These days, some of the
most exciting work in movies has a gay/lesbian theme; some of the
most honored work, too. Gender issues were central to Hilary
Swank's Oscar-winning portrayal in ``Boys Don't Cry.'' In fact, gay
or lesbian characters have become so, well, ``safe'' that they can
be the center of a TV sitcom (``Will &AMP; Grace''). But it wasn't
always that way. Here are a few titles _ some dated, some not _
made back when it took some guts to be out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Parting Glances'' (1986): Slight but oh-so-right. Filmmaker
Bill Sherwood takes his characters' sexual orientation as a given,
something you didn't see much of in the mid-'80s. The film's
cute-couple-in-Manhattan opening could kick off a dozen romantic
comedies. The difference is that this cute couple is Robert (John
Bolger) and Michael (Richard Ganoung). The picture centers on
Robert's last night in town; he's about to take a job overseas and
leave Michael, his live-in lover of six years. Most of their last
24 hours together are spent at a farewell party that has down cold
one corner of the gay scene at that time _ from the cover-up
marriages to an aging queen's come-on. This was, alas, Sherwood's
only movie; he died of AIDS in 1990. But he had an eye for talent.
The picture's most blazing presence is a young Steve Buscemi, as an
AIDS patient whose body may be breaking down, but whose mind is
still sharp, rude and very funny.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Prick Up Your Ears'' (1987): An enthralling bio-pic of the
naughty-boy wonder, playwright Joe Orton, whose thumb-nosing farces
(``Loot,'' among others) made him the toast of swinging London. He
was murdered in 1967 by his longtime lover, Kenneth Halliwell, who
then committed suicide. Based on John Lahr's biography of the same
name, Stephen Frears' film jumps around chronologically, with a
postmortem framework provided by Lahr's (Wallace Shawn) efforts to
figure out this lord of misrule. Orton truly believed that a day
without sex with a total stranger was like a day without ... well,
you get the idea. The movie is somewhat flawed as psychodrama, but
it's a tremendous actor's showcase. And no wonder. Gary Oldman
plays Orton with charisma to burn and Alfred Molina is poor,
unhappy Halliwell.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Boys in the Band'' (1970): Viewed today, this is either
campy or appalling (or maybe both), depending on your mood. But
remember that when it was released 30 years ago, it was the first
major Hollywood film entirely out front (so to speak) about
homosexuality. Based on a play by Matt Crowley and directed by
William Friedkin (yes, ``The Exorcist'' guy), the movie takes place
at a birthday party given by Kenneth Nelson (who once starred in
``The Fantastiks''). There's plenty of swishy behavior and bitchy,
back-biting humor, but at heart the film is a rather touchingly
dated ``we're just like you!'' plea for tolerance. Again, it looks
like a period piece now, as embarrassing in some ways as
African-American stereotypes from pre-'60s Hollywood. But in 1970,
it took courage to get it made.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Celluloid Closet'' (1995): A not-to-be missed outing in
every sense of the word. Narrated by Lily Tomlin, this amusing and
illuminating documentary examines images of lesbians and gays in
movies for the past 100 years. Based on Vito Russo's book, it's
pretty much essential viewing _ an amazing prism through which to
view both cinema and society.

 &HT;    The rejuvenation of Gilbert and Sullivan
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A love of the theater can help you appreciate Mike Leigh's
meticulously detailed valentine to 19th-century performers. At
first glance, the film seems to be a startling departure from
Leigh's usual kitchen-sink realism (``Naked,'' ``Secrets &AMP; Lies'').
But it's not really. Despite the period costumes and Victorian
furniture, the writer-director is continuing to do what he does
best: document everyday moments and present a detailed slice of
life.
</P>
<P>
   This slice just happens to be set 100 years ago, populated with
historical characters instead of fictional: librettist-director
William Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and composer Arthur Sullivan (Allan
Corduner). Covering only a tiny portion of their career,
``Topsy-Turvy'' focuses on the rejuvenation of the men's
partnership when Gilbert, inspired by a Japanese expo, comes up
with the idea for ``The Mikado.''
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Leigh shows us that the blissful upside-down worlds
Gilbert and Sullivan created were a place that everyone _ including
the artists involved _ could escape to as a way to forget the
everyday disappointments of real life. Timothy Spall's character
sums up the movie's theme succinctly with three words: ``laughter,
tears, curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   `Topsy-Turvy'
</P>
<P>
   Rated R / Our critic's grade: A -
</P>

<P>
   OTHER NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Anna and the King'' (PG-13) _ Maybe we didn't need another
version, but this one is handsome and engaging. Jodie Foster and
Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish, songless costume drama that holds
its own against the beloved 1956 musical ``The King and I.'' It's a
mix of old-fashioned moviemaking doused with contemporary political
correctness. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Edge of Seventeen'' (unrated) _ Not much cutting edge here,
but this teen saga about coming out and coming of age in 1984
small-town Ohio has a refreshingly unforced tone and a really
appealing young lead (Chris Stafford, who, depending on the angle,
recalls either a young Jim Carrey or a young Tom Cruise). What
works best here _ along with some sly time-capsule touches _ is the
way Stafford doesn't just discover a new sense of sexual
orientation, he discovers a new sense of himself as a whole. Grade:
B
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sweet and Lowdown'' (R) _ This jazzy little doodle of a
mockumentary is middling Woody Allen and, as such, mildly likable
once you get past the insistent whiff of self-justification. Sean
Penn is superb as a legendary (and fictional) jazz guitarist in the
1930s who's an angel with a guitar in his hands and a louse the
rest of the time. He takes up with a waifish mute (Samantha Morton)
_ she's sweet; he's lowdown _ but his selfishness, womanizing and
drinking work against them. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Liberty Heights'' (R) _ Like warmed-over chicken soup. Barry
Levinson's memory movie about coming of age in a Jewish
neighborhood in '50s Baltimore is generally well-acted and
sometimes evocative. But his anecdotal reminiscences concerning the
Kurtman brothers _ sensitive Adrien Brody and irrepressible Ben
Foster _ don't convey much that's fresh or surprising. Joe Mantegna
brings an unexpected dignity and a nuanced self-knowledge to the
role of the boys' numbers-running dad. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bicentennial Man'' (PG) _ Huggy-feely Robin Williams plays
the android Andrews, a metallic butler who slowly develops human
traits (creativity, curiosity and a hint of emotion). But the
people around him age, wither, die. Overlong, ``Man'' moves swiftly
for its first 90 minutes, but it slows down to become a
disappointingly conventional love story that isn't really
persuasive. The movie has a heart, but a flagging pulse. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' (R) _ It's choppy and cheap
looking, and it has dead spots like the Sahara, but it also has a
surprising number of genuinely funny bits, most of them slapsticky
and gleefully rude. Rob Schneider plays Deuce, a fish tender who
moonlights as a ``manwhore,'' and, although he has never been funny
for more than three minutes at any previous time in his career, he
sustains a level of genial, tasteless humor. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Chris Hewitt, Knight Ridder
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Gun Shy'' (R) _ Stressed-out undercover drug cop Liam Neeson
matches ulcers with stressed-out junior mafioso Oliver Platt in a
deeply funky New York comedy about murder, stomach disorders and
male anxiety. It's scattershot, but it scores a few surprising
satirical bull's-eyes. Love interest Sandra Bullock's screen time
is unwisely minimized by producer Sandra Bullock. Grade: C+

 &HT;    Celebrity chefs come out of kitchen
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once, their names were known only to restaurateurs, food critics
and an esoteric circle of gourmets and foodies as they worked their
magic behind the scenes. Now, scores of celebrity chefs have come
out of the kitchen _ emerging with publicists, agents, entourages,
fan clubs, product endorsements and listings in Forbes magazine _
to garner their share of wealth, fame and public adulation in the
rarefied atmosphere occupied by sports heroes, movie stars and
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   What has been called the food renaissance that began in the
1990s has propelled the once invisible chef to a high-visibility,
high-stature role of entertainer, artist and magician, who creates
drama, spectacle, excitement and pleasure for masses of people who
just can't seem to get enough.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought, less than a decade ago, that there would
be a 24-hour-a-day television channel devoted to food that reaches
more than 45 million homes and continues to grow?
</P>
<P>
   The aura and excitement generated by this new breed of chef seem
to be spreading as people enroll in culinary schools in
unprecedented numbers. In 1992 the New York Restaurant School had
400 students; four years later, enrollment had reached 1,000. When
the Culinary Institute of America, headquartered in Hyde Park,
N.Y., opened its Greystone campus in California in 1995, the
maximum enrollment of 2,000 was reached almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   And not all these fledgling chefs are kids, either. Many are
leaving longtime careers to follow their heart's desire into the
kitchen. Of the students enrolled at Manhattan's French Culinary
Institute in 1996, 85 percent were career-changers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these new chefs won't all become famous, but there
are plenty of jobs out there for them, celebrity or not. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics reports that jobs for skilled cooks rose from
408,000 in 1983 to 727,000 in 1996, and the category is expected to
increase by 14.6 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what Julia Child started in the early 1960s, when she
appeared on public television and became the first chef to become a
household word, has now become ``chef hysteria,'' says Leonard
Pickell, who heads the James Beard Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the celebrity chef heap, without question, is
Emeril Lagasse. When the Food Network superstar visited Chicago
last year, one newspaper compared the excitement to that inspired
by a papal visit. The Food Network reports that it gets more than
150,000 requests every week for the 1,500 seats to see this earthy
and engaging native of Fall River, Mass., ``kick it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are scores of other celebrity chefs who have captured
our imagination. Old favorites such as Graham Kerr, the ``Galloping
Gourmet'' (who is still galloping), Jacques Pepin, Justin Wilson
and, of course, Julia Child still hold a place in our hearts. Add
to these old-timers names like Curtis Aikens, an Atlanta native who
has gained national fame as a health food expert, consumer food
advocate, cookbook author and host of the popular Food Network show
``Pick of the Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Hot Off the Grill With Bobby Flay,'' a master of
Southwestern cuisine who developed a cult following in New York
food circles after he opened his now-celebrated Mesa Grill there
and The New York Times gushed that it ``surpasses anything of its
kind elsewhere in New York.'' And there's Mario Batali (``Molto
Mario''), Alton Brown (``Good Eats''), Sissy Biggers (``Ready . . .
Set . . . Cook!''), Jacqui Malouf (``Hot Off the Grill''), Sara
Moulton (``Cooking Live''), Tyler Florence (``Food 911'') and a
host of others, each with impressive resumes and adoring and
dedicated fans.

 &HT;    Former railroad town picks up steam again
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLINGBROKE, Ga. _ This tiny town is on a byway _ U.S. 41 _ but
maybe it should be called a buy-way.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly a little railroad and farming community in Monroe
County, about 70 miles from downtown Atlanta, Bolingbroke has
morphed into an antique lover's destination.
</P>
<P>
   While it doesn't have an abundance of gift and antique stores,
it has enough to keep shoppers content and happy. Four stores are
chock-full of goodies ranging from old syrup buckets ($20) to a
vintage hat stand ($60) to an early 19th-century English mahogany
secretary ($11,200). The fifth, Bolingbroke Country Gardens, sells
plants and garden accessories as well as offering nursery and
landscape services. All are within walking distance or a short ride
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the whole scenario,'' said Esmeralda Wells of Roswell,
Ga., strolling through the 5-year-old shop Galligans of Bolingbroke
on a recent Thursday morning. ``The scene takes you back in time.
Fortunately, the town has retained its character with these
charming shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Shop owner Mary Stewart Galligan dabbles in a bit of everything,
from antique china and pine furniture to new sterling silver
jewelry and charms. ``I carry so much variety because customers buy
everything and anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolingbroke was established in 1824 as Stallings Store; it
changed its name to Prattsville in 1844. Six years later, the town
became Colaparchee. The current moniker was bestowed by Central
Georgia Railroad President William M. Wadley in 1866, to honor
Englishman and author Lord Bolingbroke, whom he admired.
</P>
<P>
   Wadley was the great-grandfather of Beverly Mickle, who
currently owns the only restaurant in town, Sweet Sue's Tea Room
and Soda Fountain. ``My wife's great-grandfather was responsible
for rebuilding the railroads in the South,'' said Jim Mickle, the
unofficial mayor of Bolingbroke. ``That's how our town came about,
and thrived. There were lots of businesses here until 1935, when a
steam engine exploded and killed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, an antique shop opened. Others followed, and a
community developed. While shops have come and gone, the current
crop has been around long enough to see business grow. And
Bolingbroke's location, with its easy access to I-75, makes it
attractive to shoppers from Atlanta, Macon, Forsyth, Perry and
South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The most established store is the 10-year-old Antiques at
Bolingbroke, housed in a charming 1874 cottage, plus two
warehouses. Owners Jerry and Elaine Schmitt specialize in late
18th-century, 19th-century and early 20th-century American and
English furniture. Not many places offer you fresh-squeezed
lemonade while you hunt for that perfect armoire or dining room
table. Elaine says her customers are from all over the country, and
she regularly ships furniture to New York and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's of Bolingbroke is an unusual business that features
gifts, antiques and decorative accessories. Fifteen people banded
together three years ago to buy an eclectic mix of merchandise.
They rent space in a rambling 1920s house owned by Mickle and
display their specialties _ children's clothing, home accessories,
rugs, artwork, jewelry and new and antique furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all work together to run the shop,'' said Phillipa
Shoffner. ``Each person works two days a month helping customers.
Someone waters the plants; someone else does the advertising; yet
another person does the book work. ``And it's amazing that with 15
people we never have arguments!''
</P>
<P>
   For art lovers, a must stop is 4 1/2-year-old Stofko-Dixon Line
Fine Art Gallery &AMP; Studio, where owner and artist Ernestine
Stofko-Dixon holds classes for all ages. She also represents about
35 area artists, selling their works, which range from acrylic on
canvas landscapes to wood bowls to pottery. One such artist is
Trudi McKinley of Alpharetta, who specializes in painted garden
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask how many residents live in this cute little village,
you'll get the answer ``300 residents and one sorehead.'' And who
is the sorehead?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the shoe fits, wear it,'' says Jim Mickle with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take I-75 south to I-475 (Exit 177). Take Exit
15 (the first exit) and turn right at the end of the ramp onto U.S.
41. Bolingbroke is about half a mile.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Business hours vary. Call ahead.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Ample free parking in front of or behind the shops.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Restrooms are located in Sweet Sue's Tea Room &AMP;
Soda Fountain or in individual stores.

   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Sue's Tea Room &AMP; Soda Fountain. Step back into the past at
this eatery _ formerly a feed store and general store _ that dishes
up plenty of nostalgia for lunch and afternoon tea. It also boasts
a 1920s soda fountain that still dispenses old-fash-
</P>
<P>
   ioned phosphates: a Green River, a Zombie or a Pink Lady (each
$1.25) and what one fan calls ``the best chocolate soda in
Georgia'' ($1.95). For more substantial fare on a hot day, nothing
beats the Tea Sandwich Plate ($4.95) _ petite chicken salad and
cream cheese sandwiches with cheese wafers and creamy frozen fruit
salad, just like Rich's Magnolia Room used to serve. Other choices:
the quiche, small garden salad and fresh fruit ($5.95) or a
homemade pimento cheese sandwich ($2.95). And the dessert of
choice? A cream puff filled with vanilla ice cream topped with
praline sauce ($2.95). Owner Sue Mickle named her 4 1/2-year-old
tearoom after her aunt Sue Wadley, ``a special person in my life.''
To give it a nostalgic feel, she has decorated the restaurant with
her aunt's keepsakes and pictures. 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Mondays-

   Q: I have been looking everywhere for Kenneth Jay Lane jewelry.
It came into prominence when Barbara Bush was first lady. I ordered
some pieces and was very satisfied. I tried to reorder, but I can
no longer find anyone selling the jewelry line.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jean Warren, Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Former first lady Barbara Bush is a big fan of Kenneth Jay
Lane pearls, which she wear as a three-strand choker with daytime
silks as well as evening satins. But Lane jewelry is much more than
just pearls. The New York designer started his business in the '60s
with a pair of sparkly earrings. Some of his designs, shown here,
include a starfish pin ($110) and a colorful ``pebble'' necklace
($155). He's also known for art deco-inspired pins and ``bug''
earrings. Fans include Jackie Collins, Nancy Reagan and Raquel
Welch. His collection is available exclusively at Beth Ann, an
image and accessory boutique at 47 Irby Ave. (404-233-4424).
</P>
<P>
   ``His jewelry is not serious,'' says shop owner Beth Ann
Taratoot. ``Many women wear some of their real jewelry with Kenneth
Jay Lane pieces for an eclectic mix. And women of all ages can wear
his earrings and pins.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: After reading about the possible absorption of harsh
hair-coloring chemicals into the bloodstream during pregnancy, I
heard about Avigal, an all-natural, plant-based henna. I would like
to know where I can find it or which salon uses this henna.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alisa Crovetti, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: For millennia, women have used henna to color or highlight
their hair. Avigal henna, an all-natural hair color, is derived
from the leaves of the plant Lawsonia inermis, found in Saudi
Arabia, Iran, India, Egypt and Morocco. It comes in three shades _
red, black and colorless or natural. And it's the combination of
these three that creates the shades of Avigal henna, ranging from
hazel and champagne to cognac, copper, auburn and burgundy. Each
shade _ there are 12 in all, plus natural _ will look slightly
different on each individual. Currently no one in Atlanta sells
Avigal henna, but you can order it at 1-800-722-1011. Prices range
from a 4.5-ounce package at $9 to a 32.5-ounce bag for $35.
</P>
<P>
   Henna can be used on any type of hair _ virgin, tinted,
bleached, permed or streaked, says Avigal founder Ilana Harkavi.
She adds, ``It also conditions hair abused by chemicals, adds body
and texture and helps to strengthen hair.''

ENERGY SECRETARY REASSURES SENATORS ON MISSING HARD DRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson went to Capitol
Hill on Wednesday to reassure skeptical lawmakers about security in
nuclear laboratories, telling them there was ``no evidence of
espionage'' in the recent disappearance and subsequent recovery of
two sensitive computer hard drives at the Los Alamos laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary doubtless knew that bitter criticism awaited him
in the hearing room, so he was not surprised when he got it, from
senators of both parties at a session of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight, Mr. Secretary, was yours, and I believe you've
lost,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who heads the Senate
Intelligence Committee and sat in on Wednesday's Armed Services
Committee hearing. ``I believe you've lost what credibility you
have left on Capitol Hill, and I think it's time for you to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson gamely insisted he was trying to improve security
consciousness at the laboratories, putting into effect procedures
that are compatible with secrecy as well as science, and that in
many ways he was succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI is still looking at the two hard drives found last
Friday at the Los Alamos National Lab,'' Richardson testified.
``I've been speaking with FBI Director Louis Freeh throughout,
spoke with him this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary said the two drives found behind a copying machine
had been determined by the FBI to be genuine _ a question that had
not been widely raised _ and that ``there is no evidence of
espionage, nor is there evidence that the drives ever left the Los
Alamos X Division.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos officials announced a week ago Monday that the hard
drives containing nuclear data were missing, then announced on
Friday that they had been found behind the copier. The hard drives
were used to store weapons data needed by an emergency team that
responds to nuclear accidents and nuclear-related threats. The
drives contained design data about weapons from China, France,
Russia and the United States that could be used to disarm weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After their discovery on Friday, the drives were flown to
Washington for analysis to determine whether they had been tampered
with. Richardson's testimony indicated that, initially at least, no
such evidence had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary said the drives were still being studied for
fingerprints. He speculated that their mishandling might have been
the result of carelessness, and that a lab employee might have been
too frightened to acknowledge what was indisputably a grave
security lapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no excuses,'' Richardson said. ``It's unacceptable,
incomprehensible to me what happened. I will not rest until I know
what happened, when, where, why and by whom.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode of the missing and suddenly-rediscovered hard drives
is the latest in a string of embarrassing security lapses
associated with the laboratories, a fact that senators brought out
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one more potentially catastrophic security
failure which has become an all-too-familiar pattern,'' said Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services Committee.

 &HT;    X marks the spot

<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, Texas _ The dirt near the water is dark and sticky and
thick with clues just a few inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists rake the ground for ceramics, weapons, the bones
of soldiers buried before Texas was Texas. Nothing slips their
attention. Everything fetched from the clay of this old cattle
ranch is cleaned, dried, tagged and bagged in the hope that before
long, what is left of the first European colony in the state will
be dug from the banks of Garcitas Creek and preserved to explain
the rise and tragic fall of Fort St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The fort was founded by the French explorer Rene Robert
Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. He and about 180 colonists built Fort
St. Louis in 1685. Three years later, the settlement was gone.
Disease, abandonment and a surprise winter ambush by Karankawa
Indians claimed the brief but significant life of Fort St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers with the Texas Historical Commission have been
interested in the site for decades but especially since 1996, when
the fort's location was confirmed. That year, a ranch foreman swept
a metal detector over a mound and found eight iron cannons from
France, laid together like matchsticks above the brackish Garcitas,
four miles upstream of Lavaca Bay and 20 miles from the Gulf of
Mexico that carried the colonists to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists began excavating for artifacts this January. More
than 16,000 have been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other site like Fort St. Louis in Texas,'' said
Michael Davis, an archaeologist and director of special projects
with the historical commission who compared the historical
significance of the site to that of Jamestown in Virginia and
Plymouth in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed over the years. The land today resembles the
land three centuries ago. Mesquites grow near bluebonnets, which
sprout near mushrooms on a warm, soggy morning. Diamondback
rattlesnakes live here (the archaeologists have seen at least
seven). So do feral hogs and alligators.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen archaeologists have been at work at the fort site,
which occupies about 30 acres on the Coastal Bend. They've found a
range of artifacts, from half a pair of wooden dice to inchlong,
evil-warding bronze ficas that dangled from horse bridles to many
thousands of glazed, ceramic shards from certain regions of France.
Musket balls, arrow points, earrings and a French coin also have
been taken from the dense soil known as clay gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me goose bumps,'' field archaeologist Robyn Pry said.
</P>
<P>
   With each artifact the archaeologists find, the fort becomes
more whole and complete, and within a few years the artifacts taken
from the ground will be sent to museums across Texas. Then Texans
can see what was left behind by the doomed French explorers and
their leader, La Salle.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for his travels through the Great Lakes, finding the
Mississippi River and laying claim to territory known later as the
Louisiana Purchase, La Salle sailed from France to the New World in
1684. He hoped to arrive at the mouth of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   He misjudged badly. The La Salle expedition ended up in
Matagorda Bay, hundreds of miles west of what became New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Two of La Salle's four vessels _ La Belle, L'Aimable, Le Joly
and St. Francois _ eventually sank. The project to raise La Belle
from the bay ended in 1997. The ship now is being reconstructed, a
process that will take years. The wreckage of L'Aimable was never
found.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two other ships, St. Francois was lost to pirates en
route in the Caribbean. And the Joly later sailed back to France
with disgruntled settlers aboard.
</P>
<P>
   La Salle's expedition party settled on the first high point in
Garcitas Creek, but problems in the settlement forced him and some
of his men to seek help from the nearest French settlement in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next influenced the future of the New World.
</P>
<P>
   In 1687, on the way to Illinois to find help for the troubled
fort, La Salle's companions killed him and dumped his body in the
East Texas brush.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, smallpox was creeping through Fort St. Louis, killing
colonists. Then, less than a year after La Salle's death, the fort
was raided by the Karankawas. Only the children were spared.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish explorers found the fort in 1689, and they built a
presidio, or military post, on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was considered Spanish country, and the French jumped
in,'' said historian William Foster of nearby Cuero, who is not
associated with the archaeological project. ``It was a very
aggressive move by France and a very large move.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers involved in the Fort St. Louis recovery consider the
daring French colonization in Texas a defining moment in Spanish
interest in the New World. Spain was interested in protecting its
silver mines in northern Mexico, so when the French arrived, the
Spanish moved more quickly to establish their own presence in
Texas. The French forced Spain to take Texas more seriously,
historians say, and Spain did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have the Spanish background right now,'' said
Jim Bruseth, the director of the historical commission's
archaeological division. If the French presence had won out over
the Spanish, ``Texas history, and Southern history, could've taken
an entirely different course.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Fort St. Louis has given much to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There are tales of shipwrecks, expeditions, famous explorers,
massacres. There are stories such as the one Bruseth likes to tell
when he's standing over a part of the site where, in 1689, the body
of a French woman was found, half-eaten by wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That evening, over a fire, a Spanish soldier put together our
first Texas poem,'' Bruseth said, and it was an ode to the death of
the woman from France.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs in the ground still. The copper rivets found
close to the creek show how parts of the French fort were built.
The mortar found farther from the creek shows how the Spanish
presidio was built.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no signs of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the soil lay the bones of as many as 90 French
colonists. Archaeologists believe there's a cemetery near Fort St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows where, and time is running short. The $1.5
million in grants, donations and state money supporting the
archaeological project can sustain the work through fall, Bruseth
said, but the archaeologists have permission from the landowners to
stay for another year.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the archaeologists must go. And this secluded creek
bank of mesquites and mysteries will fall quiet again, just as it
did when the last colonists died and were buried, somewhere out
here.

 &HT;    BILL WOULD REIMBURSE STATES DOING GUN BACKGROUND CHECKS
 &HT;    450&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ States that perform their own background checks for
gun purchases could get federal compensation under a Senate bill
introduced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan legislation would authorize $150 million for the
next three years to reimburse ``point of contact'' states, those
that agree to conduct all background searches for gun purchases
themselves rather than relying on the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies indicate that point-of-contact states do a better job
of conducting background checks than the FBI,'' Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah, a co-sponsor of the bill, said at a Judiciary
Committee hearing. ``States have advantages, including better
access to court records and a better understanding of state
firearms laws.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the number of states using point-of-contact systems has
fallen from 23 in 1999 to 15 this year. Several others, including
Florida, are considering terminating their systems due to
increasing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said at the hearing that Congress
needs to reimburse states that serve as point-of-contact centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illinois spends about $600,000 a year for its point-of-contact
system to run effective background checks,'' Durbin said.
``Congress needs to remedy this because Illinois pays the full cost
of these mandated background checks while other states pay nothing
and simply rely on the FBI to conduct the gun background checks.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first 18 months of operation since the Brady Act began
requiring background checks for gun purchases, the point-of-contact
states have conducted 7.7 million checks, more than half the nearly
13.4 million nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Max Schlueter, director of the Vermont Crime Information Center,
told the panel that states do a better job than the FBI because
they review more records of people in prohibited categories, such
as people involuntarily committed to a mental institution or under
a domestic violence restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Vermont, 80 percent of of our felony convictions are not
forwarded to the FBI because they are not fingerprint-supported,''
Schlueter said. ``In addition, Vermont does not contribute the vast
majority of wanted persons into the National Crime Information
Center data base.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate Majority leader and Republican presidential
candidate Bob Dole told the panel that the background checks need
to be improved because only 72 percent of the background checks are
done instantly.
</P>
<P>
   While 95 percent of the background checks are finished within
two hours, the other 5 percent can take more than three days, Dole
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, sales at gun shows also need to be
monitored. ``Criminals can circumvent the background check because
there aren't any at gun shows,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was introduced on the same day that the Treasury
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reported that
large numbers of guns firearms are illegally distributed by corrupt
gun dealers and at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   For the report, which Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers
called the most comprehensive ever about the illegal firearms
market, ATF investigated 1,530 gun transactions involving 84,128
firearms over two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,670 traffickers identified by ATF agents in those
investigations, 25 percent were convicted felons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun shows accounted for nearly 26,000 trafficked firearms, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report shows that loopholes in our laws help make gun
shows and corrupt gun dealers major channels for gun trafficking,''
President Clinton said in a statement. ``Many of the diverted
weapons supplied by traffickers were later used to commit serious
crimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association said the study underlined the
importance of enforcing current gun-control laws.

CIRCUITS Q &AMP; A: OF MODEMS AND E-MAILING LISTS

   When Modems Fail to Stay Connected &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I often get disconnected from the Internet when I am trying
to download files from the Web. Is it my computer or the site I'm
on that's causing this?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several things that could be causing the problem,
and you may want to start keeping track of the disconnection
incidents to see if you can spot any patterns. If other files of
the same size download with no problems, but you find yourself
repeatedly bumped offline when trying to download a particular
file, the problem could be with that file or the site it is on.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common causes of interrupted Internet
connections is telephone line noise. Static and scratchy sounds
that you may hear occasionally while you are on the phone can
really wreak havoc when your modem is using the line to communicate
with another modem. A sudden increase in line noise can sometimes
cause your modem to disconnect, no matter what you are doing
online.
</P>
<P>
   Your local phone company may be able to check your line for
excess noise that might be causing frequent modem disconnections.
Modems need far quieter lines to communicate than people do,
though, so the company may not be able to do anything if your line
doesn't sound consistently noisy.
</P>
<P>
   You might also check with the technical support department of
your Internet service provider to make sure you have the proper
settings in your communications software for your type of modem.
Some ISPs will also automatically log off users who are connected
for long periods of time, so you may want to ask about the
company's policy on the matter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I get off a software company's mailing list that I
never wanted to be on? I tried replying to the return address, but
my request to be taken off the list was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are different types of mailing lists and different ways
to get your e-mail address removed from one. Mailing lists can
range from academic discussion groups that you sign up for with a
specific moderator or ``list master'' to junk mail that fills up
your In box courtesy of programs that comb the Internet for e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent ``news'' updates from companies is a type of e-mail
that you may not have realized that you signed up for. It is not
exactly the same kind of unsolicited e-mail as spam, since you gave
the company your e-mail address at some point. A common way to
accidentally get yourself included on the mailing list is to fill
out a form on the Web to download a browser plug-in or free bit of
software.
</P>
<P>
   The site may ask for your e-mail address, but you may not notice
a small series of boxes elsewhere on the page relating to updates
about the company and its products. These boxes are usually checked
by default to request the e-mail updates, and it is up to you to
uncheck them if you don't want to receive the company's mail.
Software registration forms that you either mail in or fill out and
submit online are typical places you might see that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Before deleting the unwanted message from your computer, you
might try looking through the text to see if the sender has
included a specific e-mail address or Web site URL for you to use
if you have questions or problems with the mail or wish to be
removed from the company's mail list. A visit to the company's Web
site may also yield the contact information you need to get off the
list.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the Reply button on the message often does not work. In
many cases, the address in the reply header of the message is
different from that of the address that sent you the message, which
might be the polite reason why no one responded to your request.
</P>
<P>
   If you find that your mailbox is filling up with junk mail and
want to learn more about how to avoid it, you can visit the home
page of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail at
www.cauce.org.

   BBO-BRAVES-ELBOWS _ ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves are trying to
figure out why they are leading the league in elbow surgeries. When
Rudy Seanez' elbow popped last week, he became one of about 10
players throughout the franchise who have been forced to undergo
Tommy John surgery. John Smoltz and others give their thoughts
about why the elbows are going pop. (Wilkinson, Atlanta

<P>
   This is a good time of year to inspect the roof, chimney and
gutters. Naturally, this entails climbing a ladder to get up to the
roof. Unfortunately, many do- it-yourselfers (and a lot of
professionals) take ladder safety for granted; as a result, more
than 90,000 ladder-related accidents are reported each year.
</P>
<P>
   While most of these accidents happened because the users failed
to observe basic safety precautions, a few accidents occurred
because of equipment failure. Therefore it's a good idea to inspect
your ladder every time you use it.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure that all the rungs are clean, secure and undamaged,
and that the side rails are sound. Inspect all the bolts, nuts and
rivets to make sure they are tight. Never paint a ladder; the paint
will hide any defects, cracks or splits that could comprise the
ladder's structural integrity.
</P>
<P>
   All ladders sold in the United States are rated and labeled
according to their weight capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Type 1A ladders are designed for heavy-duty industrial use and
are rated up to 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Type II ladders are for medium-duty commercial chores and are
rated for a maximum of 225 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Type III ladders are for general household work and have a
maximum capacity of 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you know your ladder's weight rating and do not exceed
it. Remember to take into account not only your body weight but
also the weight of the tools, equipment and supplies you may have
to carry with you.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting up a ladder, evaluate the outside weather
conditions. Never set up a ladder on wet, rainy days or on windy
days. Most people are not aware that a strong wind can easily blow
over an aluminum or fiberglass extension ladder, even with a person
standing on it. Look carefully for the location of all electrical
wires and avoid positioning the ladder near them.
</P>
<P>
   Erecting an extension ladder is relatively easy if you place the
feet of the ladder against a solid surface, like the house
foundation, then raise the ladder up by walking from the far end
toward the feet with a hand-over-hand motion. When the ladder is
upright leaning against the side of the house, pull out the feet so
the ladder is angled against the house.
</P>
<P>
   The correct angle for the ladder should be one foot away from
the wall for every four feet the ladder rises; or to express it
another way, the base should be extended away from the house about
one-quarter of the ladder's length.
</P>
<P>
   There is an easy way to check this critical angle without having
to measure distances or lengths. Once the ladder is in position,
stand with your toes against the feet of the ladder. Extend your
arms straight out and grab the nearest ladder rung. If the ladder
is positioned correctly, your arms should be parallel to the ground
and you should be able to hold the rung without bending or
stretching.
</P>
<P>
   Before climbing on the ladder, make sure the feet are firmly
based on the ground. Some extension ladders have spikes attached to
the side rails. These can be pushed into the ground to keep the
feet from slipping. If your ladder doesn't have these, drive wooden
stakes into the ground on either side of the ladder and tie the
rails to them. If you are setting the ladder on uneven ground,
place a wide flat board under the feet of the ladder and level it
by inserting shims underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Use the flat pads attached to the bottom of the ladder rails
when working on flat, hard surfaces. On a wooden surface, like a
deck, nail or screw a wooden cleat to the boards to keep the ladder
from slipping. On damp or slippery surfaces have a helper stand in
front of the ladder and brace it while you are working above.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, secure the top of the ladder as well. If you are
working in a stationary position, you can drive a long construction
staple into a surface like the fascia board and thread a wire
through the staple then wrap the wire around a rung.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to stabilize the ladder is by attaching a ladder
stay (also called a stabilizer, or stand off) to the top of the
ladder. The stay is a light frame that projects on either side of
the rails to give the ladder wider support. Adjustable stays allow
you to position the ladder away from the house when working on
gutters or projections. To keep the ladder from tipping, remember
to keep your hips between the ladder rails and avoid overreaching.
</P>
<P>
   Using a stepladder requires the same precautions as with an
extension ladder, with just a few modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Stepladders are designed to be used fully opened with the side
locks engaged. They are self-supporting and should not be propped
against a wall for reaching heights. Do not overextend yourself by
standing on either of the top two steps.
</P>

CAN WE DIG IT? THE NEW `SHAFT' IS A CYNICAL PIECE OF WORK 
</HEADLINE>

   &UR; By DAVID EDELSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the new, big-budget ``Shaft,'' Samuel L. Jackson plays the
police-detective nephew of the original, low-rent superstud private
dick (Richard Roundtree). But Jackson's Shaft doesn't have a lot in
common with his legendary ``Uncle J'': He's more like the nephew of
Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Roundtree _ who shows up here for a few mellow scenes _ was
brooding and cynical and had no illusions about whitey's law (or
whitey's anything). The younger Shaft does: He thinks the world has
changed since 1971. His bald head gleaming, he strides through the
night in his long coat toward a crime victim _ a young black man
whose head has been beaten in _ like a Western sheriff, like a man
who thinks he can make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   When the courts and the high-priced lawyers throw roadblocks at
him and keep him from nailing a rich white racist murderer
(Christian Bale), Shaft hurls his badge at the judge and then goes
out to bust heads in the name of justice.
</P>
<P>
   This Shaft recycles the same old right-wing vigilante
action-movie tricks to achieve its anti-racist, ``liberal'' ends:
It says police brutality is great if the brutal policeman is black.
And the audience _ especially African-Americans, who in the real
world have increasingly found themselves on the opposite side of
this issue _ cheers lustily.
</P>
<P>
   I cheered, too, because Shaft is a pretty good action flick _
twisty, marvelously acted, and energetically (if not always
coherently) staged. I laughed all the way through it, thrilled to
Isaac Hayes' love-daddy theme in Dolby digital surround-sound,
applauded my surrogate badass good guy, and prayed for the scumbag
white villain to die in a lot of pain.
</P>
<P>
   The movie had a famously troubled production _ accounts vary as
to who had more of a role on the set, the director and
co-screenwriter, John Singleton, or co-producer Scott Rudin _ but
the finished film is a confident piece of work: It masterfully
pushes people's buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The shootouts have some of the crude vitality of Gordon Parks'
original, which was made at a time when splattery, high-impact
urban gunplay was still a novelty, and Hayes' music (embellished by
David Arnold) brings back some of the old elation. The movie will
be a monster hit, and it deserves to be _ but at what price?
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Shaft'' (1971) was not a well-constructed film, but
it holds up: You can still feel its glee in smashing taboos. From
Shaft's disregard for clueless white cops to his casual bedding of
a white woman to his final, exultant taunt, the picture is a
celebration of black potency, both individual and collective. It
says, ``You don't have to like us, but don't mess with us: We have
powers you wouldn't believe.'' It's out there dancing and wagging
its manhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 29 years, action movies have given us scores of
superblacks, so the remake has a different agenda. It turns on a
young black man (Mekhi Phifer) exercising his freedom by showing up
at a downtown club with a white woman and getting inexplicably
mocked by a preppie (Bale) with a chip on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The guy tries to laugh off the barrage of racist insults, but
how can he? He finally picks up a knife and _ no, you racist, it's
not what you think _ he cuts eyeholes in a cloth napkin and then
drapes it over his abuser's head, a brilliant rejoinder that shames
the white man and drives him into a homicidal fury.
</P>
<P>
   After what happens next, there's no punishment too dire for that
rich scumbag or for the people he enlists to help him stay above
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson is the perfect punisher. You don't cast
Jackson as a laid-back dude who's catnip to the ladies. You cast
him for his intensity, his spooky monomania. Jackson's Shaft is a
guy who won't take his eyes off you, who'd win a staring contest
with a blind man. All edges and righteous anger, he's a seething,
post-Spike Lee John Shaft: By Any Means Necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On their first meeting, Jackson's Shaft punches Bale's Walter
Wade in the face and the audience whoops. When he's told he's going
to be transferred ``uptown'' for that act of violence, he says,
``For this?'' and socks Wade in the face again.
</P>
<P>
   Later, hunting for a witness (Toni Collette) who has gone into
hiding, he makes a deal with a black woman: In exchange for
information, he'll get rid of some young drug dealers who've been
using her son as a courier. Audiences are treated to the sight of
Shaft strolling up to the dealer _ in baggy pants, listening to
loud gangsta rap _ and pummeling the hell out of him with no direct
provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Do the people who cheer like mad at that scene imagine how it
would play if the cop were white? And what are we supposed to make
of the moment in which Shaft and an ally (Vanessa Williams) blow
away two crooked cops and exclaim, ``Giuliani time!''?
</P>
<P>
   Don't the filmmakers realize how close in spirit to Giuliani _
and to the officers who allegedly coined that phrase _ their heroes
are?
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about dueling senses of entitlement, but rather
than suggest that no one is entitled to vigilante justice, it says
that the system is so corrupt that vigilantism is our last best
hope.
</P>
<P>
   The double standard even extends to the wardrobes. Shaft
pointedly queries a white superior (Daniel Van Bargen) about how he
could afford a Nassau County manse on a New York City policeman's
salary. Meanwhile, he's wearing a leather Armani jacket that looks
as if it costs about as much as the down payment on a house.
</P>
<P>
   The principal screenwriter, Richard Price, wrote the novel (and
screenplay) for ``Clockers,'' and he knows his way around the
longings of narcs and drug lords: He can give this crap a vein of
psychological realism.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's most inspired invention is an egomaniacal Dominican
coke dealer who calls himself Peoples (Jeffrey Wright) and who ends
up forming a bizarre alliance with Wade's preppie psycho. They
don't connect at all, but in Shaft they have a common antagonist,
and Price has written teasing scenes in which they circle each
other warily, contempt coming off them in waves.
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially a reprise of Bale's ``American Psycho''
turn, but the actor is good enough to internalize his character's
snobbery: His Wade is so indefatigable in his awfulness that he has
a peculiar integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Shaft will finally make Wright a star, and it should: He's an
amazing actor. His paean to ``Tiger Woo'' and other pillars of
American entrepreneurship is hilarious, and when he fixes the
privileged white boy with a hungry stare and says, ``I would kill
to be joo,'' joo know he would.
</P>
<P>
   The movie seems to be building toward an ingenious finale: that
Shaft can win by pitting his enemies against one another, playing
on their warring senses of entitlement and their terrible
characters. But Bale drops out in the last half-hour, and the final
confrontation is strictly crash-crash-bang-bang.
</P>
<P>
   If the moviemakers had been braver, they might have underlined
the fact that Wade and Peoples' lethal partnership is the direct
result of Shaft's reckless, extralegal brutality _ that they only
meet in jail after Shaft trumps up a phony assault charge against
the drug lord.
</P>
<P>
   The moral then might have been ``Vigilantes end up creating more
monsters than they vanquish,'' instead of the one that Shaft
carries now: ``Vigilantes look especially cool in Armani.''

&HT;     LATINO GROUP OFFERS SCHOLARSHIPS, BUSINESS OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new national self-help organization called Latino
Initiatives for the Next Century announced Wednesday that it will
provide college and trade school scholarships to Hispanics in
California, Texas, New York and Illinois, while helping other
Latinos start their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from LINC, a Chicago-based organization, made the
announcement here at its first news conference.
</P>
<P>
   LINC Chairman Rudy Mulder said the group's efforts ``will enable
Latinos to expand their horizons and achieve the American dream.''
He added that the organization will initially focus on the four
states because they contain about 72 percent of the country's
Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are planning a minimum of 500 four-year scholarships over
the next 12 months for first-generation Latinos,'' said Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   LINC, which is supported by Latino business groups, will also
provide tutoring and counseling services for students to help
ensure a low dropout rate, said David Lizarraga, the organization's
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   LINC said it is encouraging Latinos of all ages to apply.
</P>
<P>
   The group's officials said they are basing their educational
program on a successful model used by a California Latino
organization called The East Los Angeles Community Union.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to raise living standards among American Latinos by
creating new wealth and job opportunities, LINC also promised to
provide financing and entrepreneurial know-how so that Hispanics
can start their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has teamed up with 7-Eleven, which has 18,000
stores across the country, to help Latinos buy and manage their own
franchises. Other companies, including restaurant chains and car
dealerships, are expected to join 7-Eleven in the effort in the
next several months, Mulder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to put 150 Latinos into business over the next
few years, just with the 7-Eleven relationship,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Keyes, 7-Eleven's chief executive officer, said in a
statement that the program ``will not only benefit (Latinos')
economic and business knowledge, but it will also allow them to
employ other Latinos and teach them business and retail skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Hispanic population in the United States is 31
million. By 2050, it is expected to top 96 million.

<P>
   The first ``Shaft'' (1971) was not a well-constructed film, but
it holds up: You can still feel its glee in smashing taboos. From
Shaft's disregard for clueless white cops to his casual bedding of
a white woman to his final, exultant taunt, the picture is a
celebration of black potency, both individual and collective. It
says, ``You don't have to like us, but don't mess with us: We have
powers you wouldn't believe.'' It's out there dancing and wagging
its manhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 29 years, action movies have given us scores of
superblacks, so the remake has a different agenda. It turns on a
young black man (Mekhi Phifer) exercising his freedom by showing up
at a downtown club with a white woman and getting inexplicably
mocked by a preppie (Bale) with a chip on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The guy tries to laugh off the barrage of racist insults, but
how can he? He finally picks up a knife and _ no, you racist, it's
not what you think _ he cuts eyeholes in a cloth napkin and then
drapes it over his abuser's head, a brilliant rejoinder that shames
the white man and drives him into a homicidal fury.
</P>
<P>
   After what happens next, there's no punishment too dire for that
rich scumbag or for the people he enlists to help him stay above
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson is the perfect punisher. You don't cast
Jackson as a laid-back dude who's catnip to the ladies. You cast
him for his intensity, his spooky monomania. Jackson's Shaft is a
guy who won't take his eyes off you, who'd win a staring contest
with a blind man. All edges and righteous anger, he's a seething,
post-Spike Lee John Shaft: By Any Means Necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On their first meeting, Jackson's Shaft punches Bale's Walter
Wade in the face and the audience whoops. When he's told he's going
to be transferred ``uptown'' for that act of violence, he says,
``For this?'' and socks Wade in the face again.
</P>
<P>
   Later, hunting for a witness (Toni Collette) who has gone into
hiding, he makes a deal with a black woman: In exchange for
information, he'll get rid of some young drug dealers who've been
using her son as a courier. Audiences are treated to the sight of
Shaft strolling up to the dealer _ in baggy pants, listening to
loud gangsta rap _ and pummeling the hell out of him with no direct
provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Do the people who cheer like mad at that scene imagine how it
would play if the cop were white? And what are we supposed to make
of the moment in which Shaft and an ally (Vanessa Williams) blow
away two crooked cops and exclaim, ``Giuliani time!''?
</P>
<P>
   Don't the filmmakers realize how close in spirit to Giuliani _
and to the officers who allegedly coined that phrase _ their heroes
are?
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about dueling senses of entitlement, but rather
than suggest that no one is entitled to vigilante justice, it says
that the system is so corrupt that vigilantism is our last best
hope.
</P>
<P>
   The double standard even extends to the wardrobes. Shaft
pointedly queries a white superior (Daniel Van Bargen) about how he
could afford a Nassau County manse on a New York City policeman's
salary. Meanwhile, he's wearing a leather Armani jacket that looks
as if it costs about as much as the down payment on a house.
</P>
<P>
   The principal screenwriter, Richard Price, wrote the novel (and
screenplay) for ``Clockers,'' and he knows his way around the
longings of narcs and drug lords: He can give this crap a vein of
psychological realism.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's most inspired invention is an egomaniacal Dominican
coke dealer who calls himself Peoples (Jeffrey Wright) and who ends
up forming a bizarre alliance with Wade's preppie psycho. They
don't connect at all, but in Shaft they have a common antagonist,
and Price has written teasing scenes in which they circle each
other warily, contempt coming off them in waves.
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially a reprise of Bale's ``American Psycho''
turn, but the actor is good enough to internalize his character's
snobbery: His Wade is so indefatigable in his awfulness that he has
a peculiar integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Shaft will finally make Wright a star, and it should: He's an
amazing actor. His paean to ``Tiger Woo'' and other pillars of
American entrepreneurship is hilarious, and when he fixes the
privileged white boy with a hungry stare and says, ``I would kill
to be joo,'' joo know he would.
</P>
<P>
   The movie seems to be building toward an ingenious finale: that
Shaft can win by pitting his enemies against one another, playing
on their warring senses of entitlement and their terrible
characters. But Bale drops out in the last half-hour, and the final
confrontation is strictly crash-crash-bang-bang.
</P>
<P>
   If the moviemakers had been braver, they might have underlined
the fact that Wade and Peoples' lethal partnership is the direct
result of Shaft's reckless, extralegal brutality _ that they only
meet in jail after Shaft trumps up a phony assault charge against
the drug lord.
</P>
<P>
   The moral then might have been ``Vigilantes end up creating more
monsters than they vanquish,'' instead of the one that Shaft
carries now: ``Vigilantes look especially cool in Armani.''

THE ARAB BRAT PACK: YOUNG, SEXY, AND RUNNING DAD'S COUNTRY

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Western media, for whom Arab autocrats usually have as much
appeal as agriculture subsidies, are gaga over the Arab Brat Pack.
</P>
<P>
   The dashing royals who inherited power last year _ 38-year-old
King Abdullah of Jordan and 36-year-old King Mohammed of Morocco _
have been joined by 34-year-old Bashar Assad, who's taking his
father's job in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The Brat Packers are Western-educated, adore the free market,
surf the Web, and seem more interested in joint ventures with
Israel than attacks on it.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain and Qatar also have new reform-minded emirs, and young
bucks are clamoring to run Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia when the
current generation of old-timers kicks.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why the Brat Packers delight the West.
Americans are accustomed to surly Arab leaders in headscarves and
uniforms. But King Abdullah prepped at Deerfield, studied at
Georgetown and speaks English better than Arabic. He's married to a
foxy young woman who worked for Apple Computer. He aced his recent
appearance on ``Larry King Live.'' He watches ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.'' He
eats at Planet Hollywood. He's a Trekkie (boldly going where no
king has gone before).
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed, unlike his father King Hassan, mingles with ordinary
Moroccans, drives his own car and lives in a modest suburban house.
Dr. Bashar, the ophthalmologist, is an Internet junkie who loves
Phil Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Pause for a gripe: Phil Collins? Planet Hollywood? Dharma &AMP;
Greg? Shouldn't potentates have better taste?
</P>
<P>
   The Brat Pack is appealing in substance as well. The Arab
leaders of the '50s and '60s preached Pan-Arabism and socialism and
obsessed about destroying Israel. But their kids came of age after
the Six-Day War, when Pan-Arabism was dead and Israel was a fact.
</P>
<P>
   Their homelands, once largely disconnected from Europe and North
America, are linked by immigration and easy travel. Their centrally
planned, corrupt economies have lagged behind the rest of the
world. This, plus a dose of European schooling, has turned the Brat
Packers into post-ideological technocrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get in touch with the broader world economy, you
have to participate in the information revolution, you can't
isolate your country: All that is quite obvious to this
generation,'' says University of Virginia professor William Quandt.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares if peace is ideologically desirable: It's economically
essential.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah toppled trade barriers and rewrote laws to win Jordan's
membership in the World Trade Organization. He privatized the
airline and telephone company. He mandated English and computer
classes in elementary school. He vows to make Jordan the Silicon
Valley of the Middle East, Singapore by the (Dead) Sea. He delights
Jordanians by disguising himself for visits to government offices
and hospitals, then demanding reform when he sees how poorly
average citizens are treated.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed, who holds an international law degree, has talked up a
reformist agenda too. He socializes with Morocco's young
entrepreneurs. He ousted Morocco's brutal interior minister, who
had run the country cruelly and corruptly for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar's record hints that he will be a modernizer. He directs
Syria's computer society and spearheaded an anti-corruption
campaign designed to make Syria a fairer place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to get carried away by this fine news, to predict
a glorious future for any Arab country lucky enough to be ruled by
a hipster. But in Jordan, Morocco and Syria, population growth
outstrips economic growth. Their economies are stagnating, and the
shortage of water is dire. More than half their citizens are under
21. Unemployment already tops 25 percent, and no one has the
foggiest notion how to employ millions of new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Their centralized economies and preposterous bureaucracies
strangle progress. They are loudly planning to become Internet
economies, yet Syria barely has credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Brat Packers also lack the power to make the changes they
long for. All depend on military and business elites to protect
them. These folks control smuggling, government jobs, central banks
and the army. They benefit from the status quo and don't want to
aerate the economy, purge the bureaucracy, or stamp out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   This handcuffs reform. Bashar, who has no power base of his own,
will serve at the military's whim. Abdullah is saddled with a
stodgy prime minister who shows no enthusiasm for shrinking the
bureaucracy and liberating Jordanian markets. But the king can't
afford to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Brat Packers did have absolute authority, they
couldn't make turbo-capitalism by diktat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make your country desirable for job-creating private
investment is not something you can decree,'' says David Mack, vice
president of the Middle East Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah wants Jordan to bustle with competition and
entrepreneurship, but that requires a posse of vigorous business
people who reject state sponsorship _ exactly the group Abdullah
cannot create.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, socialist, backward Syria is best positioned for major
economic explosion. It has a long entrepreneurial tradition and
swarms of businessmen ready to charge when the state drops
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners tend to mistake the populism and reformism of Brat
Packers for something it is not: democracy. The Brat Packers are
autocrats. Each has his job because Daddy gave it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts fear that Syria's ``monarchic republic'' sets an
alarming precedent for the region. Bashar's ascension will
encourage Muammar Qaddafi, Hosni Mubarak and Saddam Hussein to
ensure that their sons succeed them.
</P>
<P>
   These countries have no tradition of popular government: Kings
and tribal leaders have ruled for centuries. The Brat Packers
sympathize with democracy more than their dads did (which was
generally not at all), but that doesn't mean they will impose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few cases of leaders who willingly give up a
significant amount of power. These leaders may like democracy, but
even if they are willing to pursue it, the elites around them may
not allow it,'' says University of Maryland professor Shibley
Telhami.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, Morocco and Jordan all limit freedom of the press
enormously. Mohammed says he believes in equal rights for women and
wants Morocco to be a Spanish-style constitutional monarchy, but he
has not done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah has not tried to democratize Jordan. Both Jordan and
Syria face huge demographic obstacles to democracy: In Jordan,
Palestinians outnumber Jordanians. In Syria, the ruling Alawites
make up only 12 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani of Qatar, who at 50 is a kind of
semi-Brat Packer, is making a profound effort to democratize. He
funds a satellite TV news channel that reports freely and harshly
on Arab governments. He authorized municipal elections in which
women voted and ran for office, and he is drafting a constitution
that will hand much of his power to a new parliament. But Qatar has
a tiny population _ less than 1 million _ and enormous
petro-wealth. The emir can afford the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy and prosperity may be dreams, but even so, the tyro
monarchs and junior presidents vastly improve on their dads.
They'll keep peace. They won't murder their citizens. They can't
fix their basket-case nations overnight, but they'll make a start.
From baby kings, expect baby steps.

   OIL ON THE POLITICAL FIRE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush voiced support today for the Federal Trade
Commission's probe of soaring gasoline prices, but he put most of
the blame on the White House's failure to convince foreign crude
producers to ``open the spigots.'' In Los Angeles, Bush said, ``I
do think it's fair to have the FTC investigate,'' adding that the
results would be ``healthy.'' Bush didn't accuse the Clinton
administration or Al Gore of demagoguing the issue by launching the
probe, but the former Texas oilman did insist that it's the
administration's job to pressure the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Nations to increase oil output.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO YOU CALL A NON-ENDORSING ENDORSEMENT?
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring his brawny union's disenchantment with Al Gore,
Teamsters chief James P. Hoffa will join Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader in Los Angeles on Thursday to make a ``special
statement ... concerning the 2000 presidential election.'' A
Teamsters spokesman said Hoffa doesn't plan at that time to endorse
Nader. The United Auto Workers has hinted it also may support Nader
for his opposition to ``corporate globalization.'' The Teamsters
and UAW pointedly abstained last October when the AFL-CIO voted to
give Gore an early endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   THE TRUTH, TEXAS-TOAST STYLE
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has issued a warning to George W. Bush: ``The Texas
Truth Squad is coming.'' The group of workers from Texas will
appear at labor-sponsored meetings around the country to try to
sully the governor's reputation by talking about problems in Texas
that include education, health care and the treatment of farm
workers. The union leaflet says the truth squad will note that
Texas ranks the lowest among all states in the percentage of people
who have health insurance and near the bottom in College Board
scores. The first event is to be held in Philadelphia on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   PLOWING FERTILE GROUND
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore went to Iowa today and proposed exempting more family
farms and small businesses from estate taxes. While attempting to
carve out his own piece of a Republican campaign issue, Democrats
warn that eliminating the tax would blow a hole in the budget and
mainly benefit the rich. Instead, Gore proposed increasing the
exemption for small businesses and farmers _ currently up to $2.6
million _ to $5 million, meaning, he said, that 90 percent of the
nation's farmers would not owe estate taxes. Gore: ``Some on
Capitol Hill believe we should completely repeal the estate tax and
give a massive tax break to the wealthiest Americans. They want to
give away the store to those who already own the shopping center.''
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS AND QUAKERS
</P>
<P>
   Political protesters are saying they won't foment a repeat of
violence that erupted after the Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA
title the other night, but they fear police may use the riot as a
pretext to bully them away from the Democratic convention. Shawn
McDougal of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker social
service movement, and other planners promise boisterous and
disruptive rallies, but maintain their groups won't try to hurt
anyone or destroy property. And the LAPD insists it won't impede
the protests as long as the activists remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   LOW-BUDGET CAMPAIGN COVERAGE . . .
</P>
<P>
   ABC News, citing cost concerns, has pulled out of a pool
arrangement where three networks had shared camera coverage of
George W. Bush and Al Gore. ABC had joined with CBS and Fox News
Channel to share camera coverage of the campaign. But with interest
in the candidates at an ebb now and relatively few public
appearances, ABC found it wasn't worth the expense, said
spokeswoman Su-Lin Nichols. ABC is using its own cameras to cover
some events and relying on affiliates for others, she said. The
network currently has just one producer, without a correspondent or
camera crew, traveling full-time with each candidate. CBS and NBC
have yet to announce their plans, but are expected to scale back,
also.
</P>
<P>
   . . . WITH A WAY TO STAY IN THE GAME . . .
</P>
<P>
   ABC has invited Al Gore and George W. Bush to participate in a
one-on-one televised conversation shortly after Labor Day. The
network said it wanted as little participation as possible from a
moderator so the event doesn't look like a formal debate. So far,
the two candidates have agreed only to three fall debates sponsored
by the Commission on Presidential Debates. But, ``if you can have
them talk to each other directly, it will become less adversarial
and less debate-like,'' said ABC News president David Westin.
Campaigns keep such tight control on all aspects of personal
appearances that Westin's idea might be a tough sell, said ABC
anchor Peter Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND STILL KEEP MONDAY NIGHT SAFE FOR FOOTBALL
</P>
<P>
   ABC, in its dialing down of convention coverage in prime time,
doesn't plan to pre-empt two preseason NFL games. The networmillion
in federal funds for the general election and cannot raise any more
money except to cover legal and accounting costs.
</P>

   PHYSICIST CHALLENGING BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   John Hagelin, the quantum physicist who founded the Natural Law
Party, is challenging Pat Buchanan for the Reform Party's
presidential nomination and the right to spend the party's $12.6
million in federal campaign money. In addition to running as the
Natural Law nominee, Hagelin said he's qualified to have his name
placed on Reform Party's mail ballot. Ever since Buchanan left the
Republican Party last year, he has been taking over the Reform
Party, winning the biggest share of delegates. But a two-thirds
majority at the national conven

TECHNOLOGY BRINGS ALIVE NEW ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash.)  (With CIR-MUSEUM-EXHIBIT-GUIDE, attached) 
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new museum rises from Seattle's streets like great, billowing
clouds of rippling aluminum and stainless steel, its shapes so
devoid of straight lines that it appears to have been grown rather
than built by human hands.
</P>
<P>
   Even the curvy steel superstructure of the museum, the
Experience Music Project, was designed with computer assistance and
fabricated to such exacting specifications that its manufacture had
to be guided by computers as well, note its builders.
</P>
<P>
   Frank O. Gehry, when designing the museum, used the same
computer tools that were originally developed to design Mirage
fighter jets. In the end, he has said, he likes to think of his
latest creation, its multicolored skin glittering in the famously
infrequent sunshine of the Great Northwest, as a
``three-dimensional floating puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more than any other museum, the Experience Music
Project, or EMP, owes its existence and operation to contemporary
computer technology. When the 140,000-square-foot interactive
museum officially opens Friday, visitors will encounter an almost
seamless array of digital technology engineered, its designers say,
to guide, track, entertain and enlighten visitors as they explore
and celebrate American popular music, mostly rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the perfect building for rebelliousness and innovation,''
said Paul Zumwalt, who managed EMP's design and construction.
``It's not meant to be conservative, and it's not meant for
everyone to like it. Not everyone likes the same music.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the museum's use of technology, Zumwalt added:
``It's going to change the way people move through museums.''
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous music museum is full of artifacts deemed by its
curators to be important to the rock era. On display are about
1,500 pieces _ from a collection of 100,000 _ including Gibson's
original, 65-year-old experimental electric guitar, the handwritten
lyric notebook that once belonged to Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, Janis
Joplin's velvet blouse and the white Fender Stratocaster guitar
that Jimi Hendrix, a Seattle native, played at Woodstock in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   There are collections that highlight the work of musicians who
came from the Northwest, like the Kingsmen, the Fleetwoods, Bing
Crosby and Quincy Jones. There are exhibitions that explore rock
'n' roll's roots by displaying genre touchstones like Bo Diddley's
1956 guitar, young Elvis Presley's leather jacket and a 1942
Wurlitzer jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more contemporary items from the hip-hop world
like turntables belonging to Grandmaster Flash, a drum machine used
by Dr. Dre to record his breakthrough album, ``The Chronic,'' and
original works by two New York graffiti artists, Dondi and Midg.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tons and tons of stuff in this building,'' said Dave
Leinweber, information systems manager for EMP. ``The trouble we're
going to have is getting people to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything in EMP has been tweaked or enhanced by
computer technology. A book of lyrics handwritten by Hendrix can be
found under glass in a traditional exhibit case, for example, but
in a special kiosk, not unlike an automated teller machine, the
entire notebook has been digitized and made accessible by means of
a touch-sensitive liquid crystal display screen. Slide a finger
along a section of the notebook and Hendrix's tortured scribble is
instantly rendered in easy-to-read text. The same touch screen can
toggle between demo versions and completed versions of Hendrix
songs or it can activate multimedia tours and tutorials on some of
the musical forms that influenced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals in the EMP is to get people to be better
listeners, to be more perceptive listeners,'' said Jon Kertzer, the
museum's director of multimedia and special projects.
</P>
<P>
   More extraordinary gadgetry can also be found, ranging from
flat, 42-inch display screens, made of gas plasma, playing music
videos and artists' oral histories to interactive lessons guided by
computers on automated drum kits, electric guitars and keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every vintage electric guitar in the museum's guitar
gallery can be heard in the form of a digital recording of its
being played by a master musician. Visitors can also perform in a
kind of virtual karaoke machine that simulates what it sounds and
feels like to play as a rock musician before an arena crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion ride through musical innovation and creativity,
called the Artist's Journey, 40 visitors at a time bump and glide
in seats that move by way of a hydraulically controlled platform in
front of a large, wraparound screen that features a digitized image
of James Brown. Beneath visitors' seats are air hoses designed to
fill the theater with appropriate smells to enhance the story.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every corner of EMP, which is the brainchild of the
billionaire Paul Allen, Microsoft's co-founder (and a Seattle
resident), and his sister, Jody Allen Patton, the museum's
co-founder and executive director, is crammed with cutting-edge
computer technology. Even for cellular telephones to work inside
EMP, which is basically a giant steel cage, special repeaters had
to be installed so that cell phone signals would not just haplessly
bounce off the museum's walls.
</P>
<P>
   The videos and music that play continuously in the museum do not
use conventional videocassettes, CDs or DVDs as a source (although
they can). Instead, everything is delivered by a custom-made,
high-speed local area network that pumps songs and high-resolution
images throughout the museum over miles of cables running to banks
of computer servers.
</P>
<P>
   The system is so flexible and so easy to customize, said Robert
Fitzsimmons, the director of technology for EMP, that the museum's
electronic sights and sounds can be reprogrammed with unprecedented
ease and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could change the experience based on time of day, by
visitor group, by all kinds of things,'' said Fitzsimmons, who is
senior project manager of technology at Vulcan Northwest, the
umbrella company that oversees many of Allen's endeavors and which
designed some of EMP's systems. ``You wouldn't have to run out and
change DVD's and all of that.''

   But Kathy Scanlan, deputy director of museum services, cautions
that EMP is not about technology for technology's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that it's not a technology museum,'' Scanlan
said. ``The point is to enhance the experience with technology.
What you're really doing is experiencing music here and tapping
into your creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that leads you to be creative with a computer, that's
great.''

HANDHELD DEVICE IS MORE THAN A GUIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has visited an art museum in the last 10 years or so
has probably been confronted by someone on the staff proffering an
electronic contraption with headphones to ``enhance'' the gallery
experience.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, those devices have been little more than clunky
cassette players, and at best, clunky MP3 players. Each usually
provides a brief recorded narration, sometimes to the accompaniment
of light classical music or elevator jazz, about various paintings
and pieces in selected museum galleries.
</P>
<P>
   But MEG, the Museum Exhibit Guide, which makes its debut Friday
at the opening of the interactive Experience Music Project in
Seattle, appears to be something quite different.
</P>
<P>
   The device, which weighs a little more than two pounds, has the
processing power of a Pentium-class laptop. The heart of MEG is a
box that contains a Toshiba processor, batteries and an
8.3-gigabyte IBM Travelstar hard drive. It is worn with a shoulder
strap and sits on the hip. Another part of MEG contains a small,
handheld color LCD screen, numeric keypad and some buttons and is
connected to the main box by a cable. It is held in the hand much
like a palm-size organizer.
</P>
<P>
   MEG, which is equipped with an infrared transceiver, can pick up
signals from exhibits in the new museum. By aiming MEG at an item
and pressing a button or by typing an item's number into the
device, museum visitors can view text explaining the object on
MEG's screen. They can also hear audio in the form of music or
narration through the device's headphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of a juggle to get everything on, but once
you do a cruise around, it's lots of fun,'' said Robert
Fitzsimmons, director of technology for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons' company, Vulcan Northwest, in Bellevue, Wash.,
developed MEG, and he said the company hoped to license its
technology to other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can also bookmark specific exhibits while they tour the
museum. When the device is returned to museum workers, the
bookmarks are downloaded to a museum database. They can then be
called up on EMP's Web site (www.emplive.com) by using an
identification number on the museum admission ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Because MEGs are built to be upgraded, Fitzsimmons said his
company is experimenting with adding video playback.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan is also testing ways to use radio frequencies to reduce
the amount of information required to be stored on MEG's hard
drive. Using radio signals as well as infrared would allow MEG to
play back full versions of songs instead of fragments. More
up-to-date information, like museum show times, special tours and
classes and exhibition reminders, could also be beamed right into
the devices in vistors' hands, Fitzsimmon said.
</P>
<P>
   With MEG, he said, ``You get to be in charge of what you want
more information about.''

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DORA GALITZKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shades for Bulbs
</P>
<P>
   Q. For several autumns, I have put in a lot of bulbs. They are
gorgeous in spring, but then there is the inevitable dying foliage
to look at. I've tried the obvious day lilies to come up and hide
it. Would other plants work as well as screens without coming up so
early that they would interfere with the blooms?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. As a reward for not cutting the bulb foliage down before it
yellows and depriving the bulbs of all the food-making ability they
need to prepare for next year's bloom, here are a few suggestions
for plants that will serve as great-looking minglers while hiding
the bulb foliage until it dies down: astilbe, Siberian iris, the
pale pink Geranium macrorrhizum Ingwersen's Variety or any of the
medium-size hostas, including Emily Dickinson, Dorset Blue, Happy
Hearts, Bright Lights and Gold Edger. You might also try Stachys
Countess Helene von Stein, also known as Big Ears (the plant, not
the countess).
</P>
<P>
   The Other Rhododendrons
</P>
<P>
   Q. I love rhododendrons, can't get enough of them. Someone told
me recently that there is one that actually blooms in midsummer. Is
this true? Is it as beautiful as the ones that bloom in the spring?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you measure beauty by a flower's size and its ability to
blind through brightness, as so many rhododendron lovers seem to,
then the good news is tinged with bad. The really showy
rhododendrons seem to bloom themselves out in spring.
</P>
<P>
   But if you don't need that much candlepower to be impressed, and
you remember that azaleas are rhododendrons, you can extend the
flowering season by turning to some of the more subtle, delicately
refined native azaleas. They belong to the same genus, but their
side of the family hasn't been bred into circus clowns. In addition
to offering more variety of bloom time, the deciduous azaleas add
great fall foliage color to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet azalea (Rhododendron arborescens) is a large, informal
shrub with lustrous dark green foliage and, from June into July,
heliotrope-like fragrant flowers in white to light pink. Other
forms have smoky pink or yellow flowers. The exceptionally
sweet-smelling Florida hammocksweet azalea (R. serrulatum) also
blooms from June into July. The flowers are small and white to pale
pink. Finally, August brings the small orange-red to red flowers of
plumleaf azalea (R. prunifolium).
</P>
<P>
   Sources for native azaleas include Woodlanders, 1128 Colleton
Ave., Aiken, S.C. 29801, (803) 648-7522, catalog $2; and Whitney
Gardens and Nursery, P.O. Box 170, Brinnon, Wash. 98320, (360)
796-4411, catalog $4.
</P>
<P>
   Looking Like Mom
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do the progeny of weeping trees also weep, or is weeping
produced by some other means?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It depends on the tree, and on what you mean by ``progeny.''
Weeping trees, whose branches defy logic by hanging downward
instead of reaching for the sun, are mutations. The trees may be
grafted, but they are not, as a sculptor friend of mine slyly
insists, grafted upside down. Even novelty-hungry growers aren't
doing that quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   The mutations happen naturally on a single branch of a tree that
otherwise grows normally. Buds from these weeping branches can be
grafted onto hardier rootstock to extend their growing range, or
cuttings from the branches can be rooted on their own. Such
vegetative propagation will result in weeping progeny.
</P>
<P>
   Planting seeds, however, is problematic. The offspring of most
mutations revert back to the original form, so the odds of getting
a weeping tree are less than fifty-fifty. But there are trees, like
the weeping willow, whose seeds will reliably produce chips off the
old block.
</P>

weekly column which moves on Wednesdays.) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My hobby is working with and repairing antiques and I need to
cut an oval shaped piece of glass to fit in an old picture frame,
as well as a circular piece to fit in a clock face.
 &HT;    I do not have any power tools _ just the usual assortment of
hand tools.
 &HT;    Is this something I can do myself using just a regular glass
cutter?
 &HT;    A: You will need a top quality glass cutter, preferably one with
a carbide wheel.
 &HT;    Clean the glass thoroughly and draw the outline of the shape to
be cut on the glass, using a marking pencil and a wood or cardboard
pattern to form the circle or oval.
 &HT;    Place the glass on a flat surface padded with several layers of
newspaper, then dip the cutting wheel of the glass cutter into
kerosene.
 &HT;    Score the glass around the circular or oval pattern marked on
the glass, holding the cutter between the forefinger and index
finger while gripping with the thumb.
 &HT;    Move it along with steady pressure in one direction to create a
tearing sound.
 &HT;    Then use the cutter to score additional marks radiating out from
this outline to the edges (as shown in the illustration).
 &HT;    Turn the glass over and tap along the score marks with the blunt
end of the cutter, causing the glass to crack along those marks.
 &HT;    You can then carefully break away the scrap pieces with a
flat-jaw pliers.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our kitchen was originally painted with an oil base
semi-gloss enamel, but we painted over this with a latex semi-gloss
paint about a year ago.
 &HT;    This paint tends to chip and flake off when nicked, so we plan
to repaint again.
 &HT;    What should we do to prevent this happening next time?
 &HT;    A: The last coat of paint is not bonding properly to the old
paint.
 &HT;    This could be because the old paint was still glossy when you
painted over it, or because the old surface was not clean.
 &HT;    Your only sure cure now is to remove all of the paint down to
the bare surface, using a chemical paint remover.
 &HT;    Then start from scratch by applying a first coat of a
stain-killing sealer before finishing with two coats of the paint
of your choice.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The stairs in my front hall make a squeaking noise when
stepped on. How can I correct this before I put down carpet on
these steps?
 &HT;    A: Stair squeaks are usually caused by loose treads (steps) that
move slightly when stepped on.
 &HT;    They need to be fastened down more securely _ usually by driving
screws down through the tread so they go into the top of the riser
under that tread.
 &HT;    Make certain you drill pilot holes for the screws first, and be
sure the screws go into the top of the riser.
 &HT;    Countersink the head of each screw slightly below the surface,
then fill the hole that remains with a matching colored wood
plastic.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My house has a shallow crawl space under it instead of a
basement.
 &HT;    Since this space is really unusable, I would like to build a
regular basement under the existing house.
 &HT;    Is this possible?
 &HT;    A: Yes, but it is usually a very expensive job that calls for
the services of an experienced contractor _ and possibly an
architect.
 &HT;    In some cases you may have to put in a whole new foundation, but
this is something that only an architect or engineer can determine.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``CUTTING CIRCLE OF GLASS'' goes with
this column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: After scoring the circle and radial lines going out
from it, the small pieces of waste glass can be broken off with
flat-jaw pliers.

SEARS POINT IS SET FOR BIG INVASION 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICH RUPPRECHT   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ The motorheads are geared up, the NASCAR big
rigs are heading west and the deluge of motor homes should hit
Sonoma County by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's NASCAR time at Sears Point Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   The one-day delay of the Pocono 500 _ won in controversial style
by Jeremy Mayfield Monday morning _ will have little effect on this
week's Winston Cup Series race _ the Save Mart/Kragen 350 scheduled
for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR racing teams who headed back to their home bases in
North Carolina following Monday's race are making their
cross-country journey. The Sears Point paddock area officially
opens Thursday. Most racers will fly to the Bay Area and take part
in sponsor and media functions right up until the race, which will
begin qualifying Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Sears Point track is one of only two road-race courses in
the Winston Cup Series, and it's probably safe to say it's not a
favorite of many drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The one driver who has every right to love Sears Point is Jeff
Gordon, who grew up in nearby Vallejo. Gordon, who battled a
serious sinus infection and cold last year, has won the last two
Sears Point races and on the last five road race courses in Winston
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Most racing teams have cars used only on road courses, because
of the left and right turns, the latter not a part of oval track
racing. There are also few places to pass for stock cars at Sears
Point, which puts a premium on qualifying near the front, and
driving smoothly without taking a lot of risks.
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti defied conventional wisdom at Sears Point last
year, qualifying 31st and then finishing in third place, moving up
a mind-boggling 28 spots.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, who qualified and raced well at Sears Point last
year as a rookie, comes in as one of the few NASCAR drivers with a
pair of Winston Cup wins this season.
</P>
<P>
   First-time drivers at Sears Point include highly touted rookies
Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Matt Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   The 112-lap race on the 11-turn, 1.95-mile course will feature
six former Sears Point winners, including Gordon, Mark Martin
(1997), Dale Earnhardt (1995), Rusty Wallace (1990, 1996), Ricky
Rudd (1989) and Geoffrey Bodine (1993).
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's Pocono 500, Bobby Labonte is leading the Winston
Cup point standings (2,240), followed by Dale Earnhardt (2,183),
Dale Jarrett (2,125), Ward Burton (2,019), Jeff Burton (2,019),
Wallace (1,999), Stewart (1,976), Rudd (1,975), Martin (1,958) and
Gordon (1,874).

THE NEED FOR A DIGITAL IMMUNE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 By ESTHER DYSON  
 c.2000 EDventure Holdings Inc.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (The following ``separate buy'' article from cyber-guru Esther
Dyson is available from the New York Times Syndicate. Please
contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA WEYDERT at
732-390-4480)
</P>
<P>
   The impending breakup of Microsoft, whether a good idea or not,
raises interesting questions about corporate identity. What does it
mean to cut a company in two?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of AT&AMP;T, it was relatively simple: Use geography as
a guide and break it up into seven regional service areas and one
long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   But for many companies, the structure is much less clear and
much less easily divisible. Microsoft may be such a case.
</P>
<P>
   Take Microsoft's own notion of a digital nervous system, for
example. Basically, it's the idea that your computer systems are a
digital nervous system _ Your communications travel up and down
from the brain. The hierarchical nature of this is not made
explicit, but it's there.
</P>
<P>
   So dividing a company would mean cutting a brain in half, or
leaving half the company without a brain. In this case, it would
mean leaving half the company without Bill Gates. Will the other
half shrivel up and die?
</P>
<P>
   We leave that to the courts _ and history _ to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, let's think about what would be more robust than a
digital nervous system: a digital IMMUNE system. An immune system
is different from a nervous system in being decentralized, much
like the Internet itself. Each body cell, each individual knows its
identity locally; it doesn't need to check back with headquarters
to find out how to behave when it encounters a stranger, or when
different components interact internally.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's more need than ever for leadership in companies
today, we need the kind of leadership that sets examples and
motivates individuals, rather than a central figure who controls
everything directly.
</P>
<P>
   That is, a digital immune system is a better model for companies
of the 21st century than a digital nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   It all hinges on the technology: A hundred years ago most
companies were simply small, with a limited span of control, most
of it in the hands of the owner and his sons. The telephone and
various technologies of mass production enabled companies to grow
much bigger, with information passed up the ranks and orders passed
down.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a digital nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Internet. Companies changed both internally and
externally. Internally, they become more horizontal, more
decentralized. Employees now want to be empowered rather than
commanded. More tasks are outsourced, and the employees remaining
are expected to be more creative and self-starting, to take more
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Employees want rules and policies, mission and vision, but not
necessarily commands from above. Everything from financial
incentives to social understandings gives them a bigger say in
their companies. They CONSTITUTE the company; they are not simply
representatives of a corporate brain center separate from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companies' external relationships have changed as
well. In this new horizontal, fluid world, where vertical
integration becomes counterproductive, they need to rely on
partnerships and alliances rather than do everything in-house.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they need to talk directly to customers rather
than send everything through distribution channels; they outsource
production and commodity activities, and ``insource'' interaction
with their customers. The result is that companies have to be more
open and interact at all levels, rather than having everything
filtered in and out through proper corporate channels: the
chairman's pronouncement, the carefully engineered advertising
campaign, the customer inquiries department (''Write to us at P.O.
Box 288.'').
</P>
<P>
   Instead, employees themselves represent the company _ online in
sales and customer service, in responses to e-mail. That means that
a company needs to have its identity well-established locally,
within each employee. No time to check the rule book or to send an
e-mail back to the digital nervous system asking for an approved
corporate response; besides, the brain couldn't handle all the
variety employees encounter out in the field.
</P>
<P>
   This is what an immune system does: It recognizes foreign
objects and produces effective responses.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem many companies will face in the future goes
well beyond ``knowledge management,'' which translates roughly into
making sure everyone knows the corporate policy manual or corporate
procedures, and that as much information as possible is kept
accessible on the corporate intranet. An immune system does
pattern-matching, whereas a digital nervous system processes
explicit information.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is understanding corporate identity at a visceral
level: ``What ARE we?'' not just ``What do we do?'' That means that
each employee knows how to respond to customer requests _ not with
a canned response, but with an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The company of the future will depend not on how well it can
manage its people, but how well it can train them to internalize
its personality and manage themselves. Thus, a company entering the
new economy and trying to figure out whom to hire, shouldn't just
steal from IBM or HP. It should emulate companies that are already
used to training hundreds and thousands of people to deal with
humanity in all its variety _ service companies: Retailers, hotels,
airlines, anyone who deals with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that can't be copied is each company's unique
immune system, because it comes from the interaction of a corporate
identity with each of the individuals who works for that
corporation _ whether in customer support, working with partners,
or simply talking about the company online on the Net, or on line
in a bricks-and-mortar store.
</P>
<P>
   Thus you can divide an immune system without killing it,
something you cannot do easily to a nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for Microsoft? It means that the success of
any new Microsofts will depend on how successfully they are at
embodying the vision, energy and drive of their founder, rather
than simply carrying out his commands.
</P>
<P>
   But they will also have to do one more thing a good immune
system does: Adapt to a new environment.

THE NEED FOR A DIGITAL IMMUNE SYSTEM

</P>
<P>
   The impending breakup of Microsoft, whether a good idea or not,
raises interesting questions about corporate identity. What does it
mean to cut a company in two?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of AT&AMP;T, it was relatively simple: Use geography as
a guide and break it up into seven regional service areas and one
long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   But for many companies, the structure is much less clear and
much less easily divisible. Microsoft may be such a case.
</P>
<P>
   Take Microsoft's own notion of a digital nervous system, for
example. Basically, it's the idea that your computer systems are a
digital nervous system _ Your communications travel up and down
from the brain. The hierarchical nature of this is not made
explicit, but it's there.
</P>
<P>
   So dividing a company would mean cutting a brain in half, or
leaving half the company without a brain. In this case, it would
mean leaving half the company without Bill Gates. Will the other
half shrivel up and die?
</P>
<P>
   We leave that to the courts _ and history _ to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, let's think about what would be more robust than a
digital nervous system: a digital IMMUNE system. An immune system
is different from a nervous system in being decentralized, much
like the Internet itself. Each body cell, each individual knows its
identity locally; it doesn't need to check back with headquarters
to find out how to behave when it encounters a stranger, or when
different components interact internally.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's more need than ever for leadership in companies
today, we need the kind of leadership that sets examples and
motivates individuals, rather than a central figure who controls
everything directly.
</P>
<P>
   That is, a digital immune system is a better model for companies
of the 21st century than a digital nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   It all hinges on the technology: A hundred years ago most
companies were simply small, with a limited span of control, most
of it in the hands of the owner and his sons. The telephone and
various technologies of mass production enabled companies to grow
much bigger, with information passed up the ranks and orders passed
down.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a digital nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Internet. Companies changed both internally and
externally. Internally, they become more horizontal, more
decentralized. Employees now want to be empowered rather than
commanded. More tasks are outsourced, and the employees remaining
are expected to be more creative and self-starting, to take more
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Employees want rules and policies, mission and vision, but not
necessarily commands from above. Everything from financial
incentives to social understandings gives them a bigger say in
their companies. They CONSTITUTE the company; they are not simply
representatives of a corporate brain center separate from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companies' external relationships have changed as
well. In this new horizontal, fluid world, where vertical
integration becomes counterproductive, they need to rely on
partnerships and alliances rather than do everything in-house.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they need to talk directly to customers rather
than send everything through distribution channels; they outsource
production and commodity activities, and ``insource'' interaction
with their customers. The result is that companies have to be more
open and interact at all levels, rather than having everything
filtered in and out through proper corporate channels: the
chairman's pronouncement, the carefully engineered advertising
campaign, the customer inquiries department (''Write to us at P.O.
Box 288.'').
</P>
<P>
   Instead, employees themselves represent the company _ online in
sales and customer service, in responses to e-mail. That means that
a company needs to have its identity well-established locally,
within each employee. No time to check the rule book or to send an
e-mail back to the digital nervous system asking for an approved
corporate response; besides, the brain couldn't handle all the
variety employees encounter out in the field.
</P>
<P>
   This is what an immune system does: It recognizes foreign
objects and produces effective responses.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem many companies will face in the future goes
well beyond ``knowledge management,'' which translates roughly into
making sure everyone knows the corporate policy manual or corporate
procedures, and that as much information as possible is kept
accessible on the corporate intranet. An immune system does
pattern-matching, whereas a digital nervous system processes
explicit information.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is understanding corporate identity at a visceral
level: ``What ARE we?'' not just ``What do we do?'' That means that
each employee knows how to respond to customer requests _ not with
a canned response, but with an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The company of the future will depend not on how well it can
manage its people, but how well it can train them to internalize
its personality and manage themselves. Thus, a company entering the
new economy and trying to figure out whom to hire, shouldn't just
steal from IBM or HP. It should emulate companies that are already
used to training hundreds and thousands of people to deal with
humanity in all its variety _ service companies: Retailers, hotels,
airlines, anyone who deals with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that can't be copied is each company's unique
immune system, because it comes from the interaction of a corporate
identity with each of the individuals who works for that
corporation _ whether in customer support, working with partners,
or simply talking about the company online on the Net, or on line
in a bricks-and-mortar store.
</P>
<P>
   Thus you can divide an immune system without killing it,
something you cannot do easily to a nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for Microsoft? It means that the success of
any new Microsofts will depend on how successfully they are at
embodying the vision, energy and drive of their founder, rather
than simply carrying out his commands.
</P>
<P>
   But they will also have to do one more thing a good immune
system does: Adapt to a new environment.

SWEET SUMMER NIGHTS ON THE SLEEPING PORCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By LUCIAN K. TRUSCOTT IV    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just outside the door of my writing room here in Hollywood there
is a collage of snapshots my mother put together for a family
reunion some years back. There's a photo of me in my high school
ROTC drill-team uniform, and one of my brother Frank splitting
wood.
</P>
<P>
   But the snapshot that catches my eye every time I walk by was
taken when I was about 6 and Frank was 4. We're asleep on a couple
of cots on my grandparents' sleeping porch, sheets thrown back
exposing our scrawny little bodies, the fetid darkness of a summer
night in Washington, D.C., visible through the screened walls of
the porch. We spent every summer sleeping on a screen porch in
those days, when air-conditioning was an exclusive feature of the
movie theater downtown, nowhere in evidence in our home or the
homes of anyone we knew.
</P>
<P>
   The sleeping porch was something we looked forward to, when the
heat and humidity would finally build to the point that the cots
would be dragged out and once again we'd be exposed to the elements
_ cooled, if only slightly, by an itinerant breeze, sung to sleep
by the insistent nighttime chatter of cicadas.
</P>
<P>
   The best nights were the ones when a sudden thunderstorm would
blow through, and our father or grandfather would lower the outside
shutters. We'd move our cots back against the wall of the house,
and the wind would whistle through the screens, and the rain, if it
blew hard enough, would come horizontally through the shutters, and
you felt like you were on a ship somewhere at sea, taking water
over the bow. After the second or third storm of the summer, the
excitement would wane, and we would awake in the morning to find
that our beds had been moved and the shutters lowered while we
remained asleep.
</P>
<P>
   When my wife and I bought a 1921 house in Hollywood a few years
ago, the last room our realtor showed us was at the end of the
house, above what had been the servants' quarters. As we walked up
the backstairs into the rather long and narrow room, the real
estate agent said in defense of the peculiar room, ``Now this room
has a very interesting history.''
</P>
<P>
   I felt the slant in the floor, picked up the corner of a
seriously deteriorated carpet, and sure enough, the flooring was
tin covered in canvas, necessary to allow the rain to run off. A
sleeping porch had been enclosed at some point in the past.
</P>
<P>
   One of these days we'll save up the money and file for the
permits and take out the exterior walls and find some place that
has still got good quality copper screening, and we'll return the
old room at the west end of the house to its rightful incarnation,
and we'll let our 6-year-old daughter, Lilly, have some friends for
a sleepover. We'll tuck them in and pray for rain.

   VANDERBILT-MINES (Balmat, N.Y.) _ The tombstones of Talcville
and Balmat and Hailesville tell the story. Beneath them lie
generations of talc miners, and the numbers carved in the marble

the men died young _ in their late 40s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Mining has always been a perilous profession, but few of these
men died from caved-in shafts or any of the multitude of accidents
that torment humans extracting minerals from the earth. Far more of
them died the excruciating death of suffocation _ from lungs made
uselessly rigid by scarring from deeply embedded mineral fibers,
lungs with cancerous tumors, lungs filled with muddy-yellow fluid
the consistency of honey.

&HT;     `INSTANT' CHECKS ON GUN BUYERS ARE NOT ALWAYS FAST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Instant background checks on gun buyers are causing
``needless delay'' because the FBI's computer system sputters and
breaks down, Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin G. Hatch said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The system is ``delaying one-quarter of the firearms purchases
in America,'' Hatch, R-Utah, told a Senate Judiciary Committee
panel that is examining the National Instant Criminal Background
Check System.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of an instant check, we have a system that too often
causes needless delay to law-abiding citizens who are simply
exercising their constitutional rights,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Clinton administration launched the background
check system 18 months ago to stop gun sales to convicted felons,
fugitives from the law, people subject to court-issued restraining
orders or people who are mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The background checks are done by licensed gun dealers who
access government computers.
</P>
<P>
   According to FBI data, 72 percent of all background checks are
completed within 30 seconds, 95 percent are completed within two
hours and the remaining 5 percent may take a few days. The system
has checked out 13 million applicants; 2 percent _ more than
116,000 applicants _ were denied the weapons they wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the system suffered outages for more than 215 hours
last year.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Loesch, assistant director of the criminal justice
information services division at the FBI, agreed that the system
needs improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Loesch told the hearing that ``some kind of a bug or something
inside the data base'' caused the FBI's instant background check
system to crash last month for four days.
</P>
<P>
   He said the instant check system is complicated because it must
search three different databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is meld all these things together now and
we're learning as we try to make this better,'' Loesch said.
``We're looking at over 60 software fixes to make this system more
reliable The system is very complicatedWe're going to get there,
it's a matter of tweaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., said the system has been
``highly effective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the system slows down, it may be for a good reason,''
Durbin said, adding that gun applicants who are forced to wait more
than 24 hours for background checks are 20 times more likely to be
prohibited from buying a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   But Robin Ball of Spokane, Wash., a licensed gun dealer who owns
a shooting range, said 40 percent of her firearms sales were
delayed by background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for a customer to cancel a sale because we
can't get a background check,'' she complained.

<P>
   Hatch and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the top Democrat on the
Judiciary panel, introduced legislation Wednesday that would
reimburse states if they choose to do their own instant background
checks rather than rely on the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 15 states do their own background checks.
</P>
<P>
   They are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida,
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Another 11 states help the FBI by performing their own instant
background checks for handgun purchases. They are: Iowa, Michigan,
Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Indiana, Maryland, New
Hampshire, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.

the tailpipe of the nearest Chevrolet, Plymouth or Ford. It's hard
to tell which issue has made the UAW more angry _ Gore's support
for granting China normal trade status or his rants against the
internal combustion engine. Republicans, meanwhile, are trying to
get back together after Sen. John McCain creamed Gov. George W.
Bush in the Republican primary. The healing was moving smoothly
until McCain backers claimed they got the shaft when it came to
picking delegates to the Republican National Convention. McCain got
so angry that he said he wouldn't return to the state. For the time
being _ and the dust still is settling _ Bush seems more solid with
his Republican base in western Michigan than Gore is with labor and
African-Americans in Detroit. ``Reagan Democrats'' in the Detroit
suburbs _ who voted for Ronald Reagan and then switched back to
Bill Clinton _ likely will have the last word and they're still
deciding. (Hershey, Dayton Daily News). 60. MOVED.

   MICHIGANBAR _ This booming, suburban Detroit county is home to
thousands of the ``Reagan Democrats'' who switched parties to put
Ronald Reagan in the White House. Many, but not all, returned to
their roots to help Democrat Bill Clinton win two terms as
president. This year the county also became a hotbed of ``McCain
Republicans,'' the potpourri of voters who gave George W. Bush a
surprise tumble in Michigan's Republican presidential primary. Both
parties are courting these all swing voters. Meanwhile, the county
is awash in scandals of its own. Among other things, the Democratic
sheriff, in office for 24 years, was convicted of rape. We talk
with auto workers, senior citizens, college students, educators and
others from the county. (Hershey, Dayton Daily News). 20. MOVED.

FOILED HOME BUYERS TAKE TO THE COUCH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ New Yorkers are mad about real estate. So are
Californians. Texans, too.
</P>
<P>
   Boiling mad.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Kandel, 49, a costume jewelry designer in Manhattan, is
furious: no more apartment hunting. He is fed up with facing one
obstacle after another in a month of searching, in which all he
found were one-bedroom apartments that start at $400,000,
garbage-strewn backyards and brokers he described as arrogant and
unhelpful. ``You feel you have no allies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Steve Cowan, 41, a hospital technician with two
children, angrily called his yearlong search ``a never-ending
battle.'' He thought he could find a house for $150,000 in the
neighborhood where his wife, Anne, grew up. But now, he said,
``prices keep getting jacked up to the point where people who work
real hard can't touch the house they want.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Oakland, Calif., Kevin Griffith, who works for a
developer of moderate-income housing, has been looking for a ``not
very extravagant 1920s bungalow _ two bedrooms, one bath on a
3,000-square-foot lot.'' He and his wife have lost five bidding
wars since April 1. They started looking in 1998, but dropped out
six months later because brokers told them the market was cooling.
Now, Griffith said ruefully, they would be forced to pay $100,000
more for bungalows they looked at then. ``Now they tell me the
market may be cooling again, but the house I wanted last week had
10 offers on it!''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of relentless price escalation, angry
customers are slamming down phones, brokers said, and picking
pointless fights with sellers. They are even stalking out of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Road rage, take a back seat. Make way for real estate rage. See
that page of glossy real estate ads _ with nothing less than
$800,000? Just lost your third bidding war? Join the crowd. House
hunters are suffering from battle fatigue brought on by the highest
real estate prices in history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the National Association of Realtors reported that home
sales in April were down 6 percent from March, prices are
continuing to rise, said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the trade
association. And competition in the country's hottest markets, like
Silicon Valley, Dallas and Manhattan, is still hot enough to ignite
bidding wars.
</P>
<P>
   The number of frustrated shoppers _ at all income levels _ is
growing, real estate brokers said. For house hunters like Griffith,
33, and his wife, Adrienne Oberstein, 34, their inability to find a
home is serious: Oberstein is pregnant, and the one-bedroom
apartment that they are renting is too small.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do if you are feeling powerless? One man spends
his Sundays tearing the real estate ads into very long pieces.
Others focus their ire on the sellers, branding them as greedy and
dishonest. Still others have turned on their brokers, saying these
bearers of bad news have betrayed them.
</P>
<P>
   Some even vent their frustration by the hour _ on the
therapist's couch _ one place they know someone will listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, I'm hearing, `I followed all the rules,''' said
Dr. Mark Levy, a psychiatrist in San Francisco, where median sales
prices have gone up 25 percent in 12 months to $365,300, according
to the National Association of Realtors. `` `I got 100 graduate
school degrees, and why can't I buy the house I think I should
have?'''
</P>
<P>
   One patient told Levy he watched ``an already inflated house
shoot up to $2.6 million in 10 hours and then sold to some
30-year-old dot-com guy.'' Levy added: ``There's a lot of
self-blame: What did I do wrong? How stupid was I?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dave Davis, a psychiatrist in Atlanta, where real estate
agents said house values in the most expensive neighborhoods had
doubled in five years, said real estate rage ``is a terrific
problem _ just about every day, one of my patients brings it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And although heartbreak happens in every income bracket these
days, real estate agents and therapists agree: The people who yell
the loudest are usually those with the most money.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has no problem identifying. He lives _ and works _ in
Buckhead, one of Atlanta's fanciest suburbs, and his clientele
includes lots of wealthy men and women in their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anger, a lot of disappointment here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, where prices are up at least 15 percent in the best
neighborhoods since the spring of 1999, Dr. Mark Unterberg says
home buyers are not exactly angry: They are despairing. ``Envy is
also a good word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Dr. Gail Saltz, an instructor in psychiatry at New
York Presbyterian Hospital, said her patients ``are certainly
outraged and disgusted and freaked out'' by New York City prices,
where the average apartment just hit $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't believe the market keeps going up,'' she said.
``They have a presumption about certain basic things they can
expect in life.''
</P>
<P>
   An inability to afford that Park Avenue condo, she said, can
lead to distress. ``They see a multimillion-dollar asking price
they can't afford,'' she said. ``They feel like losers. Here you
are making a pretty good salary, but in this crazy situation you
can't compete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, what are the most exciting things in life?'' she
said. ``Sex? Paying incredible amounts of money for real estate? If
you can't have the first, the second fills a lot of fantasy
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But even before they take their anger to the therapist,
embittered house and apartment hunters often take it to the broker,
who is usually the bearer of bad tidings: Outbid again. Turned down
by the co-op board. The sellers accepted your offer and then
reneged after they got a higher one. Or the simplest of all: Sorry,
you can't possibly afford what you think you should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of rage right now,'' said Diane Waller, a real
estate agent in Manhattan. ``People's homes are such emotionally
charged issues in the first place. It really is enraging to be out
there and keep missing.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents are angry, too. ``After all, we're out the
commission,'' said Frank Newbold, manager of the East Hampton,
N.Y., office of Sotheby's International Real Estate. ``We don't get
paid when a deal falls through.'' He said he spends hours
counseling angry millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them it isn't a car crash, it isn't cancer,'' he said.
``I tell them to get some perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The tendency is to find someone to blame. ``It's never your own
fault,'' said Frederick Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real
Estate in New York. ``So you've got to slap the underling. You've
got to slap the broker around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad behavior is rife right now _ especially among those
unaccustomed to hearing no. ``They went to Harvard Business School,
and they're making a starting salary of $175,000, and they think
they're little masters of the universe,'' said Clark Halstead, head
of the Halstead Property Co. in Manhattan. ``But guess what? With
that salary, they might be able to afford a studio!''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding like a psychotherapist himself, Halstead said the
run-of-the-mill bonus baby, faced with the Manhattan market, first
feels ``outrageous denial.'' This is followed, he continued, by ``a
quieter resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kandel, who has his own jewelry boutique at Bergdorf Goodman,
blames the brokers, not for the market's being so high, but for
their attitude. ``It makes me furious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents made him feel ``they don't want to bother with you unless
you have a spare million you want to spend,'' he said, adding:
``Then their attitude is: Well, of course it's not perfect. This is
New York. If you don't want it, somebody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he enlisted the broker, Kandel, like so many before
him, complained that the broker usually represents the seller
legally. ``They're always watching you for your reaction,'' he
said. ``They show you places with garbage strewn all over, and if
you react negatively, that's it _ they never show you anything
else. It gives you a feeling of hopelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   And what do the psychotherapists tell all these would-be
property owners, these frustrated masters of the half acre they
would like to survey?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them that's life,'' said Davis of Atlanta. ``Life's not
fair. Just like in high school, not everybody could have the
best-looking girlfriend or the most expensive car. They've got to
get centered.''

 &HT;    Michigan voters give Bush and Gore a run for their money
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ The next time Democrat Al Gore visits Michigan,
autoworker John McGrath might tell the vice president to shove his
presidential campaign right up the exhaust pipe of the nearest
Chevrolet, Chrysler or Ford.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath twice voted for Bill Clinton but Gore's blasts at the
internal combustion engine and support for normal trade relations
with China have soured the Delphi Automotive Systems tool designer
on the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, retired mortgage banker Carol Tomasi still smarts
about how Michigan Republicans have treated her candidate, Arizona
Sen. John McCain, since McCain gave George W. Bush a Texas-sized
thrashing in the state's
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential primary in February.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shouldn't count on Tomasi's vote Nov. 7, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath and Tomasi are reminders of the fences both Gore and
Bush must mend in Michigan before either can hope to capture the
state's 18 electoral votes. Neither candidate has captured the
electorate's fancy in a state both parties consider a ``must win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the two best we can find?'' asked John Ruggero,
corporate counsel for a real estate title company in Mt. Clemens, a
Detroit suburb. ``Neither one kind of thrills me.''
</P>
<P>
   After picking Republicans Ronald Reagan and George Bush in three
straight president elections, Michigan voters gave their support to
Bill Clinton in 1992 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won decisively enough to make it seem possible that
Michigan's so-called ``Reagan Democrats'' had abandoned their fling
with Republicans. In 1992, for example, Clinton got 44 percent of
the vote to 36 percent for President George Bush, the current
Republican candidate's father. Ross Perot got 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Ohio _ where Clinton beat Bush by just 2 points _
this was a Clinton landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's positions on the environment and China trade have chilled
his relations with some Democrats and swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Third-term Republican Gov. John Engler, unable to deliver the
state for his party in the last two presidential elections,
believes George W. Bush is the right candidate to reverse the
results.
</P>
<P>
   To Engler's embarrassment, however, Bush was the wrong candidate
in the Republican primary, which was open to all voters. McCain,
with strong support from Democrats and independents, won. Despite
efforts by Engler and McCain's Michigan chairman, state Sen. John
Schwartz of Battle Creek, to patch things up, many McCain
supporters have yet to jump on Bush's presidential bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the country has barely begun to focus on the
election, the hotly contested Republican primary and controversy
over trade with China already have put the campaign on voters'
radar here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Michigan's U.S. Senate race _ pitting incumbent
Republican Spencer Abraham against U.S. Rep. Deborah Stabenow,
D-Lansing _ is considered one of the nation's most competitive. And
the fall ballot also includes a school voucher proposal that has
support from conservative Republicans and black pastors in
inner-city Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear which presidential candidate might benefit most
from these other ballot issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan could go either way,'' said Democratic pollster Ed
Sarpolus of Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Steve Mitchell of East Lansing, forecast a
close race as well, but said, ``I think ultimately Bush will take
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   CLEAN AIR, FREE TRADE AND AL GORE
</P>
<P>
   McGrath, 55, has worked in the automobile industry for 34 years,
first for General Motors and more recently for Delphi Automotive
Systems, a GM spin-off. McGrath lives in a suburb of Flint, the
city where General Motors was born and where sit-down strikes in
the 1930s established the United Auto Workers as a force to be
reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   There are 493,165 workers in Michigan with jobs related to the
automobile industry _ nearly as many people as the 495,817 who live
in the city of Cleveland _ according to the University of
Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore came into the presidential campaign already suspect to
McGrath and many others because his 1992 book, ``Earth in the
Balance,'' talked about eliminating the internal combustion engine
in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore joined President Clinton _ as well as Bush _ in
backing normal trade relations with China, it was more than McGrath
and others like him could take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for sure the Democrats were going to get us out of
the cesspool of swirling down into world trade organizations,''
McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen auto-related employment plummet in Genesee County,
which includes Flint, from nearly 51,000 in 1984 to 21,300 last
year. To McGrath, normal trade relations with China sounds like a
formula for sending auto jobs
</P>
<P>
   overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a narrow focus _ my job and the jobs of a lot of people
in this area,'' said McGrath. ``We're talking long-term here.''
</P>
<P>
   His views were echoed by United Auto Workers President Stephen
Yokich, who lives in suburban Detroit, after the U.S. House in May,
with Gore's and Clinton's backing, voted for normalizing China
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One moment, presidential candidate Gore is telling the labor
movement that he believes human rights, workers' rights and
environmental protections should be included in core trade
agreements; the next, Vice President Gore is holding hands with the
profiteers of the world,'' Yokich said.
</P>
<P>
   While the national AFL-CIO has endorsed Gore, the UAW hasn't,
and Yokich said the union will explore alternatives to the major
party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to forget about party labels and instead focus on
supporting candidates, such as (the Green Party's) Ralph Nader, who
will take a stand based on what is right, not what big money
dictates,'' Yokich said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath, who as a technical worker is not a UAW member, said
he's not likely to back a third party candidate, although Pat
Buchanan of the Reform Party, as well as Nader, is seeking votes in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't vote for idiots,'' said McGrath. ``That kind of
narrows the field to nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he's inclined to support Bush, even though Bush, like
Gore, supports the China trade agreement. He said he expected the
Republicans to take that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it's an anticipated evil,'' McGrath said. ``From the
Democrats we were hoping for a little help for the working
people.''
</P>
<P>
   While some autoworkers may sit the election out, McGrath won't.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports more gun control; Bush doesn't, said McGrath, a
hunter and fisherman. That's enough to put him, at least
temporarily, on Bush's side.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's trouble with autoworkers and the UAW hasn't gone
unnoticed by Republicans, including Engler. He and Bush are going
after those votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made one UAW (plant) gate stop,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said he's won election three times without the support of
labor leaders but with the backing of rank-and-file members. They
like the Republican emphasis on tax cuts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their better bet is the Republican Party to keep what they're
earning,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krell, UAW communications director, said Gore and the union
may not be through talking.
</P>
<P>
   Krell said the union agrees with the vice president on the
desire to produce cars that pollute less. The union's goal,
however, is to produce such cars in this country, not overseas.
</P>
<P>
   While they will continue to disagree on China, Gore must make
the case that he is better than Bush on other issues such as Social
Security, prescription drugs for senior citizens and workers' right
to organize, Krell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has a case that he can make,'' said Krell. ``He's
going to have to work a little harder to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN WINS AND LOSES
</P>
<P>
   Retired mortgage banker Carol Tomasi, 61, cheered Feb. 22 when
her candidate, Sen. John McCain, defeated Bush in Michigan's
Republican primary, getting 51 percent to Bush's 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those cheers turned to disappointment a month ago when delegates
to the Michigan Republican Convention all but ignored McCain
backers in
</P>
<P>
   choosing delegates to this summer's Republican National
Convention. Instead, Bush supporters will dominate the Michigan
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain didn't like the way his supporters were treated and
cancelled two Michigan campaign appearances for U.S. House
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, when we began this crusade I told you I would
always tell the truth,'' McCain said in an e-mail to his followers.
``The truth is what is happening in the Michigan Republican Party
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomasi agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to do any campaigning (for Bush),'' she said.
Worse for Bush, she's not even sure she'll vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still looking over the issues,'' said Tomasi, who liked
McCain's straightforward approach and his push for campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John Schwartz, McCain's Michigan chairman, believes
McCain ``did get the shaft,'' but he is working with Gov. Engler
and others to heal the wounds between McCain and Bush supporters.
Schwartz believes that by the time of the fall campaign, Republican
forces will be marching together.
</P>
<P>
   He also is thrilled at the response he has gotten to 5,000
bumper stickers he had made with the message: ``Bush-McCain
America's Choice.'' Although McCain has insisted that he won't
accept a position as Bush's vice presidential running mate,
Schwartz hasn't given up hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is exceedingly popular in this state,'' Schwartz
said.
</P>
<P>
   That would not sway Tomasi, however. In fact, she said it's a
lousy idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very upset,'' Tomasi said. ``I think (McCain's) too
important to the Republican Party. As vice president, he would be
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   BUILDING ON THE BASES
</P>
<P>
   Not every voter in Michigan is miffed at Gore and Bush, longing
for McCain or already tuned out of what promises to be a very busy
fall campaign. Some McCain supporters besides Schwartz have come to
grips with what they consider political reality: Bush is the
Republican candidate and he's preferable to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to vote today, I would vote for an elephant if he
were running against Gore,'' said Virginia Butler, 67, a retired
accountant from Sterling Heights, a Detroit suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Across the state in Ottawa County along Lake Michigan, there's
almost a frenzy for Bush. The county is considered the state's most
conservative and dependably Republican. It's part of one of only
two Michigan congressional districts that Bush carried in the
February primary.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Holmes, 59, doubles as party chairman and chairman of the
political science department at Hope College in Holland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time a Democrat carried this county was McClellan in
1864,'' Holmes said. Civil War Gen. George McClellan lost the 1864
election to a Republican incumbent named Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   This year, when Bush showed up for the county party's Lincoln
Day dinner, 1,200 people showed up, triple the usual turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that if the people aren't fired up,'' said
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Clinton feelings help Bush in the county, dominated by
residents of Dutch descent, Holmes added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This county is very strong on family values,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blueberry farmer Kenneth Reenders of Grand Haven, a town of
12,000 in northern Ottawa County, is in that group. Reenders still
can't figure out how Clinton managed to stay in office after the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part that really gets me is that he lied,'' said Reenders.
``Everybody makes a mistake. If I would have done that, they would
have thrown the book at me. Any college president, he'd be out like
a light.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone judges Gore by Clinton's missteps.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Detroit remains a Democratic stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been voting since I was old enough to vote,'' said Rodney
Means, 54, a barber at Rayfield's Friendly Barber Shop on the
city's east side. ``I'm going with Gore because he is a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't care about what Clinton did or didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all doing it,'' he said. ``He just happened to get
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Grayson, who was getting a haircut in a chair next to
Means', said he likes Gore and plans to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been one of our most active vice presidents,'' said
Grayson, 51, an investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 miles north along Interstate 75 in the suburbs of
Flint, retired autoworker Van Williams, 93, also plans to back the
vice president. Williams was born in Tennessee, came to Flint in
1923 and participated in the UAW's seminal
</P>
<P>
   sit-down strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Democrat all my life,'' said Williams, who chatted
briefly before getting ready to play golf. He doesn't like what
Bush has said about Gore. ``Bush has been putting out very
slanderous remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ``go-Gore'' cheers are good news to state Rep. LaMar
Lemmons, a Detroit Democrat. Lemmons originally backed New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic nomination but is trying to
work up enthusiasm for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Democratic lawmakers hope for a strong turnout on
election day not only to help Gore but to help them take back the
Michigan House, which Republicans control 58-52.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons and state Rep. Kwame M. Kilpatrick of Detroit, who hopes
to become the first black speaker of the Michigan House if
Democrats gain control, hope to improve voter turnout in Detroit.
Clinton won in the city in 1996 with 95 percent of the vote, but he
got just 224,371 votes _ fewer than the 260,991 Democrat Michael
Dukakis got in his 1988 losing effort and far fewer than the
322,394 Walter Mondale got in his landslide loss to Ronald Reagan
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the vice president is going to rise to the occasion,''
Kilpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons hopes so, but he is wary of Engler. The Republican
governor want to make amends for what happened to Bush in the
primary, said Lemmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's wounded,'' Lemmons said. ``There's nothing worse
than a wounded animal. I don't agree with him. I have the utmost
respect for his ability. He's the smartest governor we've ever
had.''

 &HT;    Summing up the presidential campaign from Michigan: ``Everything
is so monotone.''
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. _ Democrat Al Gore got Maureen Franey's
attention but not necessarily her vote when he picked L'Anse Creuse
Middle School North in Macomb County to kick off his ``School
Days'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fabulous,'' said Franey, 48, an executive secretary at
Philip F. Greco Title Co. in nearby Mount Clemens. ``That went
along way with me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Macomb County, just north of Detroit, gained a
national reputation as home to thousands of so-called ``Reagan
Democrats.'' These were voters who historically had backed
Democrats in presidential campaigns but found the optimistic and
socially conservative Ronald Reagan more in tune than incumbent
Democrat Jimmy Carter with their political and cultural tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton helped get Democrats back to the White House by
moving the party to the center and appealing to voters in Macomb
County and similar counties across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Macomb County went with incumbent President George Bush
against Clinton even though Clinton won statewide in Michigan. In
1996, county voters backed Clinton over Republican Bob Dole as
Clinton again carried the state. While the voter trend here has
been Republican in recent presidential elections, the electorate
includes a mix of blue- and white-collar workers who, when
questioned, are likely to say they vote for the candidate, not the
party.
</P>
<P>
   With 787,698 residents, it's the state's third most populous
county after Wayne (Detroit) and Oakland, another suburban county
north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to the middle school on March 24 particularly
caught Franey's attention because her daughter, now 22, had
attended the school. Franey is also a big fan of Gore's wife,
Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a regular gal,'' Franey said.
</P>
<P>
   Franey said, however, that in the last two presidential
elections she stuck with Republicans. This year, she remains
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a big Clinton fan. . . . There's something about
him,'' she said. There's also ``something about'' George W. Bush
that doesn't appeal to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got that smirk,'' Franey said.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that could turn her toward Gore is gun control. She
favors more of it and liked the recent ``Million Mothers' March''
on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to be collecting Uzis . . . automatic weapons,''
said Franey.
</P>
<P>
   Don Foley said he's closer to making up his mind. Foley voted
for Reagan once and for George Bush against Michael Dukakis, but
then voted twice for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaning toward Gore. I like what's been going on, not with
Bill Clinton's personal habits, but I like what's been going on
with the economy,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, 51, commutes every day from the county to Romulus, a
suburb south of Detroit, where he's an assistant high school
principal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore lacks political charisma, which hurts him, said Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (voters) want a Harrison Ford for president but they want
him with the morals of Al Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trish Shandor, 27, a student at Macomb County Community College,
is one of many Michigan voters still yearning for Arizona Sen. John
McCain, whom she supported in the Republican primary in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believed McCain had a voice,'' Shandor said. ``He had
a strong assertiveness I don't see in Bush or Gore. He's so in tune
with the people. He wanted to make government work for the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Messina, 30, also a student at the community college,
leans toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has family values,'' Messina said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she supports more gun control, which Bush
doesn't advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people should carry guns,'' she said. ``This is
not what the United States is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Philip F. Greco Title Co., Mary Brusseau, a
supervisor still is trying to make up her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Brusseau, 51, remembers being a ``Kennedy Girl'' when John F.
Kennedy ran for president in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hat, banner. . .,'' she recalled. She voted for McCain
in the Republican primary but isn't committed to either Bush or
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is so monotone,'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   In presidential elections she generally has supported Democrats,
including Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This time she's just looking for a candidate with whom she can
connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has me yet,'' she said. ``Nobody has me willing to go
out and vote for them.''

 &HT;    New fall books will knock your sandals off
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The arrival of wintry fashions in the stores
always makes me feel summer is ending too soon, but fall book
titles have the opposite effect. They always hold out the promise
of something better.
</P>
<P>
   One book worth looking forward to is former New York Times
investigative reporter Nicholas Gage's ``Greek Fire'' (Knopf,
October), an account of the romance between shipping magnate
Aristotle Onassis and the great diva, Maria Callas _ including how
the relationship survived his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy. Gage,
who came to America as a child during the Greek Civil War in 1948,
wrote a powerful memoir about his mother titled ``Eleni,'' which
became a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth anticipating is a new book by Stephen Ambrose, the
historian best known for ``Undaunted Courage.'' In ``Nothing Like
It in the World,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, September), he writes about
the men who built the transcontinental railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Two New York Times correspondents, Nicholas D. Kristof and
Sheryl WuDunn, provide a timely report on Asia and the way it's
reshaping the world in ``Thunder from the East: Portrait of a
Rising Asia'' (Knopf, September).
</P>
<P>
   Other promising nonfiction titles include Austin biographer H.W.
Brands' ``The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin
Franklin'' (Doubleday, October). Brands draws on previously
unpublished letters. Other new biographies include ``Citizen
Greenspan: The Man Behind the Money'' by Justin Martin (Perseus,
November) and ``Hitler'' by Ian Kershaw (Norton, September).
</P>
<P>
   The great South American writer Jorge Luis Borges has a new
book, despite the fact that he died in 1986. ``This Craft of
Verse'' (Harvard University Press, September) collects lost
lectures he delivered in English at Harvard in 1967-68.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, ``Nightline's'' Ted Koppel becomes the latest TV
news anchor with a book: ``Off Camera: Private Moments Made
Public'' (Knopf, September). The same, but different, is columnist
Liz Smith's story, ``Natural Blonde'' (Hyperion, September)
Columnist Anna Quindlen departs from her usual territory with ``A
Short Guide to a Happy Life,'' (Random House, October), advising
readers on how to live fully, with awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs rule again this year. In ``No One's Perfect'' (Kodansha,
September), Hirotada Ototake writes about growing up in Japan _ a
country that traditionally shields people with disabilities from
the public eye _ without arms or legs and fighting for the chance
to lead a normal life. In ``Before I Say Goodbye,'' English
journalist Ruth Picardie (Holt, October) describes with wit and
precision the final year of her life. She died at 33 from cancer, a
month after her twins' second birthday. There's also a new photo
memoir of the expatriate writer and musician Paul Bowles,
``Yesterday's Perfume'' (Clarkson Potter, November) by photographer
Cherie Nutting; former Austinite Celia Morris' ``Finding Celia's
Place'' (Texas A&AMP;M Press, September), about growing up in the '50s,
ambitious but limited by the times; and African American journalist
Debra Dickerson's ``An American Story'' (Pantheon, September).
</P>
<P>
   A fun title is Sam Sifton's on-target ``A Field Guide to the
Yettie: America's Young, Entrepreneurial Technocrats'' (Talk
Miramax Books, Nov.)
</P>
<P>
   Texas photographer Keith Carter has a haunting new horse photo
collection, ``Ezekiel's Horse'' (UT Press, November), and Laura
Wilson, known for her photos of Navajos, has a new book called
``Hutterites of Montana'' (Yale University Press, October).
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of good fiction will find much to engage them. Watch for
Carlos Fuentes' novel ``The Years with Laura Diaz'' (Farrar,
Straus, October), featuring his first major female protagonist;
Margaret Atwood's novel ``The Blind Assassin'' (Doubleday,
September); Alice Walker's stories ``The Way Forward is With a
Broken Heart'' (Random House, October); National Book Award winner
Ha Jin's stories, ``The Bridegroom,'' (Pantheon, October); Caleb
Carr's novel, ``Killing Time'' (Random House, September); Jim
Harrison's novellas, ``The Beast God Forgot to Invent''
(Grove/Atlantic, October); Michael Chabon's novel, ``The Amazing
Adventures of Kavalier &AMP; Clay'' (Random House, September); and
Canadian Bonnie Burnard's novel ``A Good House'' (Henry Holt,
September). There'll be lots of first novelists, plus reliable
repeaters like Anne Rice, Bruce Sterling, Kinky Friedman, Joe
Lansdale and Stephen Coonts.
</P>
<P>
   So, look forward to the fall. This is just a sample.

<P>
   There was a time when the term securities analyst was
unambiguous. It was a man or woman who gathered all sorts of
information about particular stocks _ from basic financial data to
arcane tidbits about the competition _ and analyzed all these
factors to come up with investment advice for brokerage clients.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts spent hours crunching a company's numbers, probing its
management team, investigating its customer relationships and the
strength of its markets _ generally assessing its prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Then they issued a report, usually on paper, explaining why a
stock was a buy at a given price or not. Clients of the big
brokerage houses got the research as a matter of course as part of
the service they expected in return for paying full commissions on
their trades.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what the function of a
Wall Street analyst is. Analysts still perform research. And they
still make recommendations. But now analysts have many masters,
with diverging interests.
</P>
<P>
   Research must help the brokerage's sales force generate orders.
It must also guide institutional clients (big mutual fund companies
like Fidelity or Putnam). And, increasingly, analysts play a vital
role in helping their firms drum up underwriting and
mergers-and-acquisitions advisory business.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in there are the interests of individual investors
seeking unbiased investment advice.
</P>
<P>
   The individual investor is decidedly lowest on the totem pole in
the hearts _ and wallets _ of analysts because they deliver the
fewest bucks to Wall Street firms. The real money comes from fees
generated by underwriting new securities offerings, brokering
megadeals and high-volume trading activity from institutions. A
hundred shares of Cisco _ a sizable transaction to the average
investor _ doesn't amount to a hill of beans for a broker or banker
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   And when even big firms like Merrill Lynch are going online and
cutting commissions to retain customers, there's no margin left to
pay for research aimed at the little guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the motivation isn't on trading volume,'' says Maryann
Keller, president of the auto services division of priceline.com
and formerly a top auto-industry analyst with Kidder Peabody, Paine
Webber and Furman Selz. ``But rather it's on who's going to do
financing or M&AMP;A activity and who will generate fee income.''
</P>
<P>
   That's important to keep in mind when you read the papers or
watch financial news shows on TV. The marquee names like Morgan
Stanley's Mary Meeker in Internet stocks or Rick Sherlund, the top
analyst on Microsoft, may seem to be talking to you, the individual
investor. But the message is about something other than what's best
for your portfolio. Sherlund's employer, Goldman Sachs, offers
brokerage service only to high-net-worth investors. Its core
businesses are investment banking and trading.
</P>
<P>
   At their most conflicted, research analysts are little more than
shills for the investment banking clients of their firms. In the
old days, there was a ``Chinese Wall'' that, in theory if not in
practice, separated equities research from banking. That wall is
history. Analysts actively participate in the process of bringing
in banking business. And they cover primarily companies that have
generated big banking fees for their firms. Not surprisingly, the
bias is to urge customers to buy, never sell.
</P>
<P>
   That, say veteran analysts, is not how the game was played 10 or
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say there was no pressure,'' says Charles Hill,
director of research for earnings forecast aggregator First Call
and a longtime Wall Street analyst. In a 20-year career on Wall
Street, Hill worked for a series of brokerages that included
Prudential Bache and Kidder Peabody, covering the electronics
industry, the forerunner of today's high-tech sector. ``I put sell
[recommendations] on big corporate-finance clients like Amp,'' says
Hill, of the electronics connector company since acquired by Tyco,
and heard ``no complaints from Pru management or from Amp.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark side of research gets darker still. Analysts often
invest for their personal accounts in the same companies they
follow. These investments typically are disclosed in the
eye-straining print at the bottom of their reports, but the vested
interest can't help but taint objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Wall Street analysts are often invited to make
early-stage investments in companies they may later follow as
analysts. Indeed, many private companies feel that by offering
prepublic shares to name-brand analysts, the company will improve
its odds of being chosen as a client by the star's investment bank.
(A spot survey of several top investment brokerages reveals strict
rules for disclosure of investments in shares of companies that are
investment banking clients. But the rules don't always cover
investments in immature companies.)
</P>
<P>
   So, if analysts appear to be such a rotten bunch, what use could
they possibly be to the average investor? Quite a lot, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are experts in their fields, often individuals who
moved to Wall Street after a career in the industry they now
analyze. Philip Rueppel, a computer hardware analyst with Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown in San Francisco, worked in marketing and
product-development positions for six years at Hewlett-Packard
before becoming an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been invaluable to me over the years,'' says Rueppel, an
electrical engineer by training. He says the industry background
helps most in terms of being a ``fib detector'' on what he's
hearing from HP (one of the hardware manufacturers he follows) and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Phillips, business software analyst for Morgan Stanley ran
computer systems for the U.S. Marine Corps before becoming an
analyst. He also has an undergraduate degree in computer science,
which he terms ``critical to understanding the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chaplinsky, now a venture capitalist with Mohr Davidow
Ventures in Menlo Park, Calif., spent six years at Intel before
following the chip maker for Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. Because he worked
in the investor relations department at Intel, some investors
believed Chaplinsky often had a better ability than competing
analysts to read the company's body language.
</P>
<P>
   The top analysts in a sector may not be the best stock pickers.
But they have deep understanding of the businesses and spend time
with top executives, accumulating a treasure trove of information
that ordinary investors can't obtain. They may not be adept at
assessing whether a stock is a buy or a sell, but they are able to
evaluate market opportunities and, occasionally, pick up reasons
for investors to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the investment-banking link can taint analyst
coverage, it has a positive side as well. Analysts at firms that
have a banking relationship with a covered company also tend to
have unusually good access to senior management at those companies.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst who meets with a young company as it prepares to go
public, shepherds it through the IPO process, and then supports it
in the aftermarket with continuing research coverage likely will be
the first to get a return phone call and be in the best position to
discern changes in the business plan, for good or ill.
</P>
<P>
   And, analysts say, they also function as a quality-control
department for their banks. If a major analyst is skeptical about a
company's business plan and indicates that he or she won't be able
to support the stock with favorable research post-IPO, the bank may
pass on the deal. How often this happens isn't a matter of public
record.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a research analyst can be a key resource for the
investor. Insights can be more valuable than advice, especially at
a time when opinions can be had on the cheap (on the tube and all
over the Web) but even investing giants like George Soros and
Julian Robertson are confused as to what to make of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   So, research is just that _ background material that gives you
some understanding of what's going on in a particular sector of the
market. It is not, however, a reliable way to pick stocks.
</P>

evaluate market opportunities and, occasionally, pick up reasons
for investors to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the investment-banking link can taint analyst
coverage, it has a positive side as well. Analysts at firms that
have a banking relationship with a covered company also tend to
have unusually good access to senior management at those companies.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst who meets with a young company as it prepares to go
public, shepherds it through the IPO process, and then supports it
in the aftermarket with continuing research coverage likely will be
the first to get a return phone call and be in the best position to
discern changes in the business plan, for good or ill.
</P>
<P>
   And, analysts say, they also function as a quality-control
department for their banks. If a major analyst is skeptical about a
company's business plan and indicates that he or she won't be able
to support the stock with favorable research post-IPO, the bank may
pass on the deal. How often this happens isn't a matter of public
record.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a research analyst can be a key resource for the
investor. Insights can be more valuable than advice, especially at
a time when opinions can be had on the cheap (on the tube and all
over the Web) but even investing giants like George Soros and
Julian Robertson are confused as to what to make of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   So, research is just that _ background material that gives you
some understanding of what's going on in a particular sector of the
market. It is not, however, a reliable way to pick stocks.

   SEOUL, South Korea _ Dozens of young people crowd around a stage
outside the high-rise, smoke wafting into the night sky as techno
music blares, a ring of red neon lights running up the building.
</P>
<P>
   This could be New York, Miami or Los Angeles, but it's the pulse
of another great city, Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   It's boomtown squared, a city of 11 million where cars and
motorcycles speed along packed streets by day, the din of horns
urging cars and pedestrians on. At night young people walk through
packed markets with a swagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work hard,'' said Michael Lee, an executive in Seoul.
``Really, we achieved no less than a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul is a showcase for the remarkable rise of South Korea from
the ashes of a war that began 50 years ago today and devastated the
peninsula. It is also the polar opposite of Pyongyang, North Korea
_ the hub of a nation where famine and economic stagnation are the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the historic summit earlier this month between
the leaders of North and South Korea _ two nations that are
technically still at war _ other contrasts stand out.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean exports include semiconductor chips, electronic
components, appliances, ships, cars, steel and machinery. Bereft of
such industries for the most part and geared to military
production, the insular north has long depended on subsidies from
neighboring China, and at one time, the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, tuberculosis is at epidemic proportions,
striking peasants and the elite alike. United Nations health
officials have discovered severe malnutrition and stunting among
children.
</P>
<P>
   There is an energy crisis, too, in North Korea. Brownouts, once
scheduled to conserve power, now take place without notice and can
last days at a time, compounding the misery of the north's brutal
Siberian winters, said veteran Korea observer Marcus Noland, a
senior fellow at the nonpartisan Institute for International
Economics.
</P>
<P>
   An hour south of ``Propaganda Village,'' a North Korean ghost
town where giant speakers aimed to the south blast communist
slogans, downtown Seoul's busy Myong-dong district is lighted up
like Las Vegas in a style best described as Asian hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Korean in the south earned $8,551 last year, while
observers say his or her counterpart in the north pocketed less
than $1,000. South Koreans are more likely to own a cell phone than
an American, but they share the same taste in designer jeans,
dresses, shoes and music.
</P>
<P>
   A South Korean middle class has emerged since around 1960, when
the ordinary worker earned $79 per year. Growth has averaged around
8.8 percent since then, and today South Korea has reversed its
once-lopsided import-expert balance.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly on par with each other in 1980, the two Koreas have gone
in radically different directions in the intervening 20 years, said
L. Gordon Flake, executive director of the Mansfield Center for
Pacific Affairs, a think tank in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   As the south has grown wealthier, the north's economy has
shrunk. Young northerners are not as well off as they were 10 years
before, Flake said, ``and so they have no access to phones, no
international television, no knowledge of the outside world.
They're impoverished and in many cases on the brink of
starvation.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of reunification since the leadership summit ended June 15
has fired a new hunger in Seoul, where war memories are fading with
the aging veterans who fought it, and a new generation enjoys a
seemingly endless bounty of material wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The talk has included speculation that North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung might win the Nobel
Peace Prize for their step toward reconciliation, the most
promising sign of rapprochement since the Korean war ended with a
fragile truce in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   While talk of eventual unification is at a feverish pitch,
practical matters remain, including the integration of two
economies and vastly different political systems. Those same issues
continue to plague a far more affluent Germany, a decade after the
unification of the communist East and democratic West.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the emerging, vocal middle class in South Korea,
observers say democracy is evolving but still immature, while the
north with Kim at the helm remains the world's only dynastic
communist state.
</P>
<P>
   Kim took power after the death in 1994 of his father, Kim Il
Sung, who had been the country's only leader since the peninsula
was divided in 1945. The government today ``in many ways remains a
theocracy with a divine leader at the top,'' Noland said.

 &HT;    Take steps to make your home unattractive to burglars
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Burglaries in Dayton and elsewhere in the United
States dropped about 10 percent between 1998 and 1999, according to
FBI crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't much comfort if yours was one of the 3,653 Dayton
houses burglarized last year. According to the Chicago-based
Burglary Prevention Council, a burglary happened somewhere in the
United States every 11 seconds last year, and the typical
burglarized house lost $1,350, not counting the cost of repairs to
broken windows and the like.
</P>
<P>
   We're heading for July and August, the busiest months of the
year for burglars. So if you want to help the downward trend in
burglaries continue, there are a few steps you can take to make
your house less attractive to thieves, particularly when you're on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Contact the local police department at least a week before you
leave. Some departments offer free crime-prevention inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Most police departments tell patrolling officers to keep an eye
on a house when they know it is going to be temporarily vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the delivery office of your neighborhood post office to
have mail delivery stopped if you're going to be out of town. Also
stop your newspaper delivery. If you're going to be gone for more
than a week, have someone cut your grass.
</P>
<P>
   DISCOURAGING BURGLARS
</P>
<P>
   Some of the following tips are from the Burglary Prevention
Council, and you can get more information from the organization by
visiting its Web site at www.burglaryprevention.org. Or send $1 for
handling and a self-addressed stamped envelope to Burglary
Prevention Council, 221 N. LaSalle St., Suite 3500, Chicago, Ill.
60601-1520 for the booklet ``Keep Your Home Safe &AMP; Secure.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Close and lock all doors when leaving home even for short
periods. More than a quarter of all burglary is without forced
entry. Make sure you check the doors of the attached garage and
breezeway, as well as all windows, including basement windows.
</P>
<P>
   _ Install deadbolt locks on all entry doors. A deadbolt lock is
hard to force and doubles your door's resistance to intrusion. If
there are no breakable windows within 40 inches of the lock, you
can use a lock with a thumb latch that will let you open the door
from the inside without a key. In doors with glass panels, use a
lock with a keyhole on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Secure all windows. You can lock a double-hung window securely
and inexpensively by drilling a hole at a downward angle through
the front sash into the back sash where the sashes overlap. A
wooden peg in the hole will keep the window from raising. Check
home-improvement, hardware or variety stores for other
window-locking ideas and devices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use automatic timers. Some timers can be set to turn on
lights, radios and other appliances at the same time each day.
Others that are slightly more expensive vary the on and off
patterns from day to day to enhance the illusion that someone is
home. Setting a timer on a radio tuned to a talk-show station might
fool burglars into thinking a live conversation is going on if they
listen at the window.
</P>
<P>
   _ Illuminate the yard. Outdoor lighting is an effective
deterrent to burglars. Energy-efficient low-voltage outdoor lights
can eliminate the dark spots where a burglar could hide and a light
with a motion sensor is great way to shoo a potential thief.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lock up ladders, tools and lawn furniture. Don't invite
burglary by providing aids to breaking into your house. A sturdy
lawn chair that can quickly be pulled under a window makes getting
through that window easier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trim trees and shrubs growing close to the house. To enter
your house without making a lot of noise, a burglar needs time to
work. Tall bushes and hanging branches can provide shelter while
the burglar cases the house or tries to pry open a door or window.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start a neighborhood watch program. Your local police
department can help organize a neighborhood watch group that
encourages neighbors to watch out for one another. But even without
a formal watch group, you should get to know your close neighbors
so each of you can help keep the other's house safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use window and door alarms. Look around discount and
home-improvement stores for inexpensive audible alarms that go off
when a window or door is forced. Also available are professionally
installed systems that automatically call emergency crews when it
senses trouble. Before investing in such a system, however, check
with police to find out what is legal in your community.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inventory your valuables and place small valuables and
important documents in a safety-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   _ Install a peephole in the front door. You must know who's at
the door before you open it, and a 180-degree peephole gives you a
fairly good view if the door doesn't have a window. Cracking the
door and depending on a security chain to protect you can have
deadly results.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't place a key under the doormat or in a similar hiding
place. Experienced burglars check doormats, flower pots, window
ledges, the tops of doors and so on because they know people leave
keys there for emergencies. If you need to leave a key outside your
house, give it to a trusted neighbor or two.
</P>
<P>
   A WORD OF CAUTION
</P>
<P>
   In last week's column on house painting, I mentioned that it is
possible to use a heat gun or propane torch to help remove cracked
paint from a house exterior. Local firefighters called to say using
propane torches has on a few occasions led to house fires as the
flames got underneath the exterior boards. Torches and heat guns
should be used only with the most extreme caution. Heat stripping
may be a technique best left to trained professionals.

   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days.

   RACE-PLANTATION (Natchitoches, La.) _ At the south edge of the
old plantation, eight simple cabins stood in a field of clover.
Generations of whitewash were peeling in ugly patches from the
mud-brick walls. All but one front porch had rotted away, and there
were gaping holes where doors and windows used to be. Obscured by
rows of live oaks, the cabins had been forgotten by many and
ignored by most. There was almost nothing left _ except the stories
of the slaves who once lived in them. Will re-enactments of slave
life at a former plantation, now a national park, help to heal
racial wounds _ or open them? By Ginger Thompson. (6500 words, with
an abridged version of about half that length.)

<P>
   RACE-KIDS (Maplewood, N.J.) _ Back in eighth grade, Kelly Regan,
Aqeelah Mateen and Johanna Perez-Fox spent New Year's Eve in
Johanna's basement, swing-dancing until they fell down laughing,
going out on the lawn to bang pots and pans, watching the midnight
fireworks beyond the trees in the park at the center of town. They
had been a tight threesome all through Maplewood Middle School _
Kelly, a tall, coltish Irish Catholic girl; Aqeelah, a small,
earnest African-American Muslim girl, and Johanna, a
light-coffee-colored girl who is half Jewish and half Puerto Rican.
It had been, they agreed, a whole lot simpler than Johanna's
birthday party three nights before. Johanna had invited all their
friends, white and black. But the mixing did not go as she had
wished. ``The black kids stayed down in the basement and danced,
and the white kids went outside on the stoop and talked,'' Johanna
said. ``I went out and said, `Why don't you guys come downstairs?'
and they said they didn't want to.'' It happens everywhere, in the
confusions of adolescence and the yearning for identity, when the
most important thing in life is choosing a group and fitting in:
Black children and white children come apart. Friendships ebb and
end. It happens everywhere, but what is striking is that it happens
even here, where the school district is extraordinarily mixed. But,
as if pulled by internal magnets, black and white children begin to
separate at sixth grade. These are children who walked to school
together, learned to read together, slept over at each other's
houses. But race becomes as much a fault line in their world as in
the world their parents hoped to move beyond. By Tamar Lewin. (7200

more complex one has replaced it, and now the system rewards
nonwhites who know how to make the largely white electorate see in

IN HIS DELTA GARDEN, ANYTHING BUT GRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ Felder Rushing's yard looks as if a collection
of folk art had flown overhead, hit a sudden Mississippi
thunderstorm and made a crash landing. All the other bungalows on
the street have quiet little aprons of grass with a few azaleas or
clipped forgettable evergreens or a magnolia tree.
</P>
<P>
   You can't even see the Rushings' house. Its gray shingles and
red door are hidden behind yaupon hollies, a tall Chinese parasol
tree with big chartreuse leaves, staghorn sumac, green baffles
shaped like Christmas trees and a blue picket fence topped with
colored bottles. There's not a blade of grass here, and this is the
home of the state turf specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come meet Granny's chicken,'' Rushing said, leading the way to
a shrine of sorts to his grandmother: an upturned old-time bathtub
decked out in glass doorknobs and shards of old mirrors (which
reflect fractured pieces of the garden as well as any visitor's
face), surrounded by plastic white calla lilies and tall sticks of
rebar topped with upside-down blue bottles. A white concrete
chicken, chipped with age, peers out from behind a patch of
liriope.
</P>
<P>
   Granny's chicken accompanies Rushing when he lectures at the
Smithsonian Institution, Longwood Gardens, the Philadelphia Flower
Show and other hotsy-totsy places. So any snobs out there can
relax. This is vernacular art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granny was basically just a hillbilly with her concrete
chicken and her zinnias,'' Rushing said, pronouncing the word the
Southern way, ZEEN-yuhs. ``When I first learned about powdery
mildew, it was on Granny's zinnias. I don't think she realized how
clever it was to have a peely painted white concrete chicken that
sort of echoed the color of the powdery mildew. It was almost
designer-esque.'' He laughed softly.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing, 48, has written six garden books, including ``Gardening
Southern Style'' (University Press of Mississippi, 1987), which was
turned into a television series. His work has appeared in numerous
magazines, and he writes a twice-a-week column for The
Clarion-Ledger of Jackson and is the host of a Saturday radio show
heard on 24 stations in the Southeast. After 20 years as a
horticultural expert for the Mississippi Agriculture Department, he
knows every inch of the state. And he's not ashamed of that
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Indianola in the Delta, B.B. King's hometown,''
Rushing said. ``Granny lived on one side of the road, and my
great-grandmother lived on the other. She was a garden club lady
with parterres and 350 types of daffodils, all labeled.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a bit of ``cognitive dissonance between the two,'' he
said, but both spirits seem to inhabit Rushing, who is just as
comfortable swapping plants at the Flora Public Library as
lecturing to rosarians at the American Rose Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them to back off the hybrid tea roses,'' he said,
digging up a philodendron called Xanadu for a swap later that
morning. His garden is full of heirloom roses like Old Blush and a
pink Noisette he grew from a cutting from a cemetery in Natchez.
</P>
<P>
   He promotes plants, old and new, that can withstand the humidity
and drought of a Mississippi summer. Since he's Southern, people
listen. ``My folks made a couple of fortunes logging down here
until they cut down all the trees in southern Mississippi and then
moved up to the Delta in the 1880s,'' he said. ``Then they made a
couple of fortunes farming until we wore the soil out. Now we all
work for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   On a summer's night, when the fireflies are out and the
bullfrogs are croaking from the water garden, he and his wife,
Terryl, a lawyer, like to rock in their rubber tire rocking chairs,
catch up with their children, Ira, 14, and Zoe, 10, and drink
Rolling Rock by the fire, which burns in an old propane tank that
looks rather upscale, with the curved rods welded onto its rim. (So
nice, in fact, that Rich Griffin, a landscape architect who lives
in a gated community across town, has stolen the very idea.)
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said, ``They never teach landscape architects anything
about plants in school.'' He was standing by the tire planter, and
a neighbor said that he'd been hanging around Rushing too long. ``I
took that as a compliment.'' he said. ``I first heard Felder on the
radio and decided, This man is going to be my friend.'' He liked
the way Rushing described plants he had never heard of (like the
Chinese parasol trees).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not conventional, he breaks the rules, and I'm the same
way,'' he added. Griffin is known for the fine gardens he designs
around Jackson. His own oil-tank fire pit _ wide, low and elegant _
is set in a circle of brick. ``I paid $5 for this and had a friend
weld a rim,'' he said. He sells smaller ones for $500 to his
clients.
</P>
<P>
   And Griffin has helped Rushing redesign his front yard. ``The
path looked like a tongue,'' Griffin said. ``I got him to think in
circles.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, their wives can't get them out of Dumpsters when the four
go out to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Rushings' yard is an over-the-top version of what he calls ``old
lady gardens.'' To a man who adores his grandmothers, it's the
highest compliment. ``It's not an age or a gender thing, it's a
style,'' Rushing said. ``I've got an old lady garden. It's things
planted every which way. They plant the way they like, where they
like, how they like. Anybody who doesn't like it can go home.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The old lady garden is all the plants your grandmother grew,
tough old ``pass-alongs,'' like Jewels of Opar, which looks like a
sedum with an airy spray of white flowers, and an upright morning
glory, which is a woody plant you'd never find in a garden center.
</P>
<P>
   Old lady gardens have diversity, but not much order. They were a
backlash against the orderly Victorian garden, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got into a little history of Southern gardening. ``We
didn't have garden centers,'' he said. ``We had plant peddlers who
would go town to town, like the Fuller Brush man. They had a lot of
bare-root stuff, and a lot of seeds, and sometimes the peddlers
would see something really neat, and get it started themselves.
They were always easy to grow and easy to propagate.''
</P>
<P>
   People in those towns tended to collect things, like concrete
chickens and pink flamingos. ``That's a genuine pink flamingo,
autographed by the man who patented it, Donald Fetherstone in
1957,'' Rushing said. He keeps his flamingo parked by the camellia
growing out of a tire planter.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was off in his Jeep Cherokee to the town of Flora, 20
miles northwest of Jackson, where 50 gardeners were at the library
for plant swaps. ``Looks like we have a peach tree here,'' Rushing
said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman called out, ``That peach tree has been in the Hardy
family for 50 years, Felder.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushing whipped out his Felco pruners and snipped off a few
branches. ``Always cut it back a little bit, to force it to have a
nice shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman continued: ``I brought a floribunda rose for you,
because last year you said you wanted one. You'll want to trim that
one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushing, smiling, said: ``Mama says not to thank you for it. Or
it won't grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone else had brought in a night-blooming cereus, nothing
more than a scraggly green leaf. ``It's one of the ugliest plants
you've ever seen in your life,'' Felder said. ``It's one of the
most exotic looking, most fragrant flowers you'll ever meet.'' He
told how his great-grandmother used to call the kids over to her
porch, where they'd sit all night on the swing, waiting for it to
bloom. ``She didn't have a television because she thought it was
the devil,'' he said. ``And if the cereus didn't bloom, we talked
about everybody who wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went. A good salvia, S. guaranitica. A sweet william that
will come back and come back, its donor said. Ginger lily, rose
campion, Louisiana irises, the yellow ones.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Rushing was on his radio show, with calls
coming in from loyal fans like Laverne Houston, who has a nandina
as big as a house, because nobody told her it couldn't grow that
big.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing speaks his mind on the overuse of chemicals, fertilizers
that leach into the water table, pesticides that aren't necessary,
irrigation systems to water lawns that should go dormant in a
drought. ``We can't keep pouring drinking water out on our lawns,
we can't keep pouring pesticides into the rivers,'' he said. ``But
the only way you can get people to stop is to highlight people who
aren't, and sooner or later, it gets into the subliminal mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Like that gardener at the Flora plant swap. He asked her to tell
how she rooted her rose. ``I know how to root roses,'' he said.
``But she had more credentials than me, because she's a real
gardener and I'm from the university. And this countrywoman's word
is going to win every time.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know the secret, go to a plant swap in Flora. Or
ask Rushing at www.Felderrushing.com. Because he's really an old
lady gardener at heart.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are those who need furniture, and there are
those who like furniture. I count myself in the second category.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I commissioned a piece. I saw a small writing table
in a shop window in Paris, walked in on an impulse, negotiated a
variation in a different wood, and walked out with a remarkably
satisfying sensation. I now had on order a folding table for
working at my laptop, a beautiful burnt oak square on waxed steel
legs, as nicely turned as a phrase. Twelve weeks later, the table
arrived, and I was Lorenzo de Medici for the day. I even relished
the wait.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone unsatisfied by the styles, quality or similarity of
mass-produced furniture, or frustrated by the prices of vintage
furniture, commissioning a piece produces furniture specific to
your tastes and needs.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it is an opportunity to work with an architect on
a project smaller than a house In other cases, it solves a problem
that can't be solved with existing furniture. Commissioning custom
work can be comparable to the cost and delivery time of more
expensive, mass-produced items. And it's cheaper than antiques.
</P>
<P>
   People interested in design come to the decision to participate
in it in a variety of ways. They include the New York City couple
who wanted innovative, not generic, furniture for their two young
children, and a woman in New Hampshire with a keen eye for
18th-century antiques who found most new traditional American
furniture devoid of grace and skill.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Woods, chairwoman and co-founder of J. Crew, who makes
style for a living, knew exactly what she needed to perfect her
Chelsea loft, and she knew she would never find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a picture in my mind of what I wanted, so I designed
it,'' she said. ``It's exactly what's sitting in my living room.''
Woods, whose 20th-century furniture collection includes a Charlotte
Perriand oak and steel table that in part inspired her commissions,
hired two young New York architects, Louise Harpman and Scott
Specht, to design a dining table and a sideboard. ``I didn't want
the place to be all old pieces,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   The first assignment, a monumental dining table with a companion
bench, was dictated by 100-year-old oak timbers Woods located in
Colorado. The architects presented over a dozen designs, in
drawings and models.
</P>
<P>
   ``She whittled through them and found the ones that seemed more
perfect for her,'' Specht said. The architects built a full-scale
cardboard mock-up, calibrating it by eye to fit the space
precisely. The table is 12 feet 4 inches by 3 feet 6 inches; a
steel undercarriage supports the sweeping span of oak that appears,
like a magician's assistant, to float.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also commissioned a sideboard. She showed the architects a
kitchen drawer neatly organized with silverware and asked for a
design as simple as that. The 9-foot-3-inch sideboard has 15 oak
drawers, framed in steel, with finger-width gaps that serve as
pulls. Because of difficulties in executing the design's length of
steel, the piece took three tries and seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thin welded steel,'' Specht said. ``It can wave and warp
all over the place.'' The architect added a precautionary lesson:
that every original piece of design is in essence an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can take as long to design a piece of furniture as it does
to design a whole house,'' Specht said. ``In order to do that, an
architect has to charge a fee that's commensurate with the amount
of work, so it can get expensive. And it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harpman and Specht also worked recently on a project that
involved a low budget, a tight schedule and a different kind of
originality.
</P>
<P>
   James Schamus, a film producer and screenwriter, and Nancy
Kricorian, a writer, commissioned furniture for their daughters
Nona, 8, and Djuna, 4, only after shopping for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see anything that we thought was well made or
beautiful, or that suited the uses of our kids,'' Kricorian said.
Schamus asked the architects, who had designed his offices, to
submit ideas.
</P>
<P>
   What Schamus and Kricorian got was an inordinate amount of
architectural thinking for Nona's 12-by-16-foot bedroom and Djuna's
9-by-13-foot maid's room on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling carts with reversible chalkboard and Formica work
surfaces house art supplies. Nona's lower bunk bed has rolling
drawer storage below. Djuna's single bed has a rolling trundle bed
beneath for guests. Built-in desk tops can be raised as the
children grow.
</P>
<P>
   The project cost approximately $10,000, which included the gift
of a good carpenter, Anthony Sandkamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was meticulous,'' Kricorian said. ``That was my only
complaint. Something would take hours. I would say, `Tony, you have
to leave now _ my children have to go to bed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Compressing his crew into a single collaborator, Robert Cole, a
freelance art director, worked with a carpenter who was also a
designer, Eric Walton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the late 1950s, but I didn't want this to look like the
window of a SoHo shop,'' Cole said, speaking of his one-bedroom
Greenwich Village apartment, which includes furniture by Florence
Knoll and Hans J. Wegner. Instead of buying a bed, Cole had Walton
build it, for both aesthetic and practical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to look like two planes floating,'' Cole said; he
also wanted handy storage and display for books. ``I did a drawing,
which had no basis in reality,'' he added,
</P>
<P>
   Walton recalled: ``I talked him out of exactly what he wanted to
do. It wasn't that structurally sound.'' Cole established his
budget, which was $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The two men exchanged several increasingly detailed sets of
drawings. Walton built a cardboard model to scale and suggested
materials. Cole chose cherry wood. The minimal-looking project
involved intricate joinery that Cole required be concealed. Walton
said that constituted much of the cost. The process took two
months.
</P>
<P>
   In Susan Cartun's case, a novel material provided the impetus to
commission. When Cartun saw the resin-topped tables designed by
Elizabeth Diller and Richard Scofidio for the newly renovated
Brasserie restaurant on West 53rd Street, she did what any New
Yorker would do _ she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Cartun played telephone: through the restaurant to the
architects, she contacted Karen Atta, at Atta Inc., who fabricated
the resin tabletops. Ten percent of her clients are individuals
with requests for residential commissions. ``The cost of custom
work is a little higher,'' Atta said, ``but it's in the same
ballpark with higher-end commercial production. We give the client
an estimate for the job right off the bat. We rarely have someone
walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartun commissioned a 10-by-4-foot dining table top, which cost
$7,000. (The $3,000 steel base was fabricated elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very impressed with the durability of it,'' she said. ``We
sat at the Brasserie with a fork and tried to scratch it. There was
nothing ready-made in this polyresin.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartun's tables were delivered last week after two months' work,
well within the client's grace period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You buy a piece of furniture from Europe and you wait 14 to 16
weeks,'' she said. ``And this is not what you're calling custom.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the issue ultimately is craftsmanship. David Lamb, a
woodworker based in Canterbury, N.H., and a member of the New
Hampshire Furniture Masters Association, has built furniture for
Harrison Ford, Ivan Lendl and Joan Farrel, who lives in neighboring
Concord.
</P>
<P>
   Farrel, who also collects 18th-century American antiques, has
commissioned three pieces from Lamb, including a $7,500 tiger-maple
Queen Anne-style table, which took eight months to execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into a store and start checking it over, especially the
tables,'' she said. ``It's out of sight what they want for it and
the workmanship is pretty sad.''

A COMBO OF ACTORS LEARNS THE JOY OF JAMMING

 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Toward the end of August Wilson's ``Jitney,'' at the
Second Stage Theater off-Broadway, the drivers and other denizens
of Becker's Car Service return to their storefront office after a
funeral. As they enter one by one, you realize you have come to
know these characters so well that you feel you have shared the
loss with them, as though you, too, are a member of the mourning
party.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that final scene, the indelible performances of the
nine cast members in ``Jitney'' have made their characters so
familiar that you may believe you have lived in Pittsburgh's Hill
District all your life and that your own family has used Becker's
for years, to be ferried to the grocery store, washeteria or visits
to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   You know that if Turnbo shows up, he's going to grumble about
being kept waiting and start gossiping; if Fielding gets the call,
he's going to try to cadge a dollar extra for a pint of whiskey; if
it's Youngblood, he's going to complain about carrying anything in
his pristine trunk; if it's Doub or Becker himself, you're going to
get a little chit-chat with the ride. You know that Shealy runs the
numbers game and that Philmore is the doorman at the hotel. You
wonder whether Youngblood will finally be tamed by Rena and whether
they will ever get married, now that their boy is 2 years old. And
you will probably know all about Booster, Becker's son, who is due
to get out of prison soon.
</P>
<P>
   This sense of familiarity begins, of course, with the richly
poetic language of Wilson, a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning
playwright whose Broadway hits include ``Ma Rainey's Black
Bottom,'' ``Fences,'' ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' ``Two Trains
Running'' and ``Seven Guitars.'' But while ``Jitney'' is very funny
in the idiosyncrasies of its characters, it is also a poignant
evocation of the aspirations of the late 1970s that cuts across
color lines, but that happens to be told from an African-American
perspective. That it is so full of hope against so much
disappointment reflects the indomitable spirit of all Americans
whether, as one actor in the cast put it, ``black, white or
green.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the play deals with the social and economic
troubles of the time through the impending forced closing of the
car service business, which will put the drivers out of jobs. But
as with all meaningful plays, ``Jitney'' operates on deeper levels
as well. There is the theme of forgiveness in the release of
Becker's son from prison, the sense of wasted lives and compromised
dignity in the stories of the older drivers and the dreams for the
future through the stormy relationship between Youngblood and Rena.
In the end, it is a play about the meaning of love.
</P>
<P>
   Just as composers must rely on musicians to convey the emotional
force of their music, playwrights depend on actors to bring their
characters to life. And the actors in Marion McClinton's staging of
``Jitney'' are pitch-perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons to music are not idle. In a recent conversation
with the nine-member cast at the theater, more than one spoke of
their performances and the play in musical terms, as did McClinton.
If the actors are the playwright's musicians, the director is the
conductor. And in casting the play, the quality McClinton said he
looked for first was the actor's ability to make the extra effort
to be an ensemble player rather than just another virtuosic
soloist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell in auditions whether an actor is an ensemble
actor,'' McClinton said in a telephone interview from his home in
St. Louis. ``Often at an audition it's simply: `Look at me! Look at
me!' But when there's give and take between actors, you know you
have a team player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing `Jitney' is like listening to the Modern Jazz
Quartet,'' McClinton added. ``Each of the characters has his or her
solo, but they've also got to be there as backup for the others.''
</P>
<P>
   For Barry Shabaka Henley, who plays Doub, a middle-aged driver,
each performance ``is like a jam session.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You come in with your own instrument every night,'' he said,
``and you've got to be ready to jump in and play as hard as you
can. You get juiced up and feed off each other's riffs. You just
can't wait to get out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The references to soloists and sidemen are especially apt for
``Jitney.'' Each of the characters has a monologue that helps
define his or her persona. For Willis Burks II, who plays the
numbers runner Shealy, it's a hilarious story about a jinx a woman
has put on his love life; for Anthony Chisholm, who is the
alcoholic driver Fielding, it's a rueful tale about once being a
tailor for Billy Eckstein; for Paul Butler's Becker, it's an
account of his wife's death; and for Henley's Doub, it's about his
service in the Korean War, stacking dead bodies: ``Six high _ not
five, not seven. But always six high.'' It's a gripping speech,
splendidly delivered by Henley.
</P>
<P>
   B UT it is brought home to the audience with even greater force
by the attention with which Russell Hornsby, who plays Youngblood,
a Vietnam veteran himself, listens to it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first lessons in Acting 101 is that you have to
listen to the actor who is speaking (instead of, say, trying to
remember your own next line or listening for your cue or trying to
steal a scene by distracting attention from the speaker). It is a
lesson some actors learn better than others. Few do it as well as
the nine actors in ``Jitney,'' whose entire cast was cited for its
work with an Obie award.
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby listens a lot in ``Jitney.'' It is Youngblood, for
example, to whom the story of Becker's son's crime is related.
Hornsby must hear the tale eight times a week with a growing
amazement and anger that will transfer to the audience almost by
osmosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes all this work for me is the fellowship we have with
each other,'' Hornsby said. ``We're truly engaged onstage because
we're engaged in real life. I ask a question out there and listen
because I want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Burks agreed: ``It's something really quite extraordinary we
have here. It lets you go out there and hear each moment for the
first time every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Michole Briana White, who plays Youngblood's independent-minded
girlfriend, Rena, said she had been astonished at ``the amount of
professionalism in the cast'' from the first reading of the play.
``Ensemble work is not about ego,'' she said. ``It's all about
moving the story forward. Everybody puts ego aside in this group.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of having a cast that has been working
together for so long is the split-second accuracy of timing and
blocking with which the action moves. Each actor knows where the
others are going to be onstage and at what tempo each scene will
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Chicago Bulls during their championship years,''
Chisholm said. ``It's like you are dribbling down court full speed
and pass the ball behind your back without looking and you know
somebody's there to take it and dunk it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley interjected: ``That was the Harlem Globetrotters.''
Chisholm shot back: ``The Bulls did it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the metaphor is apt. In several scenes, especially one
toward the end in which an argument develops over a $10
contribution for funeral flowers, the entire cast moves with the
precision of a fast break in basketball or the intricacy of a
timing pass pattern in football.

Survivor DeGeneres takes it back on the road 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, Ellen DeGeneres tuned into an early
episode of the TV show ``Survivor,'' a program the 42-year-old
actress/comedian is convinced represents ``the end of the world as
we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   And weirdly enough, she discovered a grain of truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew that woman (Sonja Christopher) was going to get
kicked off, but I think everybody related to that because
everybody's been kicked off at some point in their life,'' says
DeGeneres. ``So you know what that's like _ to be the one voted
out, and it's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell me about it. This from the woman who took it on the chin
more than a few times once her own television sitcom decided to
move in a different direction. This from the woman who said she
went into a profound depression after ``Ellen'' was canceled, and
still had to deal with the slings and arrows of being a gay rights
activist.
</P>
<P>
   But even after being ``voted out'' more than a few times, Ellen
DeGeneres _ survivor and ``Survivor'' watcher _ isn't looking for
sympathy. She's moving forward by looking backward, getting back to
her stand-up comedy roots with a cross-country tour. For the time
being, others can carry the advocacy duties. As in days past,
DeGeneres would rather stand onstage and spin out her loopy riffs
on animals and insects.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a week-long hiatus from her tour, a seemingly relaxed
DeGeneres banters with waiters, coos at babies at nearby tables and
waxes serious and humorous between bites of a salad at the Four
Seasons hotel. A few days later, she'll be back on the bus that
will return her to the road for another month, including at the
Universal Amphitheatre on Saturday. Her final show, at the Beacon
Theatre in New York, will be taped for an HBO special to air on the
cable TV network July 23. Fittingly, the one-hour program will be
titled ``Ellen DeGeneres: the Beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road, DeGeneres and her crew are contending with bad
food, questionable lodgings and life aboard a 45-foot bus. The crew
is sending back weekly diary and picture entries via the Web site
Ellen.z.com., and DeGeneres' companion, Anne Heche, is filming the
entire tour for a behind-the-scenes documentary. Then it's back to
L.A. and back to work on a new variety show she is starring in and
producing for CBS currently titled ``The Ellen Show.'' It's
scheduled to be a mid-season replacement during the upcoming TV
season, possibly airing as early as November sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   So far, life on the road has been nothing if not eventful. The
first leg of her tour had two bad shows, one in Atlantic City (``I
don't believe in heaven and hell, but if there's a hell, it's
Atlantic City''); the second in Wallingford, Conn. (``I was in a
place that should have had wrestling'').
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what goes wrong because every night the
audience has a different personality,'' DeGeneres says. ``To stand
onstage and it's you and 3,000 people, and that's a lot of energy
coming at you and you're orchestrating it. I don't alter my act. I
don't have cheap jokes I can go to and I don't like telling the
audience that they're misbehaving or they're too rowdy. I let them
figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, her off-beat stories, observational humor and
mastery of the pregnant pause that earned her all sorts of comedy
accolades, a spot on the ``The Tonight Show'' and the ``Funniest
Person in America'' designation from Showtime in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   And according to executives at HBO, which has produced a couple
of comedy specials with DeGeneres in the past, she's still got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you've been around comedy a lot, it's hard to
appreciate how excrutiatingly difficult it is for a comic to put
together a one-hour special,'' said Carolyn Strauss, senior
vice-president of original programming for HBO. ``Ellen is one of
the few premiere comics and she has a great sense on the stand-up
stage of what works for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Followers of DeGeneres' material will recognize the musings on
animals, fear of flying and the foibles of human behavior. A staple
from her early routines, the telephone conversation with God, has
become a visit to the almighty's house because, as DeGeneres notes,
``the more famous you get, you actually get to meet ... you know
... people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the visit with God I have, it's not really a political
thing so much as a positive thing,'' says DeGeneres. ``Just how I
think we're all capable of being so much more than we are, and we
don't use everything we have, mixed in with stories about cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   What Amphitheatre audiences won't get during ``An Evening with
Ellen DeGeneres'' is gay or overtly political humor. No jabs at the
Dr. Laura Schlesingers of the world or the ABC network executives
who were responsible for the demise of ``Ellen'' a year after
DeGeneres' character, Ellen Morgan, became the first openly gay
leading character on television.
</P>
<P>
   In creating her new stand-up act, DeGeneres, who publicly came
out as a lesbian at the same time her character did, said she found
herself working through some of the personal and political issues
she had faced during the past three years. Ultimately she decided
those topics didn't belong on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I didn't want to do that. It's not who I was,'' says
DeGeneres whose blue eyes don't come across nearly so clearly on
television as they do in person. ``The more I wrote, the more it
fell into the same pattern of long rambling ridiculous stories and
weirdness. It kind of just all fell back into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had started buying into the fact that I changed just because
my television show had evolved into something else. I didn't. That
was my character, and then my character was telling a story and
that was necessary. But I am the same person and I have the same
sense of humor and the same thoughts, and I'm not going to turn my
show into a gay show just because everybody knows I'm gay now.''
That kind of transformation was, of course, a charge critics
brought against ``Ellen'' after Morgan/DeGeneres came out. Now
DeGeneres says she simply wants to become ``the Artist Formerly
Known as a Lesbian.'' To that end, DeGeneres brings up the topic
early in the evening, but only to to get it out of the way.
Politics and sexuality may come around again after the show when
DeGeneres does an informal 30-minute question and answer session
with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   During that session, DeGeneres says people are asking anything
from ``help me name my dog'' to ``do you write your own material''
to questions about the upcoming television show.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get one more `What was it like to be with Sharon Stone,'
(with whom DeGeneres co-starred in a segment of ``If These Walls
Could Talk II'' on HBO), I'm going to bring a water pistol,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Twice DeGeneres said she was ready to scrap the tour and the HBO
special because she got cold feet at the thought of failing onstage
and suffering a different type of public humiliation. A 10-minute
segment at a benefit in San Francisco and an unscheduled warm-up at
the Improv convinced DeGeneres that yes indeed, the comedy muscles
are still in working order.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she says, audiences seem generally glad to see her.
It's a ``welcome back'' tour in the truest sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do have, sometimes, is people who are a little too
fanatic, just a little too happy to see me,'' she says. ``There's
lots of `I love yous' being screamed out, and it's fine as long as
it stops when I start talking. I appreciate that, but are you here
because you love me or because you get what I'm saying?''
</P>
<P>
   During the post-performance, Q-and-A sessions, DeGeneres says
the audiences tend to get protective of her, and will boo if
somebody asks an intrusive or personal question or criticizes her.
When that happens, DeGeneres says she simply tries to keep the
peace, letting the audience know that even non-supporters have a
right to their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Rowdy audiences will probably get theirs in Heche's documentary.
DeGeneres and her crew have compiled a flock of road anecdotes,
from trying to find a gym in a fleabag hotel (``Yes, we have
several,'' the clerk said. ``Who are you looking for?'') to
DeGeneres' unsuccessful efforts to pry a kitten away from a family
because she felt the animal was too young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this rescue complex. I just feel like I need to take
care of things and then the world will be a better place,''
DeGeneres says, adding with a laugh, ``so it's all on my
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   With a tour to complete and a TV show to build, DeGeneres says
she doesn't know what the future holds. She's just living in the
moment, which could quickly change. Even a career shift isn't
entirely out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had enough money to never work again, I'd probably just
work with kids and animals and eat salads at the Four Seasons,''
says DeGeneres, ``fly in a private jet maybe to an island that I
owned, have a bunch of dancers that would dance for me whenever I
demanded and play Boggle. That's what I'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and never be voted off another island. &QL;

&HT;     CLINTON AWARDS MEDAL OF HONOR TO ASIAN-AMERICAN VETS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, declaring it time to ``break the
silence on their courage,'' bestowed the Medal of Honor on 22
Asian-American veterans on Wednesday for battlefield valor during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Seven living veterans _ including Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii _
and the families of 15 deceased veterans received the nation's
highest combat honor at a ceremony carried out in a white tent
erected on the south lawn of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 22 recipients were honored for heroism during the
legendary rescue of the ``Lost Battalion,'' a Texas National Guard
unit that was trapped, starving and slaughtered by Nazi forces in
southern France in October 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Asian-American soldiers had overcome ``painful
prejudice'' against Japanese-Americans following Japan's surprise
attack at Pearl Harbor to enlist in the nation's armed forces and
``define America at its best'' by fighting valiantly in Italy,
France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Hysteria following the Japanese attack had prompted President
Franklin D. Roosevelt to order the relocation of nearly 120,000
Japanese-Americans from their homes and farms. The U.S. citizens
were detained in stark and desolate barbed wire encampments in the
West, Clinton recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not only fighting for freedom and equality abroad, we
were also in a struggle here at home over whether America would be
defined narrowly on the basis of race or broadly on the basis of
shared values and ideals,'' Clinton said. ``Rarely has a nation
been so well served by a people it has so ill treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``It is long past time to break the silence on
their courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has now awarded 34 of the 3,452 Medals of Honor
conferred since the Civil War. Only two of the medals have been
awarded to soldiers who died during his presidency _ two Delta team
snipers who died in Somalia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 32 medals have been awarded following reviews of
combat records, including reassessments to see whether minorities
were overlooked in the awards process.
</P>
<P>
   The latest awards _ upgrades of earlier combat decorations _
stemmed from a two-year review of combat decorations received by
Asian Americans required by legislation sponsored in 1996 by Sen.
Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Akaka said he sought the review because he suspected that
``bias, discrimination and hysteria'' had robbed Asian-American
veterans of proper recognition. He took the action after an earlier
review led Clinton to award Medals of Honor to seven
African-American veterans of World War II at a White House ceremony
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 Medals of Honor bestowed Wednesday, 21 were upgrades
of the Distinguished Service Cross _ the nation's second highest
award for battlefield courage. The 22nd recipient had received the
Silver Star, the third highest award.
</P>
<P>
   The Army review that led to the upgrade of the earlier awards
found ``no evidence'' of official discrimination in the
distribution of military honors more than 55 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social and legal discrimination against Asian-Americans was
widespread in American society in the 1940s, ''conceded Army
command historian John McNaughton in his report. ``Nevertheless in
the Army awards process, we found no evidence of discrimination
against Asian-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in segregated Japanese-American unit commanded by white
officers, McNaughton found that ``white officers made sure that
their Japanese-American soldiers received full recognition for
their valor.''
</P>
<P>
   McNaughton added:.`` We found no evidence that award
recommendations were rejected or downgraded on the basis of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Military records showed that some 25,000 Japanese-Americans,
13,000 Chinese-Americans and 124,000 Filipinos living in the United
States or then-U.S. territories such as Hawaii served in the armed
forces during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the 22 recipients were members of the 442nd Regimental
Combat Team or the 100th Infantry Battalion _ segregated units of
Japanese-Americans cited by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The two Japanese-American units, operating with a ``Go for
Broke'' motto, became the most highly decorated combat units of
their size in American history, with eight presidential unit
citations, 9,486 Purple Hearts and 18,143 individual decorations
including 52 Distinguished Service Crosses, the second highest
combat award for valor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of the soldiers enlisted from the relocation
camps.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the recipients were honored for their part in the
daunting rescue of 275 GIs in the 1st battalion of the 141st
Infantry Regiment, a Texas National Guard unit that was cut off for
a week without reinforcement or resupply on a ridge dubbed
``Suicide Hill'' overlooking La Houssiere in the forest-clad slopes
of the Vosges Mountains in October 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate troops sent a coded message to regimental
headquarters warning: ``No rations, no water, no communications
with headquarters four litter cases.''
</P>
<P>
   John A. Hyman recalled in his edited history of Texas' 36th
Division that Army commanders ``threw in crack troops'' from the
442nd Regimental Combat Team, ``wiry little men who went into
battle carrying twice what they would need just in case _ tough
fighters who were fighting a war for a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese-American troops were repeatedly repulsed by more
than 700 Nazi troops surrounding the trapped American unit.
</P>
<P>
   On the sixth day, a member of the stranded unit spied a
Japanese-American GI coming toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Army Pfc. Mutt Sakumoto ``just looked at him with a lump in his
throat,'' said the unit history. ``The first thing he could think
to say was: ``Do you guys need any cigarettes?''

 NEW YORK: in football.

<P>
   Another mark of the cast's distinction is the way the actors
build their characters through small personal traits _ a slight
tremor in Chisholm's hand or the way he fumbles with the cap on a
half-pint of whiskey; how Butler uses a fedora to create Becker's
aura of respectability; the way Burks and Hornsby consult the small
notebooks in which each keeps the figures that define their success
in life. It is through such specificity that the audience comes to
know them.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the cast's closeness, Leo V. Finnie III, who plays
the doorman Philmore, said: ``About 45 minutes before the show
every night, we all get together and talk about what we've been
doing. `What was your day like?' `What's been going on?'''
</P>
<P>
   Henley added: ``I love every member of this cast. Oh, we may
argue from time to time, but it's like family arguing. Some nights
we all hold hands before we go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm, who has appeared in four of Wilson's plays, said: ``In
all of August's plays something happens that puts you in a
different kind of place. But in this one, with this cast, there is
an intangible cohesiveness you don't find in the others.''
</P>
<P>
   McClinton, the director, also spoke of the ``intangible
element'' that has evolved in this production. ``It's not something
you can direct,'' he said. ``It doesn't often happen with a cast.
And with this one it's developed over the long period of time
they've been doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the reasons behind the success of this staging of
``Jitney'' is the length of time many in the cast have been
performing it. It has long been Wilson's habit that his plays tour
the country in various regional theaters while he polishes them
with rewrites before they land in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jitney,'' which was the first play Wilson wrote in his cycle
dealing with the African-American experience in each decade of the
20th century, was originally produced in 1979 in his native
Pittsburgh. The present version, for which the author made
revisions, was first staged in 1996 for the Pittsburgh Public
Theater, and four of the nine current cast members have been with
it since its inception. But it has not been a straight path to New
York. Along the way it has played in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago,
Washington and Los Angeles, among other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen McKinley Henderson, who plays Turnbo, said that some of
the actors had made sacrifices to stay with the play. ``We wouldn't
know where it was going next,'' he said. ``The Pittsburgh
production was supposed to be it. But just as we were winding up,
somebody else said they wanted to do it. We'd do that one, and then
another theater would want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burks said that some of the actors would take other jobs in
between productions. ``I worked on a couple of movies, but I would
always be available for the next time someone wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The dedication of the actors to the play had been there from the
beginning, Butler said: ``It evolved from the very first reading.
It was like we all looked at each other and said, `We gotta go! We
gotta go!'''
</P>
<P>
   The initial enthusiasm has been infectious for those who have
joined the cast since. Carl Lumbly, who plays Becker's son,
Booster, is the newest member. ``I just feel gratitude for being
part of this group,'' he said. ``To be with a cast that is
committed to meeting and then topping the bar every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The length of time in a role can have its drawbacks. Actors can
get tired of a character and end up delivering perfunctory readings
while walking through the part. In theater it's called ``mailing in
a performance.'' This has not happened in ``Jitney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The play itself is so exciting,'' Hornsby said. ``I look
forward to doing it every night. It's an emotional thing for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson agreed that the play was the main reason. ``We've all
sort of made a mission out of this,'' he said. ``Because of August.
And also because at some point you begin to realize that you're
delivering something that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   White said another factor was that the cast keeps working on
their characters. ``After every performance, Russell and I talk
about how our scene worked that night,'' she said, referring to a
confrontation she and Hornsby have in which White delivers a
virtual manifesto on behalf of black women. ``We discuss the
performance and ask ourselves how we can improve it. Do I need to
listen more? Should I put my foot down more? You can't play the
same notes every night. That's what keeps it alive and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Every season that includes a new August Wilson play is a
reminder of the vast mine of talent among black actors in this
country that one rarely gets to see onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Have opportunities increased over recent years for black actors?
Has the movement known as nontraditional casting _ using minority
and female actors in roles written for white males _ made any
difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes in cycles,'' Henley said. ``I think there were even
more black shows in the '70s than there are now. Black actors are a
reflection of black workers in other fields. When it's convenient
for us to be seen, we'll be seen. If Hollywood sees there's no
danger of losing money on a black project, then they'll do it. When
`Waiting to Exhale' did well, everybody thought, `Finally, a black
movie made money, now we'll finally see more.' But it doesn't
happen. The trend goes back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm said he saw more opportunities for African-American
actors on television than the stage: ``Today, because there are
more television channels, there are more chances to get something
done _ a miniseries or some project like that. But as far as the
theater is concerned, the chances are few and far between.
Sometimes you have to wait for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Regional theaters, Henderson said, ``are good for this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of theater between L.A. and New York,'' he
noted. ``Actors get work because of these companies. We need more
of them so we can have ensembles. Because, you know, for actors,
there are no unimportant roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm agreed. ``I'm an actor. I can play a lizard, anything.
I've worked in `nontraditional' theater. I did `Of Mice and Men.'
Played Slim. The great Joe Fields did a Willy Loman. We as actors
want to act. But first of all, I'm an African-American. And putting
all politics aside, what we need is more producers, more writers
and, as a people, more cohesiveness. We as black people have got to
support the theater. If people all came to see `Jitney,' it would
run for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who is on the faculty of the State University of New
York, Buffalo, said: ``It depends on what you mean by
`nontraditional' and `traditional.' I've had people say to me:
`You're a good actor. You should be doing Shakespeare or Shaw.' I'm
all for black actors doing those roles. But don't tell me playing
those roles has to be the goal of my career. This is a big country
and it is all of our stories that make it great. People should
listen to all the stories. If you don't get `Joe Turner's Come and
Gone' or are uncomfortable about it, still go out and see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley said that one of the reasons ``Jitney'' is ``so special
is the thread of universality in it that makes it more accessible
to white people.'' Some of Wilson's plays ``agitate a white
audience,'' Henley said.
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm, who appeared in ``Two Trains Running,'' compared the
audiences that came to that play and those at ``Jitney.'' ``You get
a very different feeling from the audiences for `Jitney,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For White: ``This play is so moving. Although it is set in the
1970s, it still applies to women today. I can totally relate to
Rena. She was ahead of her time. For her to have the kind of
courage she does _ to say `I love myself first' _ she was taking a
big risk.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the wide appeal of ``Jitney'' is the undercurrent
of hope and forgiveness that flows through the play, often even
unstated, as when two antagonists who have a bitter running feud
resume playing checkers in the final scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This play really reflects its time for black Americans,''
Lumbly said. ``It's the '70s. Vietnam is over and we black people
thought stuff was finally going to happen for us. Our dreams were
on fire. And then nothing happened. We saw our dreams start to
wither. This was also true for black actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumbly recalled that when he and Butler made the movie ``To
Sleep With Anger,'' a 1990 black drama in which they also played
father and son, ``Somebody wrote that we were `underknown' actors.
But that implies that stardom is what I should be striving for. I
don't agree with that. As black actors, we should be concentrating
simply on becoming better artists.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. The cast members of ``Jitney'' are having
the time of their lives acting in it. ``We're all so excited about
this play,'' Burks said wistfully, ``that I sometimes wish I could
just sit in the audience and watch us.''

   The Los Angeles Lakers won the championship of America's premier
winter sport Monday night, less than 24 hours before the summer
solstice, which came at 9:48 p.m. on Tuesday. Everything else might
have been right, but the timing sure was out of joint. And so are a
lot of other things.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey, after all, barely beat basketball to its conclusion,
finishing its playoffs June 10. What can you expect from a
cold-weather sport now being played professionally in places like
Florida, Texas, and California, where ice is a curiosity? If the
calendar loses importance, why should the map make any difference?
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has a long history of being slightly off its season by
starting spring training before March 21. But the big leaguers
always go to Florida and Arizona to thaw out their arms. Reports
from those sunny places are upbeat because they give hints of
warmth to come to the north. Now, however, the season has stretched
out so long that the end of the World Series could, with a bit of
bad weather, get pretty close to November.
</P>
<P>
   By then the football season is well under way, having started
its professional season with exhibition games following training
sessions that begin in early July. Football in July? Phew. Never
mind. By the end of the season it is so cold that the Super Bowl is
played either in a covered stadium or the Sun Belt, with the
all-star bash in Hawaii in February.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium football is designed to slake the thirst of those who
yearn for the sport year-round and have to travel no farther than
the couch in front of the television set. For them, the calendar
and the notion of seasonal sports is totally out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, basketball is done for now, and winter has been fully
put to rest. It's time to think about other sports and get ready
for the next transitions. A good thing, too, because (hard though
it may be to believe), there are only four months until the
hoopsters are back in full swing, while the leaves are still on the
trees.

NO DELAY ON TRADE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is holding up a vote on the
China trade bill even though it is one of the top priorities of his
party. Business executives who support the bill ought to remind him
that congressional approval is essential for them and the country
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage was supposed to be swift after the bill's
tortuous journey through the House last month. Lott, however, wants
to move several appropriations bills through the Senate before he
allows it to consider the trade bill. He has delayed any action
until at least mid-July, when the Senate returns from the July 4
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriations bills are among the most contentious the Senate
will face this year. Many are left to the last days of the session
in September or October. The China bill should not be held hostage
to the uncertainties of the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate minority leader,
suspects that Lott wants to prolong the agony for Vice President Al
Gore and the many Senate Democrats who support the trade bill but
fear a backlash from their allies in organized labor, most of whom
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Lott waits, however, the greater the risk that the
bill will not pass, especially if the Senate adds amendments that
must be reconciled with the House version. This is perhaps the most
important bill Congress will pass this year, and it deserves to be
treated with extra care.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would affirm US support for Chinese entry into the
World Trade Organization, which will tie the world's most populous
nation into the international trading community. It would reassert
the US commitment to free trade around the world, the prerequisite
to drawing hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. And it
would offer US companies the opportunity to compete in China
without the restrictions long imposed there.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee thought so highly of the bill that
it cleared the House version unanimously without amendment early
this month. Lott needs a reminder that vital national interests
should transcend politics as usual.

   At the south edge of the Magnolia Plantation, eight simple
cabins stood in a field of clover. Generations of whitewash were
peeling from the mud-brick walls. All but one front porch had
rotted away, and there were gaping holes where doors and windows
used to be. Hidden from the main house by rows of live oaks, the
cabins had been forgotten by many and ignored by most. There was
almost nothing left _ except the stories of the slaves who once
lived in them.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog hadn't been thinking about slavery when she agreed
to go along with her rich friends' plans to turn part of her
beloved Magnolia into a national park. She had been thinking about
her family's land, and her struggle to hold onto it.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzog's ancestors settled that fertile land at the south end
of Cane River more than 200 years ago, and she had lived in the big
house at Magnolia nearly all her life. She had too little money to
keep it going, and no children to pass it on to. Sometimes when she
talked about her devotion to the land, it sounded almost like
religion. ``If you had land,'' she would say, ``you were raised
that it is very important, and that if you had it, you had to keep
it.''
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Betty Hertzog is to feel the abiding power of Old
South symbols. Slight but still sturdy at 70, Hertzog is reserved
to the point of reclusiveness, happiest walking the plantation
grounds alone. But she had come to believe that the new national
park, with its droves of tourists, offered a way to hold onto the
land _ to preserve her family's stories and teach future
generations about the agricultural practices that made Magnolia the
Goliath of Cane River when cotton was king.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby DeBlieux hadn't been thinking about slavery, either, when
he began his campaign to turn Magnolia's work buildings into a
national park. He had just been trying to rescue his town.
</P>
<P>
   He had been trying since he was mayor in the mid-1970s, and
Natchitoches (pronounced NA-kuh-tish) was drying up: farms were
dying, working families were fleeing, much of downtown was boarded
shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that history was the key to turning the whole town
around,'' said DeBlieux, 67, who owns the Tante Huppe Bed &AMP;
Breakfast on Jefferson Street. ``First people would want to come
here to visit, and if they did, they would want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBlieux _ pronounced like the letter W _ doesn't look like an
economic-development visionary. With his shock of cottony-white
hair, his shirttails hanging over sagging jeans, he generally seems
to have just rolled out of bed. But he was right. Before long, that
ugly downtown had become a National Historic Landmark, a mile-long
quarter of French Colonial buildings converted into antique shops,
restaurants and souvenir emporiums. The tourists came, and they
stayed, often in the 32 B&AMP;B's _ as people here will tell you, the
most in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when DeBlieux and his preservationist friends thought
about Natchitoches' larger possibilities, they tended to look down
Cane River to Magnolia and its sister plantation, Oakland. The old
places had gone to seed some, but with a little help and money from
the National Park Service, they could make Natchitoches the
Colonial Williamsburg of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with some deftly applied pressure from Louisiana's
senior senator at the time, J. Bennett Johnston _ Betty Hertzog's
cousin by marriage _ Congress created the Cane River Creole
National Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   As for how slavery would fit in, Betty Hertzog hoped the Park
Service wouldn't dwell on it too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people around here have put slavery behind them,''
she said. ``It is a part of the history here, and no one wants to
ignore it. But I don't want them to talk about slavery and get
stuck on that.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, though, she started to feel
uneasy about the Park Service's plans. A new ranger, a black woman
named Carla Cowles, had begun scratching around the old slave
cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery was pretty much all Cowles was thinking about when she
came to Cane River. A heavy-set woman of 40 with a booming laugh
laid over an edgy determination, Cowles (pronounced coals) had
started her career at Colonial Williamsburg. But she came away with
a very different ambition than Bobby DeBlieux's: to provide a face
and a voice to the often-ignored stories of African slaves.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, in re-enactment and song, she had shown the
violent fate of captured runaways and the pain of families torn
apart, had explained how people treated as property had held onto
humanity and hope. Magnolia's slave cabins, she thought, would be
the perfect stage for her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell the whole story,'' she said. ``Some people
might call it revisionist history, but I think what's been going on
around here is a lot of revisionist history.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories, of course, have consequences. And from the beginning,
what hardly anyone really counted on was how a new park, on a
plantation that once had 260 slaves, might stir things up in a
place where people had agreed long ago that the last thing they
wanted to talk about was race.
</P>
<P>
   When the Park Service held hearings about what kind of programs
people wanted at the park, there was a lot of enthusiasm about
restoring the old buildings. When slavery came up, there was
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking about slavery proved difficult for whites and blacks,
and promised complications for park interpretation,'' the Park
Service reported. ``Blacks and whites treated slavery as a
delicate, nearly taboo subject for public discussion.''

<P>
   We've seen the needle and the damage done, so the prospect of
another movie about the aimless wanderings of a heroine addict is
about as appetizing as a syringe jammed in the jugular. But Alison
Maclean's hauntingly beautiful ``Jesus' Son'' manages to transcend
its genre by perfectly capturing the dreamy, episodic insanity of a
junkie's life without relying on the cliches and unbelievably
quirky characters that typically populate these films.
</P>
<P>
   Much credit goes to Elizabeth Cuthrell, David Urrutia and Oren
Moverman, who somehow managed to adapt Denis Johnson's celebrated
collection of linked short stories into a compelling movie. It's a
rare film that manages to do justice to an acclaimed book, much
less one that doesn't have a direct narrative. Here, the
screenwriters have taken Johnson's fractured tales of living and,
aided greatly by Maclean and cinematographer Adam Kimmel, turned
them into lyrical images of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son'' is also blessed with a gifted cast that clearly
understands the material. Billy Crudup stars as the lovable loser,
FH, who moves through life with a bemused grin and an insightful
eye. FH's initials stand for a nickname that we can't print here,
but it's a moniker that one character tells him ``will ride him to
the grave,'' given the way trouble and failure seem to follow him
around.
</P>
<P>
   The film moves back and forth in time during a five-year period
in the early 1970s that takes the hapless FH on a number of
adventures _ some exhilarating, some meditative, many howlingly
funny. FH helps a buddy (Denis Leary) rip out the copper wiring
from his ex-wife's house so they can buy some drinks and dope. FH
takes a job as a hospital orderly (giving him close proximity to a
variety of pills) where he meets a fellow junkie, Georgie (Jack
Black of ``High Fidelity,'' again stealing every scene). Georgie
believes his calling may be medicine, which may be true given his
finesse with a hunting knife in two of the movie's most memorable
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, FH remains true in his way to his tortured,
junkie girlfriend, Michelle (Samantha Morton, the mute from Woody
Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' again superb), even as she has
difficulty coping with her addiction and FH's woeful ways. As the
movie stumbles toward its resolution, it loses a bit of its edge
but none of its charm. Dennis Hopper and a splendid Holly Hunter,
in well-written supporting roles, round out the excellent cast.
</P>
<P>
   Crudup, who has made a career of starring in underrated movies,
captures his character's pathos and compassion with a precision
that would bring Oscar buzz if this were more of a mainstream film.
As it is, ``Jesus' Son'' stands as a small gem worth a look. &QL;

Finding your inner lunatic 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of the mental health community who are getting worked up
about ``Me, Myself and Irene'' better not go anywhere near ``The
Idiots.'' Lars von Trier's film about a commune of middle-class
Danes whose members want to get in touch with their inner idiot is
about as insensitively incorrect as they possibly come.
</P>
<P>
   That such a distasteful exercise manages sharp insights into the
basic nature of ideology, support psychology, social protest and
other deep-dish matters is something of a miracle. A small one, it
must be said; this is another one of those stripped-down, Danish
Dogma 95 exercises, so there's nothing big about it. But if you can
make it through the piece's offensive, meandering first half,
rewards definitely await.
</P>
<P>
   What basically happens is that a bunch of relatively young
social dropouts squat in a large suburban home that their nominal
leader, Stoffer (Jens Albinus), is supposed to be refurbishing for
his uncle. They go out on group excursions where all but one of
them (that day's designated ``minder'') try to, as the subtitles so
delicately put it, ``spass'' as convincingly as possible among
unsuspecting citizens.
</P>
<P>
   This provides the characters and the filmmaker with many fine
opportunities for public nudity (hypocritically, only the men's
naughty parts are covered by digitized black boxes). It's also good
for getting out of restaurants without paying the bill _ which, in
fact, is the incident that introduces Karen (Bodil Jorgensen), the
newest, most delicate member, to the group. She questions, as any
decent person would, the appropriateness of mimicking conditions
that real people struggle with. Stoffer and company respond with
rationalizations about achieving purer states and happiness that
bourgeois life represses.
</P>
<P>
   And although they face prejudice from uncomprehending neighbors,
it's hard not to view this bunch as a collection of self-absorbed,
irresponsible twits. Yet von Trier, whose latest film ``Dancer in
the Dark'' recently won the Cannes Film Festival's top prize, is
after pretty interesting game here. As the movie wears on, the
emotional price of the Idiots' shenanigans becomes increasingly
evident. Attempts to build deeper relationships with pre-verbal
tools prove both difficult and rewarding, while returning to their
previous lives outside the communal womb with their behavioral
philosophy intact is an often devastating act of personal
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker incisively lampoons most forms of groupthink _
including, it must be assumed, the grungy, semi-satiric Dogma dogma
_ with a kind of hall-of-mirrors approach to that cantankerous
thing called individuality. In ``The Idiots,'' acting rationally is
oppressive, but so is acting irrationally according to some
prescribed definition, however vague and superficially freeing it
might be. ``The Idiots'' may be a movie about playing dumb, but it
is remarkably smart when it comes to how our minds work. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The film: ``The Idiots'' (R; nudity, sex, language). &QL; 
The stars: Bodil Jorgensen, Jens Albinus, Louise Hassing, Troels
Lyby, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Louise Mieritz. &QL;

 NATCHITOCHES, La.: public discussion.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE ROLE OF A LIFETIME
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog had spent weeks getting the big house ready for
the Natchitoches Fall Pilgrimage of Historic Homes, and on opening
day last October, it looked like a movie set. Sunlight cascaded
over the portrait of Magnolia's patriarch, Ambrose LeComte 2nd,
striking a dandy pose in his ascot and Colonial jacket. The
Baccarat chandelier bought years ago in New Orleans was up in the
grand foyer once again. The air was suffused with the history of
Hertzog's ancestors _ it hung from every wall, filled every shelf _
and she wondered if she was doing her family proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy wouldn't have liked these tours, because he didn't like
strangers roaming through his house,'' she said. ``But you can't
make a living from farming anymore. The tourists help pay to keep
up this old place.''
</P>
<P>
   As an only child, she had always known she would someday take
over Magnolia. But she had expected to live a little of her own
life first. She was just out of college and heading to Houston to
look for work when the call came. Her father had suffered a heart
attack. Someone had to manage the harvest. ``It was panic, pure
panic,'` she said. ``I really wasn't sure I could manage it the way
Daddy did, but I had to try, or else we might lose it all.''
</P>
<P>
   So at 23, she traded her big-city dreams for a job at a local
bank, and began her turn as caretaker of the land. No one asked her
to stay. No one had to. Magnolia was simply not going to go the way
of the other Cane River plantations, into strangers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been more than 10 years since Hertzog oversaw a
harvest. In the late 1980s, when the bottom fell out of cotton, she
rented her fields to corporate growers. Soon, she began the house
tours. And then, in the early '90s, her rich preservationist
friends began talking about turning Magnolia's work buildings _ the
slave cabins and hospital, the blacksmith shop and cotton gin _
into a national park.
</P>
<P>
   On opening day of the fall festival, though, she talked about
Magnolia's good times, not her own struggle. Dressed in a pink
satin Civil War-era gown, she showed tourists the wooden clock
rescued from the original big house, burned down by Union troops;
the 1851 trophy won by the family's prize racer, an auburn
thoroughbred named Flying Dutchman; and the chapel fashioned from
an old workroom at the back of the manor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 700 tourists, all but 10 or so were white. One black
visitor, 55-year-old Sam Dugar, had come looking for his own
history. Dugar's father and grandfather had been sharecroppers at
Magnolia, but till now he had avoided the place. As the tour ended,
he said he felt cheated.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I kept thinking was that they accumulated all this wealth
because of the blacks who worked here,'' he said. ``But there was
nothing on the tour about black people. It's as if their place in
history was erased.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog insists she is not trying to erase history. ``We
are showing this house,'' she explained. ``I try to talk about
what's here, and the history that I am aware of. The slaves didn't
have a lot of records, and so you don't know who was here and where
they all were on the place.'' If visitors are interested, she tells
them the slave cabins are out there, on the Park Service's portion
of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she says, talk of slavery can offend. Her cousin
Ambrose recalled a black visitor who demanded back her $5 admission
after learning that the house was still owned by the original
slave-holding family. ``She was yelling so loud, I could hear her
from my house,'' said Hertzog, who lives next door. ``I was
wondering, what does that woman know about Betty? The days of
owning slaves was long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Hertzog says, it was not right for humans to be held
as property. But she feels no shame. ``The government has given
them every opportunity in the world,'' she said, ``so stop
complaining about the past and go out and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a low opinion of the idea, embraced by some black
intellectuals and politicians, of reparations for slaves'
descendants. ``I think they should be grateful they got their
freedom back then,'' she said. ``I think they ought to be glad they
are Americans, living in a free country. The more of that stuff
that gets stirred up, the more hate there will be on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   From the little she has learned, she says, her family did not
mistreat its slaves. A Northwestern State University historian has
found no evidence of abuse or neglect, though a set of ankle stocks
was evidence of punishment. A Park Service archaeologist also told
her that the two-family brick cabins were larger and more
comfortable than the log dwellings on other plantations. And
inventories show that Magnolia's slaves had more balanced diets
than others in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling among the cabins one evening, Hertzog said that in her
mind, slavery looked a lot like the lives of the sharecroppers _
slaves' descendants she remembered from childhood, who worked the
land for part of the crop. To this day, that is the only way she
has known blacks. Even after the last families left the cabins in
1968, she continued to employ a few black workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way things have always been,'' she said.
``Each group had different networks, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Some black old-timers, she says, have told her that their years
at Magnolia were the best of their lives. While segregation
governed life in town, she says, on Magnolia blacks and whites
raced horses together and played on the plantation baseball team,
the Black Magnolias. She knew that black children would not have
the same opportunities as whites. ``But for them,'' she said,
``that's the way life was and they accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Magnolia's slaves, she knew some of their stories would
be told at the new park. But she wanted those stories to reflect
her family's hardships and kindnesses as well. Which was why she
was getting so worried about the Park Service's plan
</P>
<P>
   Hertzog almost never talked directly about Carla Cowles. And for
more than a year after Cowles arrived, Hertzog never met with her.
``I guess I have just been too busy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she complained a lot about the Park Service, and said she
had heard Cowles and her boss were giving tours and talking about
slaves who had never even lived on Cane River. She had been led to
believe the park would be devoted to agriculture, she said, but
increasingly it seemed the emphasis would be on slavery, on
portrayals bound to vilify her family. She felt betrayed.

Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Carrey and the Farrelly brothers achieve something like
perfect baroque crudity with ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' their latest
comedy about all things that the human body can drip, ooze or
secrete.
</P>
<P>
   Moreso than in the comparatively restrained ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber,''
the zany comic dynamo and the writing-directing siblings prove that
their sickest sensiblities were made for one another. In
``Irene,''In ``Irene,'' they have crafted a densely packed circus
of scattershot insults, dirty jokes and bruising slapstick that is
often infernally hilarious _ and, yes, well out in front,
imagination- and daring-wise, of most competitors in the offensive
comedy sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   But even though it's a pleasure to report that Carrey's return
to full- throttled wackiness is among his best performances ever,
``Irene'' falls short of the giddy heights the Farrellys hit in
their last directing effort, ``There's Something About Mary.'' That
film did the impossible _ or at least, so far, unrepeatable _ for
this subgenre. It actually populated its outlandish gagscapes with
people you really believed could exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irene'' is not designed to pull off anything that difficult.
It's more purely a farce, with a knockabout road movie structure
that lends itself more to incident than character development. And
with Carrey playing two outsized caricatures in this one, there
ain't much room _ nor need _ for subtle behavioral niceties.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Carrey fits some remarkably understated effects in
the margins of all the foaming lunacy. As you're probably aware, he
plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality
disorder. The cop's usual persona, kind but wimpy Charlie
Baileygates, keeps losing control to a vengeful Id monster that
calls himself Hank, hisses like Clint Eastwood at his most
intimdating and gets into all kinds of psychic and physical
trouble. Hank's nasty jags are vintage, inspired Carrey, but some
of the actor's Jekyll-to-Hyde transitions, as well as a scene or
two when he's operating through several layers of deception, have a
quiet canniness that's as complex and accomplished as anything he's
ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Hank and Charlie both fall in love with Renee Zellweger's Irene,
whom the entity escorts to answer an outstanding warrant in upstate
New York. The film's nonplot, which the Farrellys co-wrote with
childhood pal Mike Cerrone, has something to do with crooked cops
and land developers. But it's really just an excuse for Carrey and
the Farrellys to pull outrageous stunts against deceptively bucolic
backdrops.
</P>
<P>
   Terrible things are done to a cow, a chicken, a new mother,
innocent members of the law enforcement industry, young children
and a resilient albino fellow named, tastefully, Whitey (played by
droll newcomer Michael Bowman). Everybody is made merciless fun of,
including the game Zellweger's hard-pressed straightwoman, but no
one is mortified more frequently or severely than Carrey's
characters. Taking the sadomasochistic element that's always been
part of his comedy to the limit, Carrey violates and subjects
himself to every conceivable humiliation _ and a few most of us
mere mortals have thankfully never thought of.
</P>
<P>
   I keep coming back to Carrey's performance because it is that
unforgettably extreme. But even with all the effort he puts in, he
almost loses the film's comedy spotlight to three latter day
Stooges. Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee and Jerod Mixon play _
are you ready for this? _ the three genius triplets Charlie's
runaway wife had with an African- American dwarf, whom he's
selflessly raised as his own. Somehow, though, the three hefty sons
talk trashier than Tupac; you've never heard atomic theory debated
quite the way they do.
</P>
<P>
   It's all utterly inexcusable. And uproarious. These guys have
such exuberant energy and fluid group timing that their foulmouthed
antics rise to the level of verbal ballet. Of course, it's also
disgusting, demented and evidence, if you want it to be, that civil
society is greatly endangered if not already dead and buried.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what all of ``Me, Myself and Irene'' is like. You can
hold your nose or laugh about it . . . but really, there's only one
viable option.
</P>

 NATCHITOCHES, La.: a bit.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AN OUTLET FOR THE ANGER
</P>
<P>
   ``When we learn about history, we are often told about kinder,
gentler times,'' Carla Cowles was telling a tour group at the
cabins. (Though the park won't open officially for a year or two,
she has begun giving tours of the work buildings and cabins.) ``We
are taught to think about the lives of the rich and glamorous, not
about the common, everyday people _ people like you and you and
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many children do you have, sir?'' she went on, turning to
a man in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He held up two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lived here, with your two kids, would work be all that
you did in your life?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I would have to take care of my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the people who lived here couldn't even do that. Their
children could be taken from them at any time and sold away.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of simple exchange that Cowles uses to pull her
audience into the lives of the mothers and fathers, cooks and
carpenters who lived in bondage. The history of slavery is so
painful and mind-bending, she says, that teaching anything
meaningful in an hour seems impossible. So she makes it personal,
makes the tourists become slaves, if only for one mental moment.
</P>
<P>
   It was just such a moment that set her on the road to Cane
River. In 1989, with a 16th-century literature degree from the
University of Virginia and yet another dead-end job, she answered
an ad for a job at Colonial Williamsburg: ``Talk about black
history and get paid,'' it said. It sounded promising _ except for
having to portray slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Williamsburg, the daughter of a millworker and a
teacher's aide, she had revered America's civil rights leaders. She
had watched her mother, who never graduated from junior high, fight
to get her children into Advanced Placement classes. And in
college, which she remembers as ``a sea of whites,'' Cowles
organized sit-ins to demand more minority professors.
</P>
<P>
   She saw no spirit of rebellion in slavery. ``I was like a lot of
people who think slaves were weak, and I didn't want to portray
weakness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her bosses at Colonial Williamsburg persuaded her to try. She
started off in secondary roles, singing songs that showed ``the
lighter side of slavery.'' Later, in a burlap costume, she
portrayed a slave named Secundia, who had just learned that her
mother had died on another plantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was singing to my dead mother,'' she recalled, ``saying how
we were so busy working in the fields that I never had time to tell
her I loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience, she says, was transforming. Suddenly, the slaves
she had studied in documents came to life and had her face. Their
history became her cause. And her portrayal of Secundia got her a
job at the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis,
organizing programs about the Dred Scott Decision, which barred
slaves and their descendants from citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Cowles was assigned to develop the Cane River
historical and community outreach programs. She imagines the old
cabins as a ``living, breathing slave community,'' complete with
people in costume portraying slaves.
</P>
<P>
   She expected some resistance. She had read the reports from all
the public hearings. Early on, she turned to Frankie Ray Jackson, a
black former school-board member, for help in navigating people's
sensitivities. As for Bobby DeBlieux and his friends, she had
little to do with them; at one meeting she did attend, she asked
why she was the only black person there. And she never knocked on
Betty Hertzog's door. She just hadn't had the time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Cowles doesn't often deal with whites in
Natchitoches. She speaks warmly of her boss, Laura Soulierre, who
has encouraged her pursuit of slave history. She gets along well
with the park volunteers, most of whom are white. And she deals
comfortably with white tourists, putting them at ease when they
make clumsy comments about slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't heal old wounds until we look at the way life was and
all its problems,'' she often says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the healing power of history, it has increasingly
channeled her racial anger. When she talks about that anger, she
casts back in her mind _ to the St. Louis landlord who at first
refused her an apartment because she was black; to the man who
called her a ``pickaninny'' as she guided him through Colonial
Williamsburg in her slave costume; to the grade-school teacher who
tried to fail her for refusing to pick a hero from a list of white
American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Today, away from work, she leads an essentially black life. She
dates a black man who calls himself a separatist. And though she
says she doesn't share those views, she has had only two white
friends. She tries not to wallow in anger, but the more she learns
about slavery, the more she regards the old plantation elite with
suspicion and reproach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost impossible, living as a black person in America,
and as a person who has studied so much about slavery, not to be
angry about the injustices done to black people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She avoids talking directly about Betty Hertzog, just as Hertzog
will not talk directly about her. She speaks of no one in
particular when expressing resentment at the ``furniture and
antiques'' tours popular around town. And while she is offended at
the wealth that plantation owners accumulated on the backs of
slaves, she is disturbed more, she says, by whites who ignore the
less noble truths of their families' pasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to say, `I'm sorry,''' she said. ``But if you
remain silent about it, then you have blood on your hands, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A SOCIAL CONTRACT OF SILENCE
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, for the first time, a black man ran for mayor of
Natchitoches. He was a vice president at the local university and a
six-term councilman. Many whites quietly talked of supporting him;
polls predicted record black turnout. Then the candidate, John
Winston, started talking about race, with the slogan, ``Let's make
history! Let's elect the first black mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't go over too well. White callers to the ``Talk Back
Natchitoches'' radio show worried that Winston would not serve all
equally. Some criticized him for making race an issue. White
support faded.

`NEW AMERICA,' BAD RELIGION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Local punkers Bad Religion are like that proverbial
post-apocalyptic cockroach _ they can withstand anything.
</P>
<P>
   The quintet, formed in the Valley 20 years ago, has survived
self- destructive pathology, creative battles, the defection of
founding singer- guitarist Brett Gurewitz, a much-criticized move
to Atlantic Records from indie Epitaph and the splintering of the
group's members to new homes across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bad Religion plugs on, sticking to its punk origins,
playing to packed houses of fans new and old while recording fresh
music every few years. The band's fifth and latest effort for
Atlantic, ``The New America,'' found Bad Religion teamed in Hawaii
with producer Todd Rundgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd was an underground sensation back in 1974,'' says Bad
Religion singer Greg Graffin. ``Here's a guy who was making pop
music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. He made me
sensitive to the concepts of popularity and underground ideology _
the idea that you can make popular music and yet not exploit it to
the extent that everyone has heard of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad Religion _ Greg Hetson (guitar), Brian Baker (guitar), Jay
Bentley (bass), Bobby Schayer (drums) and Graffin _ appears in a
matinee show Sunday at the Universal Amphitheatre, opening for
pop-punk trio Blink-182 (``Adam's Song'').
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, no band members are based in Los Angeles any longer.
Graffin lives in Ithaca, N.Y., where he taught laboratory courses
in zoology at Cornell University; Hetson lives in Texas; Baker is
in Washington, D.C.; Schayer lives in Seattle; and Bentley is based
in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have studios in our houses so we have the technology to
share music,'' Graffin, 35, explained. ``And we've never been a
tight unit, anyway. But there are factions within the band that get
together sometimes and do things away from the band. It's really
like family. We grew up together. We don't have to rehearse because
practice is something you do on your own anyway. You're expected to
stay in shape on the off season.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their music, the quintet sponsors its own Bad
Religion Research Fund scholarship program for budding geniuses in
the cultural or natural science fields. The program was launched in
1998 by Graffin, who holds a degree in evolutionary biology from
UCLA and is working towards his PhD. at Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pride in being able to support someone's research
endeavors,'' he said. ``The real reward for the whole band is our
being a part of higher education while perpetuating the idea that
Bad Religion has always stood for _ to question the prevailing
dogma. It's something you can do in science, the humanities and in
entertainment as well.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``The New America,'' Bad Religion adds fuel to the fierce,
inquisitive spirit and penchant for provocative examination that
took root with their founding in 1980 and continued to bloom with
such influential albums as ``How Could Hell Be Any Worse'' (1982),
``Suffer'' (1987), ``No Control'' (1989) and ``Against the Grain''
(1990).
</P>
<P>
   Through a dozen albums, Bad Religion has maintained a hard-edged
attack and righteously angry lyrics while refining its sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many bands are afraid to change,'' Graffin said. ``They're
afraid to step forward because they're in a comfortable spot with
their audience and they don't want to mess up a good thing by
offering them a challenge. Bad Religion and punk have always been
about challenge and if we can't do that on the new record, what
good are we anyways?''
</P>
<P>
   The new disc features Epitaph label founder Gurewitz's first
contributions to a Bad Religion album since 1994's gold-certified
``Stranger Than Fiction,'' the band's Atlantic debut. Graffin
hooked up with the band's former guitarist to co-write the telling
``Believe It,'' which also includes a guitar solo from the founding
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the song sounds like a long-lost friend _ there's an
almost indescribable familiarity,'' Graffin said. ``It's silly to
deny there's something special between us. We're connected and
always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album's reflective mood resulted from discussions
between Graffin and Rundgren, which took place even before many of
the songs were written. Previously, the band worked with such name
producers as Andy Wallace (Nirvana) and Rick Ocasek (the Cars).
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd is more philosophical,'' Graffin offered. ``When it comes
down to it, one of the most important things to have is some
internally consistent logic as to why you're making a record. That
was, from the get-go, Todd's most important role in this _ to
figure out how the songs should be put together on the album to
tell an accurate story of where our heads are at. And if you're
commenting on a social situation, how the material relates to
what's happening now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great education for me. It taught me so much about
the reason to make records and why certain records are great and
others fail.''

 NATCHITOCHES, La.: support faded.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end Winston lost, by 63 votes, to a white
anesthesiologist named Wayne McCullen. More than 95 percent of
Winston's supporters were black; more than 95 percent of McCullen's
were white. Both men agreed there had been a backlash over the race
issue, and Winston has had second thoughts about his slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to race, the truth gets twisted to mean a lot of
different things,' he said. ``And so most people just prefer not to
talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Public discussion of race is never easy, anywhere. But in this
town of 17,000 in central Louisiana, not talking about race is at
the heart of a social contract, rooted in the slave-owning past,
that governs all sorts of black-white relationships _ or
nonrelationships. Whatever the inner tensions, Natchitoches has
tended to get along.
</P>
<P>
   Black and white Natchitoches are separate worlds of roughly
equal size. (The black half generally includes the mixed-race
Creoles, though socially and politically they float in between.)
Whites live east of Fifth Street, blacks west. Natchitoches Junior
High is mostly black; the junior high at St. Mary's Catholic School
is mostly white. On Sundays, blacks fill the all-you-can-eat buffet
near the Wal-Mart; whites crowd restaurants on the historic
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are a handful of influential blacks, economic and
political power rests in white hands. Indeed, even if Winston had
won, he would have had less power than the three well-endowed, and
virtually all-white, private committees that turned Natchitoches
into a tourist town. Whites own all the new businesses in the
landmark district. In this place where so much revolves around
history, the history it tends to revolve around is white Colonial
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, blacks think this historic district is white
elite,'' Bobby DeBlieux said. ``Well it is. But it's not because we
designed it that way. It's sad, but black people here segregate
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks do not dispute those facts. They just give them a
different spin. ``It's true that blacks have not gotten involved in
the historic things,'' said Clifford Blake, who owns a po' boy
shop. ``I had a chance to open up a place on the waterfront, but I
didn't do it because it seemed like it was too white-dominated, and
I didn't believe they really wanted blacks involved.''
</P>
<P>
   To local preservationists, the racial climate reflects
Natchitoches' history as a ``cultural island'' in the South. From
its founding by French traders in 1714, they maintain, its
colonists were more accepting of other races than the British were,
and generally kinder to slaves. Natchitoches, they say, is the best
place to tell ``a side to slavery most people have never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People here have always gotten along and respected one
another,'' DeBlieux said, adding, ``Maybe there's no social
closeness now, but there's no tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even through the turmoil of the civil rights movement,
Natchitoches was calm; there were no protests, and a single brief
boycott. But silence, Winston and other blacks say, has been less a
matter of contentment than ingrained reticence. They recall the one
time Natchitoches did come close to open confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1927, a white plantation owner had given the city a
bronze statue of a slave tipping his hat and bowing his head in
greeting. A plaque said the statue had been erected ``in grateful
recognition of the arduous and faithful service of the good darkies
of Louisiana,'' and whites saw it as a symbol of their enlightened
view of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years the Good Darkey stood on Front Street. But in 1968,
as civil rights protests gripped the South, young blacks vowed to
bomb it, calling it an abominable symbol of servitude. In the end,
after a meeting with the mayor, blacks stood down and the Good
Darkey went gently, removed by officials late one September night.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of victory among blacks, and integration came
peacefully. But that progress, many blacks say, has gone only so
far. They remain in their separate world, profoundly wary of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Across Cane River from the new park is St. Paul Missionary
Baptist Church, organized 133 years ago by freed slaves. Even
today, says the pastor, the Rev. Leo Walker, many in his
congregation are struggling to overcome generations of distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them harbor deep anger about things that happened to
them or their ancestors in the past,'' he said, ``and they honestly
believe that no whites can go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   A SON OF `THE QUARTERS'
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Vercher winced whenever he heard people call Magnolia's
brick cabins ``slave quarters.'' They had once been his home.
</P>
<P>
   His father was born and raised in the cabins, and his family
didn't move off Magnolia until the late 1960s. Those people were
not slaves, he pointed out. They were the Hertzogs' employees, and
they called their homes ``the quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed to think about any ancestors who lived there as
slaves, this fireplug of a man looked as if he might become
physically ill. He refused to watch movies like ``Roots'' or
``Amistad,'' and rejected the term ``African-American'' because he
had never known any relatives from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly some black people on Cane River were interested in
seeing slave stories, however painful, resurrected at the new park.
But Vercher saw slavery only as a shameful part of the past, and
tried to wipe it from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear about my people being beaten and raped,''
he said, with his Cajun twang and willful scowl. ``Let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a twist of fate _ he sometimes saw it as a divine trick
played by his late father _ Vercher, 35, was now working for the
Park Service, restoring the cabins. For a black man, especially one
with a ninth-grade education, it was one of the best jobs on Cane
River, with decent pay and benefits for his common-law wife and two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ellis, had been happy that the cabins were going to
become part of a new national park. The son was still coming to
terms with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Vercher was one of Betty Hertzog's father's chief hands,
and the family _ there were 12 children _ lived in the cabin at the
end, the one with the porch still on the front. Ellis Vercher was
always proud to say he was reared on a plantation, as if it gave
more meaning to the five-bedroom house he built when the family
moved away. And he tried to instill that feeling in his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind being out here,'' Leslie Vercher said, ``because
I feel my daddy when I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought life was like for slaves, he frowned and
said, ``Hell, what you think?'' But then he thought again about his
father. There were indeed hard times, when they would work all
season and not make a cent. But there were also good times _
cookouts, horse races and dances at the company store _ and good
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a marble the other day and it felt funny in my hand,''
Vercher said. ``I thought to myself, `I bet my daddy played with
this marble.'''

   BRINGING UP SLAVERY
</P>
<P>
   A wintry chill hung over Cane River the November evening Carla
Cowles brought slavery back to Magnolia Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   For the opening of an exhibit called ``Free at Last,'' Cowles
had invited two black historical interpreters from Arkansas to
perform skits showing slave life through fables and song. ``We are
going to be talking about things that are uncomfortable,'' she told
the audience gathered at the cabins. ``We are going to show you how
people endured the institution called slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Discomfort had been swirling through town ever since a notice
appeared in The Natchitoches Times the week before. Cowles had
enlisted her boss to deliver Betty Hertzog's invitation _ ``I have
had very little contact with Miss Betty,'' she explained _ and
Hertzog seemed leery about the whole thing. ``You can never tell,''
she said. ``It might just be a bunch of stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Vercher was also worrying about stereotypes. ``It's easy
for Carla to talk about slavery because she don't come from here,''
he said. ``I don't think it would be so easy for her to tell those
stories if she was talking about her own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowles had invited all 15 schools in the area. But while
teachers at three schools accepted, the rest did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   She shrugged it off at first. With such short notice, there
probably hadn't been time to arrange transportation. Then she heard
that Samuel Jackson, a black man who is principal of Natchitoches
Junior High, was worried the performance might ignite racial
tensions. She went to see him, to explain that everything would be
handled with great sensitivity. But he stood firm.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he had worked hard to keep the peace at his school,
where more than 70 percent of the students are black and almost all
the whites are bused in by court order. Just a few weeks earlier,
he said, a white student had shown up wearing a T-shirt with a
drawing of Ku Klux Klansmen and the words, ``We were the original
Boys in the Hood.'' A black student had come to school upset that a
local white fraternity was planning a mock slave auction. Exposing
students to slave re-enactments, Jackson said, would be like
throwing a match into gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid you would have white students making fun of the
way black people talked, and then blacks might respond in a
combative way,'' he said. ``It could fester into a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, about 70 people _ black and white _ showed up that
evening. Leslie Vercher, anxieties and all, stood in back, pacing
and puffing hard on a cigarette. Betty Hertzog came, too. If the
story of slavery was going to be told, she said, she was going to
make sure it was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The two performers, Curtis Tate and Daryl Minefee, leapt into
the spotlight. They wore tattered pants, bright shirts and oversize
shoes. Their stage was a bench. Tate stood on top, joking like a
country bumpkin. Minefee, wearing that same foolish grin, sat
playing an African drum.
</P>
<P>
   First, Tate told several fables set in Africa. Then he
transported the audience to America, and told a story about a slave
beaten by an overseer for bringing her baby along to the cotton
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overseer was full of the master's whiskey,'' Tate growled,
flailing one arm as if cracking a whip, ``and when he saw that baby
he started whippin' that girl, and whippin' that girl until she and
the baby started to bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of returning to the fields, the woman ran to a wise
elder who began chanting an African incantation, and all the slaves
flew happily away.
</P>
<P>
   For the finale, Tate portrayed a slave named Luther and his
master, James McVicar. Luther had learned to read and write, but
kept it secret for fear of punishment. The year was 1849, and one
day he blurted out something from the morning paper about a gold
rush in California.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbed McVicar forced a Bible into Luther's hands and
ordered him to read his favorite passage.
</P>
<P>
   Luther trembled and said: ``Naw suh, Massa McVicar. I can't
read.''
</P>
<P>
   McVicar insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Luther opened the Bible and read in a quavering voice, ``Moses
said unto Pharaoh, `Let my people go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The audience held its breath as Luther slumped over in fear.
</P>
<P>
   Then McVicar grinned and jumped with excitement. ``I'll be
darned, Luther, you can read! Can you write, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Luther, paralyzed by confusion, forced his head to nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' his master shouted. ``You can help me keep my
books; you can help me with my ledgers.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, the audience seemed as stunned as Luther. But soon
people were laughing and applauding in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog joined the standing ovation, then headed home,
elated. ``I liked it,'' she said. ``I thought they did a real
professional job. It was especially good for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and teachers from Simpson Junior High, a white group
who had seen the show earlier that day, said they had learned
important lessons about blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us understand what they had to go through,'' said
Jenna White, 13. ``It opens our eyes and makes us respect them
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Vercher, though, was pacing and dragging harder on his
cigarette. With their silly grins and floppy hats, he said, the
actors had given no dignity to the memory of slaves. It was as if
the Good Darkey statue had come to life, not the strong, resilient
people who were his ancestors. Slaves could not fly from the
fields, he said, and if a master learned that a slave could read,
he would reach for a rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of historians are they,'' he asked, ``if they make
up things instead of telling it like it was?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO WATER THINGS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Carla Cowles was not stunned at all by the show. It went exactly
as she had planned.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, she had called Tate with a warning about the
anxieties around Cane River. She told him that blacks had been
feeling uncomfortable about slave re-enactments, and that Principal
Jackson was concerned. She also told him that the direct
descendants of Magnolia's original family would be in the audience,
along with some of the town's powerful preservationists. She went
over the details of Tate's stories, and did not ask him to change
the content in any way. But be sure, she cautioned him, that none
of the stories appear to reflect the lives of Cane River slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot that went unsaid,'' Tate recalled. ``But I got
the clear impression that she was feeling pressure.''

 NATCHITOCHES, La.: feeling pressure.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the morning performance, over lunch at Lasyone's, a local
meat-pie diner, they discussed the surprise ending to the Luther
story. It did not, they acknowledged, reflect the reality of life
for most slaves, who were beaten or separated from their families
for seeking education.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was not a complete lie. The truth is that there is
no one truth to slavery. It was different from state to state,
plantation to plantation. Tate had documents about a slave whose
masters had taught him to read and write, and others about a slave
beaten by whites when discovered reading a newspaper. In using that
first slave as raw material for the Luther story, Tate said, he was
concerned more with whites like Hertzog than blacks like Vercher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the ones who can't handle the truth,'' Tate said,
crouching over his plate and lowering his voice. ``Isn't it the
same for all black people, that we have to be careful to make white
people comfortable?''
</P>
<P>
   As they struggled to reconcile the Luther story with their
strident commitment to teaching what they saw as the holocaust of
slavery, it became clear that more pragmatic issues were at play,
too. At historical sites across the country, a new generation of
interpreters had begun to pull stories of slavery from the dust of
history. And often, as Cowles and Tate kept hearing, they ran into
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to economics,'' Tate said. ``Whites still
control most museums and historical parks. Unless black people
start putting more money into these places, then we will never
really be able to have control.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowles added, ``If you make them uncomfortable, they'll shut you
down.''
</P>
<P>
   She had seen that kind of power right here in Natchitoches. Just
weeks before, another Park Service official had come under attack
from local preservationists. The official, John Robbins, headed up
a prestigious federally financed center that develops and teaches
preservation technologies. Robbins had supported a congressional
proposal that would have allowed the center to be moved. But after
a few well-placed calls to Washington, the bill was killed, and
Robbins was transferred to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people around here may come from the country,'' Cowles
said, ``but they are very smart and well connected, and if you
cross them you're out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the performance, Cowles stood in the doorway of
a cabin and reflected on all that had happened. ``I did not want to
make the message too hard the first time,'' she said, ``especially
with me being an outsider and a black woman.''
</P>
<P>
   So she began to settle in for the long haul. Early in the year,
she turned down an assignment on the East Coast and began looking
for land where she could build a house. It might take years, she
realized, for the truth of slavery to be told on Cane River.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they felt good after that performance, they'll come to the
next one and the next one,'' she said. ``And I'll be able to
present something a little bit stronger each time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby DeBlieux says he understands that slavery will be one of
the park's main themes, and he thinks that, too, will ultimately be
good for business. There is an untapped well of black tourists out
there, he says, who might spend money on a plantation tour that
incorporates slave history.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the big house, Betty Hertzog sounds as if she is ready
to move on. The 27-room house has become more showplace than home.
Almost all her personal belongings are crammed into two bedrooms;
the rest of the house stays dark unless tourists come by. Her
relatives don't come too often, either, and so her most consistent
companions are her two dozen cats.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the performance, she decided she was not going to
worry about the new national park any more. She asked Sen.
Johnston's daughter, Mary Catalo, to look out for the family's
interests, and in April, Catalo met with Carla Cowles and offered
herself as the family liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Catalo, who is 37 and sells real estate in New Orleans, is from
the ninth generation of the family that built Magnolia, and her
feelings about how its history should be portrayed seem to mark a
clear shift from those of the woman she calls Aunt Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a comfortable thing for me to come out and say that
my relatives owned slaves,'' she said, ``but it is important that
we all openly acknowledge where we came from so we can start to
work through the problems that were created in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism is a difficult thing to deal with because it runs so
deep. To me this park offers a chance to at least help start a
dialogue that doesn't exist right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Betty Hertzog built herself a house near the river,
thinking she would move there after her parents died. What with the
responsibilities of holding onto Magnolia, she has yet to spend a
night there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I got ready to move, something else would happen
and I needed to stay,'' she said. ``But maybe the time has finally
come. Used to be that it was hard to leave this old place. But now
it's harder and harder to stay.''

<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ The accused killer has a toy fire truck in
his closet. A sixth-grade photograph, signed ``To Grandma'' but
never mailed, rests on a desk beside a certificate that reads
``Most Improved in Spanish'' and algebra homework done in No. 2
pencil. He has mastered polynomials, the homework shows, but he
signed the paper ``Nate Wuz Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Brazill, 13, left his room that way on May 26, the
last day of classes before summer vacation at Lake Worth Middle
School, the day he took a stolen gun to school and pointed it at
the face of his English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County prosecutors say he shot Barry Grunow to death
because the teacher would not let him into a classroom to say
goodbye to two girls. They charged the honors student and tuba
player as an adult with first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   In his room in a stark triplex on H Street, his mother, Polly
Powell, wondered how anyone could call him an adult when it seems
like only yesterday that her son, whom everyone calls Nate, was
playing in the dirt with a yellow Tonka truck.
</P>
<P>
   But while a mother's love is expected to be blind, others in
this Lake Worth neighborhood ask the same thing, how a seemingly
good and promising boy, who was never in trouble, could do this. It
happened, his mother says, because he is still a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a man,'' she said. ``He doesn't shave. He can't
drive a car, or go into the service. He can't buy cigarettes or
beer, or a lottery ticket. He's a child,'' she said, and like any
other he is impulsive, eager to impress friends, ignorant of the
long-term consequences of the things he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my boy back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nate, the carrier of his mother's dream that he would break
loose from her neighborhood of tiny houses and rumbling freight
trains, is charged with a slaying that demands harsh punishment at
an age that would seem to beg for some leniency, but in a state
where there is no middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged as an adult, which carries a maximum penalty of
life in prison, rather than as a juvenile, which might have ended
in his being remanded to a juvenile detention center for a few
years. Whether such a charge is appropriate is the same question
being asked in other states as a nightmare epidemic of school
shootings spread across the country, as courts decide how to punish
killers too young to see an R-rated movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the policy in this office,'' and in this state, for
youths charged in such violent felonies, said Michael Edmondson,
executive assistant to Barry Krischer, the Palm Beach County state
attorney. ``There is no selective application of that policy. That
way you don't discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a grand jury in Palm Beach County took barely 15
minutes to indict Nate on a charge of first-degree murder. He is
being held in a special ward reserved for teen-agers in the county
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he did wrong, I know he should be punished,'' said
Nate's mother, who believes the whole thing was an accident, that
the gun just went off. ``But punish him as a juvenile. If any
parent tells you different, what they'd do if it was them, they're
telling a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has caused some Florida lawmakers to consider
legislation to create some middle ground. For now, defendants like
Nate can only be sentenced to hard time in a state prison for
adults, perhaps for the rest of their lives. But some lawmakers are
considering legislation that would allow judges to take age into
consideration, perhaps allowing younger offenders to serve time in
a juvenile center and then in a state prison _ rather than locking
them away in a state prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some choice in the middle,'' said Ron Klein, a
state senator from Boca Raton, who is drafting a bill that would
allow the courts to consider all aspects of the case, including an
offender's potential for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow's family has been quiet since the killing, saying only,
in a statement, that they trust in the law.
</P>
<P>
   Nate's lawyers must convince a judge and jury that he did not
mean to kill the respected 35-year-old teacher, who left a wife, a
5-year-old son and infant daughter. Nate's best defense seems to be
his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been representing jerks for 20 years,'' said Bob Udell, a
lawyer from nearby Stuart who is representing Nate. ``They were bad
people and they'd cut your throat in a second. This isn't that.
This is payback for 20 years of jerks. This is a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, as teachers at Lake Worth Middle School selected
students for offices for the coming year, they selected Nate as a
``mediator,'' a student who could be relied on to help others
resolve confrontation without violence.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher who sponsored him was Grunow.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Nate grew up in a neighborhood where young boys were sometimes
expected to fight. The neighborhood, stucco duplexes and small
concrete houses squeezed between the railroad tracks and a
nondescript stretch of U.S. 1., trembles faintly under freight cars
loaded with crushed limestone. This part of Lake Worth, south of
Palm Beach, was once an enclave for blacks who drifted down from
the South, but now many people speak Spanish or Haitian Creole.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Powell planned on her son's life being much
better, much easier than hers, though the process of raising him
was less than ideal. Powell, who is the assistant food services
director for a retirement home, left Nate's father, and two later
marriages sometimes brought police to the door to stop the fights.
</P>
<P>
   But people here say she shielded him from that, that she spent
much of what she made on him, that she was a good mother, if overly
protective. She is full of stories, like the one about his first
haircut, how he touched his head and looked up at her with his eyes
really big and said, ``Put it back.'' In third grade, ``he got
straight A's,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She spent much of what she made on him, buying good toys _ not
those plastic things that break in a week _ and later a $1,700
computer for school work. ``He had more than most people here,''
said Powell, who also has a 2-year-old daughter, Ebony.
</P>
<P>
   She did not allow him to speak in street slang. She saw, around
her, boys who pretended to be gangsters, who dressed and acted as
gangsters, then one day vanished into the violence. Her son was a
junior usher who went to Bible study on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kid you hope for,'' said Sharon Odums, who has
known Powell since elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Some students seemed to resent Nate, because he seemed so
goody-goody.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would make fun of him,'' said Shikeria Knowles, 13, who
was a classmate of Nate's since third grade. ``They would pick on
him, and he would just ignore them. He wouldn't do a thing. He had
brains.''
</P>
<P>
   He was popular with the smart kids. ``He was always helping
people with homework,'' Shikeria said. When he drew a role as a
woman in a play in Grunow's class, he did it good naturedly, and
students applauded.

<P>
   Frank Bermudez, the band and chorus director at the school, said
Nate got an A in band, ``but I really don't remember when he
didn't. He switched from trumpet to tuba to help out our band. He
liked coming to practice. I had to throw him out of the room at
times, because he was so dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   He played video games where people blew up people and watched
movies of death and mayhem, but no more than anyone else, and never
acted any of it out, said friends.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The pivotal moment in Nate's life may have come the week before
the shooting. While visiting the home of a relative, he saw a tiny
Raven .25 caliber gun. Nate stole it.

<P>
   ``People ask what happened,'' said his mother. ``Life
happened.''

   The man who had the gun bought it because he lives in a
neighborhood where, sometimes, a gun makes people feel more safe.
Her son saw it and, fascinated as boys are with guns, took it,
probably to show his friends, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of class, a teacher _ not Grunow _ saw Nate in a
water balloon fight, and he was sent home. A classmate told police
that Nate said he would seek revenge, that ``I'll be all over the
news.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He went home and got his gun, and came back just before the
final bell. He did not seek out the teacher who expelled him but
went instead to Grunow's class and asked to say goodbye to two
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow told him no, and, as the two stood in the hallway, Nate
pulled his gun, pointed it into Grunow's face and shot him, say
police.
</P>
<P>
   When another teacher came up to him, he wheeled and pointed it
at that teacher, but did not shoot or the gun did not fire, police
said. Nate ran, but flagged down a police car a few minutes later
and turned himself in.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect things like this,'' said Bermudez. ``We don't, from
a kid like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The why of it haunts people here. ``I think it was his chance to
scare people,'' to show he was more than a nice boy, said Shikeria.
``I think he kept it all inside, for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Balfour, a counselor at the Osborne Community Center near
Nate's neighborhood, said, ``No one ever had anything bad to say
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was it, that he wanted more attention than an honor
roll could give, more than playing tuba on a 50-yard line,
classmates said. Nate was, in the end, too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   But his mother says no, he was good, and will be good again.
``My baby is going to be somebody,'' she said.

BBC SEEKS TO CHARGE ISRAEL WITH WAR CRIMES FOR DEATH OF EMPLOYEE IN
LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The BBC is charging that the killing of one of its
drivers in an Israeli tank attack in southern Lebanon last month
appears to have been a deliberate and unprovoked attack on a
civilian target, an accusation Israel strongly denies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the BBC in London are investigating whether Israel
can be accused of a war crimes violation under the terms of the
Geneva Convention, said BBC correspondents here.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army acknowledged on Friday that Abed Takkoush, who
worked as a driver and news assistant for the BBC in Lebanon for 25
years, was killed by an artillery shell fired at his car by an
Israeli tank on May 23, as Israeli forces were hastily withdrawing
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army spokesmen at first disavowed responsibility for the
incident, saying the attack might have been the work of the South
Lebanon Army, Israel's local ally in its since-abandoned border
security zone. The BBC then submitted its own detailed report on
the incident to Israeli authorities, including extensive video
footage from the BBC and four other television news organizations,
which appears to conclusively document an unprovoked attack on
Takkoush's blue Mercedes by an Israeli Merkava tank stationed about
4,000 feet away, inside Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Bowen, the BBC reporter whom Takkoush had driven to the
scene, witnessed the devastating impact from a few hundred feet
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Abed lurch out of the driver's side of the car and then
fall to the ground,'' he said. Bowen said that as he headed toward
the burning car he was met by a burst of machine-gun fire from the
Israeli border. A Lebanese Red Cross truck also came under fire as
its tried to approach the vehicle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no gunfire, no rocket attacks, no artillery
exchanges that day, as Bowen and his crew drove through the newly
abandoned security zone toward the Israeli border. Together with
his cameraman, Malek Kenaan, he walked about a hundred yards from
their parked car to set up equipment for a broadcast report, while
Takkoush stayed behind, talking to his son in Beirut by mobile
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen was close enough to the border to wave at local kibbutz
residents surveying the scene from the other side of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was quiet,'' he said. ``We had no idea that we were
in any danger.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Friday accepting responsibility for what it
termed ``a tragic accident,'' the Israeli army said the tank crew
had been warned of a possible Hezbollah attack and mistook the
BBC's tripod and camera for an anti-tank missile launcher.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with BBC correspondents, senior aides to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said the Defense Ministry has ordered a further
investigation into Takkoush's death. There is a ``possibility''
that the military army investigators might recommend financial
compensation for Takkoush's family, said Gadi Baltiansky, Barak's
chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new investigation is just now underway, Baltiansky
said the government is convinced that the tank crew and the
commanders who authorized the attack had legitimate grounds to
believe they were witnessing preparations for a missile attack. ``I
can understand the mistake, though I cannot justify it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC challenges the Israeli army's account, noting that at
the time and place the army now says it was anticipating a
Hezbollah missile attack, the army had permitted a crowd of Israeli
civilians to gather at the border fence and observe its evacuation
from the zone. They note further that the car was targeted, but not
the crew, which the Israeli army said it had ``mistakenly
identified as a terrorist group.''
</P>
<P>
   Most seriously, the BBC contends in its report that news film
from the scene shows that the Israeli army ``appeared to be
sporadically targeting vehicles'' driven by Lebanese civilians
along the same stretch of road earlier on May 23 and on May 22,
despite the absence of any ``retaliatory fire from the Lebanese
side of the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International independently reported that at least two
other Lebanese civilians were killed by Israeli tanks firing at
Lebanese cars in the same location on May 22 and 23. ``These
attacks appear to have taken place without warning, after the IDF
and SLA had already pulled back from the areas,'' the human rights
group said, referring to the Israeli army and the South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   If evidence supports the charge that the Israelis were
``recklessly'' firing at civilian vehicles across the border, the
BBC contends, this would constitute a violation of the Geneva
Convention, which categorizes as a war crime any deliberate
targeting of unarmed noncombatants. The BBC's legal department is
planning to pursue the case, Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This claim is completely groundless,'' Baltiansky said. ``We
cannot do any more than we are doing _ investigating, apologizing
and offering compensation.''

   CONGRESS-COLOMBIA (Washington) _The Senate on Wednesday was
ready to approve nearly $1 billion in aid to Colombia, nearly three
months after it passed the House. Final spending level will be set
by conference committee, and could still be held hostage to
congressional schedules. But House Speaker Dennis Hastert and
Senate backers of aid to Colombia say they may have devised a way
to get the aid measure to President Clinton's desk by end of next
week. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   BLACKS-INSURANCE (Undated) _ One of the country's biggest life
insurers, American General, said Wednesday that it was paying $175
million to settle claims that until as recently as early this year
black customers were charged more for coverage than were white
customers. By Joseph B. Treaster.
</P>
<P>
   RACE-PLANTATION (Natchitoches, La.) _ At the south edge of the
old plantation, eight simple cabins stood in a field of clover.
Generations of whitewash were peeling in ugly patches from the
mud-brick walls. All but one front porch had rotted away, and there
were gaping holes where doors and windows used to be. Obscured by
rows of live oaks, the cabins had been forgotten by many and
ignored by most. There was almost nothing left _ except the stories
of the slaves who once lived in them. Will re-enactments of slave
life at a former plantation, now a national park, help to heal
racial wounds _ or open them? By Ginger Thompson. (6500 words, with
an abridged version of about half that length.)

also move tonight.)

   GORE-OIL (Nashville, Tenn.) _ The Gore campaign, worried that
the public blames the Clinton administration for the recent surge
in oil prices, is trying to shift attention to Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, a former oil company executive himself who the Gore camp
says still has deep ties to an industry that is gouging the public.
By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   DEAF-READING (Undated) _ Deaf Americans have gained a place in
the national consciousness. American Sign Language interpreters
seem to be everywhere, from the State of the Union address to the
Miss America pageant. But some advocates for the deaf say that a
politicized devotion to the exclusive use of sign language by many
of the deaf has helped foster a little known and surprising
problem: The average 18-year-old deaf American reads at a
fourth-grade level. These advocates are seeking to lead a
revolution in deaf education through a 34-year-old method called
cued speech. By Lynette Holloway.

   SKOREA-NKOREA (Seoul, South Korea) _ The euphoria of last week's
summit meeting is wearing off to reveal the hard road ahead. In the
North, Kim Jong Il has urged North Koreans to hew to communism and
self-reliance, saying that market openings would be disastrous for
the country. In the South, the political opposition has jumped on
Kim Dae-jung, saying he got nothing and was taken in by Kim Jong
Il. By Calvin Sims.

   SCI-MARS-WATER (Washington) _ The Mars Global Surveyor has
radioed data to Earth suggesting there is surface water on the Red
Planet, which could boost the possibility of finding evidence of
life, experts say. (Summary from wires) By Warren E. Leary.

 &HT;    HOUSTON CONGRESSMAN DROPS LONGHORN PIPELINE RIDER
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After keeping Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, on
tenterhooks for most of two days, a Houston representative on
Wednesday abandoned at the last minute his plans to introduce
legislation to block an environmental study of the proposed
Longhorn pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a
``comprehensive'' environmental impact study of the Longhorn
project has been one of Doggett's pet goals for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, a Houston Democrat, began circulating the text
of an amendment to block the study Tuesday, as a bill to
appropriate EPA's budget for next year was being debated on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would have prohibited EPA from using any part of
its budget to fund the environmental study. As soon as he heard
Green planned to introduce the amendment, Doggett started lobbying
other members against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased that the amendment has been withdrawn,''
Doggett said Wednesday afternoon. ``I talked with Rep. Green on the
floor and he indicated to me he did not intend to offer it. I had
been mobilizing support to oppose it.'' Doggett said Green didn't
indicate why he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Doggett wrote to President Clinton, urging
him to direct EPA to issue a formal environmental impact statement
before approving plans for the pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
   Known formally as the Longhorn Partners Pipeline, the proposal
would reopen a recently abandoned pipeline and use it to pump
gasoline from Houston to El Paso. The line passes through Doggett's
Austin district, where it has been criticized as a threat to
underground water resources.
</P>
<P>
   In a less comprehensive report issued earlier this year, EPA
consultants declared that the plan posed no significant threat to
the environment.

&HT;     SENATORS LOB BIPARTISAN ATTACKS AT ENERGY SECRETARY
RICHARDSON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake the mysterious disappearance and
reappearance of two sensitive computer hard drives at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory, senators from both parties threatened
Wednesday to take control of America's nuclear weapons labs away
from the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,
said he will introduce legislation ordering an examination of
whether the nuclear weapons programs _ including the Los Alamos,
N.M., lab and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California _ should be turned over to an independent agency or to
the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything that has gone on, we have to wonder why these
incredibly sensitive labs are under the supervision of this
department,'' Warner said at a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The session was marked by a number of attacks against Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson and his agency's security policies.
</P>
<P>
   He was verbally skewered by senators who charged that the
secretary, a former congressman from New Mexico, had failed to
implement security measures that could have prevented the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've lost all credibility,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., chairman of the Intelligence Committee, repeating his call
for Richardson to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said Richardson had ``thrown away the
confidence of the Congress'' and that he would not have support
from the Senate if he is nominated for another administration
position. ``There's a feeling that you have treated Congress like a
lap dog,'' Bryd told Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Strongly defending himself, the secretary insisted, ``I take a
back seat to nobody when it comes to security.''
</P>
<P>
   He assured the panel that employees would be held
``accountable'' for any security breaches and added that a grand
jury has been convened to investigate the disappearance of the
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson repeated earlier statements that the FBI has found no
evidence of espionage in the case and no indication that the drives
had ever left the Los Alamos lab's top secret X-Division, where
some of the nation's most sensitive nuclear weapons research is
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department first announced June 12 that the hard
drives, which contain information on how to dismantle certain
nuclear devices, had been missing since at least May 7, when two
scientists went to remove them from a vault as a fierce wildfire
approached the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to find out what happened to the hard drives, the
FBI and Energy Department are seeking to determine why the two
scientists did not report the disappearance to lab security or
other officials for 24 days. Department rules require reporting
security lapses within eight hours. The FBI was not notified until
June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said all 26 individuals who had unescorted access to
the vault have taken lie detector tests and that the investigation
was focusing on ``a handful of X-Division employees who have
offered conflicting statements to investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI continued to treat the area where the hard
drives were found as a crime scene and that investigators believe
the two drives disappeared at the end of March, although the exact
date remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, appearing for the first time on Capitol Hill to
discuss the hard drives' disappearance, said his department also
expects to complete a review later this summer of the University of
California's contract to run the weapons labs. Critics, including
many in the Energy Department, say university officials have failed
to implement security policies and to conduct proper oversight at
the labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that the University of California
does well, like science, and things it doesn't do well, like
security, and we're considering taking over some of the things it
doesn't do well,'' Richardson said.While acknowledging the
seriousness of the hard drives' disappearance, Richardson said that
in his two years as energy secretary he had ``done more on security
than has been done in the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But several senators questioned how his security measures could
allow the labs to completely lose track of the hard drives for
several months. The last written record showed the drives to be in
the vault of the X-Division at the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said the ``lack of inventory control
was simply inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he has changed security rules so that
information on the hard drives must be encrypted with secret codes
and the vault must have guards when someone enters. A formal log-in
and log-out procedure has been created, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-drive mystery comes a year after security questions at
Los Alamos arose in the wake of the Wen Ho Lee case. Lee was a
scientist there who was investigated amid allegations that China
had stolen nuclear data. He was fired in March 1999 for security
violations and was arrested in December on charges of mishandling
classified material after it was discovered that he had downloaded
and copied vast amounts of nuclear weapons data from Los Alamos'
classified computer network.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee was never charged with espionage, and the accusations
that China had stolen design information about America's most
advanced nuclear warhead have not been proved.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Lee case, Congress created a semi-autonomous
independent agency to oversee the laboratories that was to report
to Richardson and Congress. Richardson resisted the plan, arguing
that he should remain in charge, and that he could guarantee the
safety of the nation's nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday Richardson said he would move quickly to get
the new agency up and running and that it would have his ``full
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said the semi-autonomous agency
was the department's ``last chance'' to keep the weapons facilities
from being taken away. ``This is too consequential to give another
free pass,'' Lieberman said.

TRYING TO GIVE BOMB SQUAD ROBOTS BRAINS TO MATCH THEIR BRAWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By DANIEL SORID    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes confusion is the mother of invention. A researcher at
Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque is trying to devise
software that will make bomb squad robots easier to use. That will
help law enforcement agencies put machines, rather than people, in
harm's way when a bomb is suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The robots are already sophisticated and capable in many ways.
The problem is that they can be difficult to use.
</P>
<P>
   The Albuquerque Police Department is a case in point. After
several years of seeking money for a robot to help disarm
explosives, the department spent $160,000 in 1998 for a
remote-controlled robot called Andros, built by Remotec, a
subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. The Albuquerque department, which
responds to bomb threats statewide, had one of only two such robots
in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Andros came with an impressive resume. It was designed to pick
up a suspicious device and put it in a safe container or use one of
its tools to disarm or otherwise disrupt a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after the robot was delivered, the department realized
that there was a problem. Even though Remotec had given some basic
training to department personnel, the officers were having trouble
manipulating the robot.
</P>
<P>
   Andros is a capable machine. It can climb stairs and maneuver
through difficult terrain, even crossing ditches. It is sealed to
withstand extreme environments and can work on almost any kind of
surface. Most important, it has tools to counteract bombs. Remotec
will not describe those tools, it says, because it does not want to
make that information available to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Andros and other bomb squad robots are generally slow, traveling
no faster than five miles per hour, but their every motion must be
controlled by a human operator. And since the Albuquerque bomb
squad officers train with the robot only about two hours a month,
they have found it hard to master its remote controls.
</P>
<P>
   So while the department says that it has put Andros in service
about a dozen times, the robot has only inspected suspicious
packages, not disarmed them. Someone from the bomb squad still
needs to suit up in 110 pounds of gear to do the real work of
keeping the bomb from injuring anyone. ``There have been several
other situations where we could have used it,'' said Capt. Ray
Schultz, ``but we just weren't comfortable with our proficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   That problem attracted the attention of Phil Bennett, a
mechanical engineer at Sandia, a Department of Energy laboratory
operated by a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. Bennett is using the
laboratory's technology to make bomb squad robots better.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Bennett asked to observe the Albuquerque police
officers in practice situations. He wanted to learn about the
difficulties they were having in controlling Andros and to use that
information to design a robot that would be easier to run. The
department agreed to his request.
</P>
<P>
   What Bennett found was that while bomb squad robots had been
designed to be sturdy and accurate, the controls were unwieldy. As
a result, the robots were being underused by security officers.
``The option of a robot sounds attractive until you look at what
comes off the shelf,'' Bennett said. ``What we're trying to do is
speed up the process of getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Farrow, vice president for marketing at Remotec, the
world's largest manufacturer of hazardous-duty robots, said that
its robots were effective and that it had sold 700 of them. Barrow
said that while automation could make the robots complete their
tasks faster, speed was less important than accuracy in bomb
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's plan is to adapt for bomb robots a piece of software
developed at Sandia for robots that help clean up after
environmental disasters. That software, called Smart, for Sandia
Modular Architecture for Robotics and Teleoperation, allows a robot
to use components, like sensors, made by different vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being completely manually controlled, a robot
equipped with Smart could be given sensors that would allow it to
make some decisions on its own. The robot could figure out the best
path to a point in a room, center itself in a doorway or grip a
bomb on its own. That would free security personnel to focus on
what steps to take when there was a bomb threat, Bennett said,
rather than focusing on controlling the robot's every move.
</P>
<P>
   It could take up to three years of development, testing and
evaluation before bomb squad robots controlled by Smart software
could be manufactured and sold by the private sector, Bennett said.
If all goes well, he said, the robots will be able to complete
their tasks in half the time they do now. And as terrorists develop
new types of bombs, a robot using Smart could adapt to the new
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handling bomb threats is one of law enforcement's most
treacherous tasks,'' Bennett said. Smarter robots ``will take some
of the burden off the operator's mind while he's figuring out what
to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   And while it will be difficult to switch the current generation
of robots to the Smart system, upgrades will be easy for robots
built with Smart controls. That will help law enforcement agencies
save money, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police agencies have a very limited budget,'' he said, ``and
those who can afford to have a robot, or who have gone through the
pain of getting funds allocating to buy a robot, want to use them
for as many situations as they can.'' While many major cities, like
New York, have bomb-disrupting robots, the technology may be picked
up by smaller cities when it becomes more adaptable and easily
upgradable.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Albuquerque Police Department has never
suffered an injury or death from a bomb, Schultz said. But now that
the squad has had a taste of using robots to handle bomb threats,
he wants robots to play a greater role in their policing _ once
they become easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got this great robot,'' he said. ``We want to be able to
use it to our full potential.''

   KOREA-ANNIVERSARY _ SEOUL, South Korea _ Fifty years after North
Korea invaded the South, triggering a war that left nearly 37,000
American soldiers dead, the border dividing the Korean Penninsula
into Communist North and Capitalist South remains the world's last
Cold War fault line, a place where U.S., South Korean and North
Korean troops face off across the most heavily militarized border
anywhere in the world. For protecting South Korea for the past five
decades, the United States has secured a strategic toehold in
Northeast Asia, at the doorstep of China and Russia, and has built
an enduring alliance with South Korea, host of the 1988 Summer
Olympic Games and home to one of the world's strongest economies.

   KOSOVO-PRISONERS _ MITROVICA, Kosovo _ There are reportedly more

prisoners of war, but their wives and mothers call them hostages.
The United Nations can do little to secure their release ? another
criticism people have about the U.N. It's a very politically touchy
subject. The cease-fire accords left out any mention of prisoner
releases, for a number of reasons. But now, families are left with
no recourse except to pay bribes and ransoms to get their relatives
out of jail, paying anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000. We tag along

   COXNET INSIDE NASCAR 0623: FEMALE DRIVER EARNING RESPECT _

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A complex weather system will continue to move through the
Northeastern states on Thursday, bringing rapidly changing weather
conditions to the area. In New England, morning showers will yield
to some sun, gusty breezes and very high temperatures in the
afternoon. However, showers and thunderstorms will again develop in
the mountains in the afternoon, then slide to the East Coast by the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a front will become nearly stationary across the
Southeast. This front will provide a focus for repeated showers and
thunderstorms, some of which will contain brief bursts of heavy
rain. Storms are also likely along the Gulf Coast where sea breezes
will undercut and lift warm, humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the West will remain tranquil, though thunderstorms will
develop in the mountains of New Mexico and Arizona by late in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DESERT FLOODS
</P>
<P>
   Intense thunderstorms caused blowing dust, large hail and areas
of flooding around Phoenix on Tuesday. Although rainfall in these
thunderstorms was heavy, it only takes modest amounts of rain to
cause desert flooding. The desert floor does not readily absorb
large amounts of water because of its sandy soil and lack of
vegetation. So runoff from sudden brief rain can be very rapid. In
summer, an arroyo, which is a dry creek bed, can change from an
arid gulch to a raging torrent in a matter of seconds. &QL;

<P>
   After decades of intensive lobbying, deaf Americans have gained
a place in the national consciousness. American Sign Language
interpreters seem to be everywhere, from the State of the Union
address to the Miss America pageant. Many universities and high
schools now offer it as a foreign language course.
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates for the deaf say that a politicized devotion
to the exclusive use of sign language by many of the deaf has
helped foster a little known and surprising problem: The average
18-year-old deaf American reads at a fourth-grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the problem is because of reliance on sign language, as
they say, or stems from other causes, these advocates are seeking
to lead a revolution in deaf education through a 34-year-old method
called cued speech. The supporters of cued speech say the
over-reliance on sign language fosters a kind of false pride in
deaf separatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say using cued speech would make someone more
hearing in the mind, like a black person trying to be white,'' said
Alina Engelman, 18, a deaf student of Brooklyn who uses cued
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Others counter that the poor literacy of the deaf does not stem
from reliance on sign language but from the fact that the vast
majority of the deaf are born to hearing parents who do not know
how to guide them academically. About 90 percent of the
quarter-million Americans who were born deaf or became deaf in
early childhood have hearing parents.
</P>
<P>
   Crisscrossing the nation like evangelists, these advocates of
cued speech, who are both the deaf and the hearing, are splitting
deaf Americans, their families and other advocates in a way that is
reminiscent of an earlier battle within black America over whether
integration was the best course.
</P>
<P>
   American Sign Language, called signing, bears no relationship to
English, its spelling, syntax or grammar. Cued speech, which is a
supplement to sign language, breaks words into syllables and
conveys them with hand signals and lip reading. It uses eight
phonetic hand shapes that represent groups of consonant sounds and
four positions around the face to represent groups of vowel sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cued speech is being used in a few public school systems across
the country, including New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And in some cases, its advocates say, it has helped floundering
students move to grade level quite quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first six months of using cued speech, we made a smooth
transition from signing to cueing and my son learned 500 new
words,'' said Sarina Roffe, executive director of New York Cued
Speech Center. Roffe is a hearing parent whose 24-year-old deaf
son, Simon, graduated from one of the city's most selective high
schools, Stuyvesant, and then New York University. He began using
cued speech when he was 3 and a half years old.
</P>
<P>
   Some see any attack on sign language as an attack on the rights
of the deaf. Others say it is time to face the academic failing of
the deaf and focus on the individual learning needs of the
children.
</P>
<P>
   The push for broader teaching and use of cued speech comes at
time when vocational jobs often filled by the deaf, like printing
and data entry, are being replaced by high-tech jobs that require
greater literacy, and when medical technology is making it
increasingly possible for deaf children to gain partial hearing
through cochlear implants, a surgical procedure that makes verbal
communication easier and facilitates cued speech. The implant
resembles a thumb-nail size piece of Playdough with a narrow wire
that runs behind the ear and an attachment in the hair.
</P>
<P>
   Other methods for helping the deaf communicate have also been
advocated over the years. One is oral-auralism, which is
essentially lip reading with the help of hearing aids, and was the
main teaching tool for generations when sign language was banned
from schools in an attempt to make them more like hearing children.
Another is signing exact English, which is using the American Sign
Language to depict language just as it is spoken. Still another
method is auditory verbal therapy, which teaches the maximum use of
hearing aids without lip reading.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools are using American Sign Language for instruction
and conceptual understanding of material and one of the other
methods to teach reading and writing.
</P>
<P>
   No studies exist showing that one method works better than
another, said Jane Fernandes, provost of Gallaudet University, a
college for the deaf in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years people are finally realizing that deaf
children can't read and this is the way they can learn,'' Roffe
said of cued speech. ``We aren't saying that deaf people should not
learn American Sign Language. We are saying that the deaf should
know both. Sign is not spoken, has no written form and thus has its
own syntax. It is incompatible with spoken or written English,
making it difficult to learn to read and write. Cued speech helps
the deaf to get around that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, about 100 families spent a weekend at a
campsite beside a sun-dappled lake in Warwick, N.Y., to improve
their cued speech skills. Older students trained toddlers on grassy
knolls and parents sat in hot classrooms for hours learning the
finer points. Several more camps, run by different advocacy groups
for the deaf, are scheduled to take place around the nation this
summer. It takes about 20 hours to learn the basics of cued speech.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the National Cued Speech Center in Rochester, N.Y., nor
the New York Cued Speech Center in Brooklyn has figures on how many
people use the system. But Roffe estimates that more than 3,000
people have been trained in it.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to cued speech is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Susan M. Mather, a professor of American Sign Language,
linguistics and interpretation at Gallaudet, said that the poor
literacy rate had nothing to do with sign language but was the
result of low involvement from hearing parents with their deaf
children from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children are not getting the attention they need from
the start,'' Mather, who is deaf and has deaf children, said
through a translator. ``Hearing parents are afraid if their kids
learn ASL, they will never see them again. They will only be
involved in the deaf world. That is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The deaf children of deaf parents perform slightly better in
school than deaf children of hearing parents, experts say, because
they learn to the American Sign Language earlier. While they still
encounter the problems of reading and writing, they have the
confidence to overcome it because they have been socialized
differently than children of hearing parents, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Robert R. Davila, vice president of the National Technical
Institute for the Deaf, said that methods like cued speech should
be used to improve literacy because they require the entire family
to get involved. But he disagreed that American Sign Language was
the cause of poor literacy among the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many deaf individuals are bilingual in ASL and English just as
many Hispanic children are bilingual in Spanish and English,'' said
Davila, who is Mexican-American. ``It is wrong to blame ASL for
having poor English. We don't blame Spanish for having poor
English.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cued speech was invented by R. Orin Cornet in 1966 shortly after
William C. Stokoe Jr., a linguistics professor, successfully pushed
for signing to be recognized as a language and helped end a
century-long banishment of signing from classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Cued speech was dwarfed by the focus on signing, but Cornet, a
physicist and mathematician with hearing, pressed on to improve
literacy among the deaf students. Even then, deaf educators
realized that something needed to be done about the literacy rate
of the deaf. Cornet developed a system where people could see the
spoken word.
</P>
<P>
   Cornet set up a department at Gallaudet and the technique spread
slowly. Small programs popped up in Washington and Montgomery
County, Md. Studies showed deaf children who took the programs
ended up with comparable language skills with hearing peers. Today,
Montgomery County has one of the largest cued speech public school
divisions in the country, along with Minnesota and North Carolina.
Australia also has a large deaf population that uses cued speech.
</P>
<P>
   Stokoe's efforts helped to ingrain American Sign Language into
deaf culture and attempts to help the deaf communicate with the
hearing have often been viewed with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, many doctors are recommending that cued speech
go along with cochlear implants, which increase hearing and assist
people with lip reading.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, one of the first in the nation
to perform the implant operation, used to implant about a dozen a
year. Last year, about 100 operations were performed there, almost
double the previous two years, according to Patricia M. Schute, an
audiologist at Lenox Hill, the largest cochlear implant center on
the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Cued speech is contained to the face and neck. The cues are
quick strokes of the finger across the cheek, the neck and chin.
And it encourages users to use their voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to say: `If you want to go out to play, you have to
eat your crackers first,' in sign language,'' said Carol Sereda,
39, a hearing parent, ``I would sign: Cracker, eat. Finish. Play.
Can. With cued speech, I would cue it in plain English. It's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Sereda, of Natick, Mass., was at the camp to sharpen her cued
speech skills to communicate better with her deaf 2-year-old and
her 4-year-old, who is 50 percent hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching children to write through cued speech is easier, said
Karen Doenges, a speech-language specialist with the Dakota County
school system in Rosemount, Minn., because it is based on English.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to teach a child to write milk in cued speech, it
would not be difficult,'' she said. ``But in American Sign Language
the symbol for milk looks like you're milking a cow. When they are
trying to figure out the `m' on the page and the `i' and `l' and
`k,' there is no code to match it up with. What cued speech does is
try to match the sounds of the language and turns it into a visual
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Engelman, 56, a journalism professor at Long Island
University in Brooklyn, and his wife, Synnove Trier-Engelman, 54, a
clinical psychologist, both hearing parents, trained their
daughter, Alina, in cued speech as an infant. Since kindergarten,
they said, she has tested in the 99th percentile in reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alina learned to sound out words the way hearing kids do,
learned to read because cued speech is such a rich phonetic
system,'' Mrs. Trier-Engelman said. Alina, who will graduate from
Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn next week with a 3.94
average, is scheduled to attend Brown University in the fall. Since
kindergarten, she has gone to school with a personal translator,
someone who sits next to her and translates, or cues, what the
teacher says.
</P>
<P>
   Alina wears a cochlear implant. Between the implant and intense
speech pathology training, she can speak in muffled but audible
tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be at a disadvantage without cued speech because I
would learn only American Sign Language and everyone would be
communicating in English,'' she said. ``That is not to say that I
don't like ASL. But I would be like, where do you put the `a' and
`the.' It would be hard.''

`LYING': IT COULD BE FACT OR FICTION ... OR SOMETHING ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If you've read my other books _ and I have written other
books, `Prozac Diary' and `Welcome to My Country,' which I suggest
you rush out and buy _ you would know that mental problems have
been issues throughout my life,'' Lauren Slater notes helpfully in
her third memoir. Nonetheless, though she has already cataloged a
full litany of complaints including depression, anorexia and
self-mutilation, Slater now locates a whole new vein of illness to
mine. In ``Lying,'' she presents her lifelong history of epilepsy,
but as the title suggests, there is a catch. Maybe this really
happened to her. Maybe she is making it up.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's bite: why? For what reason would she have concocted
this book's lovingly detailed auras and seizures? And if this
memoir is merely a feat of gamesmanship, what would induce the
reader to play along? Slater, who can be found posing on the front
cover of each autobiographical volume, maintains that the essential
truth of her story matters more than the particulars, and that the
figurative meaning of epilepsy _ the falling, auras, seizures and
memory lapses, not to mention the celebrity connections to van
Gogh, Dostoyevsky et al. _ makes her own life easier and more
interesting to explain. ``This is my tale,'' she says, ``and I have
written it over and over again, and, depending on my mood and my
auras, the story always seems to change, and yet it always seems
true.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't always seem true to anyone bothering to compare this
book with her earlier accounts. (Was she actually in a foster home,
or did she spend her teen-age years at home with her mother, whom
she blames for everything?) But that, as Slater repeats endlessly
here, is beside the point. The ``metaphorical memoir'' that she
attempts is a refutation of literal-minded storytelling, as well as
a response to the exaggerations that color many memoirs anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that a lot of memoirs have made-up scenes;
that's obvious,'' she writes, in a memo advising Random House on
how to market ``Lying.'' ``And everyone knows that half the time at
least fictions contain literal autobiographical truths. So how do
we decide what's what, and does it even matter?'' What she has in
mind, she continues, is ``a book that takes up residence in the
murky gap between genres, and by its stubborn self-position there,
forces us to consider important things.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, ``Lying'' flogs these important things to the
point where they cease being important. It is not likely that the
reader's interest in Slater's medical and philosophical condition
will rival her own. And this book winds up working best as an
imaginative coming-of-age memoir, one that exerts considerable
narrative pull even if it should turn out to be science fiction.
Only intermittently, as when Slater describes undergoing brain
surgery, is there a deeply compelling reason to wonder why she
might have chosen to invent such an episode, or what it means in
her larger story.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that epileptics have tendencies toward mythomania and
melodrama, Slater goes on to offer prodigious illustrations of
both. In her early years, she says, she lied about having cancer.
She stole things while in a state she regarded as a kind of
seizure. She learned to fake epileptic episodes in hospital
emergency wards all over Boston, and when she first began to write,
she says, she experienced sexual ecstasy at the keyboard. She
describes taking part in the Bread Loaf writers' conference in
Vermont under a fake name, at 17, and encountering the very famous
author with whom she had her first affair. Her writing, he told
her, made him feel ``like I need a long cool shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this enveloping section of her book tells a familiar
story, that of the young acolyte seduced by the worldly middle-aged
man, Slater succeeds here in vibrantly evoking the episode and
achieving the resonance she seeks. The link between sexual and
epileptic abandon is clear, and it is well used to illuminate her
ambivalent response to the affair. Also effective is the sense of
the author as an assured manipulator of the story she tells. ``I
didn't sleep with him,'' she tells a friend, soon after meeting
this literary lion. ``But you will,'' the friend replies. ``And it
will be such a cliche when it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, in an episodic book with sections named for the stages
of an epileptic seizure (``Onset,'' ``The Rigid Stage,'' ``The
Convulsive Stage,'' ``The Stage of Recovery''), Slater presents her
most creative and wry bit of dissembling. In keeping with the
spiritual and religious yearning that she says is also part of the
epileptic's personality profile, she falls into step with a chapter
of Alcoholics Anonymous even though she does not have _ or has not
yet chosen to write a book about _ a drinking problem. And she
finds, in the book's most natural illustration of metaphorical
sweep, that her own pathology and those discussed by A.A. members
are perfectly in sync. When it is time for her to offer a personal
history, she is perfectly equipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started, you know, doing it at home, at school, all the
time, just stumbling around and making a real fool of myself,'' she
tells the alcoholics. She speaks of relapses and petty theft and
life in a dysfunctional family. She talks of her illness and the
physical humiliation it brings. And when she is done, and her
speech has been greeted with applause and tears, she goes home, has
a drink and decides to confess her lie.
</P>
<P>
   But when Slater tries to tell the truth, her A.A. friends stop
her and decide that she is just in denial. ``Shhh,'' one tells her.
Says another, offering the perfect commentary on this book's
self-importance about blurring fact and fiction, ``We see this all
the time.''

AT 18, WILLIAM CAN NO LONGER `CARVE FOR HIMSELF' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When the royal family partied Wednesday night at
Windsor Castle to celebrate a slew of birthdays, one of the guests
of honor was conspicuous by his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Prince William, second in line to the throne, passed up the
chance to celebrate his 18th birthday with his extended family late
into one of the longest days of the year and instead spent the
night studying for an art history test Thursday at Eton.
</P>
<P>
   Such discipline may hint at the seriousness with which the son
of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, regards his responsibilities
should his father, Prince Charles, succeed Queen Elizabeth II, and
should he succeed his father.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, William was entitled to be known as His Royal
Highness, a title his grandmother, the Queen, stripped from his
mother after Diana and Charles divorced. William has said he
doesn't want to be called His Royal Highness. William, he says,
will do.
</P>
<P>
   Palace officials confirm that William does not expect staff to
bow or curtsy to him, or to address him as sir, until he begins to
take on royal duties, probably years from now.
</P>
<P>
   But having control over what people call him may be one of the
few things William will enjoy in the coming years. As of Wednesday,
he is not only legally an adult, he is fair game, and the tabloids
and paparazzi are champing at the bit to get at him, to chronicle
his love life, to document how he and his friends relax, and to
photograph him doing every conceivable thing.
</P>
<P>
   The feeding frenzy over him last week, as official photographs
of William and authorized remarks by him were released to an
insatiable British press corps, underscored the media's obsession
with a handsome and by all accounts decent young man who bears a
haunting resemblance to his dead mother.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Prince Charles's press secretary resigned after she
failed to negotiate the copyright of the authorized photos
properly. The affair was dubbed a scandal by the press, and covered
with all the gravitas of a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, William seems to be pleading to be left alone.
Before he goes on to university, perhaps to study art history, he
wants to take a year off, maybe travel a bit. When the pool
reporter chosen by palace officials to conduct an interview asked
him whether he had a girlfriend, William said only, ``I like to
keep my private life private.''
</P>
<P>
   A noble aspiration by a noble, but ultimately one that is
doomed. With the gentlemen's agreement to grant William privacy
until he was 18 now scotched, a cottage industry for Prince William
stories was officially opened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   William referred to that privacy arrangement when he was asked
how he felt about all the media attention he receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel uncomfortable with it,'' he said. ``The media have left
me alone while I have been at Eton, for which I am grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   But if William expects continued consideration from the rabid,
royal-obsessed press, he will be disappointed, according to media
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Preston, a former newspaper editor and author of a new
novel whose story line is premised on the end of the royal family,
said newspapers here will inevitably lecture each other about
invading William's privacy, more out of jealousy than real
conviction. But he believes William's privacy is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intrinsically, now, William is our property,'' Preston said in
The Observer. ``We are stuck with him, and he has nowhere else to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the press attempts to be what it considers responsible
in its dealings with William, that becomes a subject of intense
scrutiny. The BBC recently edited from a documentary about William
some advice from a Liverpool teenager that the prince be more
careful in picking his friends, several of whom are reported to
have used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Hale was selected by the BBC to offer advice to William
because he, too, is turning 18 this summer. He grew up in a housing
project and attends a publicly-funded state high school. Although
William enjoyed a far more privileged upbringing, Hale said he
wouldn't trade places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prince isn't free to live the life of a normal teenager,
and as he gets older the press will never leave him alone,'' said
Hale. ``He was born to be king, and I was born to be his subject. I
think it's ridiculous that in modern Britain, one person should be
thought of as being better than anyone else because of their
birth.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Britons share Hale's sentiments. A poll commissioned by
The Guardian newspaper found that only 44 percent of Britons think
the country would be worse off without the royal family, down from
70 percent just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's why so much is riding on William. Like his mother, he
brings a touch of glamor to a mostly dowdy royal family that has
had its dysfunctions displayed for the world to see. William's
informality, like his mother's, may endear him to a larger segment
of the public, but such strong personalities can cause problems in
a royal family that wants to be seen as loyal and monolithic.
</P>
<P>
   William's uncle, Charles Spencer, remains bitter at the way his
sister was treated by the rest of the royals. Such family tensions
will always play a divisive role within the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen invited 600 guests to the party at Windsor Castle.
While it fell on William's birthday, the bash was meant to
celebrate the upcoming 100th birthday of the Queen's mother, the
70th of the Queen's sister, Margaret, the 50th of the Queen's
daughter, Anne, and the 40th of her son Andrew, the Duke of York.
Most of the extended royal family was on the guest list, as were
smatterings of royalty from other European countries, many of whom
are related to the Windsors.
</P>
<P>
   Palace staff are hoping that one legacy of Diana, who was
literally chased to her death by paparazzi in Paris nearly three
years ago, is that the press will treat her older son with more
sensitivity. Several have pledged to do so, but palace staffers
remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   As Shakespeare put it in ``Hamlet,'' William will find his life
privileged but tightly controlled, at the mercy of his relatives
and by media that often see him as a device to sell newspapers:
``His will is not his own, for he himself is subject to his birth.
He may not, as unvalued persons do, carve for himself.''

<P>
   NATCHITOCHES, La. _ Betty Hertzog hadn't been thinking about
slavery when she agreed to go along with her rich friends' plans to
turn part of her beloved Magnolia Plantation into a national park.
She had been thinking about her family's land, and her struggle to
hold onto it.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzog's ancestors settled that fertile land at the south end
of Cane River more than 200 years ago, and she had lived in the big
house at Magnolia nearly all her life. She had too little money to
keep it going, and no children to pass it on to. Sometimes when she
talked about her devotion to the land, it sounded almost like
religion. ``If you had land,'' she would say, ``you were raised
that it is very important, and that if you had it, you had to keep
it.''
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Betty Hertzog is to feel the abiding power of Old
South symbols. Slight but still sturdy at 70, Hertzog is reserved
to the point of reclusiveness, happiest walking the plantation
grounds alone. But she had come to believe that the new national
park, with its droves of tourists, offered a way to hold onto the
land _ to preserve her family's stories and teach future
generations about the agricultural practices that made Magnolia the
Goliath of Cane River when cotton was king.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby DeBlieux hadn't been thinking about slavery, either, when
he began his campaign to turn Magnolia's work buildings into a
national park. He had just been trying to rescue his town.
</P>
<P>
   He had been trying since he was mayor in the mid-1970s, and
Natchitoches was drying up: farms were dying, working families were
fleeing, much of downtown was boarded shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that history was the key to turning the whole town
around,'' said DeBlieux, 67, who owns the Tante Huppe Bed &AMP;
Breakfast on Jefferson Street. ``First people would want to come
here to visit, and if they did, they would want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Before long, that ugly downtown had become a
National Historic Landmark, a mile-long quarter of French Colonial
buildings converted into antique shops, restaurants and souvenir
emporiums. The tourists came, and they stayed, often in the 32
B&AMP;B's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when DeBlieux and his preservationist friends thought
about Natchitoches' larger possibilities, they tended to look down
Cane River to Magnolia and its sister plantation, Oakland. The old
places had gone to seed some, but with a little help and money from
the National Park Service, they could make Natchitoches the
Colonial Williamsburg of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with some deftly applied pressure from Louisiana's
senior senator at the time, J. Bennett Johnston _ Betty Hertzog's
cousin by marriage _ Congress created the Cane River Creole
National Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   As for how slavery would fit in, Hertzog hoped the Park Service
wouldn't dwell on it too much.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, though, she started to feel
uneasy about the Park Service's plans. A new ranger, a black woman
named Carla Cowles, had begun scratching around the old slave
cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery was pretty much all Cowles was thinking about when she
came to Cane River. Cowles, 40, had started her career at Colonial
Williamsburg. But she came away with a very different ambition than
DeBlieux's: to provide a face and a voice to the often-ignored
stories of African slaves.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, in re-enactment and song, Cowles had shown the
violent fate of captured runaways and the pain of families torn
apart, had explained how people treated as property had held onto
humanity and hope. Magnolia's slave cabins, she thought, would be
the perfect stage for her work.
</P>
<P>
   What hardly anyone counted on was how a new park, on a
plantation that once had 260 slaves, might stir things up in a
place where people had agreed long ago that the last thing they
wanted to talk about was race.
</P>
<P>
   When the Park Service held hearings about what kind of programs
people wanted at the park, there was a lot of enthusiasm about
restoring the old buildings. When slavery came up, there was
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking about slavery proved difficult for whites and blacks,
and promised complications for park interpretation,'' the Park
Service reported. ``Blacks and whites treated slavery as a
delicate, nearly taboo subject for public discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ROLE OF A LIFETIME
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog had spent weeks getting the big house ready for
the Natchitoches Fall Pilgrimage of Historic Homes. ``Daddy
wouldn't have liked these tours, because he didn't like strangers
roaming through his house,'' she said. ``But you can't make a
living from farming any more. The tourists help pay to keep up this
old place.''
</P>
<P>
   As an only child, she had always known she would someday take
over Magnolia. But she had expected to live a little of her own
life first. She was just out of college when her father suffered a
heart attack. Someone had to manage the harvest. So at 23, she
abandoned her big-city dreams and began her turn as caretaker of
the land. Magnolia was not going to go the way of the other Cane
River plantations, into strangers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been more than 10 years since Hertzog oversaw a
harvest. In the late 1980s, she rented her fields to corporate
growers. Soon, she began the house tours. In the early '90s, her
rich preservationist friends began talking about turning Magnolia's
work buildings _ the slave cabins and hospital, the blacksmith shop
and cotton gin _ into a national park.
</P>
<P>
   On opening day of the festival last October, all but 10 or so of
the 700 tourists were white. One black visitor, 55-year-old Sam
Dugar, had come looking for his own history. His father and
grandfather had been sharecroppers at Magnolia, but till now he had
avoided the place. As the tour ended, he said he felt cheated.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I kept thinking was that they accumulated all this wealth
because of the blacks who worked here,'' Dugar said. ``But there
was nothing on the tour about black people. It's as if their place
in history was erased.''
</P>
<P>
   Hertzog insists she is not trying to erase history. ``We are
showing this house,'' she explained. ``I try to talk about what's
here, and the history that I am aware of. The slaves didn't have a
lot of records, and so you don't know who was here and where they
all were on the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she says, talk of slavery can offend. Her cousin
Ambrose recalled a black visitor who demanded back her $5 admission
after learning that the house was still owned by the original
slave-holding family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Hertzog says, it was not right for humans to be held
as property. But she feels no shame. ``The government has given
them every opportunity in the world,'' she said, ``so stop
complaining about the past and go out and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   From the little she has learned, she says, her family did not
mistreat its slaves. A Northwestern State University historian has
found no evidence of abuse or neglect, though a set of ankle stocks
was evidence of punishment. A Park Service archaeologist also told
her that the two-family brick cabins were larger and more
comfortable than the log dwellings on other plantations. And
inventories show that Magnolia's slaves had more balanced diets
than others in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzog said that in her mind, slavery looked a lot like the
lives of the sharecroppers _ slaves' descendants she remembered
from childhood, who worked the land for part of the crop. To this
day, that is the only way she has known blacks. Even after the last
families left the cabins in 1968, she continued to employ a few
black workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some black old-timers, she says, have told her that their years
at Magnolia were the best of their lives. While segregation
governed life in town, she says, on Magnolia blacks and whites
raced horses together and played on the plantation baseball team,
the Black Magnolias.
</P>
<P>
   As for Magnolia's slaves, she knew some of their stories would
be told at the new park. But she wanted those stories to reflect
her family's hardships and kindnesses as well. Which was why she
was getting so worried about the Park Service's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzog almost never talked directly about Carla Cowles. And for
more than a year after Cowles arrived, Hertzog never met with her.
</P>
<P>
   But she complained a lot about the Park Service. She had been
led to believe the park would be devoted to agriculture, she said,
but increasingly it seemed the emphasis would be on slavery, on
portrayals bound to vilify her family. She felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   AN OUTLET FOR THE ANGER
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, with a 16th-century literature degree from the
University of Virginia and yet another dead-end job, Carla Cowles
answered an ad for a job at Colonial Williamsburg: ``Talk about
black history and get paid,'' it said. It sounded promising _
except for having to portray slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Williamsburg, the daughter of a millworker and a
teacher's aide, she had revered America's civil rights leaders. In
college, which she remembers as ``a sea of whites,'' Cowles
organized sit-ins to demand more minority professors.
</P>
<P>
   While Cowles was working at Colonial Williamsburg, the slaves
she had studied in documents came to life. Their history became her
cause.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to work at the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial
in St. Louis. About a year ago, she was assigned to develop the
Cane River historical and community outreach programs. She imagines
the old cabins as a ``living, breathing slave community,'' complete
with people in costume portraying slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Cowles gets along well with the park volunteers, most of whom
are white. And she deals comfortably with white tourists, putting
them at ease when they make clumsy comments about slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the healing power of history, it has increasingly
channeled her racial anger. When she talks about that anger, she
casts back in her mind _ to the St. Louis landlord who at first
refused her an apartment because she was black; to the man who
called her a ``pickaninny'' as she guided him through Colonial
Williamsburg in her slave costume; to the teacher who tried to fail
her for refusing to pick a hero from a list of white American
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Away from work, Cowles leads an essentially black life. She
dates a black man who calls himself a separatist. And though she
says she doesn't share those views, she has had only two white
friends. The more she learns about slavery, the more she regards
the old plantation elite with suspicion and reproach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost impossible, living as a black person in America,
and as a person who has studied so much about slavery, not to be
angry about the injustices done to black people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowles avoids talking directly about Hertzog, just as Hertzog
will not talk directly about her. And while Cowles is offended at
the wealth plantation owners accumulated on the backs of slaves,
she is disturbed more, she says, by whites who ignore the less
noble truths of their families' pasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to say, `I'm sorry,''' she said. ``But if you
remain silent about it, then you have blood on your hands, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A SOCIAL CONTRACT OF SILENCE
</P>
<P>
   In this town of 17,000 in central Louisiana, not talking about
race is at the heart of a social contract, rooted in the
slave-owning past, that governs all sorts of black-white
relationships _ or nonrelationships. Whatever the inner tensions,
Natchitoches has tended to get along.
</P>
<P>
   Black and white Natchitoches are separate worlds of roughly
equal size. (The black half generally includes the mixed-race
Creoles, though socially and politically they float in between.)
Whites live east of Fifth Street, blacks west. Natchitoches Junior
High is mostly black; the junior high at St. Mary's Catholic School
is mostly white. On Sundays, blacks fill the all-you-can-eat buffet
near the Wal-Mart; whites crowd restaurants on the historic
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are a handful of influential blacks, economic and
political power is in white hands. The three well-endowed private
committees that turned Natchitoches into a tourist town are
virtually all white. Whites own all the new businesses in the
landmark district. In this place where so much revolves around
history, the history it tends to revolve around is white Colonial
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks think this historic district is white elite,'' DeBlieux
said. ``Well, it is. But it's not because we designed it that way.
It's sad, but black people here segregate themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks do not dispute those facts. They just give them a
different spin. ``It's true that blacks have not gotten involved in
the historic things,'' said Clifford Blake, who owns a po' boy
shop. ``I had a chance to open up a place on the waterfront, but I
didn't do it because it seemed like it was too white-dominated, and
I didn't believe they really wanted blacks involved.''
</P>
<P>
   To local preservationists, the racial climate reflects
Natchitoches' history as a ``cultural island'' in the South. From
its founding by French traders in 1714, they maintain, its
colonists were more accepting of other races than the British were,
and generally kinder to slaves. Natchitoches, they say, is the best
place to tell ``a side to slavery most people have never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even through the turmoil of the civil rights movement,
Natchitoches was calm; there were no protests, and a single brief
boycott. But silence, blacks say, has been less a matter of
contentment than ingrained reticence.
</P>
<P>
   Integration came peacefully. But that progress, many blacks say,
has gone only so far. They remain in their separate world,
profoundly wary of whites.
</P>
<P>
   A SON OF `THE QUARTERS'
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Vercher winced whenever he heard people call Magnolia's
brick cabins ``slave quarters.'' They had once been his home.
</P>
<P>
   His father was born and raised in the cabins, and his family
didn't move off Magnolia until the late 1960s. Those people were
not slaves, he pointed out. They were the Hertzogs' employees, and
they called their homes ``the quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed to think about any ancestors who lived there as
slaves, Vercher looked as if he might become physically ill.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to watch movies like ``Roots'' or ``Amistad,'' and
rejectedthe term ``African-American'' because he had never known
any relatives from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Vercher saw slavery only as a shameful part of the past, and
tried to wipe it from his mind. ``I don't want to hear about my
people being beaten and raped,'' he said, with his Cajun twang and
willful scowl. ``Let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a twist of fate, Vercher, 35, was now working for the
Park Service, restoring the cabins. For a black man, it was one of
the best jobs on Cane River.
</P>
<P>
   His late father, Ellis Vercher, who had been one of Hertzog's
father's chief hands, had been happy that the cabins were going to
become part of a new national park. The son was still coming to
terms with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   BRINGING UP SLAVERY
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Carla Cowles brought slavery back to Magnolia
Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   For the opening of an exhibit called ``Free at Last,'' Cowles
had invited two black historical interpreters from Arkansas to
perform skits showing slave life through fables and song.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Vercher was among the many locals who had been
uncomfortable since Cowles' plans were announced. ``It's easy for
Carla to talk about slavery because she don't come from here,'' he
said. ``I don't think it would be so easy for her to tell those
stories if she was talking about her own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowles had invited all 15 schools in the area. But while
teachers at three schools accepted, the rest did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, about 70 people _ black and white _ showed up that
evening. Vercher, anxieties and all, stood in back, pacing and
puffing hard on a cigarette. Betty Hertzog came, too. If the story
of slavery was going to be told, she said, she was going to make
sure it was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In the last skit of the evening, Curtis Tate portrayed a slave
named Luther and his master, James McVicar. Luther had learned to
read and write, but kept it secret for fear of punishment. The year
was 1849, and one day he blurted out something from the morning
paper about a gold rush in California.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbed McVicar forced a Bible into Luther's hands and
ordered him to read his favorite passage.
</P>
<P>
   Luther trembled and said: ``Naw suh, Massa McVicar. I can't
read.''
</P>
<P>
   McVicar insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Luther opened the Bible and read in a quavering voice, ``Moses
said unto Pharaoh, `Let my people go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The audience held its breath as Luther slumped over in fear.
</P>
<P>
   Then McVicar grinned and jumped with excitement. ``I'll be
darned, Luther, you can read! Can you write, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Luther, paralyzed by confusion, forced his head to nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' his master shouted. ``You can help me keep my
books; you can help me with my ledgers.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, the audience seemed as stunned as Luther. But soon
people were laughing and applauding in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog joined the standing ovation, then headed home,
elated. ``I liked it,'' she said. ``I thought they did a real
professional job. It was especially good for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Vercher, though, was pacing and dragging harder on his
cigarette. With their silly grins and floppy hats, he said, the
actors had given no dignity to the memory of slaves. If a master
learned that a slave could read, he would reach for a rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of historians are they,'' he asked, ``if they make
up things instead of telling it like it was?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO WATER THINGS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Cowles was not stunned at all by the show. It went exactly as
she had planned.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, she had called Tate with a warning about the
anxieties around Cane River. She told him that blacks had been
feeling uncomfortable about slave re-enactments. She also told him
that the direct descendants of Magnolia's original family would be
in the audience, along with some of the town's powerful
preservationists. She did not ask Tate to change the content in any
way. But be sure, she cautioned him, that none of the stories
appear to reflect the lives of Cane River slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot that went unsaid,'' Tate recalled. ``But I got
the clear impression that she was feeling pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   After the performance, they discussed the surprise ending to the
Luther story. It did not, they acknowledged, reflect the reality of
life for most slaves, who were beaten or separated from their
families for seeking education.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was not a complete lie. The truth is that there is
no one truth to slavery. It was different from state to state,
plantation to plantation. Tate had documents about a slave whose
masters had taught him to read and write, and others about a slave
beaten by whites when discovered reading a paper. In using that
first slave as raw material for the Luther story, Tate said, he was
concerned more with whites like Hertzog than blacks like Vercher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the ones who can't handle the truth,'' Tate said,
crouching over his plate and lowering his voice. ``Isn't it the
same for all black people, that we have to be careful to make white
people comfortable?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to economics,'' Tate said. ``Whites still
control most museums and historical parks. Unless black people
start putting more money into these places, then we will never
really be able to have control.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowles added, ``If you make them uncomfortable, they'll shut you
down.''

COMMENTARY: KEEPING HIS DISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush chose to stay away from the state convention
of the Texas Republican Party last week. If you were trying to sell
yourself to American voters as a sane, moderately conservative
candidate for president, you'd have stayed away, too.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the nation is not nearly ready for the zany
extremism of the Republican Party in Bush's home state. The
convention was held in Houston, and here are just a few of the
items in the platform adopted by the delegates:
</P>
<P>
   _The income tax and the Internal Revenue Service should be
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   _All minimum wage laws should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   _The Social Security system should be phased out entirely.
</P>
<P>
   _All U.S. participation in the United Nations should come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North American Free Trade Agreement should be repealed and
the United States should withdraw from the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal monetary system should return to the gold
standard.
</P>
<P>
   They're serious. The hard right rides at a gallop in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush thought it would be prudent to steer clear of Houston while
the convention was under way. He spent his time traveling and
raising campaign cash in New England, Ohio, Kentucky and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It may be odd for a governor to skip the convention of his own
state party but Republican politicians in Texas seemed to
understand that the potential for embarrassment was great, and it
was probably better for Bush to keep his distance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, even as a national controversy was developing over
the planned execution of Gary Graham, the Texas Republicans
asserted in their platform that ``capital punishment should be
swift and unencumbered.''
</P>
<P>
   Another item in the platform declared that ``homosexual behavior
is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that have been
ordained by God.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates would not let the Texas Log Cabin Republicans set
up an information booth inside the convention hall. So the group
rented a 25-foot air-conditioned van and drove it around the
convention center for three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lots of claps and thumbs up,'' said Steve Labinski, the
state president of the gay Republican group.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush's wife, Laura, spoke at the convention, and Bush
told the delegates, in a videotaped statement: ``I really don't
like missing my first Texas state Republican convention since
1990.''
</P>
<P>
   That may have been true. But he would have liked even less being
badgered by reporters about whether he agreed with some of the
wackier aspects of the convention and its platform _ and whether he
would fight his party (in Texas or in Congress) whenever he held an
opposing view.
</P>
<P>
   Governor, do you agree that we should get rid of the minimum
wage? Governor, what would happen to retirees if Social Security
were phased out altogether? Governor, how would the federal
government be financed if we scrapped the income tax? Governor, do
you think we should go back on the gold standard? Isn't that, um, a
half-baked idea?
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, the governor made it clear that he wanted
nothing to do with the Texas Republican Party platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' said the spokesman. ``Those
interested in Governor Bush's positions and platforms should listen
to Governor Bush on the campaign trail, or listen to him at the
National Republican Convention this summer. He is running on his
own positions and agenda items, on issues like improving education,
economic opportunity and national defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state party platform, which the governor was not involved
in drafting, was created by approximately 8,000 delegates and
should be viewed as a broad statement of philosophy. But, again,
for those interested in the Bush agenda, they should pay attention
to Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Other high-profile Texan Republicans, including Sens. Phil Gramm
and Kay Bailey Hutchison, attended the convention and made
speeches. But, of course, they're not running for president.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican who is running for president ran as far
from the weirdness of his own party's convention as he could get.
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: SOUTH SIDE GETS TO STRUT IN CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dispensing with Western Union, Al Capone sent a message to Bugs
Moran. It was delivered on Valentine's Day 1929, from Capone's
South Side headquarters in Chicago to his chief gangland rival in
the city, Moran, on the North Side. The word ``dispatch'' was
obviously taken in a literal sense by the South Siders, who lined
up seven of Moran's operatives in a garage on North Clark Street
and then riddled them with 90 bullets from submachine guns,
shotguns and revolvers.
</P>
<P>
   This comes to mind because the South Side of Chicago is again in
the news, as the White Sox _ whose home base, Comiskey Park, is
just a handful of fungo hits from Big Al's old headquarters _ are
wiping out the opposition, though, in a bloodless manner. The White
Sox are the hottest team in baseball, with the best record, and
play host to the Yankees this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of town, meanwhile, the Cubs continue in their
bewildered ways, finding that their struggle to reach .500 is as
daunting as Hercules cleaning the Augean stables, or at least
trying to find a public toilet in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet comparisons appear inevitable between the White Sox and
their century-old rival, the North Side Cubs. Fandom in Chicago has
traditionally been bitterly and passionately divided _ the way it
was with Dodger and Giant fans in New York. I grew up on the West
Side of Chicago, which might have been thought a middle ground, but
this particular pocket of Lawndale was very much tendentiously Cub.
Everyone there knew who the White Sox fan living in our midst was _
and Rosenfeld was rarely seen on the street after dark. In
contrast: the sister of the fine Chicago sportswriter, Bill
Gleason, from a South Side home, once accepted a free ticket to a
Cubs game in Wrigley Field. The Gleasons' father told her: ``It's
worse than if you left the church.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that the Cubs, on the leafy North Side, are
quiche and white wine, while the Sox, in the often less swanky
districts, are kielbasa and draft beer. Not completely. I am aware
of Sox fans who own yachts in Belmont Harbor, and Cub fans who work
outdoors for the Department of Streets and Sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Wednesday night's game, the Sox had won 14 of their
last 16 games, their record stood at 45-25, for a .643 winning
percentage, and they were seven-and-a-half games ahead of the
Cleveland Indians, the team they have been chasing for the last
five seasons without success, as the Indians captured the American
League Central Division each time.
</P>
<P>
   And before losing Tuesday night to Cleveland, 4-1, the Sox had
won eight straight games _ in remarkable fashion. They went to
Cleveland and swept three games, then moved on to Yankee Stadium
where they embarrassed the defending champs in a four-game sweep.
Back in Comiskey Park on Monday, they whipped Cleveland again.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular, and unexpected, doesn't stop there. It is
virtually axiomatic in baseball that the teams that spend a lot of
money on players win the bulk of the games. The Yankees, for
example, the team with the highest payroll _ $92.5 million this
year _ won the World Series last season. Seven of the
highest-payroll teams were among the eight in the playoffs last
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the White Sox, with a payroll of $31 million, stand 26th out
of the 30 teams in the major leagues in cash doled to their
on-field laborers. The White Sox have some brilliant young players,
made some trades that _ heavily criticized at first _ proved a
boon, have a few veterans like Frank Thomas who have rediscovered
themselves, and a bespectacled, level-headed manager, Jerry Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the first day of their current homestand, and playing
Cleveland, the White Sox drew a near sellout crowd of 43,062. This
from a team that had been averaging about 21,000 a game. It helped,
obviously, that it was ``Family Half-Price Night,'' all tickets
selling for 50 percent of face value. The next night, at full fare,
20,000 fans showed up for the Indians' game, leaving half the park
empty. The Cubs are again playing to crowds of 33,000 a game, close
to capacity, with few promotions. Fact is, the attraction is purely
Wrigley Field, that ivy-dripping jewel nestled in a gentrified
precinct. The Sox play in a charmless new stadium located in an
industrial setting. They remain one of the poorest drawing teams in
baseball. The belief here is, if players changed ballparks and
beanies, attendance would remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   But now if fans in Chicago want something more thrilling than to
just watch ivy grow, Capone's old 'hood has become the place to
be. &QL;

FIDELITY MAKES MOVES AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Investments announced a top-level management
shakeup Wednesday that reflects the broadening reach for the
world's largest mutual fund company _ and suggests that chief
executive Edward C. Johnson III is finally getting ready to pass
the baton to his daughter, Abigail.
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard at Fidelity, which manages a
staggering $930 billion in assets, included the promotion of Robert
L. Reynolds, 48, and Robert C. Pozen, 53, who will both join
Johnson's trusted lieutenant James C. Curvey as vice chairmen.
Reynolds, credited with cultivating Fidelity's 401(k) business,
will take over from Curvey as chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the three-man team was seen as a power-sharing
arrangement to help keep a handle on Fidelity's core businesses:
the burgeoning retirement business, individual brokerage accounts,
and capital investing. But Fidelity watchers say the troika also
will help Johnson, 70, ease away from the day-to-day details of the
business. It could also serve as an intermediary link to a future
under Abigail Pierrepont Johnson, 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be the senior senators, all reporting to Caesar. But
Abby will need her own senior senators if eventually she takes
over,'' said James H. Lowell, editor of company-tracking Fidelity
Investor newsletter. ``They are in a generation between Abby and
Ned, and that makes a nice bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity also could be setting itself up for a sale or merger
with another major financial services company, some analysts said,
although Fidelity executives dimissed that notion Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the changes do not pave the way for a merger or the
anticipated succession, they are still seen as significant for the
investment giant. ``Today I think they are telling the world they
are a full-service financial institution,'' said Lowell. ``They are
tacitly acknowledging that the mutual-fund business has matured,
and that to grow, there have got to be other revenue pipelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The family-owned Fidelity has been one of the great American
success stories of the end of the 20th century, helping spark the
revolution that made investing America's favorite pastime over the
last two decades. The company made ``Peter Lynch'' and ``Magellan''
household terms and controls the money of millions of average
investors through individual or 401(k) accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity dominates the mutual fund market so completely that it
recovered quickly from investing stumbles and administrative snafus
in the '90s did not slow what Fidelity-watcher Eric M. Kobren calls
the ``mind-boggling'' flow of cash pouring into the company.
Management fees alone on almost $1 trillion helped spur record
profits last year of a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's built-in. The money just keeps on coming in day after
day,'' said Kobren, editor of the newsletter Fidelity Insights, a
money manager himself, and like Lowell, a past employee of
Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's assets under management increased 84 percent, to
$952.5 billion, from 1997 to 2000. Net sales, revenue, and
operating income also increased dramatically. During the same
period, the company grew from 24,000 to 30,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity also moved quickly to capture a significant portion of
the online trading business, creating its Powerstreet online
brokerage Web site and moving customer investment activity
seamlessly over to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment of riches has created its own difficulties,
however. One problem is employee retention, as money managers in a
bull market use Fidelity as a training ground and then leave for a
lucrative hedge fund. Another problem is the basic issue of
managing a high-growth business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has recognized it cannot rely on the retail mutual
fund business for its future, that they've got to cast a very wide
net,'' said Lowell. ``But that means a management nightmare. They
own 75 percent of the retirement sales market _ that's a huge
management issue. They've got a lot of management issues tied with
their desire to hold onto assets and to grow assets.''
</P>
<P>
   To guide the change in focus from mutual funds to a
broader-based financial services firm, Reynolds is seen as a
classic, lead-the-charge manager. Reynolds, a 16-year Fidelity
veteran who will oversee distribution and service in his new role,
also has expertise in the high-growth retirement business, as head
of Fidelity Investments Institutional Retirement Group since March
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement business that Reynolds headed will be
restructured, so that Peter J. Smail will run the separate Fidelity
Employer Services Co. and Ellyn A. McColgan will run the Tax-Exempt
Services Co., Fidelity also announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a business that has grown very rapidly,'' Reynolds
said in an interview. Fidelity handles the retirement accounts for
9,000 companies nationally and 9 million individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But Reynolds said his elevation to chief operating officer was
not a direct reflection of the importance of that part of the
business, and added that the three main segments of the business _
capital investing, retirement, and retail _ were all equally
important. ``The future of Fidelity and the success of this firm is
dependent on those three separate areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Pozen, a 13-year Fidelity veteran, will continue as investment
adviser for Fidelity's storied mutual funds _ still the foundation
of the business. Pozen, who will continue as president of Fidelity
Management &AMP; Research Co., is known for being direct, a balance for
Reynolds' consensus-building skills.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Curvey, who some thought might retire, will return to
manage Fidelity Capital and Ventures, which he ran before being
tapped by Johnson to be president and chief operating officer in
1997. Curvey will oversee that part of the business including the
successful telecommunications group; the real estate development
arm that has financed the renovation of Boston's World Trade Center
and the construction of a hotel and office buildings on the
burgeoning South Boston Waterfront; BostonCoach, the executive
limousine business; and Community Newspaper Co., which operates a
chain of daily and weekly newspapers in Eastern Massachusetts. At
64, Curvey is seen as being a steady voice of wisdom and an
important link to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The division of labor among Reynolds, Pozen, and Curvey reflects
the need to keep tabs on the sprawling and upward-spiraling aspects
of the business, analysts said. But another solution would be to
reach the next level in Fidelity's long evolution: a spinoff or
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Management complexities and pressure on the employee base
``could put pressure on them to go public with a Wells Fargo, spin
off the distribution arm and go public with a retail brokerage
entity,'' said Kobren. ``The other option is if Ned feels they
would be better off with a large international financial services
firm, a merger on the level of Smith Barney- Citigroup.''
</P>
<P>
   There have also been reports of strengthened ties with Lehman
Bros., but Fidelity executives downplayed that possibility. ``To be
successful today you do have to have alliances . . . we're looking
for new ones, but no acquisitions are planned,'' said Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to acquire anybody, we're not going to be
acquired, we're going to stay private, we're a very stable
organization,'' said Pozen. International expansion is being
accomplished through internal growth, ``not trying to acquire a
firm in the international market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for succession plans, Curvey said that there were ``no
present plans for Ned to retire. He's very much involved in the
game, very young, very energetic, and still has a good time.'' He
said that splitting the business into three parts would give
Johnson a convenient, ``broader coverage of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning Abigail Johnson, Pozen said she will continue as a
trustee and senior vice president at the investment arm, working
with portfolio managers, and that ``this . . . doesn't impact that
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kobren said the changes could be seen as an intermediary step,
such that the father and daughter would not change their roles very
much at all _ at least not immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ned's not going to leave his baby,'' Kobren said. ``What he
has done is give Jim Curvey more responsibility as his trust grew,
and now he has show his trust in Pozen and Reynolds. Abigail has a
family to raise, is content to work on the investment side, and I
suspect will remain in that capacity, not putting in seven days a
week or becoming a leader on a day-to-day basis.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Kobren said, ``she doesn't have to.''

SYDNEY OLYMPICS TURNS TO DNA INK TO MARK OFFICIAL SOUVENIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By DANIEL SORID    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   High technology is nothing new for the Olympics. From
finish-line computers to drug tests, the Olympic committee has
often been an early adopter. This summer, technology will come into
play where it really matters: the sale of souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the sale of counterfeit items at the Olympics, the
Sydney Olympics organizing committee is using ink containing DNA to
mark official merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   DNA Technologies of Los Angeles developed the ink, which
contains copies of DNA strands from an Australian athlete who has
not been identified as well as a chemical that can be easily
identified with an optical scanner.
</P>
<P>
   DNA Technologies has developed inks, invisible or colored, for
about a dozen companies; in some cases, the DNA strands used have
come from celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   For the Olympic souvenirs, the special ink is placed either
directly on the goods or on a tag attached to them. If an Olympic
official suspects that a product is not authentic, the product can
be scanned on the spot as a preliminary check. To check the DNA,
the product can be sent to the company for an analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike holograms, which can be copied, DNA ink is virtually
counterfeit-proof, said Chris Outwater, the chief executive of DNA
Technologies, because DNA, which contains a person's genetic code,
is so complex.
</P>
<P>
   Making the DNA tags is fairly straightforward. According to
Outwater, a DNA sample is taken with either a blood sample or a
swab of the mouth, and that DNA is copied many times. Some DNA is
kept as an identifier, and some is mixed into the ink that is
placed on the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need a small fragment,'' Outwater said, ``to give us
enough complexity to stop any counterfeiter or bad person from
trying to copy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outwater said there was one chance in a trillion that a
counterfeiter would be able to duplicate a tag because each DNA
string used is made up of at least 20 ``beads''; each bead can be
one of four molecules. Even if counterfeiters knew that the pieces
of DNA in the ink were from a particular person's DNA, they would
still have to figure out what part of the DNA had been used as a
tag. Outwater gave this analogy: ``You're standing out in front of
the New York Public Library, and you say to the counterfeiter, `I'm
using one sentence out of one book in that library. You figure it
out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Or counterfeiters could presumably clone the DNA in the tags to
make their own version of the real ink. But Dr. Rick Tullis, a
consultant to the company, said that would not be feasible because
the DNA can be treated to make it hard to copy and other pieces of
DNA can be included in the solution to foil counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
   Why go to so much effort? The sale of official merchandise at
the Sydney Olympics is expected to reach $36 million, according to
the Sydney Olympics organizing committee. That money, the committee
says, is used to finance Olympic programs. And in one example of
the severity of the problem with counterfeit products, the Customs
Service points out that counterfeit products cost the United States
economy around $200 billion a year, more than the annual gross
domestic product of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The technique used by Outwater's company, which received a
contract with the Sydney Olympics organizers in 1998, is not
perfected. While the company is making enough DNA tags to mark
about 10 million souvenir items for the Olympics, it does not have
a handheld device that can verify beyond a doubt that a product is
authentic. Authorities doing spot checks of vending areas cannot
test for the DNA itself, Outwater said. To do that, the inspector
must send the item to DNA Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Outwater says the instant checks have been adequate for the
company's customers in the last two years _ no customer has
actually sent an item to DNA Technologies for a DNA analysis.
</P>
<P>
   DNA Technologies has made DNA tags for more than just the
Olympics. It used DNA tags to mark Mark McGwire's 70th-home-run
ball and to protect movie props at Warner Brothers that ``tend to
walk off the lot,'' Outwater said. Warner Brothers hopes that the
tags will help the company identify stolen items that are offered
for sale.

   As more companies turn to the Internet to sell consumer
merchandise, there will be a greater push for anti-counterfeit
measures like DNA tagging, Outwater said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little more scary to be on the Internet in some virtual
store and not know exactly what you're buying,'' he said. With DNA
tags, he contended, ``you're going to know that this is an
authentic product.''

RSC, `MACBETH': FIERCE KINDRED SPIRITS, BURNING FOR A THRONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.)

<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Their glittering, too-open eyes are scary, so
luminous that you expect them to glow in the dark. But while the
usual witches and ghosts are in attendance, it is something less
supernatural that gives this power couple's gaze its intensity in
the Royal Shakespeare Company's thrilling new production of
``Macbeth,'' which runs through Sunday at the Long Wharf Theater
here.
</P>
<P>
   Come now, you've seen the look that beams so unnervingly from
the faces of Antony Sher and Harriet Walter, the show's splendid
stars, and if you're a New Yorker, you encounter it daily. It's a
ravenous, lusty look that even the most sycophantic smile can't
camouflage. Stronger than any sex drive, it is pure, simple
ambition, and these Macbeths are positively drunk on it.
</P>
<P>
   Without making the obvious bids for topical relevance, the
director, Gregory Doran, has shaped Shakespeare's tale of regicide
and its discontents into a harrowing and disturbingly funny parable
for the dawn of the 21st century. This ``Macbeth,'' which bears
scant resemblance to the stodgy oratorical exercise now on Broadway
under the same name, finds its taking-off point in its
protagonist's declaration that he has ``only vaulting ambition,
which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Though Macbeth famously never finishes that sentence, this
adrenaline-pumping interpretation amply fills in the blank,
carefully and vigorously charting the landscape where leaping
ambition finally falls. That's the realm of madness of course, but
I have never seen a ``Macbeth'' that makes such a specific and
convincing case for its leading lord and lady's increasingly
demented behavior as a natural outgrowth of their characters as we
first see them.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful what you wish for. Truman Capote, a devoted
chronicler of people with warping appetites, spent his life
accumulating evidence of the wisdom of that warning. Not that these
Macbeths have any choice in the matter. Their compulsiveness and
their bottomless need to reach the throne are all too evident long
before King Duncan (Trevor Martin) is slain.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the moment when Macbeth _ freshly covered
with laurels from his triumphs on the battlefield _ appears at an
assembly where the king announces his successor. Sher puffs himself
like a nominee on Oscar night, clearly in anticipation of hearing
his own name. And the winner is, alas, the king's son, Malcolm. For
a sharp second, this Macbeth appears to have had the wind knocked
out of him. But then, like many an Oscar loser, he is the first to
lead the applause with a hearty smile.
</P>
<P>
   In like manner, when we first see Walter's Lady Macbeth, reading
aloud a letter from her husband, she runs through the text with a
breathless sexual urgency; when she comes to the word ``king,'' in
reference to the witches' prophecies for her husband, she can't
even speak it at first, she's so excited. Ooo baby, we're almost
there.
</P>
<P>
   Sher and Walter are much celebrated for their vital portraiture
on the London stage. ( Sher, the better known in the States,
appeared indelibly on Broadway several seasons ago in ``Stanley.'')
The intensity they bring to the murderous thane and his wife isn't
surprising in itself. What is, is how they are able to begin at an
improbable fever pitch and then keep growing hotter, moving
imaginatively forward when you think they have reached a dead end.

EXPERIMENTAL SELF-REPAIR OF MOUSE BRAINS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Scientists say they have succeeded in activating an
overlooked self-repair system that enables animal brains, and
potentially those of humans, to make new nerve cells and heal
themselves from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable finding topples long-held beliefs that the brain
has no way to fix itself, and could open a new route to treating
everything from Alzheimer's disease to strokes.
</P>
<P>
   For now, researchers can not try the strategy in humans: They
had to kill brain cells in the experimental mice to switch on their
brains' nerve-generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers are hunting for other methods, such as
drugs, that could to turn on the hidden maintenance kit in the
brain. The discovery is ``enticing,'' said researchers commenting
on the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long way to go,'' wrote Drs. Anders Bjorklund and
Olle Lindvall of Lund University in Sweden, but learning how to
switch on the repair system ``might eventually lead to a powerful
tool for brain repair in human disorders of the central nervous
system,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   The prominent Swedish brain researchers made the comments in an
article accompanying the report in the current issue of Nature. The
report is by Dr. Jeffrey Macklis, an associate professor of
neurology and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School and Children's
Hospital, and his colleagues, Sanjay Magavi and Blair Leavitt.
Magavi, a graduate student, should be credited as the ``motive
force'' in the study, Macklis said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are the latest in a string of intriguing
discoveries in the past few years about ``neural stem cells,''
previously unrecognized immature cells that can generate all the
major types of cells in the brain. Already, scientists have cured
mice of some severe brain disorders by implanting neural stem cells
into their brains.
</P>
<P>
   It had been long thought that the brain was incapable of
changing or repairing its nerve circuits once it had fully
developed. In fact, people were thought only to lose nerve cells as
they aged. Scientists believed that was a product of evolution in
which the brain was prevented from making new nerve cells, or
neurons, after childhood because cell growth would increase the
chances of making harmful neural connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that this view isn't correct,'' said Macklis.
Several years ago, researchers showed that neurons could make
connections, and then, more recently, neural stem cells than can
generate the major all kinds of neurons were discovered and
isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Macklis said in an interview that in two areas of the more
primitive part of mammals' brains, neural stem cells are known to
generate new neurons, though not in great numbers, in response to
damage. But it seemed the cells could not make neurons in the
higher-function parts of the brain, like the cerebral cortex.
</P>
<P>
   The researchersattempted to see whether the neural stem cells,
also called neural precursors, could move to the cerebral cortex
and generate neurons to fix damage there.
</P>
<P>
   To test this idea, Macklis and his colleagues injected a
light-sensitive chemical into a certain area of brains of adult
mice. Two weeks later they opened the skulls and shined a light on
that tiny area, and the activated chemical caused hundreds of
thousands of neurons to commit suicide, a process called apoptosis.
</P>
<P>
   The death of these neurons caused the neural stem cells to
become active, to migrate to the damaged brain area, to turn into
the correct type of neurons, and make long-distance connections to
the proper places, Macklis said. Their repair route took them only
a fraction of a millimeter, ``but that's a long way for a nerve
cell'' in a mouse brain, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The goal now, said Macklis, is to discover what signals are
received by the neural stem cells to summon them. That might enable
scientists to design drugs that would recruit the neural stem cells
and, it is hoped, make it possible ``to do the repair from the
inside'' of the brain rather than needing cell implants.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Sanberg, chair of neuroscience at the University of
South Florida, termed the work ``very important.'' But he added,
``the question will be how much neurogenesis will you see in
response to large injuries in clinical studies?'' Neurogenesis is
the creation of neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorklund and Lindvalle, in their commentary, said, ``These
cells might represent a dormant capacity for neuronal repair,'' but
pointed out that in the mouse experiment only a small fraction of
damaged neurons were replaced by the stem cells. ``It is
inconceivable'' that such a small number of nerve cells ``would
allow significant functional recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   However, they agreed that finding the signals that recruit the
repair cells will be key, because those signals might turn out to
be restarting a repair process that occurs in the brain during
early development and which might lead to better treatments for
brain disorders.

 NEW HAVEN, Conn.: dead end.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entire production, in New Haven as part of the International
Festival of Arts and Ideas, sustains a martial urgency that only
rarely slackens, underscored with propulsive drum-driven music by
Adrian Lee. In keeping with the suffocating nighttime imagery woven
throughout the tragedy, the evening begins in utter darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The chanting weird sisters (Diane Beck, Noma Dumezweni, Polly
Kemp) who begin the play are at first only seen, not heard:
whispering, as it were, in our ears. The first visual image is of
soldiers and of a bloodied man hurled into their midst as if by a
catapult. The image is apt, since the news this man bears, of
Macbeth's bloody successes on the field, sets off a missile that
won't self-destruct until the evening's end, and perhaps not even
then.
</P>
<P>
   Sher's Macbeth is introduced as a revved-up conquering hero,
borne on the shoulders of his comrades, instead of making the
customary entrance with no one but Banquo (Ken Bones). This Macbeth
is the image of the popular soldier: rowdy, virile, collegial.
</P>
<P>
   He's a brusque, blunt-spoken type, and if you asked him, he
would probably tell you he is not by nature introspective. (He
treats his horror-conjuring imagination as an unwanted guest.) What
makes him stand out from the crowd is his energy, which burns a
shade too bright for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Walter's designing Lady is, correspondingly, a bundle of
electromagnetic nerves, and it makes sense that when these two
reunite, a statewide blackout follows. While some interpretations
present Lady Macbeth as the prime motivator of the crimes to come,
this production makes it clear that the spouses share, er, strong
common interests.
</P>
<P>
   Like many couples they have a seesaw relationship of support:
when one's down, the other's up. That is, until the final acts,
when they both come spectacularly unglued.
</P>
<P>
   Doran and his team ensure that their production is not only a
portrait of a marriage. Whereas I often leave a ``Macbeth'' hard
pressed to remember who played whom in the supporting cast, this
version offers a gallery of cleanly and specifically defined
characters, not all of whom are immune to the plague of
o'ervaulting ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Bones' tough, shrewd Banquo, for example, clearly has his own
mighty thirst for regal glory, a trait made to figure ominously in
the evening's final tableau. And in that usually tedious scene in
which the exiled Malcolm (John Dougall) and Macduff (a Sam
Shepard-like Nigel Cooke) discuss the traits required for kingship,
you get the idea that the passive, pure Malcolm doesn't really have
what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brimson Lewis' set designs and Tim Mitchell's lighting
conspire to create a world in which a Grand Guignol darkness
dominates and the fantasy of majesty glows with ecclesiastic
mystery. Simple props are used to resonant poetic effect: a child's
pacifier, military medals and, particularly, the king's crown.
Notice also the use of Macduff's dagger in the climactic fight with
Macbeth.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few elements that feel overdone. Making the drunken
porter an audience-baiting comic in the manner of the M.C. from
``Cabaret'' breaks the play's rhythm in unwelcome ways, though
Stephen Noonan handles the part expertly. And Sher, whose Macbeth
later assumes a gangsterish menace that recalls Bob Hoskins at his
most splenetic, may be a shade too bogus in his rhetorical
lamentations after the body of Duncan is discovered.
</P>
<P>
   These are very small sins. In the big moments this ``Macbeth''
delivers grandly. Both the sleepwalking scene, rendered as an
autistic frenzy by Walter, and the ``tomorrow and tomorrow''
monologue, to which Sher brings a simple, all-flattening nihilism,
have the painful, grotesque immediacy of lanced blisters. Even more
impressive, you are always aware of the chain of emotional logic
that has brought these two to this jagged point.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's boldest moment, both its darkest and its
brightest, comes when Macbeth and his lady, weary with the burdens
of monarchy and murder, agree that all they really need is a good
night's sleep. Sleep? The very word sends them into paroxysms of
laughter that fleetingly confirm the couple's bond as kindred
souls. Maintaining power, as any CEO or magazine editor will tell
you, is a full-time job. There's no rest for the super-successful.

FIGHTING FOR POSSESSION OF PLANET KRIG-7B 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER OLAFSON

<P>
   Ground Control; published by Sierra Studios; $49.95; for Windows
95 and 98; for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there is supposed to be half the fun, but in the popular
genre of real-time strategy games, getting there can sometimes seem
like work.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatched to a destination by the player, vehicles may bump up
against stationary objects encountered en route and stop. They
wander into cul-de-sacs and can't escape. They push against
unclimbable cliffs. They bunch up at corners, looking less like
fearsome military units than tourists consulting a map. This is
supposed to be fun?
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Studios' Ground Control, it is. This three-dimensional
strategy game, developed by Sweden's Massive Entertainment, offers
spectacular graphics, compelling weapons, simple controls and a
manageable structure. But Ground Control is equally instructive in
the importance of the routine but vital business of moving through
the game environment. It is so lifelike and seamless that simply
being in the game is its own reward.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 2419, Ground Control casts the player as Sarah Parker, of
the Crayven Corp., which is fighting the Order of the New Dawn for
control of the planet Krig-7b.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a small force of lightly armored vehicles, Parker
performs tasks common to games of this type: Destroy a convoy,
level an enemy base or claim an alien artifact. Unlike games that
often require the player to collect resources and build new units,
the player in Ground Control is typically limited to the forces
deposited on the planet's surface at the start of a mission.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on fighting is realistic and helps keep the controls
blissfully simple. You select units with the mouse, indicate their
destination and off they go _ in a formation and with a combat
posture you assign.
</P>
<P>
   The main vehicle is the armored personnel carrier, from which
the player runs the show. It can re-charge depleted units nearby
and transport infantry. If it is destroyed, the mission ends and
you will have to restart from the beginning. (Progress is
automatically saved at the end of each completed mission, but no
provision is made for saving during a mission.)
</P>
<P>
   Combat is a vivid experience. The shells from a mobile artillery
unit arrive thunderously at their target, transforming durable
enemy outposts into blackened ruins with tilted defense turrets.
These bright detonations seem real and carry such a feeling of
omnipotence that I invariably stopped whatever else I was doing in
the game just to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I found myself watching Ground Control a lot. I found
it exhilarating just to see my units on the move _ whether
exploring a jungle or just trundling along an open plain. You can
jump to any unit _ indeed, you can adjust the game camera at will _
and there is always a sense of anticipation and threat.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the artillery unit moves like the real thing,
leaving a dust cloud and tread marks in its wake. It lumbers behind
the other forces and, unescorted, can fall prey to enemy patrols.
With each shot, the unit recoils and ejects a shell casing. The
shells leave a feathery vapor trail as they arc through the air.
Seeing them feels ominous, even when you are not on the receiving
end.
</P>
<P>
   And the unit goes where it is ordered. Ground Control's
``path-finding'' _ the artificial intelligence that instructs your
units how to negotiate terrain to reach a new location _ manages to
carry out its tasks with realism that is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the scenario in which Parker was assigned to defend the
approaches to a base. I broke my force into three groups, and sent
the personnel carrier with the weakest group. As I watched the unit
move into position, I saw another climbing a hill. It moved
speedily and with a smooth assurance, as though it had been born to
the task, and I wondered to whom it could belong. Then I realized
it was one of my units.
</P>
<P>
   All my units ran into trouble and were ordered to abandon the
base and withdraw with any usable equipment to a pick-up point to
the northeast. I panicked and, rather than micro-managing the
withdrawal, I just selected each unit and moved them en masse
toward their destination. The amazing thing was that, despite a
landscape rife with nooks and crannies with the potential to
ensnare units, most of them made it. (Some were shot up along the
way.) As enemy units poured into the base, the tattered remnants of
my forces, under a rain of fire, finally converged in a deep canyon
leading to the evacuation zone.
</P>
<P>
   In another game, that might have been an invitation to a traffic
jam. But there was no traffic jam. The units did not get lost. They
did not stop in unauthorized spots. They did not behave like
tourists. Instead, they rounded corners in smooth, continuous
movements. They followed each other at sensible intervals, and they
followed the terrain as though they knew it by heart. It made the
ordinary seem elegant and elegance seem easy. I cannot think of a
better definition of style.

 &HT;    No serious injuries in truck, train collision
 &HT;    By Andy Adams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A Union Pacific train derailed between Lufkin
and Burke on Wednesday morning after colliding with the trailer of
an 18-wheeler that was loaded with steel beams.
</P>
<P>
   The truck's driver, 31-year-old Herbert Orlando Echegoyen of
Houston, had pulled across the small Neyland Road railroad crossing
to turn the truck around, according to Texas Department of Public
Safety Senior Trooper Kevin Malone. Echegoyen was transporting the
steel to Lufkin Industries, but turned the wrong way off Loop 287
in Lufkin, the trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said witnesses to the accident claimed Echegoyen pulled
his truck across the tracks ``and just kind of sat there'' until
the train struck the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd backed up and kept backing, he'd have been OK,''
Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was seriously injured in the accident, although
47-year-old engineer Larry G. Cullins and 34-year-old conductor
Joseph T. Debruhl, both of Houston, were taken to the Memorial
Health System of East Texas for precautionary measures. Also, DPS
troopers said Echegoyen complained of back pains at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The train's eight locomotives piled up after they struck the
truck trailer, while Malone said the steel from the trailer ``kind
of looks like a roller coaster'' after it was bent in all different
directions from the impact. Sections of the railroad tracks also
were pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cullins said he was standing when he saw the 18-wheeler across
the railroad tracks in front of him, but that he and Debruhl hit
the floor of the locomotive and looked for something to hold onto
before impact. Cullins said the estimated 15 seconds of the crash
felt more like a million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they tell you that your life flashes before your eyes _
it does,'' the engineer said. ``It scared me, because I did not
know whether we were going to go sideways or stay upright or what.
It was scary. I feel very fortunate to have survived.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no railroad crossing signals or gates at Neyland Road
where it crosses the railroad tracks. But Smith said the truck
driver had at least a small amount of warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train was blowing his horn,'' she said. ``I mean, he was
sitting on that horn.''
</P>
<P>
   No chemicals were being transported by the train, although the
Lufkin Fire Department was called to spray foam on a large amount
of diesel fuel that spilled from the train's engines. The types of
rail cars being pulled behind the locomotives included box cars,
covered hoppers, gondolas and auto racks, but it was not
immediately known if any new cars were being transported.
</P>
<P>
   A railroad official at the scene said he could not comment on
the accident, but DPS Senior Trooper Bo Dunkin estimated that the
train was traveling upwards of 50 mph when it hit the trailer. He
said he believes locomotives have something that is similar to
black boxes in airplanes, and that railroad officials should be
able to determine train speed, its horn usage and other data about
the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The DPS troopers said Union Pacific officials were expected to
move some of the wreckage aside and fix the tracks as soon as
possible, since a high level of train traffic uses the rail line.
By early afternoon Wednesday, more than 100 employees of the
railroad and private companies were already working to clean up the
scene.

 &HT;    Labor plans forums to rip Bush record
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a bid to aid Vice President Al Gore, AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney is scheduling town hall meetings in cities
around the country to criticize Gov. George W. Bush's record on
labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   Planned for key battleground states, the town hall meetings are
designed to dampen enthusiasm for Bush among rank and file union
members. Support from labor voters, who typically turnout in higher
numbers than the general public, will be critical for Gore in a
dozen or more states where unions are strong.
</P>
<P>
   The first town hall meeting is scheduled June 29 in
Philadelphia, the site of the Republican National Convention, and
will feature union members from Texas, Bush's home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a below zero rating with us,'' Texas AFL-CIO
President Joe Gunn said of Bush. ``He's earned it. It hasn't been
accidental.''
</P>
<P>
   The town hall meetings come as Gore faces several challenges
within sectors of the 13 million-member labor organization.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters President James P. Hoffa, representing one of the
AFL-CIO's largest affiliates, has invited Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader to the Teamsters' executive board meeting in Washington
today.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Nader nor the Teamsters is calling the meeting an
endorsement, but Hoffa plans to hold a news conference with Nader
afterward, giving Nader plenty of free publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hoffa has made clear that he feels that the Teamsters have
been burned by the administration,'' said Laura Jones, a
spokeswoman for Nader. ``Mr. Nader is continuing to meet with labor
to discuss his platform and his commitment to labor issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Few give Nader any chance of winning the presidency, but he
could damage Gore by siphoning away the votes of some liberal and
union voters, especially in battleground states such as
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, whose members are
heavily concentrated in key Midwestern states, have declined to
endorse Gore. They also disagreed with Sweeney over the AFL-CIO's
decision to endorse Gore last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Both unions are angry with Gore because of the Clinton
administration's support for permanent normal trading relations
with China. The House voted to grant the trade status last month,
and a bill is awaiting action in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sweeney, Gore's most vocal backer in the labor movement, is
concerned that Gore's position on China could dampen turnout among
some union members. Labor leaders believe Democrats lost control of
the House in 1994 because union members, upset with the passage of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, voted in historically
lower numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said Gore's position on China would be an issue
throughout the campaign. ``We have members who are still bitter
over NAFTA, especially in the industrial states,'' Sweeney said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the AFL-CIO is devoting millions to a broad-based
political effort geared toward turning union members out to vote
for pro-labor candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message is to convince workers and their families that we
don't agree on everything with any candidate, and trade has been an
issue with Clinton and Gore,'' Sweeney said. ``But you have to look
at the total record, and you have to see how strong he is, in
Gore's case, on working family issues. . . . The thought of George
Bush, with his Texas record, is really horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Philadelphia, the AFL-CIO is planning town hall
meetings in Atlanta, Albuquerque, N.M., Chicago, Cleveland,
Hartford, Conn., Los Angeles and Louisville, Ky., with other cities
possible. All of the cities have significant numbers of union
workers.

THE ARTICLE AS BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lately it seems as if the tables of contents in magazines are
becoming the nonfiction shopping lists for book publishers. Just
within the last week, for instance, this fascination with magazine
cover stories has had publishers thrashing over those in Esquire
and The Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   In the July issue of Esquire, the cover article was about the
Worcester, Mass., warehouse fire last December in which six
firefighters died. The headline inside the magazine, although not
out front, was ``The Perfect Fire,'' an obvious knockoff of the
title of the best-selling Sebastian Junger book and George Clooney
movie ``The Perfect Storm.'' Within 24 hours the article was sold
to Warner Books for a sizable six-figure advance. Moreover, the
article, as it appeared in the magazine, was apparently considered
such a potent awareness builder for a full-length work that it was
sold without a book proposal or even an auction for potential
buyers. According to Variety the story is already ``sending
twitters'' around Hollywood. (The publisher, at least, promises the
book will have a fresh title.)
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Monthly's June issue had on its cover ``Harvard and
the Making of the Unabomber,'' and, after an auction, a book based
on it was sold to W.W. Norton for an advance of more than $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about turning magazine articles into books.
John Hersey's classic ``Hiroshima'' was first published as the
entire issue of The New Yorker in 1946 before becoming a Knopf
book; like it, Rachel Carson's 1962 book ``The Silent Spring''
(Houghton Mifflin) also first appeared in The New Yorker. More
recently, there is Michael Paterniti's soon-to-be-published
``Driving Albert'' (Dial Press), the true chronicle of conveying
Einstein's brain across the United States in a car trunk that first
appeared in Harper's; Jon Krakauer's ``Into Thin Air'' and ``Into
the Wild,'' (both Villard), grew from work in Outside magazine. But
The New Yorker still seems to be the best source. ``The Tipping
Point'' (Little, Brown), by Malcolm Gladwell, was an expansion of
an article in that magazine, and so, too, was Anthony Bourdain's
``Kitchen Confidential'' (Bloomsbury).
</P>
<P>
   The question really is whether these concepts would have as
quickly and as lucratively become books had they not been prominent
magazine articles and instead were peddled only through the
traditional method of authors' agents submitting written, often
lengthily, book proposals to editors and publishers. A book
proposal is the prospectus or the campaign map of a concept,
showing how the writer will attack the material, laying out in
almost diagnostic fashion what will be in the finished manuscript.
And it shows the author's mastery of material and writing style,
although it's not uncommon for a really good book writer to produce
a really terrible proposal. Which is one of the risks of the game.
</P>
<P>
   David Black, one of a few literary agents known for torturing
clients into writing the perfect proposal, sold Sean Flynn's story
of the Worcester inferno to Rick Horgan, an executive editor at
Warner Books without a proposal and without offering it to another
publisher. It's something he doesn't like to do. This was an
anomaly. ``Most magazines are running shorter pieces, rather than
longer ones,'' Black said, ``so you need a good proposal to develop
the blueprint for a book. In this case, the piece was long and
didn't need the transition. You got a lot of the framework.'' He
says a well-done proposal is not only a selling point but usually
leads to a well-done book: ``Most of my client list are
journalists, and most of them spend a lot of time developing
proposals before the book is sold.'' Often, of course, his clients
have both: a magazine article and a proposal. He said, ``With a
great proposal, you have a writer who has thought through the
larger themes; what they are presenting is a larger canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   Horgan of Warner Books said that ``the shorter magazine piece
makes the dramatic arch of the story visible, and sometimes the
conclusion you reach is that a magazine article is the best format
for that particular story.'' He said: ``Generally I want a
proposal, but this time it was obvious from the magazine article
that if the writer had more room to work with he could have layered
in more material, deeper characters. We did have a lengthy
conversation on how the book should be shaped.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing is a risk business involving, among many factors,
keeping one's eye on the competition. ``It's incumbent on editors
these days to take a flier once in a while,'' Horgan said. ``So I
decided to make a quick offer. I called David at 9:30 a.m. last
Tuesday, and we had a deal in principal in place by 2 p.m. We both
took a risk. You can get carried away in the fray of an auction
while you're evaluating the competition. We have a saying here that
sometimes he who wins the auction loses.
</P>
<P>
   Over at W.W. Norton, its editor in chief, Starling Lawrence, had
a proposal on Alston Chase's story of Theodore Kaczynski, the
Unabomber, from Chase's agent, Deborah Grosvenor. It elaborated on
the Atlantic article and offered material not in it, including
information about Kaczynski's sexual history that goes somewhat
beyond the court records of the case, which revealed that he had
considered a sex-change operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal also showed the direction in which a book would
grow from a magazine article, how Alston would attack the subject,
and what his insights are,'' Lawrence said. ``You always want to
see the thinking that makes a book from a magazine article.'' David
Hirshey, the executive editor of HarperCollins and the former
editor of Esquire, said that although ``it seems insane to pay out
so much based on a magazine piece, these articles can be very
seductive because it gives the book editor a tangible illustration
of what the book could turn out to be.'' But he added: ``It's much
like viewing a movie trailer. Often you see great trailers turned
into disappointing movies. The best of all possible worlds is a
great magazine piece and a proposal that says, `Here's what I
didn't say in the magazine and it's even better than what you
read.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are agents who encourage their clients to negotiate their
own magazine sales, because such sales take up too much time for 15
percent of relatively small fees. This will certainly change if the
trend from magazine cover into lucrative book deal gets even more
bullish. For if it does, the same material will then command not
one but two, more robust paydays; or even three, if there's a movie
at the end of the line.

 &HT;    White, chafing in retirement, reportedly talks with Titans
 &HT;    By Ken Sugiura

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Reggie White's career might have a second act.
</P>
<P>
   White, the NFL's career sacks leader who retired from the Green
Bay Packers after the 1998 season, has indicated interest in coming
back to the game.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in The Tennessean in Nashville on
Wednesday, White has spoken with Titans coach Jeff Fisher about how
he could be used by Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers hold White's contractual rights, but White's agent,
Jimmy Sexton, said Green Bay has allowed White to talk to other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that's happened is we've been given permission to talk to
a team,'' Sexton said. ``No offers have been made, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans media relations director Tony Wyllie said the team could
not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans look like a good possibility for a number of reasons.
White, 38, was born in Chattanooga and played for the University of
Tennessee. He played for Fisher when he was the Philadelphia
Eagles' defensive coordinator in 1989 and 1990. Perhaps most
important, the NFL on Tuesday upheld its suspension of Titans
defensive tackle Josh Evans for the season for a repeat violation
of the league's substance abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, however, don't have much room under the salary cap.
The team is $54,000 under the cap right now. Tennessee will have
Evans' $900,000 base salary because of the suspension, but the
Titans have not signed any of their draft picks and are negotiating
a contract extension with running back Eddie George. Furthermore,
White's 1998 base salary was $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   White's adjustment to retired life apparently hasn't been easy.
Sheri Tanner, a manager of Reggie White's All-Pro Shop in Green
Bay, said she wasn't surprised by the talk of a return.
</P>
<P>
   He has a home in Green Bay but didn't spend much time there last
fall because, Tanner said, ``He had a tough time'' being so close
to the game but not a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know at the time he did retire, he really wasn't happy about
retiring,'' she said. ``It was something his heart wasn't set on.''

&HT;     HUB OF TEXAS EXECUTIONS PREPAPES FOR THE WORST

   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ With convicted killer Gary Graham scheduled
to be put to death on Thursday, the home of Texas' execution
chamber is taking no chances. State prison officials expect
thousands to come to the Walls Unit downtown to protest the
execution, and some fear riots and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Stores, restaurants and businesses, including the courthouse,
plan to close after lunch Thursday, allowing their employees to
leave the area in advance of any protests.
</P>
<P>
   Activists from the United States and abroad have protested
Graham's scheduled execution, contending he did not get a fair
trial and may be innocent of the 1981 murder that landed him on
Texas' death row.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, now 36, was sentenced to death for the shooting and
robbery of Bobby Grant Lambert outside a Houston supermarket. The
testimony of one witness led to his conviction and no physical
evidence linked him to the crime. Two grocery store employees who
saw the suspect have said Graham was not the killer. They were
never called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's case has been through dozens of court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is expected to announce a
recommendation on Graham's application for clemency at noon, six
hours before he is scheduled to be put to death by lethal
injection. It will then be up to Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential hopeful, to act on the decision.
</P>
<P>
   In Huntsville, a town of 35,000 north of Houston, the Cafe Texan
has served as a meeting place for locals since it opened in 1936.
People who grew up here meet daily over their morning coffee and
newspaper to discuss current events. On Wednesday, the Graham
execution peppered many conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Located on the courthouse square, about three blocks from the
Walls Unit where executions are carried out, the Cafe Texan will
shut its doors at 2 p.m., six hours earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel confident we're not going to have any major
catastrophe of any sort,'' said John Strickland, owner of the cafe.
``I'm doing this for the precaution and safety of my employees. I'm
not even taking a chance on endangering them. I will stay here to
protect my property.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Henry, 45, isn't as optimistic as Strickland and wonders if
the police and prison officials will be able to handle a large
crowd of protesters _ especially if it becomes unruly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my home _ they don't know anything about rioting,''
said Henry, who works in the automotive business. ``It'll freak
Huntsville out. They don't know how to do it. They're as lost as a
goose.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Williams, who owns a framing gallery less than two blocks
away from the Walls Unit, said she would like to see the death
chamber moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Texas needs to take the responsibility to take
the execution (chamber) away from the town square. It's two blocks
from the hub of town,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Fitzgerald, spokesman for the prison system, said law
enforcement officials will be prepared to deal with a hostile
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking every possible precaution,'' he said. ``We've
been aware of all the events. We're taking the steps necessary to
ensure public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the agencies that will be involved in security are the
Department of Public Safety, Texas Department of Criminal Justice
and the police and sheriff's department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate any unruliness,'' Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Groups expected to protest represent both sides of the
controversial execution. Among those expected to protest against it
are the American Civil Liberties Union, Rainbow Coalition and
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials also are preparing to have another fight on
their hands _ Graham has vowed to physically resist the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not willingly participate in my lynching,'' he said in
a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said Graham would not be sedated, but officers in
riot gear would use tear gas if he resists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not treating Gary Graham any differently than we do any
other inmate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is what happens outside the prison walls that is of concern
to residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Huntsville will be outnumbered. I think it will be
lost,'' Henry said as he finished his morning coffee. ``Everyone's
on pins and needles. They want it to hurry up and be done.''

UNEARTHING SECRETS, FICTIONAL AND REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archaeology as a search for hidden truth is a central theme of
Michael Ondaatje's new novel, ``Anil's Ghost,'' and was very much
on his mind during a recent interview. ``Writing is a kind of
archaeological act,'' he said. ``In all my books there is a
discovery of a story. You're unearthing and you're learning. The
drama is to find out about the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   For him a novel is both intuitive and exploratory. He said that
when he begins a book he never knows the outcome or even the full
cast of characters. People suddenly appear, assume identities and
move the narrative forward. All this was true of ``The English
Patient,'' Ontaadje's Booker Prize-winning novel (and later an
Oscar-winning film), and it is true of ``Anil's Ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   In his novels Ondaatje writes about displaced persons, people
who are unsure of where they belong and to whom they owe their
allegiance: the title character and the Sikh demolitions expert in
``The English Patient,'' Anil Tissera and other characters in
``Anil's Ghost.'' Anil is a young forensic anthropologist who
returns from the United States to her homeland, Sri Lanka, on a
humanitarian mission. She joins forces with an archaeologist to
investigate possible war crimes. The principal subject of their
investigation is the skeleton of what appears to be a victim of
torture.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ondaatje is also a poet, his books are often called
poetic novels, a label he greets with dismay: ``I'm not sure I
would go out of my way to take poetic novels to a desert island.''
For him, the interplay between his poetry and his fiction is far
more subtle. ``William Carlos Williams talked about a poem as
something that didn't have any extra parts in it,'' he said. The
idea of distillation is carried over into his fiction. This means
that his novels are ``tighter, more contained, more suggestive.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time they are filled with haunting imagery. In
``Anil's Ghost'' Anil is told the story of the excavation of a
lacquered coffin of an ancient Chinese ruler, buried alongside 20
female musicians. The bodies were bones, but the musical
instruments _ drums, zithers, bells _ survived. In the fifth
century B.C. music was regarded as a moral and spiritual force.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense Anil is a stand-in for the author, who left Sri Lanka
at 11 and grew up in London, where his mother lived after
separating from his father. Later he emigrated to Canada. Now 56,
he is a Canadian citizen of Indian, Dutch and Sinhalese ancestry,
and the book represents his own homecoming to Sri Lanka. This is
the first of his four novels to take place in his native country,
he said, although he has dealt with it before in his poetry and in
his memoir, ``Running in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka is, in fact, the reason for the book. He began with a
place, a time and an event: a civil war in the mid 1980s. ``I
didn't want it to be a tract against Sri Lanka,'' he said. ``I
wanted to catch that state of the world, people in that kind of
situation, which was a nightmare.'' He intended his story to have
emanations of battles in other countries, like Bosnia and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not want to write about Sri Lanka from the point
of view of someone who lived there permanently. Instead he chose as
his protagonist ``someone who was a stranger but who had come from
that country.'' Anil's insights are shadowed by memories from her
childhood. To give an added perspective he decided to make the
protagonist a woman ``who had been liberated by living in the West
and was now in a country that was a male world.'' That choice, he
said, ``gave me an extra pair of glasses and allowed me to see the
place differently.''
</P>
<P>
   As Anil and the archaeologist, Sarath, investigate the mystery
of the unknown victim, they themselves and others in their lives
are revealed: ``The searchers, the detectives, are the ones who are
being discovered in the novel,'' Ondaatje said. ``We learn how they
have been created by their past.'' The ``real forensics'' in the
book are about these characters and Sarath's brother, and about an
artist who paints eyes on statues of Buddha but is forbidden to
look at the face of the deity.
</P>
<P>
   When Ondaatje began the book, all he knew about Sarath was that
he would be Anil's foil, that he would be more languid in contrast
to her enthusiasm and determination. At their first meeting, Sarath
is noncommittal, offering the equivalent of ``the Asian nod,''
which is a ``very hesitant head roll that means yes and no,'' the
author said. ``It's the kind of thing Henry James should have been
doing a lot of.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point the novel was a matter of accretion, growth and
constant revision. Ondaatje's own obsession is with revising, one
reason that it took him eight years to finish the novel, his first
since ``The English Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the incidents in the new book are drawn from fact;
others are invention, for example the astonishing adventure of a
surgeon who is kidnapped by rebels and forced to operate on the
wounded behind the lines. The rebels also kidnap a nurse and steal
medical supplies. The doctor soon finds himself totally caught up
in his rescue work.
</P>
<P>
   Everything of course is filtered through the author's
imagination, which often approaches that of such magic realists as
Gabriel Garcia Marquez. ``When I read Marquez for the first time,''
he said, ``it was like realism to me. It was like Sri Lanka.'' His
most Marquezian book is his memoir, a fanciful dream journey
through the lives of his parents and their relatives, eccentrics
including an uncle who was killed when a hunting companion mistook
him for a wild boar. In the memoir he says that from his mother he
received his sense of the dramatic, from his father secrecy and
reclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He also writes of strange Sri Lankan traditions: it is believed
that if a child eats the tongue of a thalagoya, a crocodile-like
reptile, he becomes brilliant. Ondaatje did not partake of this
``repulsive creature.'' But in his own way, without artificial
intelligence or training as a writer, he embarked on a brilliant
career in which his literary reputation is matched by his
popularity. Both ``The English Patient'' and ``Anil's Ghost'' are
best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Ondaatje, who went to Canada because his brother Christopher was
there, did not start writing until he was in his early 20s. ``I
didn't know I wanted to be a writer,'' he said. ``There hadn't been
a burning desire.'' But in Canada he felt a sudden freedom and a
realization that ``I could attempt anything, I could be a writer or
a filmmaker.'' (He has made two documentary films.)
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by a teacher at the University of Toronto, he began
writing poetry, which ranged from the domestic to the mythological.
His first book of poetry was published in 1967. In 1970 he wrote
``The Collected Works of Billy the Kid,'' which was part poem, part
historical novel, and was subsequently dramatized onstage. Since
then he has alternated between poetry and fiction. He and his wife,
Linda Spalding, live in Toronto, where they edit Brick, a literary
journal.
</P>
<P>
   His first novel, ``Coming Through Slaughter,'' inspired by the
life of the jazzman Buddy Bolden, was, he said, ``a mental
landscape, where you put yourself and real people into an imagined
situation.'' ``Anil's Ghost'' was different: fictional people on a
real landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone who has been very much a migrant in my life and as
a writer,'' he said, ``one of the things you envy is Faulkner's
postage stamp of Yoknapatawpha County or Alice Munro's southwest
Ontario. That is the opposite of me, but in some odd way in this
book, there is a landscape I knew very well.''

COLOMBIA DRUG PACKAGE NEARS VOTE IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After several months of delay, the Senate Wednesday
appeared headed toward approving a scaled-down $934 million version
of the Clinton administration's drug-fighting package for Colombia,
a vote that would ensure a major new US commitment in the Andean
nation's long war.
</P>
<P>
   By a 89-11 vote, the Senate first rejected an amendment that
would have taken $225 million earmarked for Colombia's military and
put into US drug-treatment programs, setting the stage for final
approval of the funds. A final vote is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate's plan, the money for Colombia will go to buy
transport helicopters, train Colombian military, provide regional
assistance, and set up several human rights programs.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides have complained that Senate's delay on
Colombia has hurt drug-fighting initiatives there. Colombian
President Andres Pastrana first requested the funds late last
summer, and the Clinton administration proposed a $1.3 billion
two-year package in January. The House approved a $1.7 billion
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Once it clears the Senate, the measure would go to a conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The funding for Colombia is part of the Senate's $13.4 billion
foreign aid bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate supporters said the funds needed to be released now in
order to help preserve Colombia's democracy as well as stem the
massive flow of cocaine and heroin to America's streets. Colombia
is estimated to provide about 80 percent of America's cocaine and
nearly all its heroin in certain markets, including New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``This package may not be perfect, but our delay in responding
to a neighbor's call for help is getting too long,'' said Senator
Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat. ``Every day we wait,
every day we delay, means more lives lost, means greater strength
for these narco-traffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Republican, described how
he flew with the Colombian military last weekend over coca fields
in southern Colombia. ``You could see the plants in every
direction, 600 square miles of coca plants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the plants, which are refined into cocaine, would
soon be on its way to the United States. ``It will be sold right
here,'' he said. ``The likelihood you will be robbed or murdered is
usually connected to narcotics. . . The prisons in America are
busting at the seams primarily because of narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, who
had earlier held up consideration of the package, called the
Colombian funding a ``close national security interest for our
country. . . Where better to be involved?''
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who offered the
amendment to shift funds into drug treatment, called it a
``scandal'' that the bulk of funding in the US war on drugs was not
put toward helping addicts try to quit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much evidence that we can treat this addiction and
make a huge difference,'' Wellstone said. ``Instead, we are trying
to go the militarization route. . . What I am hearing in this
debate is this is not really a question of a war on narcotics, this
is a question of basically saying we've got to support the
Colombian military.''
</P>
<P>
   US and Colombian officials have said the military needs
transport helicopters as well as specially trained batallions to
help fight narco-traffickers in the 40 percent of the country that
is not in government control.
</P>
<P>
   The US funding is directed almost solely at the guerrillas
fighting the government, ignoring drug-cultivating areas in north
Colombia controlled mainly by paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   Several human rights reports in the last year have found
extensive links between the military and paramilitary forces. By
voice vote, the Senate Wednesday passed an amendment by Senators
Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, and Jeff Sessions, an Alabama
Republican, that conditions payments under the plan on the
Colombian government meeting certain human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the paramilitaries was underscored Wednesday when
right-wing gangs admitted kidnapping a government peace envoy's
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was watched closely by a large group of interested
parties, from companies that make military helicopters to human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are in for a very long war,'' said a depressed
Sanho Tree, director of the drug policy project at the Institute
for Policy Studies, a progressive think-tank. ``I don't know if we
will know what victory looks like two, three years down the line. I
don't know if we will recognize defeat either.''

   BOSTON _ At the end of the regular season in April, when the

brains about what went wrong, about the future and what they think

scheduled for Saturday in Calgary, the Bruins will use the No. 7
overall pick as a chance to add depth to the organization.
O'Connell said they will use the free agency period, which begin
July 1, to boost their defensive corps.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, O'Connell said he sees this summer as a jumping-off
point to bigger and better things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked (the players), `If we can fill some of these holes on
defense, do you think we have a chance to compete with the other
teams that are in it?' '' O'Connell said. ``They all said,
`Absolutely.' Not one of them said, `No way. We need this or need
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Ray Bourque, who was traded to Colorado in
March, and the very possible loss of veteran Don Sweeney, who said
he will test the waters of unrestricted free agency, defense is
Boston's big need. The European-laden draft, however, has more
forwards to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To draft a defenseman who's going to come in and play, you're
asking a lot,'' said O'Connell. ``We think we have a good set of
forwards and through free agency or trades _ hopefully free agency
_ we can fill some of those holes. There are some good players
available through free agency. There are some defensemen who can
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have the possibility of picking at No. 27 in the
first round as well. New Jersey traded the pick to Colorado in its
deal for Claude Lemieux that sent Brian Rolston to the Avalanche.
When Rolston came to Boston in the Bourque deal, the Avalanche sent
that pick to the Bruins, who can exercise it this year or take
Colorado's first-round pick next year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the immediate future is far brighter than it
appeared in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have solid enough goaltending and forwards and we do
have some good players on defense,'' said O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   If goaltender Rob Tallas isn't taken in the expansion draft,
it's likely the Bruins will deal him in order to shore up the blue
line. Other players left exposed, such as Steve Heinze, could also
be used as a way to add defensive help.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the No. 7 pick stands to be a player someday,
just not right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting time for our staff,'' said O'Connell. ``They
work very hard to identify the top players and it's a chance to add
to your organizational depth. Hopefully, you make the right choices
and in two or three years, we benefit. I think it gets harder and
harder to find players in the draft. I don't know what the
percentages are but as a way to build, it's difficult right now.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news. All of those Bruins who had surgery _
which was pretty much everybody _ are progressing well. O'Connell
said management believes the 2000-2001 season will be a far cry
from the one just completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a trying year,'' said O'Connell. ``You look at it and
three years ago, people gave us no chance for four or five years
and I think we turned it around pretty good. We went from an old
team to a young team faster than most people expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year, it was a good year, we learned a lot. The
second year, we learned more. The third year, we just expected it
and that's easy to do with a young team. People picked us to go
far. I think our young players realized this year that it doesn't
just happen. It will be a different team this year. It will be
interesting to see how these players respond.''

REDUCING BIAS IN HIRING STILL THE KEY TO CIVIL RIGHTS GOALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   When he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Barry
Goldwater declared, ``The problems of discrimination cannot be
cured by laws alone.''
</P>
<P>
   More than three decades of experience suggests that Goldwater
was wrong, although not entirely. There is abundant evidence that
the act did much to improve prospects for blacks, but as the
continuing series in The New York Times on race in America makes
clear, discrimination persists, taking on more subtle forms that
are less amenable to correction by legislation. Still, existing
laws could combat discrimination more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which took effect 35 years
ago next month, prohibited employment discrimination and
established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The first
studies on the law's economic impact were conducted by Richard
Freeman of Harvard and Orley Ashenfelter of Princeton in the early
1970s. They found that after 15 years of stagnation, black men's
earnings increased relative to those of whites shortly after the
act took effect, with the median earnings gap closing from 36
percent in 1965 to 26 percent in 1975. Gains were particularly
large for black professionals. The timing suggests, but certainly
does not prove, that the Civil Rights Act was responsible for the
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman and Ashenfelter were quickly criticized by both the
right and the left. From the right, critics argued that the
narrowing gap was a mirage _ that low-wage workers, who were
disproportionately black, were induced to drop out of the labor
market by expanded income-transfer programs. The average wage of
black workers rose, it was argued, because many who would have
earned low wages left the labor force. Others argued that
improvements in education among blacks and Northern migration were
responsible. Some left-wing critics argued that the strong economy,
not civil rights legislation, had lifted the earnings of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying these criticisms was the belief from the right that
job discrimination could not persist in a competitive economy
because employers would bid up the wages of minorities if they were
equally productive but less well paid, and the left's belief that
more government intervention was needed to make a real dent in
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulating evidence has convinced most critics that the
Civil Rights Act was a principal cause of black progress. The
black-white earnings gap continued to narrow until the mid-1970s,
in both strong and weak economic times. Several studies, including
a recent working paper by Chinhui Juhn of the University of
Houston, found that labor market dropouts accounted for only a
small part of the narrowing. The gap shrank most impressively in
the South, for workers in all age groups, suggesting that
educational improvements and migration were not primarily
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the earnings gap shrank because of deeper
changes in society _ the very forces that led to the enactment of
the Civil Rights Act. But a 1998 study by Kenneth Chay of the
University of California at Berkeley found that when smaller
establishments became covered by the act in 1972, the employment
and pay of black workers increased in them more than in
establishments that were already covered. Because societal forces
operated on both large and small employers, coverage by the Civil
Rights Act made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement in the relative economic status of blacks halted
in the mid-1970s, especially for college graduates, and the
earnings gap increased slightly in the 1980s. Strong economic
growth in the late 1990s helped return the black-white wage gap for
men to about where it was at the end of the 1970s. For black women,
who have a smaller earnings gap than do black men, the gap with
white women has continued to widen slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Progress in narrowing the gap slowed primarily as a byproduct of
forces that caused rising wage dispersion throughout the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the Civil Rights Act has also been a victim of
its own success. The early cases brought under the law were
predominantly class-action suits against employers who refused to
hire African-Americans in higher-paying jobs and industries, like
steel and aircraft manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of litigation has changed. Research by John Donohue
III and Peter Siegelman published in the Stanford Law Review found
that in 1966, charges of racial discrimination involving hiring
outnumbered those involving firing by 50 percent. In 1999 firing
cases outnumbered hiring cases by more than six to one. The number
of class-action suits, though up in the last five years, declined
from a peak of 1,100 in 1975 to 28 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-discrimination policy works best when it opens doors and
gives people a chance to prove their mettle. Studies in which
paired black and white job seekers apply for the same job routinely
turn up evidence of bias in hiring. But cases involving individual
discharges are easier and less costly for lawyers to pursue. This
is unfortunate because ``abuses of the system are greater on the
firing side, and the potential for achieving the goals of the
legislation are greater on the hiring side,'' Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about possible litigation over future discharges could
also discourage employers from taking a chance on minority job
applicants in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To make the Civil Rights Act more effective, Donohue proposes
doubling or tripling damages in discriminatory hiring cases, as is
done in antitrust cases and curtailing punitive damages on the
discharge side.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Steven Miller, a commissioner with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, said he was concerned that different
penalties for hiring and firing cases would send a signal that some
forms of employment discrimination are more offensive than others.
Instead, he favors increased technical assistance for minority job
applicants, greater use of programs to send matched-race testers to
apply for jobs and affirmative action to identify and reduce racial
bias in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to argue with Donohue when he says, ``It would
be a shame if Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which embodies one
of the most noble ideas of the 20th century, becomes used primarily
as a way for less competent workers to hang on to their jobs or
walk away with a sizable, undeserved severance package.''

COLOMBIA DRUG PACKAGE NEARS VOTE IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After several months of delay, the Senate Wednesday
appeared headed toward approving a scaled-down $934 million version
of the Clinton administration's drug-fighting package for Colombia,
a vote that would ensure a major new US commitment in the Andean
nation's long war.
</P>
<P>
   By a 89-11 vote, the Senate first rejected an amendment that
would have taken $225 million earmarked for Colombia's military and
put into US drug-treatment programs, setting the stage for final
approval of the funds. A final vote is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate's plan, the money for Colombia will go to buy
transport helicopters, train Colombian military, provide regional
assistance, and set up several human rights programs.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides have complained that Senate's delay on
Colombia has hurt drug-fighting initiatives there. Colombian
President Andres Pastrana first requested the funds late last
summer, and the Clinton administration proposed a $1.3 billion
two-year package in January. The House approved a $1.7 billion
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Once it clears the Senate, the measure would go to a conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The funding for Colombia is part of the Senate's $13.4 billion
foreign aid bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate supporters said the funds needed to be released now in
order to help preserve Colombia's democracy as well as stem the
massive flow of cocaine and heroin to America's streets. Colombia
is estimated to provide about 80 percent of America's cocaine and
nearly all its heroin in certain markets, including New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``This package may not be perfect, but our delay in responding
to a neighbor's call for help is getting too long,'' said Senator
Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat. ``Every day we wait,
every day we delay, means more lives lost, means greater strength
for these narco-traffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Republican, described how
he flew with the Colombian military last weekend over coca fields
in southern Colombia. ``You could see the plants in every
direction, 600 square miles of coca plants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the plants, which are refined into cocaine, would
soon be on its way to the United States. ``It will be sold right
here,'' he said. ``The likelihood you will be robbed or murdered is
usually connected to narcotics. . . The prisons in America are
busting at the seams primarily because of narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, who
had earlier held up consideration of the package, called the
Colombian funding a ``close national security interest for our
country. . . Where better to be involved?''
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who offered the
amendment to shift funds into drug treatment, called it a
``scandal'' that the bulk of funding in the US war on drugs was not
put toward helping addicts try to quit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much evidence that we can treat this addiction and
make a huge difference,'' Wellstone said. ``Instead, we are trying
to go the militarization route. . . What I am hearing in this
debate is this is not really a question of a war on narcotics, this
is a question of basically saying we've got to support the
Colombian military.''
</P>
<P>
   US and Colombian officials have said the military needs
transport helicopters as well as specially trained batallions to
help fight narco-traffickers in the 40 percent of the country that
is not in government control.
</P>
<P>
   The US funding is directed almost solely at the guerrillas
fighting the government, ignoring drug-cultivating areas in north
Colombia controlled mainly by paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   Several human rights reports in the last year have found
extensive links between the military and paramilitary forces. By
voice vote, the Senate Wednesday passed an amendment by Senators
Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, and Jeff Sessions, an Alabama
Republican, that conditions payments under the plan on the
Colombian government meeting certain human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the paramilitaries was underscored Wednesday when
right-wing gangs admitted kidnapping a government peace envoy's
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was watched closely by a large group of interested
parties, from companies that make military helicopters to human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are in for a very long war,'' said a depressed
Sanho Tree, director of the drug policy project at the Institute
for Policy Studies, a progressive think-tank. ``I don't know if we
will know what victory looks like two, three years down the line. I
don't know if we will recognize defeat either.''

BRUINS SEEK DEPTH WITH NO. 7 DRAFT PICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At the end of the regular season in April, when the
Bruins' year was mercifully over, assistant general manager Mike
O'Connell sat down with many members of his club and picked their
brains about what went wrong, about the future and what they think
about the present.
</P>
<P>
   He said it wasn't as bleak as it appeared from the pitiful
statistics that had Boston on the outside of the postseason for the
second time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansion draft on tap for Friday and the entry draft
scheduled for Saturday in Calgary, the Bruins will use the No. 7
overall pick as a chance to add depth to the organization.
O'Connell said they will use the free agency period, which begin
July 1, to boost their defensive corps.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, O'Connell said he sees this summer as a jumping-off
point to bigger and better things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked (the players), `If we can fill some of these holes on
defense, do you think we have a chance to compete with the other
teams that are in it?' '' O'Connell said. ``They all said,
`Absolutely.' Not one of them said, `No way. We need this or need
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Ray Bourque, who was traded to Colorado in
March, and the very possible loss of veteran Don Sweeney, who said
he will test the waters of unrestricted free agency, defense is
Boston's big need. The European-laden draft, however, has more
forwards to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To draft a defenseman who's going to come in and play, you're
asking a lot,'' said O'Connell. ``We think we have a good set of
forwards and through free agency or trades _ hopefully free agency
_ we can fill some of those holes. There are some good players
available through free agency. There are some defensemen who can
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have the possibility of picking at No. 27 in the
first round as well. New Jersey traded the pick to Colorado in its
deal for Claude Lemieux that sent Brian Rolston to the Avalanche.
When Rolston came to Boston in the Bourque deal, the Avalanche sent
that pick to the Bruins, who can exercise it this year or take
Colorado's first-round pick next year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the immediate future is far brighter than it
appeared in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have solid enough goaltending and forwards and we do
have some good players on defense,'' said O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   If goaltender Rob Tallas isn't taken in the expansion draft,
it's likely the Bruins will deal him in order to shore up the blue
line. Other players left exposed, such as Steve Heinze, could also
be used as a way to add defensive help.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the No. 7 pick stands to be a player someday,
just not right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting time for our staff,'' said O'Connell. ``They
work very hard to identify the top players and it's a chance to add
to your organizational depth. Hopefully, you make the right choices
and in two or three years, we benefit. I think it gets harder and
harder to find players in the draft. I don't know what the
percentages are but as a way to build, it's difficult right now.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news. All of those Bruins who had surgery _
which was pretty much everybody _ are progressing well. O'Connell
said management believes the 2000-2001 season will be a far cry
from the one just completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a trying year,'' said O'Connell. ``You look at it and
three years ago, people gave us no chance for four or five years
and I think we turned it around pretty good. We went from an old
team to a young team faster than most people expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year, it was a good year, we learned a lot. The
second year, we learned more. The third year, we just expected it
and that's easy to do with a young team. People picked us to go
far. I think our young players realized this year that it doesn't
just happen. It will be a different team this year. It will be
interesting to see how these players respond.''

   WASHINGTON _ Convicted murderer Gary Graham, set to be executed
today in Huntsville, is hitting Gov. George W. Bush's presidential
campaign with its greatest challenge since Arizona Sen. John McCain
put up a dramatic primary fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every campaign is faced with a major issue, either planned or
unplanned, and it appears that Bush is being faced with his first
major issue with this death penalty controversy,'' said Scott Reed,
former campaign manager of Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 White House bid.
``How he handles this will be one of the three or four deciding
factors on election day. I put it up there with the
vice-presidential selection, the convention and the debates, big
events that affect the way the world looks at the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told CNN Wednesday that he would, ``uphold the laws of the
land and if it costs me politically, it costs me politically.'' But
with the world watching, the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles, all Bush appointees, have taken the unusual step of
delaying a decision on Graham's fate until noon today.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, Bush can accept or veto board recommendations
to pardon Graham or commute his sentence. He cannot spare Graham's
life against the board's wishes because former Gov. Ann Richards
already did that in Graham's case in 1993. The board has
recommended a death sentence be commuted to life in prison only
once and Bush accepted that recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's conviction, based on the testimony of a single
eyewitness, has been grabbing media attention for the past several
week. It has been driven by newspaper reports questioning the
fairness of Texas' justice system; reports of innocent men set free
thanks to DNA testing; and a Columbia University study that found
two-thirds of death sentences in the past 23 years have been
overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Rev. Pat Robertson and conservative columnist
George Will have called for a reassessment of the death penalty.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson and human rights activist Bianca Jagger
joined protestors in Austin to support Graham as death penalty
opponents heckled Bush on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, death penalty support, still strong, has softened
since 1980. Texans, however, continue to firmly back the ultimate
punishment, despite concerns that the state has executed innocent
people and expressions of strong support by Texans for making DNA
testing available to inmates, according to a Scripps Howard Texas
poll released today.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,000 Texans, conducted May 22-June 16, showed 73
percent in favor of the death penalty, consistent with national
polls. Seventy-two percent still favored it even when presented
with true life imprisonment as an alternative. But 57 percent also
said they believe that Texas has executed innocent inmates.
Thirty-eight percent said that the state's image benefits from its
frequent use of capital punishment. Texas leads the nation in
executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was a little surprising to me is the number of people who
think Texas has executed innocent people,'' said poll director Ty
Meighan. ``I think that's more a criticism of the criminal justice
system. Perhaps people think that some of these inmates are not
getting a fair trial or they don't have the proper legal
representation.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six percent of the respondents said Texas should declare
a moratorium on death sentences for inmates whose cases might be
affected by DNA testing. Eighty-seven percent said the testing
should be available to inmates at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said Bush weakens his
credibility when he insists that all 134 inmates executed on his
watch have been guilty. He said Vice President Gore, a death
penalty supporter, has nothing to gain by speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of his few statements on the issue, Gore said
Wednesday that a moratorium on executions is the right thing for
states with numerous criminal justice errors. He said he did not
know the record in Texas, pointing instead to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a situation, to use the metaphor, of Bush
hanging himself,'' Mellman said. ``The reality is the public still
supports the death penalty, but the level of support is shrinking
and shrinking fairly dramatically...Given what's happened in
science and what's been revealed in these studies of the death
penalty, for anybody to say they're 100 percent sure that everyone
put to death has been guilty is ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Illinois Gov. George Ryan suspended executions after
13 death row inmates were exonerated and released. Recently, Bush
granted his first-ever 30-day reprieve so that the inmate, Ricky
McGinn, could get further DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas law professor, said what
Bush does today and later matters less in political terms than how
he does it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not to do with Bush's chances to win the presidency
so much as it is another opportunity for him to show whether or not
he can seem brave and serious enough when he talks about these
matters,'' Buchanan said. This is particularly true since this
issue will not fade away for Bush: at least 16 Texas inmates are
scheduled to be executed by the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, conservative writer Tucker Carlson quoted Bush
mocking Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman executed since the Civil
War, who was convicted of the ax-killing of two people. Tucker, a
white woman who never contested her guilt, asked to be spared
because she found religion and redemption on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a black man with a string of crimes behind him, does not
pose the same sort of public relations problem. Houston police
accused him of 22 crimes. He pleaded guilty to 10 armed robberies.
Victim David Spiers was left unable to walk for two years after
Graham shot him during a robbery. A female victim who was 57 in
1981 was robbed, abducted, and repeatedly raped by Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the ninth-grade dropout's fate hangs on his conviction in
the murder of Bobby Lambert, shot in 1981 as he walked outside a
Safeway, groceries in his arms. As he weighs the facts, Bush needs
to show the world his heart, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not comfortable talking about his serious, inner
processes publicly so he sticks to a script,'' he said. ``In
certain instances that won't reflect well on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's options in Gary Graham's execution:
</P>
<P>
   He cannot issue a 30-day reprieve. Graham received the one
reprieve he is allowed by law from Gov. Ann Richards in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot halt the execution unless the Texas Board of Pardons
and Paroles first recommends a reprieve, commutation to a life
sentence, or a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot overrule a board vote to proceed with the execution.
</P>
<P>
   He can veto a board vote to grant a reprieve, commutation, or
pardon _ and order the execution to proceed.

BUSH REITERATES HIS UNWAVERING SUPPORT FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ One day before a scheduled execution in Texas that has
come under intense scrutiny, Gov. George W. Bush said he understood
and sympathized with the strong emotions of people who opposed the
death penalty, calling it ``a subject that needs to be debated in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor also said that his support for the death
penalty was firm, and would remain so, even if he sensed it was
hurting him politically. And he said that if the Texas Board of
Pardons and Paroles did not vote on Thursday to halt the execution
of Gary Graham _ convicted of a 1981 murder largely on the
testimony of one witness _ there was nothing he could do as
governor to spare the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it's a high-profile case, and I know there is a
lot of emotion swirling around this case,'' Bush told reporters
Wednesday morning in Los Angeles, where he wrapped up a campaign
swing through Western states before returning to Texas in the
evening. ``The death penalty is not an easy subject for a lot of
folks.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, it was part of Texas law, and it was his sworn
duty as governor, ``to uphold the laws of the land,'' a phrase he
repeated again and again. ``If it costs me politically,'' Bush
said, ``it costs me politically.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little reason to believe that it will, or that it has,
and it is possible that the opposite is true. But Bush nonetheless
seemed to be selecting his words and controlling his expression
Wednesday with care.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was his usual buoyancy; in its place was a subdued manner
and an almost whispery voice that alternately suggested seriousness
and weariness with the constant questions about the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   As both the Republican presidential nominee and the governor of
a state that executes more inmates than any other, Bush has become
a lightning rod for protests against capital punishment and a focal
point in the intensifying national re-examination of whether people
sentenced to die have received fair trials.
</P>
<P>
   At several points over the last three days, Bush was met at
events, or disrupted during them, by demonstrators imploring him to
stop the execution of Graham.
</P>
<P>
   In response to reporters' questions at a news conference
Wednesday, Bush struck a more ruminative note than he often had
when discussing the death penalty publicly. He said he did not
think that news organizations were paying too much attention to
executions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty is a subject that needs to be debated in
America, and cases come along that spark the debate, and this is
one,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed respect for people's rights to make their
disapproval of the death penalty known, but said that he, too, had
strong convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also keep in mind the victims,'' Bush said. ``And the reason
I support the death penalty is I believe it saves lives. That's why
I support it. It so happens the people of my state support it as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, the governor can accept or reject
recommendations from the Board of Pardons and Paroles that a death
sentence be commuted or that the inmate be pardoned. But,
typically, if the board authorizes an execution, the governor only
has the authority to grant the inmate a one-time reprieve of 30
days. It usually winds up extending much longer than that, as
courts reconsider the case.
</P>
<P>
   Graham received such a reprieve from Gov. Ann Richards in 1993,
and Bush said Wednesday that his interpretation of the law was that
he could not grant Graham another one. He said he would only be in
a position to make a decision about Graham's fate if the board
voted to halt the execution. The board's vote is expected to come
midday Thursday; Graham is slated to be put to death by lethal
injection on Thursday night. He would be the 135th person executed
in Texas since Bush became governor five and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was talking daily with the state's lawyers about
Graham's case and was doing what he always did: assessing whether
there was convincing evidence of Graham's guilt and whether Graham
received full access to courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to treat this no differently than any other case
that has crossed my desk,'' Bush said.

WAR CRIMES PROSECUTOR WILL NOT DROP CHARGES AGAINST MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The chief prosecutor of the International
War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said Wednesday that
she would not withdraw the indictment against Slobodan Milosevic,
the Yugoslav president, and that she opposed any action by
Washington or other governments to let him escape justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be stability in the Balkans if Milosevic is not
brought to justice in the Hague,'' said the prosecutor, Carla Del
Ponte, at a news conference during a visit to the Kosovo capital
Wednesday. ``I don't think that the man most responsible for what
happened here in Kosovo should have preference.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported on Monday that the Clinton
administration, with some NATO allies and Russia, was exploring the
possibility of letting Milosevic leave office with guarantees that
he would not be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. war crimes tribunal, based in the Hague, publicly
indicted Milosevic and four members of his Cabinet last year for
responsibility for the deaths and expulsion of ethnic Albanians
during the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte firmly rejected any policy change for the tribunal and
said her staff was proceeding with investigations against Milosevic
for crimes in Kosovo and in previous wars in the region. ``We are
investigating the criminal responsibility of Slobodan Milosevic for
Croatia and Bosnia,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They were also preparing additional indictments against other
lesser officials like police, military and political personnel,
both Serbs and others, including Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless in a comment that hinted at the overriding power of
politics, she said, ``I am a prosecutor, not a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte was visiting Kosovo to see the progress of forensic
teams that are exhuming bodies from hundreds of sites around
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She has also visited Macedonia and will travel on to the
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro to ask for its cooperation in the
war crimes investigations. Her investigators are banned from Serbia
despite their repeated requests for access to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a new development, she said the tribunal has begun
investigations into whether the Kosovo Liberation Army had
committed crimes in the conflict, dating back to 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She said five episodes to which members of the now disbanded
guerrilla army have been linked were under investigation. No
indictments have been brought against members of the KLA but
certain allegations merit investigation, a tribunal spokesman, Paul
Risley, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are allegations that the KLA were responsible for crimes
in five areas, and we have an obligation to look at these serious
allegations,'' said Graham Blewitt, deputy prosecutor at the
tribunal. He and Del Ponte refused to discuss the types of crimes
being investigated, but there are widely known cases of Serbian
civilians abducted by members of the KLA. The Serbs have not been
found and their disappearance has fueled local hatred against the
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials estimate that 1 million Albanians were
expelled from their homes and the territory of Kosovo by Serbian
forces in the spring of last year and that thousands of civilians
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   There remains uncertainty about whether that campaign,
apparently orchestrated by the Serbian leadership, amounted to
genocide, since to bring charges of genocide, prosecutors have to
prove the intention to destroy a people or part of a people.
``There are other explanations, and we need to look at those,''
Blewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of KLA crimes could not be compared to the
organized campaign by Serb forces, Blewitt said. They involved
fewer victims and cannot be considered genocide, he said. ``The KLA
does not get anywhere near that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the announcement of an international investigation of crimes
by Albanians is bound to have some meaning here. It came the day
after a young Serb couple were shot and wounded near the main
street in Pristina on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte accompanied the chief of the U.N. mission here,
Bernard Kouchner, and local Albanian political leaders to lay
flowers at the spot of the attack. The two Serbs, a young bank
security guard and his girlfriend, a local radio reporter, were
found by peacekeeping officers and taken to a hospital, where they
were reported to be in stable condition. Both had been shot several
times.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting happened near the busy center of Pristina and
highlighted the impunity with which Albanians have conducted
revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The divided town of Mitrovica also exploded into violence
Wednesday as a Serbian crowd stoned the Albanian driver of a
garbage truck and then set fire to cars with U.N. or foreign
registrations. Several people were injured.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James E. Goodwin, the chief executive of UAL Corp., the parent
of United Airlines, describes his proposed $4.3 billion purchase of
US Airways as a ``win-win for consumers'' that will usher in a
glorious new era of global air service.
</P>
<P>
   But many passengers see the proposed merger rather differently.
For them, air travel is already a grim reality of high fares,
interminable check-in lines, overcrowded planes, endless delays and
in-flight meals that are stingy when they are offered at all. ``I
look at fares now, especially for business trips, and they are
outrageous,'' said Linda Kurz, an executive assistant in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Those two visions are on a collision course in Washington, where
Goodwin and Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of US Airways, have
already faced a hostile Congress at several hearings. At issue is
whether the airline industry, a generation after the 1978
deregulation law prompted a wave of industry consolidation, will
best serve consumers if it is allowed to become even more
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   The United-US Airways deal, if approved by regulators, would
create a winged giant that would carry one quarter of the nation's
air traffic. The proposal has sparked a frenzy of merger talks that
many are convinced could reduce the country's six largest carriers
to three mega-airlines. That prospect alarms consumer advocates and
lawmakers who already complain that there is too little
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no loss of competition if this merger goes
through,'' Rep. Leonard L. Boswell, D-Iowa, said with more than a
touch of irony, ``because there is no competition now.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., was even more disturbed. ``I think the
flying public is in for some real, real horror stories, worse than
they have ever experienced,'' he said, adding that Congress does
not have the power to stop the merger.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department will decide whether the combination
hinders competition. But opponents and backers of the deal agree
that it may rise and fall on public opinion and election-year
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers have written to the Justice Department urging
it to look at the effect of the merger on the structure of the
industry. A group of senators led by Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked the
Department of Transportation's inspector general to investigate the
degree to which airline mergers adversely affect customer service.
And attorneys general from 20 states have joined forces to oppose
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, UAL, already the nation's largest airline, has
enlisted a small army of lobbyists to make its case. Goodwin is now
devoting nearly all his time to talking to anyone in Washington who
will listen.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, this is a terrible moment to propose an airline
merger. The major carriers have faced a growing chorus of critics
and government challenges over the last six years. As business
fares rose to record highs in the mid-1990's, many cities and
states came to resent the way large airlines dominated major
metropolitan airports.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that fares are much higher at such hubs than at
airports with more carriers. In Minneapolis, for example, where
Northwest Airlines is the biggest airline by far, fares on average
were 49 percent higher than at comparable airports with greater
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The major airlines were also accused of preying on new, low-fare
competitors. The Justice Department sued American Airlines in May
1999, accusing it of illegally driving a small competitor out of
its Dallas-Fort Worth hub and then raising prices. American denies
any wrongdoing and is fighting the government in court.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Justice filed suit in 1998 to force Northwest to sell
its controlling stake in Continental Airlines. It charged that the
deal would lead to higher ticket prices and diminished service for
millions of passengers. That case is scheduled to go to trial later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about airlines rose to such a crescendo last year
that Congress came close to passing legislation mandating specific
levels of service. The industry headed that off by submitting a
voluntary set of standards, promising, among other things, to
respond to complaints within 60 days and to allow consumers to hold
reservations for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, complaints are at an all-time high, rising over
130 percent in the 12 months ending in April.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both United and US Airways score at or near the bottom in
industry measures of service compiled by the Department of
Transportation. United was ranked seventh and US Airways eighth in
on-time arrivals for the 12 months ending in April, according to
the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``How they could come forward with this deal in an environment
like this leaves you scratching your head,'' said Kevin P.
Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which
represents corporate airline customers.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that airline executives live in a world of
statistics while passengers tend to remember individual flights.
United flew 89 million passengers last year so it is not surprising
to Goodwin that some had problems. He acknowledged in an interview
that United needs to improve its service but he said that according
to data compiled by the industry for internal use, United ranks at
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin and other airline executives point out that passengers
nearly tripled to 635 million last year from 240 million in 1977,
before the industry was deregulated, but average fares, adjusted
for inflation, declined 40 percent over the same period. Still, the
complex way the industry sets fares, which seem to change by the
minute, has fueled broad resentment among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the airline industry,'' said Leo F. Mullin,
the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, ``is that it gets killed by
anecdotes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most airline executives and industry analysts on Wall Street
believe that consolidation is inevitable. Industry profit margins,
even in the best years, are about 5 percent compared with an
average at least twice that for the companies included in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   United argues that combining with US Airways will give it a
strong presence along the East Coast, where it is weak. That will
be a boon for consumers, the airline said, because the new United
would be able to offer service on 560 city-to-city routes, like
Sacramento to Erie, Penn., and Fargo, N.D., to Panama City, Fla.,
that neither it nor US Airways currently serve. Together with its
international partners, United said it would also be able to offer
``seamless'' service to numerous destinations in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the deal will only force United's rivals to get
bigger, too. Within days of United's announcement, the AMR Corp.,
the parent of American Airlines, the country's second-largest
airline, entered into merger discussions with both Northwest and
Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe that AMR will ultimately seek to merge
with No. 4 Northwest, while No. 3 Delta will attempt to combine
with No. 5 Continental Airlines. That would create three giants
carrying 80 percent of all passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Some airline executives argue that having three truly national
carriers competing head to head in every city would be an
improvement on the situation today in which the six airlines have
hegemony over so-called fortress hubs at major metropolitan
airports.
</P>
<P>
   But Samuel Buttrick, a airline analyst with Paine Webber in New
York, called the notion that three big carriers would offer more
competition than six independent airlines ``borderline lunacy.'' He
said that ``more competitors means more supply, means more choice
at better prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers agree. ``Right now all the airlines have to
compete for the same dollar,'' said Wally Thompson, a salesman in
Manhattan. ``Once they don't have to compete, prices will go up.''
</P>
<P>
   To mute criticism, United has pledged not to lay off any of US
Airways' 40,000 employees and has also vowed not to increase fares
for two years after the deal is consummated. In addition, because a
combined United-US Airways would dominate air travel in the
Washington D.C. area, US Airways has agreed to sell most of its
operations at Ronald Reagan National Airport to Robert L. Johnson,
the founder of Black Entertainment Television and a US Airways
director.
</P>
<P>
   But many executives and analysts believe the fare freeze is
meaningless because United has said it reserves the right to raise
prices in response to inflation and fuel costs. Executives at rival
airlines also said that United will ultimately be forced to abandon
some of US Airways' hub airports to justify the expense of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   DC Air, Johnson's new airline, has also been heavily criticized
as a ploy to keep valuable assets at National Airport out of the
hands of United's strongest competitors. There are also concerns
that DC Air, which will depend on United for all its services from
ticketing to maintenance, will not be a truly independent
competitor. And even if it is, United would still be the clearly
dominant airline in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And bigger is not necessarily better for frequent flyers,
including some in Congress. ``I'm a 2 million mile customer of
United,'' Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., told Goodwin. ``I want a
reasonable price and I want better service. I am not so concerned
about the seamlessness of my international and national travel.
That's what travel agents are for.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola's in North Korea
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co., a symbol for capitalism around the
world, entered Communist North Korea on Wednesday, just two days
after the U.S. government lifted most economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in today through an import company in North Korea,''
Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin said Wednesday. ``It's a first
step toward business development there.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said a truck carrying a limited amount of Coke entered
North Korea through China, where the soft-drink was produced.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, it's possible the company will build production
plants and tailor marketing strategies for North Korea, a Coca-Cola
spokesman in Seoul, South Korea, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to monitor the business and see what makes
sense,'' Baskin added.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola becomes one of the first U.S. companies to enter North
Korea following a historic summit last week between the leaders of
North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly shows Coke's aggressiveness and responsiveness
to changing conditions,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of
Beverage Digest. ``Coke CEO Doug Daft talks about growing the
company by being agile and quick. This is a very good example.''
Before becoming head of the company, Daft was in charge of its
Asian operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sicher predicted that Coca-Cola would gain ``modest'' volume and
profit growth in North Korea over the long-term.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly half a century, Coca-Cola and other U.S. companies
were prevented from doing business in North Korea, a nation of 22.5
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Coke products made it into North Korea through
independent sources in China.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, however, Coca-Cola has been selling beverages
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It has 53 percent of the soft-drink market there, according to
Beverage Digest. That compared with 13 percent for Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's move into North Korea is its second major entry into
a Communist-led Asian country over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The company sold its products in Vietnam less than 24 hours
after the U.S. government dropped its trade embargo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which does business in about 200 nations, is still
prevented by the U.S. government from selling its beverages in
about a half-dozen nations, including Cuba and Libya.

ARTS ABROAD: WHEN IT COMES TO GLASS SCULPTURE, A CZECH COUPLE THINK
BIG 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER S. GREEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZELEZNY BROD, Czech Republic _ ``Alchemy,'' answered Stanislav
Libensky. The question was how Libensky and his wife, Jaroslava
Brychtova, arrive at the sublimely pure colors that define their
work as glass artists, and it seemed an almost plausible
explanation for the genius that has made them among the most
respected artists in their medium today.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing mysterious about the Libenskys' work. They have
spent nearly half a century refining the art and technique of
casting huge chunks of delicately colored glass. A rare and
harmonious collaboration between husband and wife underpins their
work, which is having a major retrospective at the Heller Gallery
on West 14th Street in New York City through June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really the towering figures in the 20th century in
the realm of glass sculpture,'' said Robert Kehlmann, an American
critic, himself a glass artist. ``Libensky-Brychtova are really
dealing with sculpture, and they are dealing with it not on a
tabletop scale, but at the scale which sculpture has come to be in
the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Their scale was always big. ``The River of Life,'' at the 1970
World Exhibition in Osaka, Japan, weighed 13 tons and measured 14.5
feet high and 72 feet long, all of it cast glass, in three towering
sections. Other mammoth pieces include ``Big Conus,'' a
12.5-foot-high tower for the 1967 Montreal Exposition, and the
hauntingly translucent ``Green Eye of the Pyramid,'' now at the
Corning Museum of Glass in New York State. On a recent visit to his
studio here, the diminutive Libensky and Brychtova, who is slightly
taller than her husband, were dwarfed by the massive, 6.5-foot-tall
``Angel'' of smoky gray glass.
</P>
<P>
   Scale is half of their alchemy. The other half is light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an illuminating space within this material that
doesn't exist in any other medium,'' said Libensky as he took a
visitor through the basement studio in his hillside house in the
foothills of the Ore mountains, where glassmakers have worked since
the 14th century. ``That is why we are attracted by glass and why
we can't leave it, really, even though glass has many
disadvantages.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of masters like Tiffany, Daum, Lalique and Galle,
glass teetered on what Libensky's teacher, Josef Kaplicky,
described as ``the boundaries where the sphere of creative spirit
ends and the empire of monotonous craft begins.'' Like their
predecessors, the Libenskys push glass work from the decorative
arts to the fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were willing to explore the inherent qualities of the
glass itself,'' said Katya Kohoutova Garrow, a partner in the
Heller Gallery. ``They said, `If we do a bas-relief, that's
interesting, but not as interesting as if you look at it through
the flat surface where you see its plasticity, and the density and
thickness of the glass create the sculpture's volume and color.'''
</P>
<P>
   Libensky paints and sketches, and Brychtova makes clay
sculptures from his designs. Master craftsmen follow with plaster
molds that are filled with glass shards and ``fired'': heated for
two or three days and slowly cooled for as long as a month. Garrow
says it is Brychtova who teases the genius out of Libensky's
drawings, endlessly perfecting the surfaces and the shapes.
</P>
<P>
   They were both married when they met in Zelezny Brod, and their
artistic infatuation soon led to a romance that scandalized this
small North Bohemian town. So Libensky returned to Prague to teach
at the Academy of Decorative Arts, while Brychtova stayed to direct
the architectural glass studio at Zelezny Brod. Five years later
they married.
</P>
<P>
   The political turmoil after the 1948 Communist putsch, and the
show trials and purges of important pre-World War II artists
virtually wiped out abstract art. But it allowed the Libenskys a
professional freedom. The Communist-era construction boom demanded
massive sculptures to beautify the new palaces of the proletariat,
a boon for glass artists, because, Libensky said, ``the state
didn't see glass as art.''
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of quality fine arts to submit to the 1958 Brussels
World's Fair, the Communists turned to decorative arts, and the
Libenskys designed a wall of flagstone-size colored glass blocks
with reversed reliefs of wild animals, reminiscent of Stone Age
cave paintings. Their work, innovative art that did nothing to
glorify socialism, slid in to the exhibition as a piece of
architecture. ``Art went in through the back door,'' Brychtova
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual liberalization of the Prague Spring reform Communist
movement in the mid-1960s encouraged the Libenskys artistically and
politically. Their 1964 windows for the chapel in Prague Castle for
the Czech patron saint, St. Wenceslas, are a melding of plates of
softly colored glass.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Prague Spring, they began work in 1967 on a
massive installation for the Osaka World's Fair. Made of clear
glass cast in vast chunks and strung together on a steel frame,
``The River of Life'' was meant, said Libensky, to show ``the
system of life in this country'' from birth through youth to the
dancing feet of freedom and then, finally, the deep imprints of
army boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The River'' was installed in Osaka just two years after the
1968 Soviet-led invasion crushed the reforms. In a moment of
inspired puckishness, a sculpture of marching soldiers by a fellow
Czech, Vladimir Janousek, was positioned so that it appeared to be
marching from the nearby Soviet pavilion to the boot marks of ``The
River,'' as if it were a representation of the Russian and Germany
armies that had occupied his homeland for most of his life. ``The
Russian and Czech potentates recognized what this was about
straight off,'' said Libensky, and he was forced to sand off the
boot prints from ``The River.''
</P>
<P>
   Osaka secured the Libenskys' international reputation, but it
also guaranteed that the Communists would never again allow them
such exposure. On their return to Czechoslovakia, the Libenskys
were interrogated, expelled from the party and for some years
forbidden to travel abroad, although he stayed at the academy,
training nearly all of today's prominent Czech glass artists. She
remained in Zelezny Brod. They won commissions for Czechoslovak
embassies and even for the Federal Czechoslovak Parliament, but
many more for such places as a Prague subway station, hotel lobbies
and government offices. The state kept most of the income from
whatever pieces they did sell abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Some Czech glass artists were able to study in Libensky's studio
and cast their work at Brychtova's atelier; today a generation of
them owe their careers to the couple. The Libenskys' influence has
been particularly strong in the United States, where they first
visited in the mid-1980s to teach at the prestigious Pilchuk Glass
School near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Now 79 and still recovering from lung cancer, Libensky is
reluctant to talk about the influences on his current work, or why
he has abandoned the bright pastel colors for somber grays and
browns. But Brychtova, who is 75, says: ``The last four years the
theme is inner space, and all the things he created while he was
ill and he was shown the X-rays of his own body. All this you see
here reminds him of his own body.'' She pointed to the stacks of
gray-and-black canvases spread around the studio.

NASA TO CONFIRM LIQUID WATER EXISTS ON MARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been the greatest quest of planetary scientists for
decades, and Thursday the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration will announce that at long last it has been found:
water on the surface of another world. The clearest evidence ever
of liquid water _ the most basic prerequisite for life _ has now
been seen on the surface of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement will be made at a press conference at NASA
headquarters at 11 a.m. and will include new pictures taken by the
Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft that are said to show clear signs
of the surface water. A detailed report will be published next week
in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, while scientists had seen abundant signs that water
had flowed across the red planet in the very distant past and
remains frozen in the polar ice caps and occasional frosts, there
had never been direct evidence of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   If liquid water exists on Mars, scientists say, that greatly
increases the odds that some form of life _ presumably in the form
of primitive microorganisms _ exists there now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever there's water on Earth, there's life,'' said one
planetary scientist who is familiar with the new results. ``No one
knows if there was life on Mars, but certainly, if liquid water
existed in even a few places for an extended period, that obviously
improves the chances of finding life.''
</P>
<P>
   That scientist, who insisted on anonymity because the findings
will not officially be made public until Thursday, added that the
new report is ``significant'' and ``a very nice analysis'' by
respected scientists. ``It's an important paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, research results published in a scientific journal may
not be discussed publicly until the date of publication, but word
of the exciting new findings leaked out this week, initially
through an Internet site called NASA Watch (www.nasawatch.com), and
the story was quickly picked up by other media. That forced NASA
and Science to hastily reschedule the press conference and release,
initially planned for June 29.
</P>
<P>
   But most reports that have circulated so far have been wrong
about many details, NASA officials said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the new findings noted that several
reports have erroneously said that the new findings were based on
pictures of Valles Marineris, the 3,000 mile-long, mile-deep canyon
system that is the largest known on any planet. Also incorrect were
reports that the new study was based on pictures of a crater taken
two years ago by Mars Global Surveyor, these sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Mars billions of years ago is thought to have been warmer and
wetter, similar to the early Earth, but now is colder than
Antarctica and its air is thinner than at the summit of Everest. As
a result, except under rare conditions, water can exist only as
solid or gas. It normally turns straight from ice to vapor without
going through a liquid phase. So the new findings suggest that
there must be a source, such as a spring, that brings water to the
surface continuously.
</P>
<P>
   Most researchers exploring the history of water on Mars have
focused on the first billion years of the planet's 4.6 billion-year
history, a time when the planet is believed to have been warmer.
Last year, a team led by James Head of Brown University found
strong evidence that Mars long ago had an ocean that spanned vast
regions of the planet's northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Another report showed that a vast underground reservoir of water
must have persisted through most of Mars' history, based on
indirect evidence gathered from meteorites that were blasted to
Earth from the Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   But, since the new findings show that water is present now, or
was there very recently, ``that's obviously very important,'' one
scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who have long believed that there is water on Mars
found vindication in the new NASA findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's old hat to us,'' said Gilbert Levin, president of
Biospherics Inc., who was the chief scientist for one of the three
experiments sent to Mars in 1976 specifically to look for signs of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Levin has maintained ever since that mission that his experiment
showed clear evidence that living microbes exist on Mars today.
Levin's claims have never been taken seriously by other scientists,
though the final report of the Viking mission concluded that the
results of his experiment did indeed meet the conditions _ agreed
to in advance by all the scientists _ for a positive detection of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Levin has proposed a simple, low-cost experiment that could be
carried on a future Mars mission that he says would settle the
question, once and for all, of whether the Viking results really
did produce evidence of life. But so far NASA has not agreed to
include the experiment on any upcoming mission.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Donahue, professor emeritus of planetary science at the
University of Michigan also was delighted, but not surprised by
NASA's new findings. He published indirect results five years ago
showing that the ratio of certain gases trapped inside meteorites
that came from Mars show that vast amounts of liquid water must
have persisted there throughout most, if not all, of the planet's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly nice to see some direct physical evidence to
support the inferences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighborhood of liquid water,'' Donahue said, ``is the
neighborhood in which you want to look for life today.'' And, he
added, ``I don't think it would surprise anyone, either, to find
that there is indeed evidence for life'' on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ward, a paleontologist at the University of Washington who
has written about the possibilities of life on other worlds, said
Wednesday that ``the probability of microbial life'' on Mars ``has
just skyrocketed.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding of water, he said, provides ``a far stronger case
for NASA to get up there. . . . It gives you a better shot of
finding not only living organisms, but also fossils.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some of the old soldiers were unsteady as they
stood at attention Wednesday while a bugler blew taps into a fresh
breeze in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of them were in their mid-70s, after all. Some had
come thousands of miles for this dress-blue ceremony under a gray
sky, so it was no surprise that their shoulders sagged under the
weight of years and, perhaps, of memories.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven old soldiers in Arlington National Cemetery.
One was well known, Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, the others much
less so. All have just been awarded the Medal of Honor, the
country's highest military award, for what they did more than a
half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The seven are among 22 Asian-Americans, most of Japanese
descent, who fought heroically during World War II as their
relatives endured prejudice, even internment, back home. Most of
the 22 belonged to the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which
sustained heavy casualties in Italy, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rose above any sense of personal injustice to sacrifice
all that they held dear in order to keep our country strong,'' Army
Secretary Louis Caldera said before the Arlington ceremony in their
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Heroism? Not really, said one of the seven, Barney Hajiro, now
83.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot myself in combat,'' Hajiro said. ``I couldn't run
backward. I had to run forward. That's the job of a soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Hajiro of the 442nd killed several German soldiers and helped
capture more than a dozen others in eastern France in October 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The 442nd fought in many campaigns and garnered many medals. But
as the years went by and prejudice faded, people in and out of the
military asked why only two Asian-Americans were awarded the Medal
of Honor for heroism in World War II. (No black soldiers received
the Medal of Honor.)
</P>
<P>
   The Army reviewed more than 100 instances in which the
Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest medal, was given to
Asian-Americans. Last month, the Army concluded that in 21
instances the Medal of Honor should have been awarded instead.
(More recently, a member of the 442nd who had won another high
honor, the Silver Star, was found worthy of a Medal of Honor.)
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 22 were killed in action, and others have succumbed
to time. Many relatives of the dead were at the tomb Wednesday,
some leaning on canes or on the strong arms of honor guard soldiers
young enough to be their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   George T. Sakato, another of the seven, was a private with the
442nd. According to his medal citation, he killed five German
soldiers and captured four on Oct. 29, 1944, before his unit was
pinned down. Then he led ``a one-man rush,'' killing as many as a
dozen more enemy soldiers and capturing several others.
</P>
<P>
   Not particularly heroic, said Sakato, 79. ``Nowadays, they call
what I did `road rage,''' he said. His killing rampage for his
country was inspired by the death of a buddy, Saburo Tanamachi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died in my arms,'' Sakato said with a distant look in his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As a 20-year-old first lieutenant in the 442nd, Daniel Inouye
led an attack in Italy in April 1945 in which two dozen enemy
soldiers were killed. His right arm was shattered and had to be
amputated.
</P>
<P>
   The seven old soldiers, their relatives and survivors of the
dead Medal of Honor recipients went to the White House Wednesday
afternoon to meet President Clinton and get their medals. On
Thursday, the 22 will be honored at a Pentagon ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Sakato lives in Denver and is a retired postal worker. He
recalled how, early in the war, his family was given three days to
leave their home in Southern California or face internment. They
went to Arizona to live with relatives. After he came home from the
war, Sakato felt the stares whenever he entered a restaurant,
``from people thinking, `What are you doing here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hajiro is from Waipahu, Hawaii, and went back to the islands to
work on a sugar plantation after leaving the Army. Memories of
Pearl Harbor were still vivid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after the war,'' he said, ``they called me a `Jap,' you
know.''

ROCKS, NOT BULLETS, NOW FLY ACROSS THE ISRAEL-LEBANON BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel _ Armed with a slingshot, a walkie-talkie and a
pistol tucked into his pants, a Hezbollah guerrilla across the
fence in Lebanon let another stone fly Wednesday toward a
mesh-covered Israeli army post on the outskirts of this northern
border community.
</P>
<P>
   Rocks regularly sail over the fence these days at Israeli
farmers from Metulla who work in apple orchards that stretch to the
border. Vehicles have been hit and irrigation systems smashed,
disrupting work in recent weeks, although no one has been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers patrolling the border are under strict orders
not to fire unless they are fired upon, and it has been only
stones, not bullets, that have crossed the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a month after Israel withdrew its troops from southern
Lebanon, the frontier between the countries remains free of gunfire
but unsettled. The line of Israeli withdrawal, certified by the
United Nations but disputed in some points by Lebanon, is still
being checked by U.N. teams. In the meantime, Hezbollah guerrillas,
not Lebanese or U.N. soldiers, face the Israelis along the
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all our land is not liberated we will continue fighting,
and we want our prisoners released,'' one warned near the border
fence Wednesday, echoing the pledge of his movement's leader, Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is visiting the Middle
East, was in Israel Wednesday to try to iron out the reported
violations of the withdrawal line, and after meeting him, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said he expected the matter to be settled in 24
to 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who met Nasrallah in Lebanon on Tuesday, noted the
``restraint, responsibility and discipline'' of Hezbollah, which
has not fired across the border since the Israeli withdrawal, and
he asserted that U.N. peacekeepers would be posted on the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will move the troops to the border,'' he said, adding that
Lebanese officials had indicated to him that they, too, would soon
send their troops to southern Lebanon.

&HT;     AGENTS FIRED THROUGH WINDOWLESS DOOR, LAWYER TESTIFIES IN WACO
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DICK J. REAVIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Noted criminal defense lawyer Dick DeGuerin told a
jury Wednesday that he believes federal agents fired through a
windowless, steel door at targets they could not see when they
raided the Branch Davidian compound in Mount Carmel on the morning
of Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin was called to testify in the Branch Davidian wrongful
death suit against the federal government by Cynthia Chapman, wife
and law partner of Mike Caddell, the lead attorney for plaintiffs
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman called DeGuerin in an effort to show that federal agents
fired ``indiscriminately'' at Mount Carmel, endangering the lives
of unarmed women and children who were followers of Davidian leader
David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   During the 51-day federal siege in 1993, DeGuerin, with
permission from FBI commanders, entered the compound four times.
Inside, he conferred with Koresh, whom he represented. He also
toured and inspected the building and spoke with other Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawyers objected to DeGuerin's attempts to say that
bullet holes he examined in one of the twin front doors at Koresh's
Mount Carmel compound had been fired into the building from outside
_ not from inside, going out, as government officials have
maintained. Their objection was that DeGuerin has not been
qualified as a firearms expert. Judge Walter Smith Jr., who is
presiding over the trial, sustained the objection.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was born in Texas! I've been a hunter all of my life,''
DeGuerin protested.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning by Chapman, DeGuerin slipped around the
government's objections by saying he often had seen bullet holes in
traffic signs near property that he owns. Smooth holes appear on
the entry side, while holes with ``jagged edges'' appear on the
exit side, he observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holes on the outside of that door at Mount Carmel were
smooth,'' he said. ``The holes that I recall examining on the
inside of that door were jagged.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin also noted that the door he examined has never been
found. Its twin was introduced into evidence by prosecutors during
the 1994 criminal trial of Davidian defendants. That door showed
evidence of gunshots fired from inside.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin's testimony followed a morning that jurors spent
listening to tapes of 911 telephone calls in which three Davidian
figures spoke with Larry Lynch, then a McLennan County sheriff's
lieutenant. The calls were made during and after the chaotic Feb.
28 raid by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, the plaintiffs' attorney in the wrongful death lawsuit,
introduced the tapes into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The calls were initiated by Wayne Martin, a Harvard-trained Waco
lawyer who lived at Mount Carmel and died there during the April 19
fire that killed Koresh and some 76 of his followers, ending the
51-day standoff. Marin's widow, Sheila, present in the courtroom,
grimaced and bowed her head as some three hours of Feb. 28 tapes
were played.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 75 men around our building, and they're shooting at
us in Mount Carmel! . . . Tell them that there are women and
children in here and to call it off,'' Martin can be heard telling
Lynch in their initial conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch had no telephone contact with the ATF agents. Chatting
with Martin on the line, the lieutenant tried to buy time. But
gunshots are heard on the recording, and at one point, Lynch tells
Martin, who was using a speakerphone, to put down his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a right to defend myself,'' Martin shouts. ``They
started firing first.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were rapt as they listened.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the 911 tapes were played during the 1994 Davidian
criminal trial in San Antonio, but during that proceeding, Smith
refused to allow a jury to hear Martin say, ``They started firing
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was ``self-serving,'' Smith said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   After Lynch established contact with ATF commanders, Martin and
Lynch arranged a cease-fire, despite the shouting and shots
recorded on the tapes. As the ATF began withdrawing, Lynch also
spoke with Koresh and his aide, Steven Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   But the conversation with Koresh quickly bogged down when the
wounded cult leader began expounding theology and Schneider was
hostile and demanding. Effective negotiation, crucial to the
removal of severely wounded agents, fell to Martin, who talked with
the lieutenant until late in the afternoon of Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys played for the jury a separate sampling of
tapes, which included the Lynch chat with Koresh and various
sections of Lynch-Martin conversations during the minutes after the
cease-fire was arranged. The government's apparent motive in
playing the excerpts was to show that the Davidians refused to
accept offers of medical help for their wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want any help from your country,'' Martin told the
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to DeGuerin's testimony, trial jurors viewed a
videotaped deposition by Anetta Richards, 71, a Jamaican native who
is a resident of Canada. Richards, a practical nurse, was visiting
the Branch Davidian outpost at the time of the Feb. 28 raid. She
said she witnessed from her bedroom on the rear side of the
building's second floor the approach of three helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   When another resident told her to step clear of the window,
Richards sat down on her bed, she told attorneys who questioned her
for the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortly after I sat down on my bed a bullet came through the
wall and just past my face,'' Richards testified. Richards then
took refuge in the second-floor hallway, where, she testified, she
shielded with her body a five-month-old child, Patron Wendell,
because ``at that time bullets were coming in from the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 interview with Texas Rangers, and in testimony before
Congress in 1995, DeGuerin said that he had examined holes in the
roof of the building, which he concluded had been made by bullets
fired from the ATF's helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But Chapman failed to question DeGuerin about bullet holes in
the compound's ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering why she didn't ask me that,'' he said after
leaving the witness stand.

UPSIDE DOWN CAKE RECIPE COMES TO THE SURFACE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the Pineapple Upside Down Cake recipe using Bisquick that
was requested a while back. The original request inadvertently ran
with the incorrect name. U. Van Dam of North Hills is the reader
who was actually looking for the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen readers sent along the same recipe that came
from various Betty Crocker Bisquick cookbooks over the years
(dating back to 1964) and the Betty Crocker Web site. A couple of
the recipes included 1/2 cup shredded coconut with the Bisquick
batter, so add or not as desired. One used crushed pineapple
instead of slices and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract in addition to
the vanilla in the batter. A few of the recipes baked the cake five
minutes less while a couple baked it five minutes longer. Use the
baking time as a guideline and watch the cake carefully near the
end of the time specified.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to all who shared the recipe. No doubt Van Dam will be
pleased to whip up this easy creation once again. &QL; 
PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE &QL; 
2 tablespoons butter OR margarine &QL; 
1/4 cup packed brown sugar &QL; 
1 (8 1/4-ounce) can sliced pineapple, drained &QL; 
Maraschino cherries, drained &QL; 
Walnut OR pecan halves (optional) &QL; 
1 1/2 cups buttermilk baking mix (such as Bisquick) &QL; 
1/2 cup granulated sugar &QL; 
1 egg &QL; 
1/2 cup milk OR water &QL; 
2 tablespoons shortening &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Place butter in an 8x8x2-inch square pan or 9x1 1/2-inch round
layer pan in preheated 350-degree oven until butter melts. Sprinkle
brown sugar over butter.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange drained pineapple slices on brown sugar mixture.
Decorate with maraschino cherries and walnut or pecan halves, if
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, blend remaining ingredients in a large mixing bowl on
low speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl frequently. Beat 4 minutes on
medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour batter evenly over
pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center
comes out clean. Immediately invert pan onto a heatproof serving
plate; leave pan over cake a few minutes before removing.
</P>
<P>
   Serve warm, plain or with sweetened whipped cream. Makes 8 to 9
servings. &QL; 
Hawaiian-style pie &QL; 
A colleague was recently looking for something to take to a
Hawaiian-inspired potluck, and this replica recipe, a copycat of a
dessert served at Chin Chin restaurant in Studio City, came to
mind. It's a cinch to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   To speed preparation, use prepared pie crust dough, readily
available packaged in the refrigerated deli section of
supermarkets. Of course, if you have the time or inclination, your
favorite homemade crust would be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The filling is a mixture of brown sugar, eggs, butter, milk,
vanilla, chocolate pieces, coconut and macadamia nuts. For best
results, be sure to mix the ingredients by hand, with a fork or
wooden spoon rather than with an electric mixer. Otherwise, you'll
end up with a completely different result, which I found
unacceptable. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA &QL; 
NUT PIE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 cup packed brown sugar &QL; 
1 tablespoon flour &QL; 
2 eggs &QL; 
2 tablespoons milk &QL; 
2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
1/3 cup butter, melted &QL; 
1 cup semisweet chocolate pieces &QL; 
1 cup shredded coconut &QL; 
1 1/2 cups dry-roasted macadamia nuts (one 7-ounce jar) &QL; 
1 (9-inch) unbaked pie crust
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, combine brown sugar and flour. With a
fork or wooden spoon (not an electric mixer), beat in eggs, milk,
vanilla and melted butter. Stir in chocolate pieces, coconut and
macadamia nuts. Turn into pastry-lined pie pan.

   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 30 to 35 minutes, until barely
set. Cool. Refrigerate (so pie sets up). Serve slices topped with
whipped cream, if desired. Makes 1 pie. &QL;

SUMMIT GLOW FADES AS THE KOREAS FACE HARD TASKS OF REUNIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The euphoria that followed the summit
meeting between North and South Korea last week has started to fade
as their leaders face the reality of trying to reunite two
countries with a common ancestry and language but drastically
different ideologies and fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Although foreign diplomats and political experts say the
prospects of peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula
remain promising, antagonistic statements in both countries in
recent days underscore the inevitable difficulties that North and
South face in trying to overcome five decades as ideological
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the official North Korean news agency released
numerous provocative declarations, some old and some new, by the
country's leader, Kim Jong Il, admonishing North Koreans not to
stray from the principles of the communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must create a self-sufficient and strong nation and not
yield to economic reforms and market openings that would certainly
lead to our destruction,'' Kim Jong Il said in a rebroadcast of a
1999 speech on Tuesday, a day after the United States had removed
sanctions on nonmilitary trade with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In a broadcast Wednesday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry
demanded that all sanctions be lifted and that the United States
stop being ``hostile.'' On Sunday, North Korea said the United
States, which has 37,000 troops in South Korea, had increased the
likelihood of war on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The diatribe, which political experts said was intended to
appease North Korean hard-liners and project an image of strength,
was a sharp contrast to the conciliatory gestures that Kim Jong Il
and President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea had traded at their talks
in Pyongyang. The two leaders signed an accord that called for
closer ties, economic cooperation and eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   But the North's shift in tone has been no more caustic than a
barrage of criticism that South Korea's main political opposition
has levied against the communist country and the agreement forged
there.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the significance of the summit meeting,
leaders of the opposition Grand National Party said that North
Korea remained a dangerous state and that the talks had failed to
address important issues like the North's nuclear and missile
programs and the costs of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim Jong Il is very good at putting on a show,'' said Chung
Hyung-keun, a legislator from the opposition Grand National Party.
``But he is an old-line communist leader who believes that he can
make the South his own at any time, and that is very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign and Korean experts said the verbal jabs had provided a
much-needed reality check to the mass euphoria after the summit
sessions and pointed to some of the difficulties ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that both sides are working hard to achieve peace, but
we can't expect them to abandon their political systems and
party-line rhetoric overnight,'' said a European ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects reunification of the peninsula soon. The stark
economic differences between the two Koreas and the astronomical
costs of merging them make reunification a distant prospect.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fueled by foreign investment, open markets, advanced technology
and entrepreneurial spirit, South Korea has become one of the
world's most economically successful democracies.
</P>
<P>
   But North Korea, by all accounts, is in dire straits.
Inefficient agriculture and devastating floods have created severe
food shortages. Most of its factories are dormant. In most regions,
there are virtually no paved roads, telephones or public
transportation. Economists have estimated that it could cost
hundreds of billions of dollars to integrate the two.
</P>
<P>
   How fast the two countries unify would largely depend on what
political changes occur in North Korea. Because North Korea remains
closed to the outside world, little is known about what effects the
summit meeting has had there. South Korean envoys who attended the
sessions said it was widely reported in newspapers and on radio and
television in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   But political experts said because Kim Jong Il's government so
tightly controlled what North Koreans see and think and the country
has been isolated so long, the meetings were highly unlikely to
have significant political effects soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim Jong Il's power has never been stronger, despite his
people's dismal economic situation,'' said Jo Dong-ho, an economist
for the Korean Development Institute, a private think tank in
Seoul. ``For change to take place, North Koreans have to become
aware that their difficulties arise from bad governance. But most
of them still believe that Kim Jong Il is great and all people on
this planet worship him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting may have had some repercussions in the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the notion that Kim Dae-jung's visit created a lot
of excitement in North Korea and that the recent broadcasts
reasserting revolutionary principles were designed to calm the
excitement there that reunification was near,'' said Yoon
Young-joong, who monitors North Korean broadcasts for the
Unification Ministry in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's propagandistic broadcasts are also being put
forward by South Korea's political opposition as evidence that Kim
Jong Il has not changed his ways. The opposition has criticized Kim
Dae-jung for not using the meetings to focus attention on the
hundreds of thousands of North Koreans who international aid
workers estimate have died because of famine and floods and the
government's failure to adopt agricultural and market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians also accused South Korean media of
presenting an unrealistically positive view of the summit meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just recently,'' Chung said, ``the South Korean media were
filled with images of starving North Korean children eating worms
from the ground just outside Pyongyang and elsewhere around the
country. But now the media have stopped showing these atrocities,
and the only thing they show are pretty images of Pyongyang.''

ORBITER SPOTS SIGNS OF A RECENT FLOW OF WATER ON MARS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A spacecraft orbiting Mars has sighted grooved
surface features suggesting a relatively recent water flow on the
planet, a finding that could redirect efforts to find evidence of
past or present life, experts said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, which has been conducting
photographic surveys of the planet for more than two years, has
spotted evidence of liquid water at, or near, the surface that
could have flowed a few hundred or a thousand years ago, a billion
years later than previous estimates, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration scheduled a
news conference for Thursday to discuss the findings after a day of
speculation about the discovery in the news media. A paper
describing the observations is to be published next week in the
journal Science, but the journal's editors decided to release the
information on Thursday because of the interest in the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Neither NASA nor the authors of the report, including Dr.
Michael C. Malin and Dr. Ken Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems
of San Diego, would disclose details of the study. But people
familiar with the report said high resolution pictures from Global
Surveyor clearly show channels and grooves on the steep, inside
walls of craters that indicate the downward flow of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs appear to be evidence of water in the upper
crust of Mars that has seeped through and run down the channels,
said two experts familiar with the report who spoke on the
condition that they not be named. Contrary to speculation about the
findings, there is no clear evidence of standing pools of water or
gushing springs on Mars, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current climate of Mars would cause surface water to
instantly freeze and vaporize into the atmosphere,'' one expert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Water is crucial to plans for exploring Mars with robot
spacecraft to find evidence of life, and for possible visits by
humans in the future. The United States has ambitious Mars
exploration plans that focus on finding water. Those plans are
being revised after the failure of two spacecrafts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's chief scientist, said future
orbiting and surface craft sent by the United States would search
for water and the life it can sustain. ``To find life on Mars, you
have to follow the water,'' Weiler has said. ``Without water, there
was no life as we know it in the past, and there is no life now.
It's all about the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Water on Mars would also make human visits more likely and more
economical, experts said, because astronauts could drink it, and it
could be broken down into oxygen to breathe and hydrogen to fuel
rockets and electricity-producing generators.
</P>
<P>
   Water has previously been detected on Mars in the form of ice
trapped at the poles, but until now no evidence of it had been seen
elsewhere. Because of the planet's extreme temperatures, with
average surface temperatures of minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and an
atmospheric pressure less than 1 percent that of Earth's, liquid
water would not exist long on the surface before evaporating into
the air and drifting off into space.
</P>
<P>
   But there is ample evidence of past water on the planet,
including channels and canyons formed by flowing rivers millions of
years ago and indications of upswelling ground waters. And last
year, scientists from Brown University said they found evidence in
Global Surveyor pictures, which are more than 20 times more
detailed than any previous photographs, of a giant ocean that once
existed in the northern lowlands that left behind beach and
shoreline features.

WHEN CHEFS EAT OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no secret that chefs and those in the food business around
town _ like all of us _ tire of their own cooking and need a break.
Even pressed for time, we'll often turn to little informal
neighborhood establishments to pick up a bite to eat.
</P>
<P>
   We asked some Los Angeles food professionals where they grab
takeout sustenance _ and what menu items in particular they favor.
</P>
<P>
   Once or twice a week Swiss-born Ueli Huegli, chef/owner of the
Matterhorn Chef, Valley Glen travels up the street to El Patron in
Van Nuys to pick up the tortilla soup. ``It's excellent as it is
nice and light _ not heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, he also picks up the seafood platter with marinated
octopus, shrimp, oysters and clams along with the restaurant's
terrific salsas, guacamole and chips.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally for lunch, he even grabs the imperial platter _ a
combination of teriyaki, tempura, sukiyaki and other items _ at the
Mikado in North Hollywood for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   A chef is very easy to please, he said. ``Give me a piece of
bread and some good quality cheese and I'm happy. I like plain food
and home cooking.'' High on his list of preferred cheeses is
cambozola _ a delicious combination of camembert and gorgonzola _
that he buys at Trader Joe's and eats with french bread.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Berk, co-editor of the Zagat Los Angeles/Southern
California restaurant and Marketplace surveys and co-owner of the
Seasonal Table cooking school, says she doesn't eat chain fast food
but will indulge in quick takeout food from time to time. When she
does, she likes something delicious and nurturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be a good fix. If I'm going to go off my usual
healthy eating routine, then I want to pull out all stops and get
something that is satisfying and worth the calories, fat and
carbos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pizza is really good at Frankie &AMP; Johnnie's on San Vicente
in Brentwood _ and I can go there late at night and get takeout.''
She opts for a vegetarian pizza with cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Another of her favorite takeout establishments when she's in a
hurry is California Chicken Cafe in Santa Monica (other locations
in Encino, West Los Angeles and Los Angeles) which has good wrap
sandwiches. She always orders them with mustard instead of
mayonniase including the Avocado Turkey Wrap, which is high on her
perferred list. Another good bet is Reddi-Chick in the Brentwood
Country Mart. ``I pick up whole rotisserie chickens there, but they
also have ribs, barbecued beef and baked potatoes.'' And in the
Valley, she raves about the rolled sandwich creations (``I get the
falafel stuffed sandwich when I'm feeling decadent'') at the
Tarzana Armenian Grocery. It's filled with pickled peppers.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to takeout for parties, Berk picks up Greek food
like moussaka, grape leaves, Greek salad and other traditional
items from Delphi in Westwood. When she's in the mood for Middle
Eastern fare on her entertaining menus, she purchases fattoush
(bread salad), tabbouleh and babaganoush from Marouch in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Berk is frustratated that Los Angeles has never been able to
support the kind of quality takout that is available in places like
New York (which has Zabar's, for instance) and San Francisco. ``I
think it is because we are a car culture _ not a walking culture _
and people are into one-stop shopping at supermarkets for
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Samson, executive chef, Posto in Sherman Oaks, likes to
dine in or takeout from Thai Original BBQ Restaurant in Studio City
on his days off. Although he grew up in Tarzana eating Northern
Italian food (his mother is from Bologna), he now enjoys spicy
food. He opts for some of the cold spicy appetizers such as spicy
grilled shrimp with red onions and cucumbers, or ground chicken
cooked and served as a salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often get a craving for spicy food and find the flavors
invigorating.'' He also orders a half grilled or barbecued chicken
which has a sauce with lots of honey and nice barbecue flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Samson is also an In-N-Out Burger fan. ``It's as L.A. as (it)
can be.'' His must-have favorite there is a double-double
cheeseburger with grilled onions and no sauce.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he routinely stops by Mel's Drive-In in Sherman Oaks
for breakfast and scarfs down whole grain pancakes, fruit salad,
fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee before heading a few doors
down to the kitchen at Posto.
</P>
<P>
   ``No city I have ever lived in _ including New York _ does fast
food as well as L.A. _ particularly the burgers at In-N-Out and
Mexican food.'' He loves tortas from little Mexican places.
</P>
<P>
   When Toluca Lake resident, Rodolfo Costella, proprietor of Ca'
del Sole in Universal City, wants to pick up a quick bite, he heads
to Poquito Mas on Cahuenga Boulevard in Studio City (other
locations in Burbank, North Hollywood, West Hollywood) for soft
beef and chicken tacos. He tops them with spicy green jalapeno
sauce from the salsa bar (offering numerous selections from mild to
hot).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then I have a craving for them. It gives me a
break from Italian food _ and they're fast and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally he goes to Bob's Big Boy in Toluca Lake for a
cheeseburger and french fries which he dips in mayonnaise. ``I
picked up the mayonnaise habit when I was living in Holland,'' said
the native of Venice, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Naylor, executive chef at Granita in Malibu, makes a
trip once of twice a week to Pane Dolce on Montana Avenue in Santa
Monica for the fresh buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomato and fresh
basil sandwich on sourdough bread with garlic basil mayonnaise and
fresh lemonade. The neighborhood place makes all kinds of great
sandwiches to order. ``I like it because the place uses high
quality, fresh ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   Naylor said she never gets bored or tires of eating at the
restaurant because the creations are constantly changing and she is
contantly eating new things.
</P>
<P>
   She also frequents Il Sogno Dolce on Montana Ave. most mornings
to pick up one of their great giant blueberry scones. They also
have good antipasto salads and other items.
</P>
<P>
   When she is cooking barbecue items for July 4 dining at the
restaurant and for catered parties, she picks up a variety of fresh
chiles at a little Mexican place _ Gallegos Mexican Deli on
Broadway in Santa Monica. As a treat for her restaurant co-works,
she also picks up plenty of chicken chile verde tamales.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Scrimgeour, executive chef, Saddle Peak Lodge, Calabasas,
favors Pomodoro restaurant in Westwood and Nagao in Santa Monica.
He opts for picking up spaghetti with meatballs at Pomodoro (``the
restaurant has a really mean meatball sauce''), antipasto, salad or
penne pasta with vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the price Nagao (a neighborhood sushi bar) has the best
sushi in Los Angeles,'' said the Paris-trained chef who grew up
eating an eclectic and cosmopolitan mix of foods. ``I love eating
all kinds of different foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Peel, chef-owner of Campanile restaurant in Los Angeles,
frequents Zankou Chicken on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood (other
locations in Van Nuys, Glendale and Pasadena) where he picks up a
whole chicken, grape leaves, hummus, tabbouleh, moutabal and plenty
of extra garlic sauce. His three children _ ranging in age from 6
to 17 _ love it. They also enjoy the plain cheese (he likes
pepperoni) pizza from Village Pizzeria in Larchmont village. Other
times he opts to have pizza and pastas delivered from Angeli Caffe
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saverio Posarelli, chef/owner, Padri in Agoura Hills,
loves Italian food, he doesn't want to eat it when he has a day
off. Instead, the Westlake Village resident goes for barbecue at
Adobe Cantina in Agoura Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the tritip sandwich with extra hot and spicy barbecue
sauce (referred to as turbo) along with coleslaw and barbecue
beans. They also have good pork ribs and Mexican food.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's in the Encino area, he picks up curried chicken, pad
thai noodles, fried rice and thai ice tea at Thai 'N I in Encino.
</P>
<P>
   Italia Deli on Thousand Oaks Boulevard in Agoura Hills has a
terrific meatball sandwich. The rolls and meatballs are soft _ and
the sandwich is filled with mozzarella, parmigianas and marinara
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to eat a variety of food,'' said Posarelli, adding that
``when someone else is cooking, it's always better. It's fun to
take out food.'' Posarelli believes it's important for chefs to
keep their eyes open and have different food experiences _ and keep
in touch with what's going on foodwise.
</P>
<P>
   When time is short, Jackie Ravel Knezevich, owner, BakeAway, Los
Angeles, has Baja Fresh in Studio City whip up a custom low-fat
burrito for her two to three times a week to take home for dinner.
It's a flour tortilla filled with black beans, grilled chicken,
shredded lettuce and pico de gallo. She puts a little green
tomatillo salsa on top and eats it with knife and fork. ``That's my
meal _ it's about 600 calories total. I love the flavor _ and it is
healthy and delicious. I watch my calories whenever I go
anywhere.'' And even when she picks up a Chinese Chicken Salad at
Chin Chin in Studio City, she requests low-fat dressing.
</P>
<P>
   When Phyllis Vaccarelli, owner Let's Get Cooking, Westlake
Village, craves ribs, she picks them up at Wood Ranch BBQ &AMP; Grill
in Agoura Hills. When she's pressed for time, she might opt for the
Chinois Chicken Salad at Wolfgang Puck's takeout counter in
Gelson's Westlake Village store, poached salmon with mustard sauce
from the market's fresh deli or a cooked duck at Bristol Farms in
Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   So when time is at a premium and there's no time to cook, get a
taste of what the chefs and foodies around town enjoy. There are
plenty of options.

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Colored charts and graphs in hand, Vice
President Al Gore Wednesday compared his retirement savings plan
with Republican presidential rival George W. Bush's, telling Iowans
that his plan offers them twice as much retirement income as the
Texas governor's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the choice in this election,'' Gore told carpenters
union members and other supporters in Des Moines. ``Are you for
working people or not? That's the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his plan, which would provide government matching
funds to help those earning under $100,000 a year to build a nest
egg in addition to Social Security, would generate more than
$28,000 a year for an average retiree _ $15,877 from Social
Security and $12,345 from their own retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan, he said, would leave average workers retiring in
2037 with $12,663, less than the current guaranteed benefit from
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a study by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities,
Gore said Bush's plan, which would allow workers to divert a
percentage of their Social Security payroll taxes into private
retirement investment accounts, would take $1 trillion from the
Social Security trust fund and bankrupt the system by 2023, rather
than the current estimate of 2037.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Gore said his plan would extend Social Security
through at least 2054 by shoring up the system with interest saved
from debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Los Angeles Wednesday, anticipated Gore's
attack and said he welcomes the debate on a crucial national issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2037, there's not going to be enough payers to
support the retired baby boomers, and if nothing is done, no reform
is in place, we're either going to have to raise taxes or reduce
benefits,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his plan would allow younger workers to manage some of
their money in the private sector and take advantage of compound
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really important to make sure the system survives,''
Bush said. ``I'm strong on my position because it's the right way
to go in my judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to portray the Republican presidential candidate as
dedicated to helping only the wealthy and himself as the candidate
of working people, Gore also attacked pending legislation to repeal
the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Republican-backed plan, passed by the House earlier
this month with the help of some Democrats and awaiting action in
the Senate, would benefit only the wealthiest taxpayers, since
smaller estates are exempt from the taxes anyway. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A business or farm left to heirs by a couple is exempt from
estate tax if its value is under $2.6 million. Gore would raise
that exemption to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That would eliminate estate taxes for more than 90 percent of
family farmers and more than 70 percent of small business owners,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some on Capitol Hill believe we should completely repeal the
estate tax and give a massive tax break to the wealthiest
Americans. Under their plan, fully half the benefits go to less
than 3,000 families. That's just not fair,'' Gore said. ``These are
the priorities of Congress. Instead of just making it easier to
pass on a family farm, they want to give away the store to those
who already own the shopping center, and I'm not for that.''

MARKET PLACE: SEC FINES FORMER OWNER OF FOUNDERS ASSET MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif.)   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regulators have suspended and fined the former owner of Founders
Asset Management, which manages more than $8 billion, for failing
to disclose that some of the firm's clients paid excessive
commissions on stock trades in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Erik Borgen, the sole owner of Founders during the
three-year period in question, agreed to a 180-day suspension from
the investment business to settle the complaint by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Borgen will also pay a $590,000 fine, representing the profits
that Founders made on the affected clients during that time. Mellon
Financial Corp., which bought Founders from Borgen in April 1998,
will pay an additional $50,000, although the SEC did not cite any
problems at Founders since Mellon acquired the company.
</P>
<P>
   Borgen, who is now president of Borgen Investment Group, did not
admit or deny any wrongdoing under the settlement, reached last
week. A lawyer for Borgen said he had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The fine and suspension add to the recent spate of aggressive
enforcement actions from the commission. In the last 10 days, the
SEC has taken action against former officers of Cendant, who it
said participated in a fraud at what used to be CUC International
for more than a dozen years; a nationwide series of microcap fraud
rings, and several people who traded on insider information in a
Bay Networks acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said that Borgen caused some Founders clients, though
not the company's mutual fund clients, to pay excessive brokerage
commissions as a way to compensate a broker who had placed the
clients with Founders. The clients did not know that they were
being overcharged, according to the commission. In addition, the
trades were made later than those for other Founders clients, and
so were usually done at less favorable prices, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of this case is on disclosure, and the
responsibility of investment advisers to fully disclose their
commission policies and their execution policy,'' said Don Hoerl,
associate regional director of the SEC's office in Denver, which
brought the case.
</P>
<P>
   The commission charged that the excessive commissions were paid
to brokerage companies affiliated with William O. Foster, a San
Diego broker who persuaded more than 40 of his clients to invest
$123 million with Founders. ``Founders did so at Borgen's direction
in order to provide Foster with a prearranged amount of brokerage
commissions in exchange for Foster referring clients,'' the SEC
asserted in its complaint. By failing to disclose the practice,
Borgen violated securities law, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Foster, who simultaneously agreed to a $25,000 fine
and 30-day suspension from the industry in a similar SEC case that
did not name Founders, said Foster had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Founders spokeswoman said the company had changed its rules
and now treats all its clients fairly. ``In 1995, when these
practices came to light, Founders proactively addressed them,''
said the spokeswoman, Bridget Richards. ``This matter did not
involve the operations of our mutual funds. It was strictly a small
number of small private accounts.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archaeology as a search for hidden truth is a central theme of
Michael Ondaatje's new novel, ``Anil's Ghost,'' and was very much
on his mind during a recent interview. ``Writing is a kind of
archaeological act,'' he said. ``In all my books there is a
discovery of a story. You're unearthing and you're learning. The
drama is to find out about the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   For him a novel is both intuitive and exploratory. He said that
when he begins a book he never knows the outcome or even the full
cast of characters. People suddenly appear, assume identities and
move the narrative forward. All this was true of ``The English
Patient,'' Ontaadje's Booker Prize-winning novel (and later an
Oscar-winning film), and it is true of ``Anil's Ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   In his novels Ondaatje writes about displaced persons, people
who are unsure of where they belong and to whom they owe their
allegiance: the title character and the Sikh demolitions expert in
``The English Patient,'' Anil Tissera and other characters in
``Anil's Ghost.'' Anil is a young forensic anthropologist who
returns from the United States to her homeland, Sri Lanka, on a
humanitarian mission. She joins forces with an archaeologist to
investigate possible war crimes. The principal subject of their
investigation is the skeleton of what appears to be a victim of
torture.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ondaatje is also a poet, his books are often called
poetic novels, a label he greets with dismay: ``I'm not sure I
would go out of my way to take poetic novels to a desert island.''
For him, the interplay between his poetry and his fiction is far
more subtle. ``William Carlos Williams talked about a poem as
something that didn't have any extra parts in it,'' he said. The
idea of distillation is carried over into his fiction. This means
that his novels are ``tighter, more contained, more suggestive.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time they are filled with haunting imagery. In
``Anil's Ghost'' Anil is told the story of the excavation of a
lacquered coffin of an ancient Chinese ruler, buried alongside 20
female musicians. The bodies were bones, but the musical
instruments _ drums, zithers, bells _ survived. In the fifth
century B.C. music was regarded as a moral and spiritual force.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense Anil is a stand-in for the author, who left Sri Lanka
at 11 and grew up in London, where his mother lived after
separating from his father. Later he emigrated to Canada. Now 56,
he is a Canadian citizen of Indian, Dutch and Sinhalese ancestry,
and the book represents his own homecoming to Sri Lanka. This is
the first of his four novels to take place in his native country,
he said, although he has dealt with it before in his poetry and in
his memoir, ``Running in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka is, in fact, the reason for the book. He began with a
place, a time and an event: a civil war in the mid 1980s. ``I
didn't want it to be a tract against Sri Lanka,'' he said. ``I
wanted to catch that state of the world, people in that kind of
situation, which was a nightmare.'' He intended his story to have
emanations of battles in other countries, like Bosnia and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not want to write about Sri Lanka from the point
of view of someone who lived there permanently. Instead he chose as
his protagonist ``someone who was a stranger but who had come from
that country.'' Anil's insights are shadowed by memories from her
childhood. To give an added perspective he decided to make the
protagonist a woman ``who had been liberated by living in the West
and was now in a country that was a male world.'' That choice, he
said, ``gave me an extra pair of glasses and allowed me to see the
place differently.''
</P>
<P>
   As Anil and the archaeologist, Sarath, investigate the mystery
of the unknown victim, they themselves and others in their lives
are revealed: ``The searchers, the detectives, are the ones who are
being discovered in the novel,'' Ondaatje said. ``We learn how they
have been created by their past.'' The ``real forensics'' in the
book are about these characters and Sarath's brother, and about an
artist who paints eyes on statues of Buddha but is forbidden to
look at the face of the deity.
</P>
<P>
   When Ondaatje began the book, all he knew about Sarath was that
he would be Anil's foil, that he would be more languid in contrast
to her enthusiasm and determination. At their first meeting, Sarath
is noncommittal, offering the equivalent of ``the Asian nod,''
which is a ``very hesitant head roll that means yes and no,'' the
author said. ``It's the kind of thing Henry James should have been
doing a lot of.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point the novel was a matter of accretion, growth and
constant revision. Ondaatje's own obsession is with revising, one
reason that it took him eight years to finish the novel, his first
since ``The English Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the incidents in the new book are drawn from fact;
others are invention, for example the astonishing adventure of a
surgeon who is kidnapped by rebels and forced to operate on the
wounded behind the lines. The rebels also kidnap a nurse and steal
medical supplies. The doctor soon finds himself totally caught up
in his rescue work.
</P>
<P>
   Everything of course is filtered through the author's
imagination, which often approaches that of such magic realists as
Gabriel Garcia Marquez. ``When I read Marquez for the first time,''
he said, ``it was like realism to me. It was like Sri Lanka.'' His
most Marquezian book is his memoir, a fanciful dream journey
through the lives of his parents and their relatives, eccentrics
including an uncle who was killed when a hunting companion mistook
him for a wild boar. In the memoir he says that from his mother he
received his sense of the dramatic, from his father secrecy and
reclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He also writes of strange Sri Lankan traditions: it is believed
that if a child eats the tongue of a thalagoya, a crocodile-like
reptile, he becomes brilliant. Ondaatje did not partake of this
``repulsive creature.'' But in his own way, without artificial
intelligence or training as a writer, he embarked on a brilliant
career in which his literary reputation is matched by his
popularity. Both ``The English Patient'' and ``Anil's Ghost'' are
best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Ondaatje, who went to Canada because his brother Christopher was
there, did not start writing until he was in his early 20s. ``I
didn't know I wanted to be a writer,'' he said. ``There hadn't been
a burning desire.'' But in Canada he felt a sudden freedom and a
realization that ``I could attempt anything, I could be a writer or
a filmmaker.'' (He has made two documentary films.)
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by a teacher at the University of Toronto, he began
writing poetry, which ranged from the domestic to the mythological.
His first book of poetry was published in 1967. In 1970 he wrote
``The Collected Works of Billy the Kid,'' which was part poem, part
historical novel, and was subsequently dramatized onstage. Since
then he has alternated between poetry and fiction. He and his wife,
Linda Spalding, live in Toronto, where they edit Brick, a literary
journal.
</P>
<P>
   His first novel, ``Coming Through Slaughter,'' inspired by the
life of the jazzman Buddy Bolden, was, he said, ``a mental
landscape, where you put yourself and real people into an imagined
situation.'' ``Anil's Ghost'' was different: fictional people on a
real landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone who has been very much a migrant in my life and as
a writer,'' he said, ``one of the things you envy is Faulkner's
postage stamp of Yoknapatawpha County or Alice Munro's southwest
Ontario. That is the opposite of me, but in some odd way in this
book, there is a landscape I knew very well.''

 &HT;    EDS: Advance story for Sunday, June 25.
 &HT;    A museum of a different color'
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA - Apart from the traditional sites of this seat of
onetime Austrian royalty is a quite-uncommon house whose courtyard
faces the Danube Canal in a neighborhood where there are no
palaces.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the building appear unusual are the windows.
</P>
<P>
   No two are alike.
</P>
<P>
   This is KunstHausWien, a privately-operated and sponsored museum
that pays homage to the art and architectural representations of a
most unusual man, Friedensreich Hundertwasser. ``Unusual'' might
not be adequate to describe him; ``eccentric'' likely is better,
``bizarre'' also fitting _ and ``creative genius'' perhaps most
precise.
</P>
<P>
   In KunstHausWien, you won't find any crown jewels, or chamber
pots some little prince used.
</P>
<P>
   Hundertwasser, who died in February at the age of 71, was a
contemporary artist much of whose prominence was attained through
architectural designs that turned ordinary into unique: a gruesome
district heating plant with a new skin of tiles, lights and bright
colors; a traditional church belltower renovated to include a gold
onion dome and exterior ceramics; a somewhat candy-striped roadside
restaurant that surpasses any unconventional equivalent in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   What also set Hundertwasser apart from others, in addition to
lecturing in the nude (flanked, of course, by two corresponding
unclad females), was his passion for the ``right of window.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own words, Hundertwasser proclaimed, ``Each individual
window has its own right to life.'' Translated, he was saying that
uniform windows on buildings were a manner of conformity from which
he felt the world should rebel.
</P>
<P>
   There's where the KunstHausWien comes in. In 1991, the already
internationally-recognized Hundertwasser took a commonplace former
furniture factory and recreated it as his legacy. Not only were all
the windows made to be different, but much of the floors were
reconfigured uneven; a rise here, a decline there _ like walking in
the woods but you are inside a house.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hundertwasser's position that people who lived inside
buildings have a right to stamp their cachet on those buildings.
Anything within arm's reach outside the window was fair game for
the occupant to design to his or her own desires. The window
casements even could be altered. As a suggestive template,
Hundertwasser designed the building that he described as ``a
``colorful spot in the cheerless, monotonous and sterile face of
the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Externally, the shape of the windows, the paint and/or tiles
around them, depict a cacophony of color and style that somehow
makes sense. On the inside, Hundertwasser's representative art, a
contemporary corollary to what fellow Austrian Gustav Klimt
expressed a century earlier, fills the walls and display cases, a
monument to his creativity and his adroitness for performing
cosmetic surgery on unattractive buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Hundertwasser's diverse talents even brought him to designing
postage stamps and redesigning national flags, none of the latter
having been accepted but which represented his utopian beliefs. As
an example, he designed a flag for the Holy Land; not Israel, not a
Palestinian State but for what he idealistically called the Holy
Land. It has a white background with a green Star of David sitting
atop a horizontally-drawn green Muslim-representative crescent, an
artistic wish that coexistence would be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   On the lower floors of this unusual building, Hundertwasser's
paintings, graphics and architectural prototypes are numerous. So
are his decrees: ``If we do not honor our past, we lose our future.
If we destroy our roots, we cannot grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``The straight line is godless.''
</P>
<P>
   It is to the latter that Hundertwasser most addressed himself.
Straight lines are difficult to find in KunstHausWien.
Nevertheless, his contemporary style can please even
tradition-bound devotees, among which included the Austrian critic
Wieland Schmiel who admitted that his original unfavorable
assessment of Hundertwasser was colored by the unusualness of the
artist himself rather than the hypothetical, yet controlled, images
he was painting.
</P>
<P>
   Hundertwasser's philosophy of life dominates. To attempt to
explain it, his theories of space, of mind, of environment, would
require much the space taken by those lower floors. He has a
philosophy about everything, not always in concert with his other
philosophies. That's what makes his house so exciting; so eclectic.
He takes us on adventures into multiple facets of life, all with
artistic creation.
</P>
<P>
   The upper floors, reachable via a giddy, lumpy staircase provide
exhibition space for other artists and artisans.
</P>
<P>
   Born as Friedrich Stowasser in Vienna of a Jewish mother and
Aryan father, that he and his mother came through the Nazi period
in that city is salient, if not mysterious inasmuch as more than 60
of his maternal side perished in the Holocaust. This is not a
hidden period of Hundertwasser's life (there is a photo displayed
of him in the museum, showing him as a school child posing in a
classroom with crossed Nazi swastika flags in the background) but
puzzling in that the mother and son (the father died in 1929) not
only survived but seemed to fit into the pattern of day-to-day
living in a Nazi-controlled society. He adopted his professional
name in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   A biographer, Pierre Restany, devoted but three sentences to
that period of Hundertwasser's life. A guide at KunstHausWien said
he was unable to answer my question as to how the Hundertwassers,
despite their Jewish linkage, endured _ not because of anything
protective but simply because he didn't know, that it wasn't an
issue to which he felt he needed answers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundertwasser was too young to be involved in anything political
then but his later blossoming as an artist brought worldwide
acclaim. In 1981, Austria awarded him the country's highest honor
for culture, the Austrian State Prize. He toured extensively and,
at times, lived in France and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   (According to Associated Press, Hundertwasser's first
architectural creation in New Zealand was a public toilet made of
colorful tiles and wine bottles, with no straight lines and a roof
that was covered with vegetation including marijuana plants.)
</P>
<P>
   It was on a cruise aboard the QE2 from New Zealand that the
outspoken critic of nuclear power had a heart attack and died
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   His endowment to the world of art and architecture is intact in
the strange house alongside the Danube Canal. In the course of
doing the Vienna thing, palaces, royal apartments and treasure
caches are plentiful. Take a break from the glitz of royalty, try
the unique KunstHausWien.

OUTRAGE IN A SMALL ILLINOIS TOWN OVER HIGH COURT RULING ON PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill., Texas)  By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANO, Ill. _ Out for breakfast in a small-town restaurant,
Wanda Huffman, 42, led her children in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Then she shook her head in dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how long it will be,'' she said, ``before they tell
us we can't pray in public places.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffman was outraged by the ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on
Monday that student-led prayers at high school football games are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In this conservative small town, 58 miles west of Chicago, the
court ruling was seen as another attack on homespun values by
sneering elitists. Of more than two dozen people interviewed here,
not a single person defended the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, people despaired of an emerging American culture that
allows for gay Boy Scout leaders, but grows skittish about students
who want to pray. And they often saw the curbs on prayer as part of
a greater effort to impose government regulations, like gun
control. But more than anything, they saw it as a lapse of common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the trouble we're in because there's not enough
prayer,'' said Denise Spooner, standing outside the Wal-Mart store
on Route 34, as storm clouds gathered. ``If people are bothered by
a bunch of kids getting together to pray before a game, well, I
just don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court strongly reaffirmed its
earlier rulings against officially sponsored prayer in public
schools, saying that prayers led by students at high school
football games are no exception. The majority opinion by Justice
John Paul Stevens said that even when attendance was voluntary and
when the decision to pray was made by students, ``the delivery of a
pregame prayer has the improper effect of coercing those present to
participate in an act of worship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't be coerced to pray,'' said Jim Wasson, an
electrician, ``but I don't think that's what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But people in Plano, a town of 5,100 in the farm country west of
Chicago's suburbs, said they could not fathom that young people
would succumb to prayer out of peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to feel like they have to pray,'' said
Stephanie Briggs, 18. ``People in school like to do their own
thing. Besides that, the players all know each other. They know
their religious beliefs. It's not like some pregame prayer is going
to mean that much, or change their views.''
</P>
<P>
   To Shane Shelton, a 30-year-old construction worker, the whole
discussion seems a bit silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professional players are always praying on the field and
talking about God, and that doesn't seem to bother anybody,''
Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, who wore a bandana and shoulder-length hair, said he
was not a church-goer, and would not join in public prayer
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if somebody else wants to do that, what do I care?'' he
said. ``It's about freedom. Just let people pray, if that's what
they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Karen Wasson, 55, who owns the Tastee Treet ice cream stand in
Plano, lamented that American society had lost its moral bearings,
and that leaders were unwilling to speak the unvarnished truth
about right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is not respected,'' she said. ``Religion is not
respected. And authority is not respected. We won't stand up for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasson, who has been teaching Catholic religion classes for 18
years, said she was sometimes astonished at the cheeky behavior of
young people nowadays, even among those enrolled in religious
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things they say _ in my day, I would have been
smacked in the head so hard my head would rotate,'' she said.
``Some of these kids know more about the world at 12 than I did at
24. It's sad, really, that so many kids don't have the chance to
just be kids.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To Debbie Finley, 39, the court ruling seemed another example of
an extreme reaction. ``It's like all these schools getting rid of
their Christmas programs,'' she said. ``Everybody is afraid that
somebody is going to get offended.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Kelsey Finley, 16, plays basketball for the Serena
High School team, but said she saves her prayers for the Lutheran
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think praying before a game is going to help you
win,'' she said, with a smile. ``But if other people want to pray,
it doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Bildusas, a 34-year-old secretary, said her family
recently turned to home-schooling, in large part because it sensed
a hostility toward religion by the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be telling kids who want to pray, `More power to
you,''' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Spooner, the property manager, saw the court ruling as ``the
government stepping into your family's way,'' decreeing what kinds
of worship were permissible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, for the last 30 years, they've been reprogramming
us about what's right and wrong,'' she said. ``We're being watered
down in this country. But there's a higher power than the United
States government. We're all going to have to answer to God.''

   IRAN, EGYPT: DIRECT TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Presaging a possible warming of relations between two mutually
suspicious nations, the presidents of Egypt and Iran spoke by
telephone in what may be the first direct top-level contact since
their countries broke off ties after Egypt's peace treaty with
Israel in 1979. The occasion for the conversation was Iran's bid to
join the so-called G15 group of developing nations, which ended a
two-day meeting in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN: 2 WOMEN FREED
</P>
<P>
   Two Iranian women who were jailed in May after attending a
Berlin seminar on democracy were released after posting about
$60,000 each in bail. Mehrangiz Kar and Shahla Lahiji, women's
rights figures who have been denounced by religious conservatives,
are charged with endangering Iran's security. Four others arrested
after attending the Berlin conference remain in prison.

<P>
   ISRAEL: CRISIS MOVE
</P>
<P>
   The leftist Meretz Party paved the way for a resolution to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's coalition crisis. Meretz said it would stay
in the coalition to support Barak's peace moves, but that its three
ministers, including Education Minister Yossi Sarid, would give up
their cabinet posts. That should help bring back the linchpin Shas
Party, which has been in a feud with Sarid and quit the government,
with resignations that do not take effect until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: SETTLER TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he had decided to open a
``continous dialogue'' with settlers, who have been protesting
regularly outside his residence and office. His office said he had
told his ministers and peace negotiators to visit settlements and
listen to settlers' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: BARGAINING CHIPS
</P>
<P>
   Parliament passed a preliminary bill enabling Israel to imprison
``combatants not entitled to prisoner-of-war status.'' The bill is
meant to enable Israel to continue holding two Lebanese militants
seized as bargaining chips for missing Israeli soldiers. After a
High Court ruling outlawed the practice the government sought to
create a legal justification for their detention.

   The Security Council extended for one year a Bosnia mission that
includes a 1,600-member international police force sent to create a
multiethnic local force from Muslims, Serbs and Bosnian Croats.
Russia abstained in protest at the exclusion of Yugoslavia from a
conference in Brussels on Bosnia's future, China also spoke against
the exclusion of President Slobodan Milosevic's government from the
conference, but voted for the mission's extension.

 &HT;    Sister cities have much in common
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Shhhh. It's a well-kept secret in both places,
it seems, but Atlanta and Taipei are Sister Cities.
</P>
<P>
   They have been since 1979, and, though the relationship is a
nominal one, as such ties often are, the fit in this case is better
than most.
</P>
<P>
   Mat Matich, a University of Georgia graduate who moved here a
couple of years ago, was discussing the similarities between
Atlanta and Taipei while nursing a drink at the Lai Lai Sheraton
Hotel one recent evening.
</P>
<P>
   Matich, who claims to speak Chinese with a Southern accent, came
here seeking adventure and now works as a writer for Topics
magazine, a publication of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Like Atlanta, Taipei might not be a great place to visit, but it
is a great place to live, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say visitors can't find attractions amid the
bustling din of this densely populated Asian metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   John Flick, international spokesperson for United Parcel
Service, has visited the city off and on for a decade and thinks,
for instance, that it ``has probably the best museums in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, the National Palace Museum, houses the world's
finest collection of Chinese art, spanning nearly 5,000 years. It's
emblematic of the links between the island of Taiwan and mainland
China. The vast collection was China's national treasure until it
was carted here, in 4,800 crates, for safe-keeping when the
Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek fled the mainland after
being defeated in a civil war with the communists.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors with a taste for Asian cuisine can also find plenty to
whet their appetites. Taipei's food-loving residents take pride in
their city's reputation as a unique center for all styles of Asian
cuisine, and they boast that the variety is even greater than in
the international melting pot of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is the culture,'' said Fred Chiou, an Internet company
executive with a doctorate in engineering from Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Chiou, like Matich, sees many similarities between these two
cities which are a half-globe apart.
</P>
<P>
   Like Atlanta, Taipei, with a population of 2.7 million intown
and more than 4 million in the metro area, is a regional business
center with a love of healthy profit margins. And, like Atlanta, it
has boomed in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Atlanta's suburbs have sprawled over what were once
cotton fields, Taipei's glass-faced high rises stretch for miles
into what, in the 1960s, were rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   Both cities are also raucously democratic, and this week at
least you could make a case for comparing two of their most famous
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   One of Atlanta's best-known figures is a former U.S. president,
Jimmy Carter, who has made a reputation as a global peacemaker. One
of Taipei's _ immediate past mayor Chen Shui-bian _ was inaugurated
just last month as president of the Republic of China on Taiwan and
this week launched a peacemaking campaign of his own. Apparently
inspired by the example of the two Koreas, which met in a historic
summit in Pyongyang, Chen called Tuesday for a similar meeting with
China to ease the long-running tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   The two cities also share a leading corporate citizen, United
Parcel Service. UPS, which is based in Atlanta, provided frenzied
support for victims of last year's devastating earthquake in
central Taiwan. It has operated out of Taipei since 1988 and has
made the East Asian city its key hub for the Asia-Pacific region.
Pictures of UPS planes _ which make 68 flights a week out of
Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek international airport _ are featured in a
multi-media production Taiwan's government proudly shows visiting
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese ``are very pro-business, and they've been very
good about helping us out,'' said Flick, adding that his company
has also invested heavily in related businesses in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal world, Chiou, who lived 15 years in Georgia and
expects to return once his son reaches college age, said he would
spend his days in Atlanta and his nights in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Even the nights here are not necessarily so different, however.
</P>
<P>
   True, at the crowded night markets, you can visit a Chinese
medicine practitioner or even watch a vendor tease a snake before
killing it to be eaten.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Atlanta bar scene is more to your liking, you can
find its equivalent by dropping in at the Hollywood Underground at
the Far Eastern Plaza, where on some nights patrons dressed as
movie stars are admitted free. Saturdays bring ``Saturday Night
Fever'' events at the TMC Disco, or you can stop by on a Monday _
Energy Night _ and get a free cocktail if you wear workout gear.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Hong Kong rival or surpass the United States in
influence on popular culture, but there is ample American influence
if you look for it.
</P>
<P>
   Cable TV is widely available and provides a fair sampling of
American shows. Yah-chiTsai, an interpreter for English-speaking
visitors, especially likes decorator maven Martha Stewart's show.
``I think she is a genius,'' Tsai gushed.
</P>
<P>
   But if you prefer ball over decorating, you can take in a
baseball game, watching teams from one of two professional leagues.
In one of them, Taipei's Suns compete against the Braves _ of
Chiayi.
</P>
<P>
   Even the weather of the cities ``is very similar,'' said Chiou,
who moved back in March.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical sultry day, women stroll down the street carrying
umbrellas to block out the sun. And that typical Taipei weather
influenced one foreign visitor to propose a new slogan for the
city, Tsai recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to describe Taipei he would use three H's,'' she said.
``Hot, humid and hospitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan sums up her town well, Tsai thought. It might also
apply to that Sister community back in the American South.

PINK SLIPS PROLIFERATE IN THE DOT-COM WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Laura Schmidt took an Internet job 10 months ago
packed with promise: a big raise, stocks she figured could someday
be worth $5 million and the chance at early retirement.
Unfortunately, her leisure time came way too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Schmidt received a pink slip from ThirdAge
Media, a Web site for baby boomers, laid off in the Internet
industry's first significant shakeout. As quickly and aggressively
as they filled their cubicles last year, dozens of dot-coms across
the country are unloading employees in an effort to meet a
seemingly obvious goal heretofore put on indefinite hold: Make a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs signal an end to the unbounded optimism of some
dot-com employees who flocked to start-ups in hopes of developing
sudden wealth, but who now say they are approaching new job offers
with more caution. And the very stock market that once held the
keys to new wealth now may be equally responsible not just for
lowered expectations, but for lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts say the reversal of fortune for many companies,
and their employees, can be traced in part to stock market turmoil
on April 14. When the Nasdaq plunged that day, investors signaled
they no longer would finance dot-coms that sought to grow at all
costs, ignoring, at least temporarily, the concept that successful
businesses take in more than they spend.
</P>
<P>
   While lots of Internet businesses with sound strategies and
healthy finances are continuing to thrive, the challenge these days
for a number of e-commerce companies is simply to keep from going
broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it old-fashioned, but at some point, these companies had
to start making money,'' said Douglas Henton, president of
Collaborative Economics, an economic advisory group in Palo Alto,
Calif., who called the phenomenon a healthy shakeout in which some
companies fail and others refine themselves. ``At some point, they
run out of money and they have to start laying off.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that have had to lay off workers include lesser-known
and big-name Web sites, including the health care site drkoop.com
Inc. (50 employees laid off, or 35 percent), carOrder.com Inc. (100
layoffs, or 33 percent), an insurance site called InsWeb (100
planned, or 40 percent), the home-furnishing site living.com (50,
or 13 percent), the search engine Alta Vista (50, about 6 percent)
and more than two dozens other sites for a total of more than 2,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not include a growing number of dot-coms that have
been subsumed in mergers or simply gone broke, including DEN.com,
an entertainment site in Los Angeles that employed 200,
APBnews.com, a New York-based crime news site with 140 workers, and
toysmart.com, a Disney-backed toy retailer in Waltham, Mass., with
170 employees that folded in May.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year even Amazon.com laid off 150 people, but that
represents just 2 percent of its work force and that move preceded
the market downturn that seems to be driving the latest layoff
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at many of the companies still in business say
layoffs do not suggest they are desperately low on cash, but that
they must plan for a future in which new infusions of capital are
not as easily obtained as they have been in the two previous years.
They say they are rewriting business models that had been
predicated on obtaining quick public offerings, which means that
some are being forced to cut costs by terminating employees, who
are the chief expense of many Internet enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hard,'' said T. Paul Thomas, president and chief
executive of TurboLinux, a Linux operating system vendor in San
Francisco, which cut roughly 50 of 300 employees last month. ``The
people we had to let go had been here an average of two or three
months. But investors, public and private, are saying you can't
just spend and spend. You have to get to profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news, economists say, is that the human toll appears
limited to individual dot-coms, that the number of employees laid
off represents a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of
members of the Internet work force, and that nearly all of those
who lost their jobs have skills that should help them easily obtain
jobs with other technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't any signals the economy is in trouble,'' said
Stephen Levy, director for the Center for Continuing Study of the
California Economy. ``The industry is doing well by any economic
measure. This is a company phenomenon, not an industry-wide or
economy-wide phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most dot-com employees seem surprisingly sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an auspicious time,'' said Schmidt, 33, who spent 10
months as director of brand design for ThirdAge Media, which cut 35
of its 140 jobs. ``I live in San Francisco. I'm just glad it
happened now rather than in two months when a lot more people will
be looking for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she saw the layoff as an opportunity for an extended
vacation before she starts her next job. But she also said she was
looking at prospective employers with new scrutiny to make sure
their business plan seemed viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine that if I want a job by the end of next week,
I'd have one,'' she said. But, she added. ``I'm doing a lot more
research than I did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others who have been laid off say that no sooner did they
receive the news than they began interviewing again, sifting
through offers, taking new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of those receiving a pink slip are feeling rosy
about the experience. One 26-year-old woman hired in February by an
entertainment dot-com said she felt the company had misled her by
suggesting she could ``be retired by age 30.'' Instead, she was out
of a job three months later, having lost all her stock options
because she was not yet vested.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, she said the company had used her, then quickly
dismissed her when it came to its financial senses, and she said
she was concerned that other entrepreneurs would make similar
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very hopeful _ investors, employees _ and married
with greed, you've got a perfect formula for a lot of shady
companies,'' she said, requesting anonymity because she said she
had signed an agreement not to discuss the circumstances of her
departure from the company.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she was being very cautious when considering new
offers, hoping to avoid a repeat of the situation. And that is a
theme echoed not just by others who have been laid off, but also by
recruiters who are placing dot-com employees in new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Jodi M. Milam, who owns Career Wave, a human resources
consulting company in Chandler, Ariz., that focuses on placing
Internet employees around the country, said the layoff phenomenon
had become ``epidemic'' because so many companies were started
without sound business plans.
</P>
<P>
   Milam said the companies recruited new employees with the
promise they would soon attract a next round of private funding, or
even go public. But, Milam said, the entrepreneurs either were
naive about their own prospects, or misleading hires. They also
seemed, she said, to lay off employees _ even those who pulled up
stakes or were lured from other good jobs _ with little
compunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business ethics have gone down the toilet,'' she said, adding
that she wakes up with a stomachache every day because ``I'm afraid
of sending people to companies'' that will go under.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies say the layoffs represent a bona fide
realization that they must be mindful of the bottom line and of
what it takes to succeed in a harsher business climate. A number of
the companies said the layoffs signaled an effort to shift
directions, typically away from Internet businesses that focus on
selling to consumers and into ventures that sell to other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   An example is Alta Vista, a search engine company in Palo Alto,
Calif., that in early May reduced its staff by 50 people, or about
6 percent. Though the site processes a remarkable 50 million search
queries a day, the company decided that its long-term survivability
rested not just on being a destination site but also in licensing
its technology to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done a slight shift in strategic positioning following
the market turmoil,'' said David Emanuel, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, businesses are shedding ambitious plans and
renewing the narrow focus with which they began operations. InsWeb,
in Redwood City, Calif., in announcing plans to lay off 40 percent
of its 240 workers in the next six months, said it would return to
its roots, becoming a marketplace for consumers seeking insurance,
and scrap a number of other initiatives, according to Greg Jones,
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The new focus means the end of the line at InsWeb for Steve
Foster, 43, who quit a job in Los Angeles and moved north to take a
job in November as InsWeb's vice president of marketing research.
At the time, he said, it was ``literally the zenith of dot-com
times'' and he negotiated for a healthy raise and 19,000 shares of
stock.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, it looked as if his gamble would pay off in a
big way. The company's stock, $14 when he was recruited, jumped to
$36 in January, giving him a gain in personal value ``worth a
quarter of a million right off the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Foster was laid off with 30 colleagues two weeks ago.
Meanwhile, the price of the company's stock has fallen to $3,
making his options worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says he bears no ill will toward the company, which he
said had treated employees well and had never misled anyone about
the prospects. And as to his lost fortune _ the few brief shining
moments when his stock options ballooned in value _ he seems
philosophical about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking I'll keep a single share and frame it,'' he
said. ``Just to keep the memory alive.''

TELEFONICA CHAIRMAN UNDER PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chairman of the Spanish telecommunications giant that is
acquiring Internet portal Lycos Inc. is under investigation by
government regulators in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The probe, reopening an old controversy, centers on the purchase
and quick sale of options in his company's shares by Telefonica SA
chairman Juan Villalonga. Shares of Telefonica, its Terra Networks
Internet unit and Lycos all fell Wednesday on fears the review
could disrupt the merger.
</P>
<P>
   American analysts Wednesday cautioned the new investigation
might be politically motivated, however, while its financial impact
is unclear. Telefonica would not comment, though a Terra executive
called the inquiry ``no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny at least seemed to underscore Villalonga's
controversial tenure at the head of one of Spain's largest
businesses and a former state-owned monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish newspaper Wednesday reported that Spain's National
Securities Market Commission is looking into whether Villalonga
acted improperly when he bought options on roughly a
quarter-million shares in Telefonica in 1998, then sold them two
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had previously investigated the trades and
declined to take action. But in a story confirmed by company
officials, the newspaper El Mundo reported the commission had begun
a new inquiry, which seemed to center on whether Villalonga bought
the options after he began talks about an alliance with WorldCom
Inc. (The two companies announced the alliance in March 1998).
</P>
<P>
   The probe is only the latest move by the Spanish government
against Telefonica. Last month, officials blocked Villalonga's
planned $58 billion merger with the Dutch phone company Royal KPN.
Members of the Spanish securities commission weren't available to
discuss their reasoning Wednesday, and it could be years before the
body issues its finding.
</P>
<P>
   Following the news report, Telefonica's American-share
equivalents shares fell $2.50 to close at $58.25 in Nasdaq trading.
Shares in its majority-owned Terra Networks unit, which would
technically acquire Lycos, shares slipped 13 cents to close at
$36.89.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos shares, meanwhile, fell $4.88 to $54, down from a high of
more than $72.63 the day the deal was announced. That's still above
the $38 at which Lycos traded in late April, before sales talk
began.
</P>
<P>
   Abel Linares, managing director of Terra Networks, said the
investigation wouldn't disrupt the proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no problem for Terra,'' said Linares, who is slated to
become chief operating officer of the combined company, Terra
Lycos. The company will be based in Barcelona but is planning to
expand the Lycos offices in Waltham, Mass. Linares attributed the
share declines to ``normal trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are watching the share prices as Villalonga attempts
to use his company's stock to turn Telefonica into a global player
in the consolidating media business.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he announced an agreement in which Terra Networks
would purchase Lycos Inc. for stock then valued at $12.5 billion.
The combination would become a global competitor of other media
giants, including the company to be formed as America Online
proposes to buy Time Warner Inc. Germany's Bertelsmann AG, a
one-time ally of AOL, also pledged to buy $1 billion worth of
advertising and services from Terra Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   While Terra shareholders have approved the merger, Lycos holders
aren't expected to vote on the deal until later this summer. A year
ago, Lycos stockowners rejected a merger proposal as undervaluing
the company. Paul Noglows, analyst for Chase H &AMP; Q in San
Francisco, said he's heard from ``most institutional holders of
Lycos stock'' that they will support the merger, though he declined
to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is up to Villalonga to keep his backers in line. That
might be an accomplishment for the 47-year-old, who has riled
Spain's relatively closed business establishment even as he has
increased the company's market value. He spends much of his time in
Miami, where Terra threw a lavish party last week, worrying some in
Europe that Telefonica's center of gravity is shifting across the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Some Spanish Socialists have also suggested that the purchase of
Lycos would dillute Terra's Spanish character.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga tried to rebut that criticism earlier this month,
when he told shareholders that Terra Lycos ``is and always will be
a Spanish company.''
</P>
<P>
   But continued problems with the government could be Villalonga's
undoing. ``If the national commission keeps finding proof of
wrongdoing, then Terra might have a big problem and he (Villalonga)
should be moved out of the company,'' said Felipe Gomez-Serrano,
senior telecommunications analyst for the Caja Madrid Bolsa
securities firm and a columnist for El Mundo.

<HEADLINE>
WITNESS STANDS BY TESTIMONY ON SKAKEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Under intense cross-examination Wednesday, a
former classmate of Michael Skakel's stood firmly behind his
allegation that the nephew of Ethel Kennedy told him more than 20
years ago that he had murdered a teenage girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I heard,'' testified Gregory Coleman, 38, who
attended a Maine facility for troubled adolescents with Skakel in
the late 1970s. ``I'm sure of that _ not 99.9 percent, but 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys also heard a childhood friend of Skakel's, Andrew
Pugh, testify that Skakel had said around 1991 he had been at the
murder scene on the night of Martha Moxley's death in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said Skakel told him he had masturbated in a pine tree
above the spot where Moxley's body was discovered the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh, who said he harbored suspicions about Skakel's guilt,
testified that he refused to cooperate with private investigators
hired by the Skakel family, who contacted him after Michael's
admission. Pugh said he felt that ``I shouldn't be helping defend''
Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Coleman, who attended the Elan School in
Poland Spring, Maine with Skakel, parried with defense attorney
Michael ``Mickey'' Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that Skakel had confessed to Moxley's murder, but he
conceded he mistakenly told the grand jury that the defendant made
the admission ``five or six times.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who is serving an eight-month sentence in a New York
state prison, testified that Skakel confessed twice in 1978 at
Elan.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coleman, the first confession occurred as he stood
night watch over Skakel. Although Skakel had just been returned to
Elan after an escape, he had not been beaten _ as Coleman said he
expected _ and was allowed the special privilege of keeping a
stereo on the dining-room stage where he was forced to sleep as
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the comment that this guy could get away with murder,''
Coleman said. Skakel allegedly replied: ``I am going to get away
with murder. I'm a Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman testified that Skakel then told him details of the
crime, including his golf-club assault on a girl who had spurned
his advances.
</P>
<P>
   The next confession, Coleman said, came during a ``primal
scream'' session in which students were forced to yell apologies to
a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was common knowledge'' at the school, Coleman said of
Skakel's alleged link to the murder. ``It wasn't a hidden thing.
Everybody knew about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, another former Elan student, John Higgins, testified
that Skakel also told him he murdered Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman described Skakel _ ``arrogant, cocky, self-serving'' _
as an unpopular student at a controversial treatment center that
routinely used physical abuse in the name of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Staff-sanctioned punishment at Elan would range from blows with
oak paddles, to open-fist assaults, to ``boxing'' matches in which
offenders were beaten to the floor, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorization for such student-dispensed discipline came
from school owner Joseph Ricci, Coleman said. In one case of abuse,
he added, a thin teenage girl was beaten by several students into a
state of shock that required hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci has told The Boston Globe he never heard Skakel confess to
Moxley's murder, and that he believes his former students that
claim Skakel confessed are lying.
</P>
<P>
   According to a sealed police report obtained by USA Today,
Skakel pulled a switchblade on a family chauffeur in 1978 and had
to be pulled off the railing of the Triborough Bridge in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 police interview with the chauffeur, Larry Zicarelli,
Skakel is portrayed as wildly tormented. Zicarelli said he was told
by Skakel's father to drive Michael to a therapist's session in New
York after he tried to steal a family car.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, Skakel allegedly pulled a switchblade on Zicarelli,
jumped out of the car several times, and twice had to be pulled off
the bridge railing. Zicarelli described Skakel as ``absolutely
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, Skakel allegedly told Zicarelli,
``I've done something very bad. I'm in a lot of trouble. I've
either got to kill myself or leave the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman had no comment on that report.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony before Juvenile Judge Maureen Dennis, Pugh said
that shortly after Skakel told him about being at the murder scene,
he was contacted about 30 times by the private investigators hired
by the Skakel family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael asked if I would meet with them,'' Pugh said of Sutton
Associates. The answer was no.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Pugh finally went to police with Skakel's comment that
he had been at the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel had never given police that version of events. Until
being interviewed by Sutton Associates, Skakel had told authorities
he drove a cousin home on the night of the murder, returned to his
house, and went directly to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles homicide detective who
wrote a book about the Moxley slaying, has suggested that Skakel
changed his official alibi to include masturbation as a way to
explain the presence of semen that might be traced to him through
modern DNA analysis.
</P>
<P>
   After Pugh's testimony, the prosecution rested its case in the
``reasonable cause'' hearing to determine whether Skakel, 39,
should be tried for Moxley's murder. Judge Dennis adjourned the
hearing until Wednesday, when Sherman will call former Elan
students and staff as defense witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If reasonable cause is found, Dennis also must rule whether
Skakel is to be tried as an adult for a crime he allegedly
committed as a 15-year-old. A grand jury indicted Skakel in
January.

COMMENTARY: HILLARY'S TRAVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Congenital liar'' was the inflammatory phrase used in this
space four years ago to describe Hillary Rodham Clinton's habitual
departures from the truth. Bill Clinton promptly made known,
through his press secretary, that were he not constrained by
occupying the office of the president, he would punch me in the
nose.
</P>
<P>
   In a day or two, we should begin to learn whether the first lady
deserves the repute imputed to her, or whether I deserve a pop on
the proboscis soon after noon on Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Robert Ray, the independent counsel who
succeeded Ken Starr, is expected to submit his report on suspected
abuses of power in the firing and subsequent unwarranted
humiliation and prosecution of White House travel office employees
as Clinton took office. It has long been suspected, and angrily
denied, that this wrongdoing was personally instigated by Mrs.
Clinton to make room for patronage to their Arkansas relatives and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The report, mandated by law, will be sealed by the court until
October to permit those mentioned in it to object to the
prosecutor's judgments. No indictments are expected to be handed
up, but when Ray's report on the firings is finally made public, we
will see if a pattern of artful, lawyerly, deliberate deception _
wriggling away from admitting the truth just short of prosecutable
perjury _ is shown to support my harsh characterization of long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony about her role in the harassment of the employees is
in conflict. Mrs. Clinton and her lawyers submitted an affidavit to
Congress professing a passive, peripheral part in the firings,
swearing that ``Although I had no decision-making role with regard
to the removal of the travel office employees on May 19, 1993, I
expressed my concern ... that if there were fiscal mismanagement in
the travel office ... it should be addressed promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the half of it, according to a contemporaneous,
``soul-cleansing'' memo written by David Watkins, the White House
aide told to dismiss the veteran employees occupying slots Mrs.
Clinton wanted. He wrote the chief of staff ``we both knew there
would be hell to pay'' if ``we failed to take swift and decisive
action in conformity with the first lady's wishes.'' Mrs. Clinton
had told him in no uncertain terms, ``We need those people out and
we need our people in.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he told his boss he had ``been as protective and vague as
possible'' to investigators, Watkins drafted a confidential memo
saying that ``(Vincent) Foster regularly informed me that the first
lady was concerned and desired action _ the action desired was the
firing of the travel office staff.'' At Foster's direction, the
aide spoke to Mrs. Clinton that evening, who conveyed to him
directly ``her desire for swift and clear action to resolve the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Never happened, insists Hillary. Her lawyer's letter to the
General Accounting Office states flatly that ``Mrs. Clinton does
not know the origin of the decision to remove the travel office
employees'' and that ``she did not direct that any action be taken
by anyone ....''
</P>
<P>
   Later the whipsawed aide would affirm the truth of what he wrote
at the time, but nervously added language pleasing to White House
lawyers: ``She did not command me to fire them.'' Of course not;
she was not a government official, and had no power to direct,
order or command. But he got her message, and the employees got the
gate.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares about seven government workers? Why does this warrant
years of investigation? Here's the significance: To cover up their
desire to put cronies and a relative on the government payroll, the
Clintons' White House induced an eager-to-please FBI to launch and
to wrongfully publicize an investigation of innocent people. This
resulted in a politically motivated Reno Justice Department trial
at which a disgusted jury acquitted the falsely accused in less
than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Hillary Clinton has been artfully (non-prosecutably)
misleading us about her mean-spirited power abuse. Ray may show us
how.
</P>
<P>
   The humorist Mark Russell once kindly suggested that I had
described this first lady merely as ``a congenial lawyer.'' Thanks,
but if the travel office's patronage queen attends the next
inaugural as senator-elect, I'd be among the many holding their
noses _ in my case, to protect it from ex-presidential retribution.

SPACECRAFT PHOTOGRAPHS 
SIGNS OF WATER ON MARS 
 

</HEADLINE>
 WATER-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Cameras aboard NASA's sharp-eyed Mars Global Surveyor
spacecraft have photographed recent evidence of water flowing and
pooling on the arid world, an unexpected finding that if borne out
raises the odds of primitive life on the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency plans to unveil the imagery gathered by San
Diego-based scientists Mike Malin and Ken Edgett Thursday at a
Washington news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs show narrow V-shaped channels and large curved
and darkened depressions that resemble ponds in a range of features
on the Martian surface, including a 31-mile wide meteor impact
crater in the planet's Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will essentially turn many of our ideas about the current
state of water on Mars on their ears,'' said Steven Clifford, an
expert on the planet's hydrology based at the Lunar and Planetary
Institute in Houston. ``If the interpretation is correct, it raises
uncountable questions about the conditions under which liquid water
has been stored so close to the surface and released during recent
times. This is a complete mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the scientists involved in the discovery nor NASA
officials would discuss the findings Wednesday. Malin and Edgett,
who built and operate the camera on the Mars Global Surveyor, had
planned to publish their findings in the journal Science next week.
</P>
<P>
   However, sketchy reports in at least two Internet news sites and
the British Broadcasting Corporation earlier this week forced the
space agency to advance its plans to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Half the size of the neighboring Earth, Mars had long held a
fascination with the public as well as with scientists. Of the
solar system's nine planets, Mars is most Earth-like and the more
likely to host a primitive form of life.
</P>
<P>
   Now cold and arid with a thin atmosphere of deadly carbon
dioxide, Mars revealed what appear to be river channels, large
watersheds as well as shorelines to early American spacecraft,
especially NASA's highly successful Viking probes of the late
1970s. The features suggest water was once abundant on the Martian
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The failures last year of NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars
Polar Lander probes interrupted what began as an aggressive effort
by American scientists to find out where the water went.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing theory is that a dramatic climate change,
possibly associated with a slow but dramatic wobble in the axis of
Mars, caused the water that once flowed freely on the surface to
seep deep underground and freeze.

<P>
   Mars could have dried up more than 3.5 billion years ago, some
experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature now rises above the freezing point on Mars for
only a few hours at a time during the warmest part of the summer at
the planet's equator, making any evidence of flowing water all the
more surprising, said Clifford.
</P>
<P>
   If the findings are borne out, they are all the more important
in the search for evidence of current or past primitive life on the
Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Mars presentation that NASA plans today is
reminiscent of an announcement it made four years ago in Washington
and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 6, 1996 scientists from NASA's Johnson Space Center and
Stanford University announced they had detected evidence of
fossilized bacteria in a 4.2 pound meteorite of Martian origin.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorite was collected in 1984 from the Antarctic, where it
fell 13,000 years ago. A microscopic examination of the rock's
interior produced evidence of bacteria-like structures in the
crevices of the rock that appeared to be 3.6 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the meteorite was among debris blasted away
from the Martian surface when it was struck by an asteroid 16
million years ago. The meteorite wandered around the sun until it
crossed the Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the claim by the NASA and Stanford scientists
remains hotly debated.

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The chief prosecutor of the International
War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said Wednesday that
she would not withdraw the indictment against Slobodan Milosevic,
the Yugoslav president, and that she opposed any action by
Washington or other governments to let him escape justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be stability in the Balkans if Milosevic is not
brought to justice in the Hague,'' said the prosecutor, Carla Del
Ponte, at a news conference during a visit to the Kosovo capital
Wednesday. ``I don't think that the man most responsible for what
happened here in Kosovo should have preference.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported on Monday that the Clinton
administration, with some NATO allies and Russia, was exploring the
possibility of letting Milosevic leave office with guarantees that
he would not be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. war crimes tribunal, based in the Hague, publicly
indicted Milosevic and four members of his Cabinet last year for
responsibility for the deaths and expulsion of ethnic Albanians
during the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte firmly rejected any policy change for the tribunal and
said her staff was proceeding with investigations against Milosevic
for crimes in Kosovo and in previous wars in the region. ``We are
investigating the criminal responsibility of Slobodan Milosevic for
Croatia and Bosnia,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They were also preparing additional indictments against other
lesser officials like police, military and political personnel,
both Serbs and others, including Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless in a comment that hinted at the overriding power of
politics, she said, ``I am a prosecutor, not a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte was visiting Kosovo to see the progress of forensic
teams that are exhuming bodies from hundreds of sites around
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She has also visited Macedonia and will travel on to the
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro to ask for its cooperation in the
war crimes investigations. Her investigators are banned from Serbia
despite their repeated requests for access to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a new development, she said the tribunal has begun
investigations into whether the Kosovo Liberation Army had
committed crimes in the conflict, dating back to 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She said five episodes to which members of the now disbanded
guerrilla army have been linked were under investigation. No
indictments have been brought against members of the KLA but
certain allegations merit investigation, a tribunal spokesman, Paul
Risley, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are allegations that the KLA were responsible for crimes
in five areas, and we have an obligation to look at these serious
allegations,'' said Graham Blewitt, deputy prosecutor at the
tribunal. He and Del Ponte refused to discuss the types of crimes
being investigated, but there are widely known cases of Serbian
civilians abducted by members of the KLA. The Serbs have not been
found and their disappearance has fueled local hatred against the
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials estimate that 1 million Albanians were
expelled from their homes and the territory of Kosovo by Serbian
forces in the spring of last year and that thousands of civilians
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   There remains uncertainty about whether that campaign,
apparently orchestrated by the Serbian leadership, amounted to
genocide, since to bring charges of genocide, prosecutors have to
prove the intention to destroy a people or part of a people.
``There are other explanations, and we need to look at those,''
Blewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of KLA crimes could not be compared to the
organized campaign by Serb forces, Blewitt said. They involved
fewer victims and cannot be considered genocide, he said. ``The KLA
does not get anywhere near that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the announcement of an international investigation of crimes
by Albanians is bound to have some meaning here. It came the day
after a young Serb couple were shot and wounded near the main
street in Pristina on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte accompanied the chief of the U.N. mission here,
Bernard Kouchner, and local Albanian political leaders to lay
flowers at the spot of the attack. The two Serbs, a young bank
security guard and his girlfriend, a local radio reporter, were
found by peacekeeping officers and taken to a hospital, where they
were reported to be in stable condition. Both had been shot several
times.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting happened near the busy center of Pristina and
highlighted the impunity with which Albanians have conducted
revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The divided town of Mitrovica also exploded into violence
Wednesday as a Serbian crowd stoned the Albanian driver of a
garbage truck and then set fire to cars with U.N. or foreign
registrations. Several people were injured.

SENATE PROVIDES ALMOST $1 BILLION FOR COLOMBIAN FIGHT AGAINST DRUG
TAFFICKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday night endorsed an aid
package of nearly $1 billion to help Colombia equip and train
security forces to combat drug traffickers in a country where the
narcotics trade and guerrilla insurgency support each other.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate delayed until Thursday final passage of the
legislation containing the aid, that outcome was not in doubt, and
senators completed work on the portions of the bill dealing with
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has now set aside a total of almost $1.3 billion for
assistance to Colombia over the next two years, counting $300
million in an earlier military bill. In late March, the House
approved $1.7 billion over two years in emergency spending for the
nation, one of Washington's most important Latin American allies.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Wednesday's votes, House and Senate Republican
leaders met on Wednesday morning to discuss how to reconcile the
two competing versions, which have several crucial differences, so
that an aid package could be approved before the July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, both President Clinton and President Andres
Pastrana of Colombia have appealed to congressional leaders to rush
passage of an anti-drug plan to help Colombia and other Andean
nations. The plan is backed by top Republican leaders like House
Speaker Dennis Hastert and Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is the heart of the drug war and we'd better get on
with it,'' Coverdell said. ``If we lose in Colombia, then we lose
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics argued in debate on Wednesday that the aid package
would ensnare the United States in an open-ended conflict that has
claimed tens of thousands of lives over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capacity of this body for self-delusion appears to this
senator to be unlimited,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. ``There
has been no consideration of the consequences, cost and length of
involvement. This bill says, let's get into war now and justify it
later.''
</P>
<P>
   The decisive votes on Wednesday came on two amendments to reduce
or shift some of the $934 million earmarked this year and next for
Colombia in a foreign aid bill.
</P>
<P>
   By 89-11, Senators defeated an amendment by Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., to transfer $225 million in aid from the Colombia military
to drug treatment and prevention programs in the United States. The
Senate then defeated an amendment by Gorton to cut the aid package
to $200 million, from $934 million. That vote was 79-19.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director,
released a statement on Wednesday anticipating the overall bill's
final approval on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's work is a crucial step toward final congressional
approval of the package that will greatly enhance counter-drug
efforts in Colombia and neighboring Andean countries in their
struggle against illicit production and trafficking, and
drug-funded criminal organizations.''

   How do you make sure that Ringer and Joanna get to discuss the
worst episodes of the television series ``Charmed'' without getting
spammed by trolls _ hatemongers, teen-agers spouting profanity,
pornography hucksters and the just plain rude? At Mighty Big TV, a
Web site that dishes up sarcastic recaps of television shows, as
with many Internet forums, the job of keeping online debate
coherent and spam-free falls to discussion board moderators.
</P>
<P>
   In the online world, portals, Internet service providers,
consumer goods companies, sports teams and sites dedicated to
everything under the sun have areas where people can exchange
ideas. According to Jupiter Communications, an Internet market
research firm, more than half of all major sites use some sort of
chat function. Discussion boards, where people post thoughts on a
particular topic or question in long-running conversations that can
span hours, days or weeks, are a popular conversation-enabling
format (others include real-time chat rooms and private or
semiprivate club rooms).
</P>
<P>
   The job of a discussion board moderator falls somewhere between
virtual playground monitor and online cocktail party host.
Moderators have to prevent abusive, anonymous writers from using
the boards as graffiti walls and make sure that, say, vendors of
teeth-whitening toothpaste don't use discussions to promote their
product.
</P>
<P>
   Moderators also deal with subtler challenges: they try to ensure
that people posting messages have interesting conversations. They
have to smooth ruffled feathers when one person offends another.
They have to urge the overzealous to tone it down without killing
the conversation. And they have to remind people to use spell
check.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bunting and Tara Ariano founded Mighty Big TV
(www.mightybigtv.com) last September, after meeting on another
discussion board. (They worked on the site for more than a year
before meeting in person). At Mighty Big TV's ``talk back'' forums,
visitors can discuss things like Ally McBeal's hair (there is a
forum topic called Hairiffic) and weigh in on their least favorite
participant on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunting and Ariano read every posting on the site _ about 300 a
day. ``We have pretty strict rules of engagement, in terms of what
we allow to be posted,'' Bunting said. ``You can't attack someone
ad hominem, we don't allow too much cursing, and anyone espousing a
bigoted viewpoint is booted. There's zero tolerance for hate
speech.'' When they decide to boot someone, Bunting and Ariano use
software that erases all messages by the offender.
</P>
<P>
   People sending hate messages ``aren't told they're being booted,
they're just booted,'' said Ariano. On the other hand, ``if there's
a user who's annoying the regulars, we might send an e-mail _
`please check spelling, don't attack the old guard.' People usually
settle down. The regulars correct the newbies, and it's usually not
something where we have to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Big TV has a core of 150 to 200 people who keep the site
on their screens all day, Bunting said.
</P>
<P>
   Ariano makes no bones about what it takes to keep the
conversation on a discussion board at a desirable level. ``You have
to be actively elitist,'' she said. ``In a room in the real world,
you can control who comes in. On the Internet, anyone can wander
in, and if you let someone who has nothing interesting to say stick
around, they get comfortable, and they never get any smarter. If
someone comes in and says, ` 'N Sync Rules,' then forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Mighty Big TV has successful message boards, Ariano
said, is that the community members know that there are people
actually running it. ``It's not a faceless entity,'' she said.
``Sites with no moderators have no conversations. In our case,
people know who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, sometimes even moderators have to take time
off, and when they do, trouble can start. Bunting recalled a time
when both moderators were on vacation, and someone with an obscene
handle, or online name, signed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``So little Mr. Puerile started spamming the site with lurid and
not particularly anatomically accurate things he was going to do,''
Bunting said. ``But the regulars flamed him and ignored him.'' When
the moderators returned from vacation, they deleted his posts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Williams moderates the Table Talk discussion boards
for Salon.com, the online magazine. She said the site was designed
to encourage discussion board participants to read all the other
posts on a particular board before they join the discussion. ``As a
host, I go into conversations and if I see something interesting, I
try to be really responsive,'' she said. ``I find positive
reinforcement works better than negative reinforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussion boards develop into strong communities, and fostering
this community is part of Williams' job. ``We've had a lot of
people go through really major stuff in their lives, and they get
through it with the help of people on Table Talk,'' she said.
Moderating, she said, is ``not just a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are real people with real feelings,'' she added. ``It's
not just a case of `did somebody say a bad word,' but an issue of
the subtleties of what people are feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also sometimes has to deal with people who become
obsessed and spend inordinate amounts of time on the discussion
board. ``Sometimes I send an e-mail saying gently, `Maybe you
should try turning off your computer for a few hours,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At eDiets, an online weight-loss site where members pay monthly
fees and can turn to one of 36 discussion boards for advice and
support, Shelly Waltman, manager of community services, said she
and her staff sometimes join the discussion groups under other
names to encourage discussion or response to members' questions.
``Basically, one of the jobs of the moderators is that if someone
is posting and asking for a reply, they answer,'' Waltman said,
``so that everyone has at least one response. I will sometimes go
in under another name to write encouraging notes to people, but 95
percent of the time we're doing it under our own names.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeding discussion using other names can lead to trouble,
though. Karen Ahn, who writes Mighty Big TV's wrap-up of MTV's
``Real World'' and moderates the discussion boards pertaining to
the show, used to be a moderator at another Web site. Part of her
job was to go into the site's discussion area secretly, using a
fake name, and start conversations. Another moderator once
approached her alternate identity and asked if she wanted a job _
as a moderator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get that `ignore the man behind the curtain,' Wizard
of Oz feeling,'' Ahn said. ``By the end I was putting in weird
acronyms that would spell out nasty things. I was so aggrieved at
having to post messages that I knew couldn't spark any genuine
dialogue, since I wasn't a `genuine' community member _ I was being
paid to post! It all seemed so cynical and ultimately
self-defeating.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in which a corporate employee moderates a
discussion board can eate an odd power dynamic, she added. ``You
elect yourself lord-mayor. These people didn't know me, they didn't
elect me to monitor their discussion _ it was just because I was a
salaried employee that I had control.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderators point out that a key difference between the online
world and the offline world is that online there are no facial or
verbal cues. ``There have been times when I've said something I
considered light-hearted and it's been taken the wrong way,''
Williams said. Sometimes, without face-to-face interaction to keep
people in check, tempers can flare. Then it is the job of the
moderator to calm things down. Waltman gave an example from the
eDiets site: ``When people type in capital letters it really gets
to some people. We have to go in there and say, `Are we really here
to discuss capital letters?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bunting said the moderators' power can be seductive. ``You have
to be willing to incur the wrath of the users,'' she said. ``But
you also have to rise above the pettiness. You can't get in that
last dig and then close the thread.''

INSURER AGREES TO REPAYMENTS IN BIAS ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., Va., Tenn., Ala., Texas)   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After decades of paying higher premiums for life insurance than
white customers, nearly 5 million black customers and their
families nationwide are going to be compensated in a settlement
reached Wednesday with one of the nation's biggest insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company, American General, said that it was making
restitution of $206 million, mainly to the black customers and
their heirs who, until as recently as April, paid as much as 33
percent more than white customers for small policies intended to
cover burial expenses.
</P>
<P>
   American General also agreed to pay fines of $7.5 million to
regulators in five states, Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee
and Alabama, where most of the insurance was sold, and to
contribute $2 million to the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   One black policyholder, Bessie Jones, a 71-year-old grandmother
in Sarasota, Fla., told state insurance regulators who uncovered
the racially biased practices, that she bought at least a dozen
policies with face values of about $1,000 from a company now owned
by American General. On one of several policies she cited, she said
she paid premiums of 90 cents a week and had paid more than $1,600
for the $1,000 death benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nelson, the insurance commissioner in Florida who, along
with private class-action lawyers negotiated the settlement on
behalf of all 50 states, called the long history of discrimination
tragic. And he added: ``It's incomprehensible that this practice
continued up until recent days.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had begun to take steps to end the practice
as soon as it became aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say individual policyholders and their heirs are
likely to receive a few hundred dollars each, with up to 11.5
percent of the $206 million going to the lawyers, led by the New
York firm of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &AMP; Lerach, which
specializes in class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   About $50 million of the money has been designated for both
black and white customers who, regardless of the rates they were
charged, paid more over the years in premiums than the few hundred
dollars that these policies would pay.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was the first step in setting things right with
millions of of poor blacks who paid more for their insurance
because the companies calculated that they would have shorter life
spans than white customers. While regulators say millions of these
policies remain in effect, the two-tiered actuarial policy was
outlawed in the early 1960s. And the insurance industry now
acknowledges that poverty rather than race led to shorter lives for
many of those against whom the companies discriminated.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 companies have low-cost burial policies on their
books. Florida is already investigating four of these companies
that it thinks charged higher rates to poor blacks and, in some
cases, Hispanics. Those four companies are all subsidiaries of
bigger companies: the United Insurance Co. of America, a unit of
Unitrin Inc.; the Monumental Life Insurance Co., a unit of Aegon;
the Liberty National Life Insurance Co., a unit of the Torchmark
Corp.; and the Life Insurance Co. of Georgia, a unit of ING Group.
Both Aegon and ING are Dutch companies with growing operations in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge step in the right direction,'' said the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, whose Rainbow Coalition Wall Street project
concentrates on equality for minority members in financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no doubt that millions of other cases awaited
resolution. ``My grandmother had these kinds of policies when I was
growing up in Greenville, S.C.,'' he said. ``They would pay 25
cents a week. The insurance man and the rent man would come by
every week and when you could only pay one, you paid the insurance
man because all the old folks wanted a dignified burial.''
</P>
<P>
   American General said the nearly 5 million discriminatory
policies plus 4.3 million others held by both black and white
customers were sold by companies it acquired over the last 20 years
as it was expanding to become one of the nation's largest insurers.
On about 400,000 of these policies, the company said, customers
have paid or would have paid premiums that exceeded the face value
of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the policyholders were making regular monthly
payments to an American General subsidiary, American General Life
and Accident in Nashville, American General said it discovered the
two-tiered system only after Florida insurance regulators
subpoenaed company records last October.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida investigators had begun looking into the sales of
small burial policies, sometimes referred to as industrial policies
because they were originally designed for low-paid industrial
workers, after receiving complaints from some customers that they
had paid more in premiums than the policies on their lives were
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials said that American General executives began
negotiations on settling the state's concerns earlier this year but
that the insurer kept collecting higher premiums from blacks than
whites until April, when Florida demanded that the practice stop.
Talks between the state and the insurance company had broken off,
but they resumed after the so-called cease-and-desist order was
issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not condone this practice,'' American General said in a
statement when it stopped collecting the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Robert M. Devlin, the chief executive
of American General, said it was ``imperative that we move swiftly
and responsibly to correct an unfortunate historical practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president at A.M. Best Co., the
insurance rating agency, said the settlement would not have a major
financial effect on American General, which has assets of about
$110 billion, making it the nation's fourth-largest life insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to potential harm to sales, Mayewski said: ``There's
always some impact when you're in the news for something that is
not overly favorable. I think the organization has decided, right
or wrong, that the best thing to do is settle this and put it
behind them and move on.''

<P>
   Jackson said he was hopeful that other companies that followed
racially biased practices would settle rather than wage long,
drawn-out court battles.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said his Rainbow Coalition had been independently
reviewing the records of insurance companies during the days of
slavery and segregation. His group has reported that some companies
sold life insurance policies on slaves with the master as the
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   The two-tier pricing system, he said, ``is a concrete,
documented exploitation and violation and we now need a commitment
to heal the breach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he had a ``very good meeting'' with American
General executives at their headquarters in Houston after they
announced the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret we had a slavery system,'' he said. ``It's no
secret we had legally segregated society. The issue now is how in
some meaningful way to end the policy and to pay the people who
were exploited.'' &QL;

ELIZABETH DOOLEY, 87, A FRIEND OF THE RED SOX WITHOUT AN EQUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dooley, who watched more than 4,000 consecutive Boston
Red Sox home games over 55 seasons from her front-row box seat,
died Monday in Boston, hours before her beloved Red Sox suffered a
22-1 beating from the Yankees. She was 87, a year younger than
Fenway Park, the home of the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ted Williams, the greatest Red Sox player of them all,
said of Dooley: ``Forever, she's the greatest Red Sox fan there'll
ever be. Every time I get a chance to get around here I like to do
it, because she's really a big league gal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley shrugged off that accolade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not consider myself a fan,'' she said. ``I am a friend of
the Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Lib Dooley was a faithful friend. She called Williams Theodore
and telephoned him on his every birthday. When Bobby Doerr retired,
she started sending him clippings from Boston newspapers. When
Mickey Mantle of the Yankees hit home runs against the Red Sox, he
would good-naturedly stick out his tongue at her.
</P>
<P>
   Dom DiMaggio was another of her Red Sox favorites. Upon learning
of her death, he told The Boston Globe: ``She was a perfect lady. I
remember so well when she presented us with our American League
championship rings after we won in 1946. She was so thrilled. The
Red Sox were practically her whole life, from what I could
gather.''
</P>
<P>
   They were indeed that. From 1944 until 1998, she did not miss a
home game and sometimes made road trips. Illness forced her to miss
some games in 1998 and 1999. This year, she made only opening day
and last month's Red Sox Hall of Fame dinner.
</P>
<P>
   She would sit in Box 36-A in the front row behind the Red Sox
on-deck circle, delivering Oreos and Starbursts to the players and
then watching the game intently. Despite her close seat, she said
only one foul ball came her way, by Carroll Hardy in the early
1960s. She caught it and broke two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   She never married. She attended Boston College at night, and
then, for 39 years, was a gym and health teacher in the Boston
public school system. In 1956, she moved to an apartment in Kenmore
Square. It was seven minutes from Fenway Park, she said, a little
longer as age made walking more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   She came by baseball naturally. In 1901, her father, John
Stephen Dooley, helped the new Red Sox team get a home at the
Huntington Avenue Grounds. According to her family, the father
attended every season opener from 1894 until 1970, when he died at
97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I despise bridge and I hate gossip,'' Lib Dooley said. ``I
wanted something where I could go by myself without anyone ruining
it by saying, `I can't do it this week.' Baseball gets you out in
the fresh air and keeps you from talking about your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friendship with players did not alter her perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are really baseball, not the players,'' she said.
``You can always get someone to play ball. It doesn't have to be
someone who gets $4 million to work two hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leary, her 24-year-old grandnephew, sat in her seat at
Monday night's game. Afterward, he got a game ball to place in her
coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Her survivors include four sisters, Winifred Dooley, Katherine
Dooley and Anna Martin, all of Milton, Mass., and Mary Jane Boyd of
Texas.

 &HT;    jMillions due Georgians
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost 200,000 Georgians could get a share of a $206
million settlement from one of the nation's largest insurance
companies, which overcharged black customers based on their race.
</P>
<P>
   American General Life and Accident Insurance Co. also agreed to
pay $7.5 million in fines to several states, including about $1.2
million to Georgia. The Nashville company is a unit of
Houston-based American General Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement stems from a multistate investigation led by
Florida insurance officials, who alleged that American General and
four other insurance companies charged black policyholders premiums
more than a third higher than white customers paid for small life
insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine estimated that more
than 176,000 Georgians will be eligible to share $31 million in
cash refunds, lower premiums or larger death benefits.
</P>
<P>
   American General said that about 600,000 out of about 9 million
living and deceased policyholders nationwide can expect to get cash
payments of at least $150 from the settlement. The policies were
sold during the 1940s through the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of paying weekly premiums, most policyholders by
now have paid in more money _ sometimes two or three times more _
than the $500 to $2,000 death benefit of most of the policies,
Oxendine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one lady who had bought a $500 policy . . . and
she had spent around a thousand'' to keep it in force, he said.
</P>
<P>
   American General acquired the companies that sold the policies,
said Carl Santillo, American General executive vice president of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we became aware of the problem, we had no hesitation''
about reaching a resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not sold industrial policies for at least 20 years,'' he
said, referring to the insurance usually known as ``burial
policies,'' sold door to door.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance officials involved in the investigation said about
108,000 African-Americans with active American General policies
sold at overtly discriminatory rates can expect refunds of at least
$150.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries of deceased policyholders also may be eligible for
larger, retroactive death benefits in cash. About 3.7 million
policies have been terminated, have matured or have paid out death
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The other policyholders affected by the settlement are eligible
for larger future death benefits, reduced premiums or both. They
include about 5.7 million customers of all races who ended up
paying much more in premiums than their policies will pay after
they die.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement and a related class-action lawsuit resulted after
Florida insurance regulators and lawyers began investigating the
practices of five companies, including American General. The
investigators said some units of the companies not only charged
African-Americans higher premiums but also have continued to
collect the higher, discriminatory rates on old policies.
</P>
<P>
   The ``burial policies'' were sold generally in poor, black
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine said discrimination cases against the other four
companies, including Georgia-based Life Insurance Co. of Georgia,
are still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're next on the list,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials said African-American and other policyholders
with small life insurance policies _ generally less than $2,000 _
from several firms owned by American General may be eligible to
take part in a $206 million discrimination settlement announced
Wednesday. The companies are:
</P>
<P>
   Equitable Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Home Beneficial Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Home State Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Life and Accident Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Life and Casualty Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   National Life and Accident Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>

ASSAD PATRONAGE PUT A SMALL SECT ON TOP IN SYRIA

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ When Hafez Assad died on June 10, his power
and privileges passed to his eldest surviving son, Bashar, a
34-year-old eye doctor who is just a few formalities away from
officially inheriting the Syrian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Assad is not the only heir to his father's 30 years of
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him _ in the officer corps of the armed forces, the
intelligence services, the palace guard and the ruling Baath Party
command _ stand thousands of his fellow Alawites, members of a
minority religious sect who owe their fortunes and their influence
exclusively to Assad family patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his father's death, Dr. Assad had begun to prune the
political and military hierarchy of many of the old guard whose
willingness to accept a continuation of the Assad dynasty was in
question.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats and Syrian analysts said that the overall number
of Alawites in positions of power _ the army officers who give the
real commands, the intelligence chiefs who monitor the population,
the security officers in charge of neighboring Lebanon and the
commanders of the presidential militias _ did not change and may
well have increased.
</P>
<P>
   Their dominance is never openly discussed, however. It is a
taboo in Syria to speak publicly about Alawite power or the power
of any other minority. Syrian nationalism and Arab nationalism were
supposed to have erased sectarian identities, underthe ruling
philosophy of the Assad regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as an Alawite sect in Syria,'' declared
Riyad Ghassan Agha, head of the political bureau of the presidency,
in a recent interview on Al-Jezeera television.
</P>
<P>
   If Assad, like his father, surrounds himself with cousins,
uncles and other members of the extended Alawite family, that is
perfectly natural, he added. ``Do you think he would have his
enemies as his assistants?'' Agha said. ``When you work, you have
your friends and families around you. Otherwise it would be a power
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the late President Assad's reign, his favoritism
toward Alawites was a source of much private resentment among
Syria's traditionally dominant Sunni Muslim majority. In the early
1980s, the supremacy of the Alawites, historically regarded in
Syria as heretics, was a spur for a violent rebellion by Islamic
fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Assad dealt with the resentment by placing Sunni
Muslims in a few high-profile ministries, like Foreign Affairs and
Defense, and by permitting some Sunni merchant families to operate
private businesses within his socialist state.
</P>
<P>
   He dealt with the Sunni fundamentalist rebellion by brutally
crushing it. And he carefully courted other religious minorities in
Syria, like Shiite Muslims and Christians, who also feared that
they would be trampled if the majority Sunnis were to regain
political power.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Assad, his son, inherits that precariously balanced system
of patronage and appeasement. With the Alawite clans behind him,
analysts say, he may have the support he needs to retain power. But
he also will always have to watch his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hold the most important key positions and they can make a
difference if they move,'' said an Arab diplomat in Damascus,
referring to the Alawites in the army and security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is now, do the Alawites believe that Bashar is
the best man to represent and protect them?`` the diplomat added.
``This will take time to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alawites, at about 1.5 million strong in Syria and
representing about 12 percent of the country's population, are
considered by some to be a distant offshoot of the Shiite branch of
Islam. Most members of the sect live in Syria, although there are
scattered communities in Turkey as well.
</P>
<P>
   Their belief system has been a matter of speculation, rumor and
suspicion from more orthodox Muslims of both the Shiite and Sunni
sects almost from their beginnings in the ninth century, when the
branch was founded by a man named Ibn Nusayr, who declared himself
the gateway to truth.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small group within the sect are initiated into Alawite
rituals and doctrine. But researchers who have studied the group
say they drink wine in some ceremonies, incorporate elements of
Phoenician paganism, and hold that Ali, the son-in-law of the
Prophet Muhammad, is a divine. All of that is anathema to
conventional Islam.
</P>
<P>
   During French rule over Syria between the end of the First World
War and 1946, the Alawites joined other non-Muslim minorities in
the colonial army in suppressing the Sunni Muslims who were the
vanguard of the independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   Alawite cooperation with the European and Christian colonizers
of the region has marked their rule in Syria. It has been a
reassuring factor for non-Arabs and non-Sunni Muslims, helping
Syria retain the most stable religious diversity in the Middle
East. But the Alawite history also made Hafez Assad especially
fierce in his anti-Zionism, as if to prove to other Arab leaders
that he would never act less Arab or Muslim than they.
</P>
<P>
   The Alawite rise in Syria was dramatic. After independence, the
Alawite clans retreated to the mountains around the coastal city of
Latakia, which remains a base for the Assad family and its cronies.
They were the poorest of Syria's citizens, sending their daughters
to work as domestics in the homes of wealthy Sunnis in Damascus and
their sons to low-paying jobs in the Syrian army.
</P>
<P>
   The Baath Party takeover in 1966 provided a means for Alawite
ascent. With its socialist and Arab nationalist motifs, the party
attracted the ambitious young of minority groups long
disenfranchised by the Sunni majority. By the time the late
President Assad dispatched his party rivals and established his
autocratic rule in 1970, the army's officer class was largely
Alawite and so was the party command.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad especially favored the tribes from his hometown of
Qardaha in the Alawite Mountains along the Mediterranean coast.
Even now, people in the town speak of his favors with awe: the free
modern hospital, the free schools, the free houses, the special
office in Damascus for Qardaha residents seeking jobs or money or
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up we lived in a mud house,'' recalled Hind
Ahmed, a 44-year-old housewife in Qardaha. ``We had no electricity
or running water. The streets were unpaved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad, she said, changed all that. When he would come home
to visit, his grateful former neighbors would lift his car on their
shoulders and parade it before the new home he gave them money to
build. His brothers built palatial villas on the hilltops
overlooking the village.
</P>
<P>
   One, Rifaat Assad, stationed his private militia in Qardaha and
distributed meat and other food to the villagers regularly before
he was exiled to Europe for trying to overthrow his brother. After
the president's death, he declared himself the legitimate heir to
the presidency from his new villa in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   For Ahmed, any Assad would be acceptable as Syria's leader
because he could be expected to continue the largesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, Rifaat is a great man and he was so nice to us when he
was here,'' she said. ``Bashar is the same. For us the most
important for us is that the president should come from the Assad
family.''

GORE TRIES TO LINK BUSH TO BIG OIL AND HIGHER GAS PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Worried that voters will blame the Clinton
administration _ and Vice President Al Gore _ for the recent surge
in gasoline prices, the Gore campaign has begun an effort to paint
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a onetime oil company executive, as a
tool of the oil interests the campaign says are relentlessly
gouging consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Wednesday for the Gore campaign, Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, said that Bush was ``getting all his money'' from the oil
companies, a reference to the industry's contributions to Bush's
presidential campaign. The oil and gas interests are the
eighth-largest industry donor to the Bush effort.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said he wanted oil executives to testify under oath on
Capitol Hill about the price increases.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush and Republicans on Capitol Hill blame the
gas-price increase on the Clinton administration, saying it has had
no coherent domestic energy policy and, in imposing regulations to
meet clean air standards, had allowed prices to drift as high as
$2.39 a gallon in the Midwest. Bush also said the administration
had failed to persuade the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to ``open the spigots'' to increase the supply.
</P>
<P>
   The group did decide Wednesday to increase oil production by
more than most experts had expected, a move that would presumably
push gasoline prices down in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been reticent to discuss the issue publicly, broke
his silence Wednesday and joined Gore in endorsing the
investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that was announced on
Tuesday. ``I do think it's fair to have the FTC investigate,'' he
said in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comment could undercut Gore's efforts to portray the
governor as part of the problem. In any case, the issue has jumped
to the top of the agenda in presidential politics as Americans
begin their summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The prices have hit hardest in the Midwest, the very
battleground states where the two campaigns are competing most
fiercely for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices in Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan are substantially
higher than in other parts of the country for several reasons, but
chief among them, Republicans say, is the special kind of
reformulated gas the area must use under Environmental Protection
Agency regulations. Those regulations went into effect on June 1,
which is when prices began to rise considerably. The Midwest is the
first region, under the rules, to begin using this ethanol-laced
reformulated gas to prevent pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that new polling shows that voters
believe the price of gasoline is far and away the No. 1 problem in
the country. The officials also say that voters blame American oil
companies most, then the OPEC oil cartel in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials see the emergence of this issue as an opportunity
to link Bush directly in the public mind with the oil companies and
portray Gore as on the side of working families. This has been a
longtime goal of the Gore campaign, but it has not succeeded so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Gore, said: ``It all comes down to
who people think is on their side. People believe, and rightly so,
that the oil companies are in large part responsible for the price
of gasoline. They don't believe the government is responsible for
the price of gas. So what average people are deciding is, `Who do I
want in the government when gas prices skyrocket?' We think the
answer is clear: Vice President Gore is on their side, Governor
Bush isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself has ratcheted up his language on the price
increases, last week saying in selective interviews with Midwest
television stations that he wanted an investigation into possible
collusion. Wednesday, he said at the opening of a Social Security
speech in Iowa, one of the states most affected, that he was
concerned about the ``conduct of the oil companies'' and that they
might have been price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the issue deserved an investigation by the Federal
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that it will be thorough and hard-hitting,'' Gore said
of the investigation. ``If there's evidence of what I suspect
there's evidence of, it ought to be dealt with quickly and
harshly,'' he said. `'I think it's time to put our feet on the
brakes of what may well be big oil's price gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin, speaking on behalf of the Gore campaign on a conference
call with reporters, accused the oil companies of ``outright
thievery.'' He went on to castigate Bush for his ``silence'' on the
matter, saying, ``What can you expect of someone who once claimed,
and I quote, `There's no such thing as being too closely aligned to
the oil business in West Texas.?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush uttered the quotation during a 1978 congressional campaign.
Acknowledging that the quotation was more than 20 years old, Harkin
said: ``The point is, the test of character and leadership is when
you're willing to take on your friends when it's in the nation's
best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed an emergency tax bill in 1999 that gave state tax
breaks to oil and gas companies. The Dallas Morning News reported
that the bill saved Richard Rainwater, a former business partner of
the governor, $1 million. At least 14 of Bush's ``Pioneers,'' his
largest financial contributors, have ties to the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign has received $1.5 million from gas and oil
interests as of April 1, while Gore had received less than $100,000
as of the same date.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore strategy of opening up fire on the oil front
carries some dangers for the campaign. For one thing, rising prices
_ and being reminded of them _ could undermine consumer confidence
in the economy at a time when Gore is boasting about the economy on
his ``progress and prosperity tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the majority leader, told reporters in
Washington on Wednesday: ``The vice president has a growing
political problem because his administration has been asleep at the
wheel when it comes to dealing with OPEC. Instead of acknowledging
that his administration has no energy policy, which leaves our
nation overly dependent on foreign oil, the vice president is
looking for a scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also said that Gore has obsessively lobbied for
so-called ``clean-air fuel,'' the kind that is now at the center of
the Midwestern price increases, without worrying about the
consequences. ``He is the one who pushed this whole idea of a
different type of gasoline,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore officials say the environmental standards leading to
the reformulation of gasoline have added only four to eight cents a
gallon to the cost of fuel and would not account for such a drastic
price increase.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1992 environmental treatise, ``Earth in the Balance,''
Gore himself proposed the idea of higher fuel taxes on oil
companies to help reduce pollution; as part of that, he suggested a
corresponding cut in corporate income and payroll taxes.

A SCRAMBLE TO SALVAGE SPRINT-WORLDCOM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing mounting opposition from regulators to its $115 billion
deal to acquire Sprint, WorldCom is considering selling broad
swaths of Sprint's operations, including Sprint's entire
long-distance unit, people close to the companies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continue between the company and the Justice
Department, which is reviewing the deal's antitrust implications in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Mario Monti, head of the European Commission's competition
ministry, now appears inclined to block the deal over concern that
the combined company would have too much control over the world's
long-distance telephone market as well as a stranglehold on
Internet traffic in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the deal involves two American companies, the
European Commission has the power to block it. The commission,
based in Brussels, Belgium, is the executive arm of the 15-nation
European Union. It claims jurisdiction over any merger involving
companies that do more than $200 million in business in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear since the deal was announced last year that
the combined company would at least have to sell Sprint's Internet
business, and the Justice Department appears to have accepted that
element of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the European regulators would prefer that the combined
company spin off WorldCom's UUNET Internet operation, the world's
No. 1 Internet carrier. WorldCom executives have said that they
would rather scrap the acquisition altogether than sell UUNET.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, is mainly concerned about the
power a combined Sprint-WorldCom would hold over the long-distance
telephone business in the United States, according to people close
to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's chief executive, has long been
prepared to sell off Sprint's consumer long-distance operation as
well as the Sprint brand. But the Justice Department appears also
to want a divestiture of Sprint's unit that sells long-distance
services to business customers. WorldCom was built on serving
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the approval discussions said Wednesday that
WorldCom expected its talks with the Justice Department to conclude
by the beginning of next week, at the latest. Monti is to meet this
week with regulators and officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom faces particular resistance in Europe, in part because
many European officials believe it failed to follow through
properly on a pledge to spin off the MCI Communications' Internet
business after MCI was acquired by WorldCom in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   To win approval of that acquisition, WorldCom promised to sell
MCI's Internet business to Cable and Wireless of Britain. But Cable
and Wireless later complained to the European Commission that the
sale was incomplete, failing to include some employees as well as
some contracts. WorldCom settled the dispute privately, and the
European Commission did not pursue the issue. But the affair left a
bad taste with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once burned, twice shy,'' said Maurits Dolmans, an antitrust
lawyer in Brussels for Cleary, Gottlieb Steen &AMP; Hamilton. ``This
time the commission is going to make very, very sure that any
spinoff of Sprint's Internet business is carried out quickly,
fully, completely and will be entirely enforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the European Commission's rules, the case must be decided
by July 5. But the European and U.S. regulators are almost sure to
coordinate their demands.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps in recognition of the inevitable, WorldCom is now
considering a plan to sell off Sprint's entire long-distance
business, in addition to Sprint's Internet operation. Such a plan
would almost surely appease the regulators but would skew the
financial plan that underpinned the acquisition in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the deal is Sprint's wireless telephone
operation, one of the biggest in the United States. Neither
WorldCom nor the old MCI owned a significant wireless network, and
WorldCom hopes to generate a lot more revenue by adding Sprint's
wireless offerings to its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sprint's wireless unit is growing quickly, it remains
highly unprofitable. Last year, it lost $2.5 billion on $3.2
billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the main attraction of WorldCom's stock has long
been its robust growth in per-share earnings. With the exception of
its acquisition of the Wiltel communications network a few years
ago, WorldCom has shied away from acquisitions that would dilute
its per-share earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's wireless unit trades as a ``tracking stock,'' which
helps isolate its losses from the financial results of the parent
company. But in deciding to pay $115 billion for Sprint, WorldCom
was counting on billions of dollars of cost savings from combining
the Sprint and WorldCom long-distance operations.
</P>
<P>
   But if WorldCom is forced to sell Sprint's long-distance
operation, it will not be able to realize those savings, throwing
into question the financial structure of the original deal. One way
out of this quandary would be to sell Sprint's long-distance unit
to another company that could generate similar cost savings. But if
the Sprint long-distance unit were sold to, say, a foreign company
or a Bell local carrier, the cost savings that could be realized
would be far smaller.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, unless it could renegotiate the deal with Sprint,
WorldCom would effectively end up paying a lot more than it had
planned for Sprint's wireless operation. That raises the prospect
that selling off Sprint's long-distance business in exchange for
regulatory approval would end up a Pyrrhic victory.

 &HT;    Euro won't miss Germany, England
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the quarterfinals of the European Championships
this weekend are an improvement on some stirring group matches thus
far, then this could go down as one of the best major tournaments
in years. Breathtaking displays by Spain and Portugal, the
well-rounded skill of France and Holland, and the Cinderella story
of Turkey winning its first European match give Saturday and
Sunday's contests the kind of buzz that has been missing most of
the last decade, in previous Euros and the last three World Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of dull, safe and unimaginative soccer have gone
home. And so have the English hooligans, whose outbursts in the
streets of Charleroi, Belgium, on Saturday might have scuttled
England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a dreadful foul by England defender Phil Neville in
the final minute of regulation on Tuesday, Romania advanced to a
quarterfinal mathchup against Italy with a 3-2 victory. He was
called for a penalty kick while chasing Viorel Moldovan in the box.
Ioan Ganea converted the spot kick and England, needing only a draw
to advance, had a goat to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevastated,'' blared a tabloid headline Wednesday in The Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The English are just about the only ones mourning their
departure. UEFA threatened to send the England team home when
nearly 900 people, most of them English, were arrested before
Saturday's 1-0 win over Germany because of altercations in
Charleroi. Plastic furniture was thrown about, minor injuries and
property damage resulted, and many of the violators were sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Germany and Holland took strong measures before
Euro 2000 to control their own hooligans; even suspected
troublemakers had their passports revoked. The British government,
by contrast, keeps records only of hooligans with a clear record of
misbehavior. Most of those detained had no previous arrests and a
good number of them, having consumed strong Belgian beer, were
piling on in the frenzy of the crowd. Embarrassingly, officials
representing the government and the English Football Association
were left to point out that only a handful of their fans were
causing problems.
</P>
<P>
   But those tensions have been removed from the proceedings and
replaced with brilliance on the pitch. Wednesday's thrilling 4-3
victory by Spain over Yugoslavia to capture Group C was a
celebration of freewheeling, attacking soccer that has marked Euro
2000. The Spaniards, a favorite to win the title, got two goals in
second-half stoppage time to reverse a long history of early exits.
Yugoslavia, playing a man down most of the second half, took a 3-2
lead but allowed Spain to draw even on a penalty kick by Gaizka
Mendieta moments into stoppage time. The Spaniards kept attacking,
however, and Alfonso ripped a dipping shot from the edge of the box
for the victory in what has been the best match of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Holland joined Portugal with a perfect 3-0-0 record in group
play by defeating France 3-2 on Wednesday in what could be a
preview of the championship match. France, fielding mostly its
second team, gave up second-half goals to Frank de Boer and
Boudewijn Zenden before a joyous orange-clad home crowd at the
Amsterdam ArenA.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Germany, which turned out the second-worst
showing of Euro 2000 (ahead of only winless, goalless Denmark), was
eliminated from the group stage for the first time since 1984,
after a 3-0 loss Tuesday to a Portugal team missing nine starters.
Coach Erich Ribbeck, who inherited a substandard side after the
1998 World Cup team, promptly resigned Wednesday, as the German
press went into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the soccer idiots of Europe! Germany is ashamed of
you!'' screeched the lead headline in Wednesday's Bild, a sports
daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Portugal meets upstart Turkey in Amsterdam, and
Italy takes on Romania in Brussels. On Sunday, Holland faces
Yugoslavia in Rotterdam, and Bruges, Belgium, hosts what should be
a classic between France and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep our feet firmly to the ground, despite the
euphoria we're feeling now,'' Spain's Alfonso said.

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ In a grudging move to reign in soaring oil
prices, ministers at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries decided Wednesday to increase their production limits by
about 708,000 barrels a day or 2.5 percent, beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, OPEC's second in three months, is slightly higher
than had been expected. But analysts said it remains too modest to
bring down gasoline prices, which have reached more than $2 a
gallon in some parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Given that member countries are already overshooting their
official production quotas, analysts said that Wednesday's move
largely amounts to a ratification of existing practices.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, any increased production in crude oil
will take at least two months to work its way through the refining
system and will not reach gasoline pumps until after the summer
driving season is largely over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are officializing what they are already producing,'' said
Roger Diwan, an analyst at the Petroleum Finance Corp., an industry
consulting firm in Washington. ``It's the minimum that could have
been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, oil ministers meeting here went out of their way to
place much of the blame for high gasoline prices on regulations and
refining problems in the United States as well as extremely high
gasoline taxes across much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``People in consuming countries point their finger at OPEC,''
complained Rilwanu Lukman, the organization's secretary-general.
``These people should tackle their own countries.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But many oil ministers have themselves been baffled by the
extent to which prices have remained high. One senior official here
complained that buying and selling in the petroleum markets has
caused unjustifiable price swings from as low as $24 to as high as
$33 since OPEC raised production at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Production has increased more than 2 million barrels a day since
the end of March, yet crude oil prices have rebounded and
inventories are still at their lowest levels in years.
</P>
<P>
   For all their caution, oil ministers meeting here displayed far
more solidarity than they did three months ago, when Iran angrily
rebelled against Saudi Arabian pressure to raise production by
about 7 percent, or a total of 1.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Iran on Wednesday signed on without any objections to the new
increase while also formally accepting the last one as well. By
avoiding a replay of the bitter rift in March, the OPEC ministers,
who control about 40 percent of the global supply of oil, easily
reached a consensus in one day.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Today everybody, I think, is of the opinion that an increase
was necessary,'' said Khelil Chakib, Algeria's oil minister, who
predicted that the price of crude oil would soon decline from more
than $30 a barrel to less than $28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was how big the increase should be,'' Chakib
added. ``I think this is about the right volume, because we have
got to consider manufacturers, the supply-demand behavior and the
growth of world consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude reflects a significant change in the mindset
within OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As recently as three months ago, many producer countries were
still terrified that any increase in production would lead to a
catastrophic decline in prices similar to one in 1998, when oil
fell to $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   But when oil prices jumped back to more than $30 a barrel after
the last production increase, exporting countries became
increasingly more confident.
</P>
<P>
   As one official from a non-OPEC producing country remarked
Wednesday, ``When the price of crude on the market is $33,
everybody can afford to be friends.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more countries now agree with Saudi Arabian
leaders that current prices are too high to be stable and would
over time cause economic slowdowns in consuming countries that
could hurt OPEC members by lowering global demand for their oil.
</P>
<P>
   World oil markets brushed off the production increase announced
Wednesday, sending prices up. Crude oil prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange jumped about 2 percent or 72 cents to $31.37 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers essentially conceded Wednesday that they had
given up their plan for an ``automatic'' adjustment if oil prices
ranged outside a band of $22 to $28 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Member countries had agreed to the band in March, but when the
20-day average price of oil exceeded $28 a barrel two weeks ago,
the organization did not impose any increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about bands,'' Lukman told reporters after the oil
ministers adjourned their meeting. ``Focus on the fact that OPEC
wants a price of around $25 a barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's influence on the global supply of oil is immense. It
plays a crucial role as a swing producer that can pump or withhold
additional oil.
</P>
<P>
   Many OPEC members are already at or near their own maximum
capacity. But the countries that still have extra capacity are
among its biggest producers: Saudi Arabia, which pumps about 8
million barrels a day; Kuwait, which pumps about 2 million barrels;
and the United Arab Emirates, which pumps about 2.2 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Iran, which produces about 3.6 million barrels a day, is
believed to be near maximum capacity. But Iran's oil minister,
Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, insisted Wednesday evening that his country
could meet its new quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough capacity,'' Sangeneh said at the start of the
minister's meeting. ``We can comply fully with our commitments
within OPEC.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A few important non-OPEC producers, mainly Mexico and Norway,
are expected to increase production as well. Both countries copied
the production cuts that OPEC members adopted in March 1999, which
helped prices more than triple to a high of $34, the highest in
nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Further non-OPEC production could add another 300,000 barrels of
oil a day, bringing the total supply of new oil to 600,000 or
700,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration greeted OPEC's
decision with cautious praise. The White House has kept a decidedly
low profile in the last few weeks, in sharp contrast to the
relentless and very public lobbying conducted by the secretary of
energy, Bill Richardson, before OPEC's meeting in March.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richardson's lobbying campaign, which included telephone calls
to OPEC ministers while they were meeting in Vienna, irritated many
countries and provoked especially loud denunciations from Iran
about ``external pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson expressed a measured endorsement of OPEC's decision
Wednesday, calling it ``a positive, though modest step that we hope
will lead to more stable oil markets and lower oil prices at the
pump.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary N. Ross, head of PIRA Energy, an energy consulting firm in
New York, was more skeptical and predicted that Wednesday's move
would do little to minimize U.S. motorists' anger, particularly in
the Midwest where gasoline prices have surpassed $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``World demand will go up by 1.5 million barrels a day in the
third quarter compared to the second quarter,'' Ross predicted here
Wednesday. ``So we are not going to get the supply to increase
stock-building. This is not going to make Al Gore or the U.S.
government very happy.''

LAWMAKERS DEBATE 
EASING CUBAN EMBARGO 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers moved closer Wednesday to easing the
40-year-old embargo against Cuba as support among farm state
Republicans and Democrats mounted for eliminating sanctions on food
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders and Cuban-American lawmakers continued to
insist that a provision relaxing sanctions be rewritten to deny any
U.S. loans to Fidel Castro's communist regime that could be used to
purchase food or medicine from U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida and other anti-Castro
Republicans said they wanted language that would allow ``cash
only'' deals between U.S. companies and Havana on the sale of
agriculture goods and medical supplies. They also want a
prohibition of the import of Cuban goods to the United States. The
provision is included in the 2000 agriculture appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. agriculture interests contend that potentially billions of
dollars in U.S. sales to Cuba could be jeopardized if the Cuban
government is denied access to U.S. banks to help pay for
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting off all access to U.S. credits and loans would
basically make the lifting of these sanctions meaningless,'' said
one farm state lobbyist who was instrumental in helping to get
language placed in the agriculture bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba is not exactly the kind of country that has a lot of
cash-on-hand,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics of relaxing the embargo point out that Cuba is
unlikely to increase its import of food even if the sanctions are
lifted. They argue that easing the restrictions would force Castro
to loosen his control over the economy to accommodate private
investors who may be concerned about the Cuban government
interfering with their business activities.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the language in the agriculture bill would be the
most significant change in trade sanctions against Cuba since they
were imposed nearly 41 years ago when Castro came to power.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would also ease the embargoes on food and medicine
in place against North Korea, Libya, Iran and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders, including Majority Leader Dick Armey
and Majority Whip Tom DeLay, both of Texas, remain strongly opposed
to any change in the embargo. Along with House Speaker Dennis
Hastert of Illinois, they have tried since May to figure out how to
strip the Cuba language out of the agriculture bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Michelle Davis, Armey's press secretary, said Tuesday that
the leadership is now resigned to the fact there is growing support
within Congress for changing the policy toward Cuba. She said the
leadership is now trying to help negotiate a compromise that will
be acceptable to both Cuban-American and farm state members of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens in the negotiations, however, she
said the agriculture bill would likely be brought to the floor next
week for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the only question is what kind of language will be in
it?'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   If a compromise cannot be reached in the coming days, there
could be a floor fight over the issue. But opponents of lifting the
embargo would likely lose that showdown, given the fact that
support for lifting the sanctions has grown in both the House and
Senate. The Senate passed an anti-sanctions bill last year but it
died after the House failed to consider it. This year, the Senate
Foreign Relations and Appropriations committees have already
approved measures that would greatly ease the embargo.

ORBITER SPOTS SIGNS OF A RECENT FLOW OF WATER ON MARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A spacecraft orbiting Mars has sighted grooved
surface features suggesting a relatively recent water flow on the
planet, a finding that could redirect efforts to find evidence of
past or present life there, experts said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, which has been conducting
photographic surveys of the planet for more than two years, has
spotted evidence of liquid water at, or near, the surface that
could have flowed a few hundreds or thousands of years ago, a
billion years later than previous estimates, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration scheduled a
news conference for Thursday to discuss the findings after a day of
speculation about the discovery in the news media. A paper
describing the observations is to be published next week in the
journal Science, but the journal's editors decided to release the
information on Thursday because of the interest in the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Neither NASA nor the authors of the report, including Dr.
Michael C. Malin and Dr. Ken Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems
of San Diego, would disclose details of the study. But people
familiar with the report said high resolution pictures from Global
Surveyor clearly show channels and grooves on the steep, inside
walls of craters that indicate the downward flow of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   These surface features appear to be evidence of water in the
upper crust of Mars that has seeped through and run down the
channels, said two experts familiar with the report who spoke on
the condition that they not be named. Contrary to speculation about
the findings, there is no clear evidence of standing pools of water
or gushing springs on Mars, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current climate of Mars would cause surface water to
instantly freeze and vaporize into the atmosphere,'' one expert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Water is crucial to plans for exploring Mars with robot
spacecraft to find evidence of life, and for possible visits by
humans. The United States has ambitious Mars exploration plans that
focus on finding water. Those plans are being revised after the
failure of two spacecrafts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's chief scientist, said future
orbiting and surface craft would search for water and the life it
can sustain. ``To find life on Mars, you have to follow the
water,'' Weiler has said. ``Without water, there was no life as we
know it in the past, and there is no life now. It's all about the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Future spacecraft would be directed to areas where there is a
high probablility of finding water. Data from orbiters and landing
craft would help researchers home in on those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Water on Mars would also make human visits more likely and
economical, experts said, because astronauts could drink it, and it
could be broken down into oxygen to breathe and hydrogen to fuel
rockets and generators.
</P>
<P>
   Water has already been detected on Mars in the form of ice
trapped at the poles, but until now no evidence of it had been seen
elsewhere. Because of the planet's extreme temperatures, with
average surface temperatures of minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and an
atmospheric pressure less than 1 percent that of Earth's, liquid
water would not exist long on the surface before breaking down in
the thin air and drifting into space.
</P>
<P>
   But there is ample evidence of flowing water long ago on the
planet, including channels and canyons formed by flowing rivers
millions of years ago and indications of upswelling ground waters.
And last year, scientists at Brown University said that they found
evidence in Global Surveyor pictures, which are more than 20 times
more detailed than any previous photographs, of a giant ocean that
once existed in the northern lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing aspect of the newest findings is the possibility
of water near the surface, instead of miles below as some have
theorized. If water is a few feet below the surface, as early
characterizations of the new data suggest, landing crafts could
drill down to reach it, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Victor R. Baker, a hydrology expert and planetary scientist
at the University of Arizona, said that if there was evidence of
active water seepage in the new data, it would have wide
implications. Baker, who had not seen the report, said that if
water still flowed on Mars and escaped to the surface, it would
need an underground heat source to keep it thawed and provide the
energy necessary to force it to the surface. So far, no evidence of
active volcanic or thermal activity has been found on the planet,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
   If water was flowing on Mars, he said, it would produce a cloud
of vapor, as it dissipated under current surface conditions, that
spacecraft instruments should be able to detect from orbit. ``It
should be fairly easy to confirm if there is major seepage going on
now,'' Baker said.

OPEC AGREES TO 2.5   PERCENT INCREASE IN OUTPUT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ In a grudging move to reign in soaring oil
prices, ministers at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries decided Wednesday to increase their production limits by
about 708,000 barrels a day or 2.5 percent, beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, OPEC's second in three months, is slightly higher
than had been expected. But analysts said it remains too modest to
bring down gasoline prices, which have reached more than $2 a
gallon in some parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Given that member countries are already overshooting their
official production quotas, analysts said that Wednesday's move
largely amounts to a ratification of existing practices.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, any increased production in crude oil
will take at least two months to work its way through the refining
system and will not reach gasoline pumps until after the summer
driving season is largely over.
</P>
<P>
   Production has increased more than 2 million barrels a day since
the end of March, yet crude oil prices have rebounded and
inventories are still at their lowest levels in years.
</P>
<P>
   For all their caution, oil ministers meeting here displayed far
more solidarity than they did three months ago, when Iran angrily
rebelled against Saudi Arabian pressure to raise production by
about 7 percent, or a total of 1.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Iran on Wednesday signed on without any objections to the new
increase while also formally accepting the last one as well. By
avoiding a replay of the bitter rift in March, the OPEC ministers,
who control about 40 percent of the global supply of oil, easily
reached a consensus in one day.
</P>
<P>
   World oil markets brushed off the production increase announced
Wednesday, sending prices up. Crude oil prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange jumped about 2 percent or 72 cents to $31.37 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's influence on the global supply of oil is immense. It
plays a crucial role as a swing producer that can pump or withhold
additional oil.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration greeted OPEC's
decision with cautious praise. The White House has kept a decidedly
low profile in the last few weeks, in sharp contrast to the
relentless and very public lobbying conducted by the secretary of
energy, Bill Richardson, before OPEC's meeting in March.

MOST TEXANS IN POLL STILL 
SUPPORT DEATH PENALTY 

</HEADLINE>
 POLL-HNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than half of Texans believe innocent people
have been executed, but the vast majority of them continue to
support the use of the death penalty, a new poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Scripps Howard Texas Poll also found that even greater
numbers of Texans favor a moratorium on executions in cases that
might be affected by DNA testing and think felons should have the
right to obtain free testing of genetic material to prove their
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 1,000 adults was conducted between May 22
and June 16. Although the Texas Poll has looked at the death
penalty in the past, this was the first time questions were asked
about executing an innocent person or DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are similar to those being raised across the
nation as Texas' use of capital punishment comes under scrutiny,
due largely to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he believes every one of the 134 people executed
during his 5 1/2 years in office was guilty. He reiterated that
Wednesday while campaigning in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, there has not been one innocent
person executed since I've been the governor,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Texans do not necessarily agree. Fifty-seven
percent of those surveyed said they believe Texas has executed
someone who was innocent of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, 73 percent said they support the continued use of
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The support is statistically the same as a year ago, but up 5
percentage points from February 1998. That 68 percent approval
rating was the lowest Texans have given the death penalty since
1988, according to the Texas Poll. It came after the highly
publicized execution of Karla Faye Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty support peaked in 1988 and again in 1994, when 86
percent of Texans said they agreed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Support of the death penalty among Texans varies significantly
among racial and ethnic groups, according to the poll. Survey
results show that while 81 percent of Anglos back capital
punishment, support drops to 55 percent among Hispanics and 44
percent among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they thought Texas had ever executed an
innocent person, 71 percent of African-Americans said they believed
that to be the case. Only 55 percent of Anglos and 54 percent of
Hispanics believe someone innocent has been executed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Nearly 9 out of 10 Texans said they believe inmates should have
the right to obtain free DNA testing to try to prove their
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Three out of four respondents said the state should declare a
moratorium on death sentences in cases that might be affected by
DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Scripps Howard Data Center said its poll has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, meaning the results can
vary in either direction by that much. The margin of error is
slightly higher when poll results are broken down into smaller
categories such as race and ethnicity, according to the data
center. &UR;  &QL;

 WASHINGTON: criminal organizations. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In debate this week, senators have not disputed that the United
States must help Colombia, which is the source of 90 percent of the
cocaine and 65 percent of the heroin seized in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have warned that Washington was being pulled more
deeply into a convoluted civil conflict in which two leftist
guerrilla armies are fighting the government, right-wing
paramilitary forces are fighting the guerrillas, guerrillas are
providing paid protection to drug traffickers and civilians are
trapped in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that Colombia is a country in crisis,'' said Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis. ``But we're not walking into this scheme
with our eyes wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the aid package is an armada of helicopters and
more than $500 million for the Colombian army and police, all of
which would be used to train and equip three battalions for
anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference between the House and Senate bills is the
helicopter of choice. The House package includes 30 Blackhawk
helicopters, which have longer range and can carry more troops than
the 60 Huey helicopters that the Senate approved. The Blackhawks
cost $12.8 million each, according to administration figures, as
opposed to $1.8 million each for the Hueys.
</P>
<P>
   The administration favors the Blackhawks. An amendment to leave
the choice of helicopter up to the American and Colombian
militaries narrowly failed, 51-47.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version also provides more aid to other Andean
countries than the House bill, and for protecting human rights in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the aid package framed the debate not only in
terms of backing a Latin Amerian ally, but also as a crucial step
in fighting the drug war in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very essence of why we need to help restore stability in
Colombia and help combat the violent insurgents is the need to keep
drugs off our streets here at home and out of the hands of our
children,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio.

HOW FIRM FOUGHT GOVERNMENT STUDY LINKING MINERS' DEATHS, ASBESTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two decades ago, a U.S. government study concluded
that workers at R.T. Vanderbilt Co. talc mines were dying from
asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   But an unauthorized collaboration between Vanderbilt and two
government scientists attempted to discredit the study, and
influenced a federal agency to abandon efforts to regulate the
asbestos fibers found in the talc.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the scientists were ultimately disciplined for their
unreported relationship with Vanderbilt and left their government
jobs, the renegade report they produced is still hindering efforts
to protect workers and consumers, health officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health published a study examining the health of miners and millers
in the talc mines around Gouverneur, N.Y. It documented health
problems caused by two forms of asbestos _ tremolite and
anthophyllite _ and a significant increase in asbestos-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, responding to a request for a health hazards
evaluation from the talc miners and their union, used company
records to identify 710 men who worked with the ore between 1947
and 1978. NIOSH found the death rate from non-malignant respiratory
disease in that group to be almost three times higher than what was
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that it was very unlikely that an excess of deaths
that large would have occurred by chance,'' Dr. Elizabeth Ward of
the agency's Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and
Field Studies said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The study also reported that deaths among the miners from lung
cancer was twice the expected rate, ``a very pronounced excess,''
Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that these are valid scientific
reports,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIOSH's position on these studies was there was asbestos in
the talc,'' Ward said. ``I'm not sure what more I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years later, NIOSH stands by its studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Dement, who headed the NIOSH team doing the Vanderbilt
studies, says he hasn't ``backed down at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of semantics being played again in regard to the
definition of asbestos, but the lung and (its lining) doesn't care
about what it's called. That mine has asbestos fibers of biological
significance which have caused and most likely, continue to cause,
health problems for the miners and others exposed to them,'' says
Dement, now a Duke University professor. He still specializes in
occupational safety and health research.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt denounced the studies when they were published, and
still does today.
</P>
<P>
   The studies were incorrect, flawed and criticized by the NIOSH's
own scientists, says John Kelse, Vanderbilt's corporate risk
manager.
</P>
<P>
   The part about the internal criticism is true.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, John Gamble, an epidemiologist assigned to NIOSH's
Division of Respiratory Disease Studies in Morgantown, W.Va.,
criticized the agency's 1980 study.
</P>
<P>
   But the facts behind his criticism launched an investigation by
NIOSH Executive Officer Larry Sparks and the inspector general for
the Department of Health and Human Services into allegations that
Gamble and his supervisor in the respiratory disease division had
``inappropriate financial dealings'' with Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said they found no proof that money changed
hands, but did find that there were ``frequent private visits and
contacts'' between Vanderbilt officials and Gamble and Bob Glenn,
who headed the respiratory disease division. The investigators'
report said ``complimentary meals and travel'' were accepted, and
there was an ``enormous, continuing conflict of interest'' that
tainted the work done by Gamble and Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators examined what they termed a ``private''
four-year relationship between a handful of NIOSH scientists and
Vanderbilt officials, including Hugh Vanderbilt, the company
president. They documented scores of letters and more then 14
meetings _ many lasting a full work day _ that senior NIOSH
officials knew nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions began in 1984 when Vanderbilt officials
contacted Gamble to express concerns over the 1980 report and its
impact on the definition of asbestos that the Occupational Health
and Safety Administration was about to make into law, NIOSH
documents showed.
</P>
<P>
   This ``project'' was ``intentionally concealed'' from NIOSH
staff and its director, the investigators determined, adding that
there was no research protocol and there was no peer review. The
tradition in NIOSH and other government agencies for researchers to
share information and seek opinions from other scientists
apparently never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was unauthorized, the epidemiologist's work would be of
no value to Vanderbilt if it wasn't made public. So, according to
the investigators, members of the Morgantown lab ``developed a
strategy'' to have Vanderbilt request a Health Hazard Evaluation to
update the critical 1980 study. Glenn assigned the job to Gamble,
who had been privately meeting with Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks after being given the assignment, Gamble
submitted a ``preliminary'' 22-page report with 47 references to
Glenn. It criticized NIOSH's findings on the dangers of workers'
exposure to the Vanderbilt talc, faulted Dement's mortality study
of the miners and the agency's position on the health hazards of
the asbestos found in the mine.
</P>
<P>
   On July 8, 1986, even before the report was submitted,
Vanderbilt's Kelse contacted Glenn, requesting a copy, the
investigators found.
</P>
<P>
   Other NIOSH scientists raised concerns over how the report was
done.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations say an evaluation of this type must have input from
not only the company, but also from the union and other concerned
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``All information used by the investigators was supplied solely
and directly by Vanderbilt or its consultants,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It also listed other troubling departures from policy:
</P>
<P>
   The investigator made no site visit to Vanderbilt's mine or
mill. The individual routinely assigned to coordinate these
evaluations had no involvement, nor did any of the investigator's
immediate supervisors. Gamble bypassed the rest of the chain of
command and reported directly to Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time _ June 17, 1986 _ OSHA issued a new standard
which defined tremolite and anthophyllite as asbestos _ the same
fibers found in NIOSH's 1980 study as the likely cause of the death
and illness of Vanderbilt's miners.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Vanderbilt filed a challenge for review in the
U.S. Court of Appeals. Almost immediately, Vanderbilt's Kelse wrote
to Gamble, saying that his study was ``the best hope'' in the
company's effort to overturn the OSHA standard and to gain the
attention of the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   It was July 1, 1986, when Dr. Donald Millar, NIOSH's director,
first learned of the unsanctioned study. That morning, Hugh
Vanderbilt and a lawyer showed up at the agency's Atlanta
headquarters to pick up the study and the supporting memos under a
Freedom of Information Act request. Glenn had hand-carried the
material to Atlanta so Vanderbilt could get it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, 1987, OSHA agreed that Vanderbilt could continue to
operate as usual, since the debate over the definition of the
asbestos fibers had been extended for another year.
</P>
<P>
   In December of that year, Millar was called by Labor Secretary
William Brock, who said he had met with Vanderbilt officials. He
wanted to know why OSHA had not been told about Gamble's study and
questioned what NIOSH's position was on its 1980 report and how it
was defining asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Millar quickly wrote to OSHA, saying that ``the NIOSH definition
and policy regarding asbestos has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, 1992, OSHA decided to eliminate the part of its
standards which would have regulated the asbestos found in
Vanderbilt's mine, based in part on ``certain NIOSH staff memos
which have recently been brought to its attention.''
</P>
<P>
   One NIOSH official characterized the impact of the ``spoon-fed
study'' accepted by OSHA as ``a bell that couldn't be unrung.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conclusion to its report, the investigators wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on their inappropriate actions in the course of pursuing
the studies of workers employed by the R.T. Vanderbilt Co.,
appropriate disciplinary action is being taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said this week that neither he nor Gamble were``fired or
let go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say the scientific views by some in NIOSH differed with
others, including ours. I thought that's what scientists were
suppose to do. You know, debate and argue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   John Kelse, director of risk management for Vanderbilt, said
yesterday, ``It was an internal conflict. If you want to have a
good study done, the company has to be involved. How can you have
your plant studied if you're not part of the process? I don't see
that as any conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Millar convened a ``board of scientific counselors'' to review
the the study that Vanderbilt wanted released so badly. The board
concluded that the ``updated study supports the finding of an
excess risk for lung cancer and non-malignant respiratory disease
which was observed in these workers by NIOSH researchers in 1980.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said the study that he and Gamble did wasn't unauthorized
nor was there a conflict of interest, ``but I really don't want to
go into all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he balanced his, Gamble's and Vanderbilt's views
that there wasn't harmful asbestos in the talc with the documented
cases of hundreds of miners being sickened and killed by asbestos,
he answered: ``I'd have to see the medical studies, but I'm not a
doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither OSHA nor the Mine Safety and Health Administration has
made any effort to change the controversial ruling, which has left
the miners without help for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these fibers, which are respirable, can get into
the lungs, can cause disease, but are not regulated, means that
these miners and the people who use their products are not being
protected under federal standards as they should be,'' says Dr.
Richard Lemen, a former associate director of NIOSH and a former
assistant surgeon general who teaches at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although OSHA has not formally announced that it intends to
reopen the record for further rulemaking, it is closely monitoring
the toxicological data and hazard information on asbestos and other
mineral fibers. If these data indicate that workers may be at
significant risk of material impairment of health, OSHA will
initiate rulemaking,'' an agency spokesperson said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon said the impact of Gamble's study meant on NIOSH
scientists' desire for credible and unbiased research ``should not
be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was indeed a low point to the morale of the institute, but
at the same time a very significant event as the institute took
quick steps to assure such behavior would not recur,'' said Lemen.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, miners in all mines that have asbestos as a
contaminant _ including talc, vermiculite and taconite _ continue
to work under health regulations that fail to take the contested
fibers into account.
</P>
<P>
   Dement shares the miners' frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not commercial asbestos that is killing the miners or
making them ill. It's the asbestiform tremolite and anthophyllite,
and fibrous components in the talc,'' he said. ``That hasn't
changed.''

CONGO LEADER SHUTS DOWN AFRICA MEDIATION EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Laurent Kabila of Congo said
Wednesday that he was shutting down an effort by the Organization
of African Unity to open a political discourse among warring
factions in Congo and banning the coup's mediator because he had
openly criticized the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Kinshasa offices of the mediator, Sir Ketumile Masire, a
former president of Botswana, were sealed and his staff dispersed,
Kabila said. The move sets back hopes in the Security Council that
a political discussion among the Congo factions could take place
simultaneously with efforts to disarm them and prepare the way for
a United Nations peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department called Kabila's actions a ``clear
violation'' of a 1999 peace agreement and said that they
``undermine prospects for regional peace and development.'' It
called on Congo to permit the immediate reopening of the office and
to cooperate fully with the effort to start a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila made his statements in a telephone interview from
Kinshasa, the country's capital. While he was critical of the
efforts to start talks to end the civil war, Kabila was
surprisingly hopeful that he and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda _
allies until the Rwandans invaded Congo in 1998 _ could work out a
peace deal between them. Eleven days ago, the two men met for the
first time in more than two years at the Kenyan hill town of
Eldoret.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mr. Kagame I think we can find a solution to the problem
of the war,'' Kabila said. ``If he's serious. If he will recognize
the mistakes he made by invading the Congo. He seems to have
interest in really discussing peace with us. This was my
impression. I believe he was sincere. But we shall see.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila was dismissive, however, of President Yoweri Museveni of
Uganda, whose troops are also part of the conflict in Congo. He
said the Ugandans had no higher aim than to loot the country.
</P>
<P>
   The current phase of fighting in Congo began a year after
Kabila, with Rwanda's help, took power in 1997 after leading a
rebellion that overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko, whose long dictatorship
had bled the country dry. Since then, fighting has involved the
armies of six African nations and several rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   In talking about Masire's ill-fated political mission, Kabila
showed his abiding irritation with South Africa, which he said has
long been a friend of his enemies. It was a remark that Masire made
on a South African radio program that incensed the Congolese more
than anything, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His statement, openly on South African Broadcasting Corp.,
that he will go with the internal dialogue with or without Kabila _
that created the maximum point of discord,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila said he had written to the Organization of African Unity
asking it to find a replacement for Masire who would be impartial
and, moreover, could speak French. The organization is responsible
under the 1999 Lusaka peace accord on Congo for providing a
``facilitator'' for political talks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Masire made speeches everywhere against the government,''
Kabila said in the interview, which was arranged through his
American public relations adviser, John Aycoth, who was in
Kinshasa. ``He has an agenda very, very contrary to what we have
been believing he would be. We have decided that never will he be
accepted here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila said, however, that he had no problems with United
Nations officials in Kinshasa. He explained a mob attack last week
on the United Nations headquarters in Congo as the work of
disaffected easterners displaced by war who had heard about
fighting in the eastern city of Kisangani and thought the United
Nations should be doing something about it. United Nations
officials said they saw the attack as a reminder of how volatile
Congo is and how bad Kabila's relations with the outside world have
generally been.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a group of Security Council members, led by
Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke of the United States, visited Congo
as fighting between Ugandans and Rwandans flared in Kisangani. The
ambassadors negotiated a promise from both the Rwandan and Ugandan
leaders to withdraw their troops from Kisangani, creating a neutral
city of about three million people where the United Nations could
deploy its first peacekeepers _ and perhaps find a base for the
discussion everyone hoped would soon begin.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila said he had no objections to the plan as long as his
government's sovereignty over Kisangani was recognized. But he
asked why the United Nations was thinking of sending a South
African battalion to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need other troops we can not suspect of being friends to
the aggressor,'' he said. ``That is the problem with the South
Africans. The South Africans have been assisting the other side
since the beginning of the war. I think the world is very wide. Why
can't they find other troops?''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila was skeptical about reports that Ugandans and Rwandans
were withdrawing from Kisangani, which would make a United Nations
move into the town more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United States and Congo remain cool.
Kabila accused Washington of blocking disbursements from a $50
million World Bank trust fund, even if the money were to go
strictly to nongovernmental agencies in Congo. The United States
has not contributed to the fund, which was set up late in 1997,
more than six months after Kabila rose to power.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Kabila repeated his complaints that United States
support for the Rwandan president, Kagame, has prolonged Rwanda's
war in Congo, which began in 1998, ostensibly to pursue ethnic Hutu
militias that had carried out genocidal attacks in Rwanda in 1994.
Rwanda says that Congo is not doing enough to deal with this
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the State Department during the two years was not
supporting Kagame and Museveni, I think we would be talking peace
now _ and reconstruction,'' Kabila said. ``From the beginning we
wanted to have good relations with the United States. We thought
the United States will support us after the liberation, to
democratize the country, to reconstruct the country. We didn't
understand that a few people there had decided to support the
aggressors, and abandon the Congolese people. They give all the
money to Uganda and to Rwanda.''

RUSSIAN MEDIA EXECUTIVE, FREED FROM JAIL, FEELS NEW PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Gazprom, Russia's biggest company, began a campaign of
pressure Wednesday against the owner of the nation's largest
independent media conglomerate, demanding that his company repay a
large debt.
</P>
<P>
   The move came a week after Vladimir Gusinsky, the media tycoon,
was jailed on charges of embezzlement. He was released pending
trial. But he has expressed concern that he will face more
pressure, and President Vladimir Putin has called on Gazprom, a
financial supporter, to take a tough stand toward Gusinsky's
company.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas company, on Wednesday
seemed to confirm Gusinsky's fears. It said it would insist that
his company, Media-Most, make good on a large loan that Gazprom
guaranteed, which would subject Gusinsky's company to serious
economic pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The $211 million loan from Credit Suisse First Boston was
payable in March. Gusinsky put up 20 percent of his company as
collateral, and Gazprom paid the loan and now insists that he
settle the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was freed from jail after complaints from Russian
businessmen, politicians and journalists. Now the government, which
is Gazprom's main shareholder, appears to be looking for his weak
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the money first and foremost,'' said Alfred Kokh,
general director of Gazprom Media, a subsidiary that manages the
company's media assets. ``We haven't taken the collateral yet, and
we aren't sure that we want it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Gazprom has tried to pressure
Gusinsky. Earlier this year, Gazprom's chief executive, Rem
Vyakhirev, called for Media-Most to take a more pro-government
stance in covering the war in Chechnya, saying the critical
coverage gave Gazprom serious reason to reconsider extending
financial support.
</P>
<P>
   The government has indicated that Gazprom should halt financial
support to Media-Most. Putin, on an official visit to Europe last
week, wondered aloud why Gazprom ``should spend money on this.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Sergei Dubinin, deputy chairman of Gazprom,
indicated the company should get out of side businesses like media.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gusinsky's company has vulnerabilities. Media-Most is heavily in
debt to Gazprom, which now holds 14 percent of the company. But
because it paid the past loan, and is liable for a future loan,
Gazprom stands to own 54 percent _ a majority _ of Media-Most
stock, according to Kokh of Gazprom Media. Media-Most says the
figure is less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most is looking for a foreign investor who could help ease
the pressure from Gazprom. Media-Most's main television network,
NTV, holds about a third of Russia's television advertising market,
which totaled about $150 million last year. Still, the company ran
into a cash crunch after the 1998 financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most says it is worth $2 billion. Gazprom says the amount
is far less. ``This is a big fight over the valuation of his
companies and what he's prepared to give up,'' one market insider
said of Gusinsky. ``If his valuation is really that high, then why
doesn't he just extinguish the loan?''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Gazprom has guaranteed about $400 million in loans to
Gusinsky's company. The next loan matures in a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a live television broadcast on Tuesday, Gusinsky said his
company is not in danger of losing assets. But more pushing from
Gazprom will stretch its finances and hurt its chances of finding a
foreign investor.

REVENGE OF THE GERONTOCRACY: ITALY'S ELITE CLING TO POWER IN OLD
AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Italian advertising is known for shock value. But even in
Italy, the image of former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, 81,
glaring sinisterly in black and white from huge city billboards and
full-page newspaper ads, was startling.
</P>
<P>
   The ad copy for a new Diner's Club Web site, www.DiNetClub.com,
plays with Andreotti's long, tumultuous history in postwar
politics: ``He thought he had seen everything. So he thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The creator of the ad, Marco Testa, head of the Armando Testa
Agency, explained that Andreotti's fame and his reputation for dry
humor made him an obvious choice. ``There is a string of irony
running through his personality that makes the ad work.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is another unexpected twist buried in the advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet got a late start in Italy but is already viewed by
sociologists as a catalyst for social change, a way of breaking
down Italy's rigid old-boy network of political and financial
influence and of creating jobs, uninherited fortunes and new power
bases. Andreotti, seven times prime minister and who last year was
acquitted in two trials of charges he colluded with the Mafia,
symbolizes something else: the revenge of Italy's gerontocracy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, after an investigation of widespread political
corruption toppled the old political order, causing the Socialist
Party and Andreotti's centrist Christian Democratic Party to
collapse, many Italians believed that a new generation of business
and political leaders would arise. Many new faces did emerge, but
lately, older ones are back in business.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, for example, had cabinet posts in
many previous governments, including those of the disgraced, and
now deceased, Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi in the 1980s.
Earlier this month, Amato threatened to quit if his embattled
center-left coalition sought a fresh, new face (i.e., not his own),
as the standard-bearer in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether in politics, finance, business, or academia, in Italy
there is a widespread gerontocracy, like the Kremlin 20 years
ago,'' Giampaolo Fabris, a sociology professor, said. Fabris is
studying aging at IULM, the Free University of Language and
Communication in Milan. At 62, Fabris, is by Italian academic
standards, a young Turk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more exceptions, of course, but there is
still tremendous resistance to change,'' Fabris explained. ``In
some things, Italy is rightly known for creativity and innovation,
but it is at its core an archaic civilization. In those, elders
retain power and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Nepotism is one factor. The state statistics agency last month
published a study showing that 38 percent of Italians under 40 got
their jobs through friends or family connections. A 1999 study by
Bocconi University's School of Management in Milan found that 78
percent of Italy's top 150 companies were family-owned. (The figure
in the United States is 20 percent.) The implicit quid pro quo is
that the father stays on as long as he likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father worked until he died, at the age of 74,'' Testa, 49,
who took over the advertising firm at his death in 1992, explained.
</P>
<P>
   Demographics also play a role. Italy has one of the lowest
birthrates in the world, and 18 percent of its population is over
65. Average life expectancy in Italy, which keeps growing, reached
75.5 in 1998 for men, according to the statistics agency. Women's
average life expectancy is 81.8.
</P>
<P>
   While most Italians retire at relatively young ages,
overburdening the pension system, within Italy's elite, leaders die
with their Gucci shoes on.
</P>
<P>
   Andreotti, who said he would donate his advertising fee to
charity, certainly shows no sign of retiring. He is active in the
Senate and writes articles, attends conferences and makes many talk
show appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Gianni Agnelli, also a senator for life, is now the honorary
chairman of Fiat. Removed from day-to-day company decision-making,
he remains, at 81, Italy's prince of industry, who regally welcomed
Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, to Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico Cuccia, who turns 93 in November, just got out of the
hospital, but still keeps an office and the title of honorary
chairman of Mediobanca, one of Italy's most important banks. Other
executives run Mediobanca day-to-day, but Cuccia is clinging to his
perch. His most recent entry in Who's Who in Italy explains that he
``has played a key role in all of the major financial operations
carried out in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither age nor scandal serve as automatic springboards to
retirement. In 1997, Cesare Romiti, then 73 and chairman of Fiat,
was convicted of accounting fraud and illegal political
contributions and given an 18-month suspended sentence. (It was
reduced further on appeal in 1999.) The case was one of the most
prominent in the Tangentopoli, or ``Bribesville,'' scandals of the
1990's, but Romiti did not fade away. In 1998, he nimbly became
chairman of RCS-Corriere della Sera, a huge publishing empire of
which Fiat owns the largest equity stake.
</P>
<P>
   Things are changing _ shaken up by Silicon Valley. Italy, too,
now has a new generation of relatively young computer plutocrats,
most notably, Renato Soru, 42, a Sardinian real-estate developer
and founder of Tiscali, an Internet start-up that, for a short
while this year surpassed Fiat in market value. He is on a 1999
list of Italy's 10 wealthiest men, but his is one of the few new
names in a roster dominated by long-established family fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Antonio D'Amato was elected head of Confindustria, Italy's
powerful association of industrialists last year, the fact that he
was 43 and from Naples, not the North, was hailed as revolutionary.
Italian business magazines regularly highlight the best and the
brightest young executives, often featuring Luca Garavoglia, 31,
president of Campari, the beverage company. He is also, however,
the son of the former chairman, Domenico Garavoglia, and took over
two years after his father's death in 1992. Some in Italy say
Garavoglia is nevertheless a symbol of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to be the son without power,'' Guido Corbetta,
40, a professor at Bocconi University, said. ``But it is another to
be given full power in your 30s, 40s or 50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian politics has grown slightly more youthful. President
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, is 79, but Prime Minister Amato is 62, and
his chief rival, the center-right opposition leader Silvio
Berlusconi, a media tycoon, is 63. Some of the most respected
newspaper columnists are old enough to have covered the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-year-old Indro Montanelli writes a daily column in
Corriere della Sera. Enzo Biagi, 80, writes columns for several
publications and also hosts a nightly five-minute news commentary
on RAI One, Italy's leading public network.
</P>
<P>
   Academia has seen the least mobility. At La Sapienza, the state
university of Rome and the largest university in Italy, the median
age for senior professors is 63. (It is 58 for ordinary professors;
49 for researchers.) In an effort to unclog Italy's tenure track,
the government recently lowered the mandatory retirement age for
academia from 72 to 67.
</P>
<P>
   Younger Italian doctors also complain about what they term the
``barons'' of medicine. Part of the problem is the sheer number of
doctors _ Italy has twice as many per capita as Finland. But top
jobs in hospitals and medical schools are still tightly controlled
by an older generation. Paolo Marotta, 39, who co-founded a union
of younger doctors to lobby against the medical establishment, said
it took him 12 years to find a job in the Italian public health
system _ even though he is in a boom industry _ gerontology. ``And
I am one of the really lucky ones,'' Marotta said.
</P>
<P>
   Andreotti's new ad campaign adapts one of his best known quips
to the Web site, ``the Internet wears out those who don't have
it.'' But Andreotti's original words were perhaps more fitting:
``Power wears out those who don't have it.''

HOUSE CLOSE TO LIFTING SANCTIONS AGAINST CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House is on the verge of allowing food and
medicine to be sent to Cuba for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   As sponsor of the controversial provision aimed at helping
struggling farmers by opening new markets, Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., is tantalizingly close to a hard-won victory. He and
others are confident it will happen, but the complexities and
political delicacy of the situation mean it could be a week or more
away, and there is a slight chance it still could fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt has had to navigate the ferocious and emotional
cross-currents inside the House that accompany questions involving
Cuba and U.S. relations. In doing so he has irritated both the
House leadership and the Cuban American National Foundation, an
anti-Castro group with deep pockets, vast influence in Washington
and a long memory.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt's provision would remove barriers that have prevented
shipments of food and medicine to Iran, Libya, Sudan and North
Korea as well as Cuba, because those countries have been deemed
hostile to U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for the change, Nethercutt points out that the
sanctions have locked U.S. farmers and businesses out of markets
that are actively pursued by Canada, the European Union, South
America and other U.S. trading competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sanctions against Cuba were imposed in 1961, Cuba was
a huge market for Washington state crops, and was the top importer
of Washington dry peas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States stands alone in prohibiting sales of the
most basic humanitarian goods to these countries, leading to $1
billion in lost economic activity in rural America,'' Nethercutt
wrote in a column last month in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our farmers suffer from lost sales, but these sanctioned
countries freely purchase an estimated $7 billion of agricultural
commodities from our allies around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue carries major political implications for Nethercutt,
who is considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the
House. A win would be good news for farmers, which would translate
into good political news for Nethercutt. Agriculture is a major
industry in his district and opening markets to their commodities
is a major litmus test in November.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing his bill, Nethercutt has butted heads with powerful
leaders of his own party, absorbed bruising attack ads aired in his
Spokane district, and been doubted by his allies. He has had to
endure weeks of tough negotiations and posturing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, aides to Nethercutt and his allies in the
House say an agreement is imminent. The provision is likely to be
added to the agriculture-spending bill that the House is scheduled
to consider next week. Though no final agreement has been reached,
negotiators have narrowed their differences and believe a
resolution can be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe both sides are very hopeful for a positive
resolution,'' said Nethercutt's chief of staff Jim Dornan.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who is
Nethercutt's most formidable opponent and a strident critic of
Cuban President Fidel Castro, offered a more cautious assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no agreement yet, either tentative or firm,'' said
spokesman Jonathan Baron. ``In matters like these, details matter
most and those details are still under discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest unresolved question concerns financing for
purchases. DeLay and his supporters insist that any sale to Cuba be
cash-only to preclude the possibility that U.S. tax dollars or tax
credits could be used to help an adversary. Nethercutt is willing
to include such a stipulation, but finding acceptable wording has
been difficult. DeLay is demanding wording that is ``air tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Nethercutt, however, are confident the problem can be
solved. And they point out that, after coming so far, it is a
relatively small matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt pulled together a unique coalition of farm-state
Republicans and Democrats sympathetic to human rights advocates who
believe liberalizing trade with Cuba is in the best interest of
both countries. Nethercutt says nearly 300 lawmakers in the House
support lifting sanctions if the GOP leadership would allow it to
come to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   His cause got a boost from the Elian Gonzalez case, which
improved Cuba's perception among the U.S. public, according to
polls. It also was helped earlier this spring when the House voted
to normalize trade with China, like Cuba a totalitarian country
that was once an adversary of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, negotiations are at such a fragile stage that
Nethercutt declined interview requests. In comments last month,
however, he laid out an argument that has proved effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic is straightforward: support American farmers and
American values by allowing the export of food and medicine to
currently sanctioned countries,'' Nethercutt said in the New York
Times column. ``The amendment merely allows sanctioned states to
buy food and medicine on a commercial basis, nothing more. If a
normal trading relationship with China is a home run for America,
then lifting these sanctions is the equivalent of a grand slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees it that way. DeLay remains an ardent,
entrenched opponent. So do House members from South Florida and
especially the Cuban American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cardenas, director of the foundation's Washington office,
vows to punish Nethercutt if the sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they (the GOP leaders) going to allow a backbencher to
decide what legislation reaches the floor and what doesn't?''
Cardenas said in an interview. ``I'm not saying George Nethercutt
has to be crushed like a bug, but (House Majority Leader Dick)
Armey and Mr. DeLay have to maintain party discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the threat, the foundation began airing ads last
week in Nethercutt's district. The 30-second ads, titled
``Dictatorship,'' don't mention Nethercutt by name but condemn
Castro for allegedly allowing forced child labor and child
prostitution, sponsoring international terrorism and imprisoning
political dissidents. ``Lifting America's embargo on Cuba will
strengthen Castro and help the abuses continue,'' the ad says.
``The embargo is right ... because the abuses are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas would not disclose how much the ad campaign costs, but
he said the organization was prepared ``to spend whatever it
takes'' to publicize their opposition and Nethercutt's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Also watching closely are constituents such as Cary Janson, a
farmer in the Palouse who lives about as far from Cuba and
Washington, D.C. as you can get and still have an address in the
continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   For hard-pressed farmers like Janson who are coping with
historically low commodity prices and overproduction, the
opportunity to sell crops to five hungry news countries is reason
to cheer, even if one of those nations is governed by one of the
world's last Communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a record number of farmers going broke, it's kind of
comical that the government will lock us out of these markets,''
said Janson, a fourth-generation farmer who says he ``was raised to
feed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his farming neighbors, Janson is particularly
galled by the sanction against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a huge consumer of dry peas 90 miles off the coast of
the U.S. and all the market is going to Canada,'' said Janson, who
grows peas, lentils and wheat on 2,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the kind of voter Nethercutt needs if he is to win a
fourth term. But while Janson is fond of Nethercutt and has voted
for him in the past, Janson is approaching the election with an
open mind.
</P>
<P>
   And he offers some advice that Nethercutt is sure to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, he says, ``has kind of turned their back on us. ...
But if (Nethercutt) wins this one, he's got my vote back for
sure.''

WHITE HOUSE ADMITS POSSIBLE PRIVACY VIOLATIONS OF COMPUTER USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House conceded Wednesday that it may have
violated federal privacy guidelines when it ordered its Office of
National Drug Control Policy to stop using a software device that
tracks computer users who view the government's anti-drug
advertisements on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To monitor traffic on its Internet sites for children and their
parents, the White House's drug policy office has employed computer
files known as ``cookies,'' which are placed in computers
electronically _ usually without the knowledge of users _ to
monitor their Internet travels.
</P>
<P>
   The software is widely used on many commercial web sites to
record information about the shopping habits and other interests of
their users. But White House officials said that they saw a
distinction between companies tracking customers and the government
doing similar monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't have to worry when they're getting
information from the government that the government is getting
information from them,'' said an administration official who worked
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The firm that installed the devices, DoubleClick, a New York
advertising company that specializes in the Internet, said it used
the monitoring software to measure which ads were most effective in
sending computer users to the drug office's Web sites. The
arrangement was set up by Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, which handles
the drug office's advertising account.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick outraged privacy-rights advocates and prompted an
investigation of the company by the Federal Trade Commission
earlier this year when it said it would merge anonymous data about
Web surfers with personal information it has in other databases.
The company has since suspended the plan, awaiting the outcome of
negotiations between the industry and the FTC on voluntary privacy
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally anonymous,'' a DoubleClick spokesman, Josh Isay,
said of the monitoring it does for the drug policy office. ``It's
not used for profiling. It's not shared with anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Most large commercial Internet sites, including those of The New
York Times and other news organizations, make use of cookies.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House, concerned about privacy violations, ordered
the practice stopped after it was reported this week by Scripps
Howard News Service. The White House also required the destruction
of any data gathered by DoubleClick and another contractor, the
Coleman Design Group of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Coleman Design, visitors to a drug office Web
site for parents were tracked by software that had been installed
without the knowledge of even drug office officials, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take all steps necessary to halt these practices
now,'' the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said. White House
officials said that they did not know if other government sites
monitored users but that if they did the practice would stop.
</P>
<P>
   The drug policy office operates two anti-drug Web sites, one for
children (www.freevibe.com) and another for parents
(www.antidrug.com). It will spend $12 million this year, part of a
$130 million advertising budget, to direct computer users to those
sites.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the drug policy office's campaign on the
Internet, computer users who visit certain youth-oriented Web sites
receive banner anti-drug ads at the top of their screens. If the
users click on those ads to reach the drug policy office, cookies
are installed, which can then track their movements.
</P>
<P>
   The drug policy office also made deals with various search
engines so that computer users who search the Internet with
drug-oriented terms such as ``pot'' or ``weed'' or ``huffing'' _ a
slang word used for sniffing inhalants _ would receive anti-drug

   Drug policy office officials said they had no idea they had
crossed any lines of propriety. ``We thought we were doing the
right thing,'' said Donald Maple, a senior policy analyst at the
office, ``and we thought we were being very sensitive to the nature
of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, sent a firmly
worded letter to the drug office Wednesday asking officials to
explain how they had reached such arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta's directive to the drug policy office Wednesday was not
the first time it has been forced to scale back its anti-drug
campaign. In January, drug policy officials said they would stop
scrutinizing scripts of television shows under a widely criticized
financial agreement with the networks that had encouraged them to
include anti-drug messages in the plots of shows.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the two-year-old arrangement, White House drug policy
officials reviewed more than 100 episodes of shows like ``E.R.''
and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' before they ran. Drug policy officials
said they would continue to reward networks for shows with strong
anti-drug themes, but that they would not review the shows'
contents until they had been televised.

million, mainly to the black customers and their heirs who, until
as recently as April, paid as much as 33 percent more than white
customers for small policies intended to cover burial expenses.

ASBESTOS DANGER IN TALC-MINE COUNTRY _ `GRAVEYARDS ARE FILLED WITH
PROOF' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOUVERNEUR, N.Y. _ The tombstones of Talcville and Balmat and
Hailesville tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath them lie generations of talc miners, and the numbers
carved in the marble and granite stones show that generations here
run short. Many of the men who took their living from this soft
white rock died young _ in their late 40s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Mining has always been a perilous profession, but few of these
men died from caved-in shafts or runaway ore cars or any of the
multitude of accidents that torment humans extracting minerals from
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Far more of them died the excruciating death of suffocation _
from lungs made uselessly rigid by scarring from deeply embedded
mineral fibers, lungs with cancerous tumors, lungs filled with
muddy-yellow fluid the consistency of honey. Lungs that could no
longer absorb life-giving air.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers that did this are the same fibers the government
found this month in crayons. That's because most of the nation's
top crayon makers put talc from The R.T. Vanderbilt Co. mines here
in their products.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer reported last month that tests
commissioned by the newspaper had found asbestos in three major
brands of crayons. Two weeks ago, after the Consumer Product Safety
Commission conducted its own tests, the agency urged crayon makers
to eliminate talc from their products. The three major
manufacturers agreed to do so within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt insists, and The Occupational Health and Safety
Administration agrees, that the huge number of fibers in Vanderbilt
talc, which look like asbestos, and which doctors say have the same
chemical composition and shape as asbestos, aren't asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Spending even a short time in St. Lawrence County makes it hard
to understand how anyone could say that.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the houses tell the same story as the gravestones:
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen tables bear baskets full of pills _ unless the grandkids
are visiting, then the pills are shoved out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Cylinders of oxygen and coils of tubing can often be found
beside the bed, or next to the best armchair in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   These men have the same disease that has been killing the miners
and millers of talc for years.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians say the cause is asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt says it's anything but.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many claims of finding asbestos in our mines,
but when we've been able to analyze those claims, we've not been
able to confirm it,'' said John Kelse, manager of Vanderbilt's
Corporate Risk Management Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no asbestiform _ anthophyllite or tremolite. There
are transitional fibers which can be described as asbestiform, and
we wouldn't argue with that. Are those things considered asbestos?
No. And more importantly, do they pose the same type of risk as
asbestos? The data that we have says they do not.''
</P>
<P>
   When interviewed Wednesday, Kelse, who sounded weary from
decades of explaining Vanderbilt's position, said he has ``stacks
of boxes filled with studies and reports showing the talc contains
no asbestos.'' Despite repeated requests, this material was not
made available to the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse law firm of Setright &AMP; Longstreet spent years
gathering depositions and other evidence on behalf of 139 miners or
the heirs of miners who died from asbestos-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   A jury will never get to weigh the evidence or hear the miners'
stories. Last year, the New York Supreme Court ruled that the
mining companies cannot be sued because state law requires that the
alleged injuries be handled through workers' compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I found hundreds of such claims, in which Vanderbilt
workers were found to have work-related respiratory disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   A foot-high stack of documents _ autopsy reports, medical
records, pathology studies and death certificates _ shows that
miners, millers and mine supervisors have died or are dying from
disease caused by fibers _ mostly asbestos _ in their lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions, medical records and company documents show
repeated examples of company doctors telling workers for years that
they were healthy, when X-rays locked away in company files showed
lungs filled with asbestos or tumors. If the miners had known this
medical information, they could have halted the deadly exposures,
doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably didn't believe that the X-rays showed
asbestosis,'' Kelse said when asked why the company withheld the
information. ``You can't do mineral analysis on an X-ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Other statements showed Vanderbilt's continuing assurances to
its workers that there was no asbestos in the talc. But
interspersed are company letters and reports touting the value and
variety of the asbestos-containing products it sold.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving is not easy
</P>
<P>
   While the court depositions graphically document the medical
plight of the miners, the true magnitude of the pain inflicted on
these families is far more apparent sitting across a kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   If Norman Rockwell was still searching for images that capture
the spirit of the nation, Herb and Margaret Conklin would be great
models.
</P>
<P>
   An American flag hangs from a pole in a driveway covered with
white tailings from the mine. Behind the pristine, carefully kept
house are two large, dilapidated barns.
</P>
<P>
   Conklin is one who did not die young. But his later years have
been filled with suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked in the mines for 30 years to the day,'' says Conklin,
77. He ran a rock crusher, drove ore cars, fixed heavy machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did about everything that could be done at the mines and all
of it in dust so heavy you sometimes couldn't see 10 feet.'' he
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They claimed the dust was safe, non-asbestiform. Vanderbilt
called it non-fibrous, nothing that would harm us. They posted
signs on the bulletin board saying the government doctors, the guys
from NIOSH, were wrong, that it wasn't dangerous,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers a late afternoon in one of the work buildings away
from the dustiest areas of the mine and mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun had dropped low enough to shine though one of the
dirty windows,'' he says, ``and the sunbeam that was cutting across
the room was thick with fine particles of dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared me because I knew there was asbestos in that dust,''
he says. ``The company knew it and they tried to hush it up every
time the government mine inspectors came up.''
</P>
<P>
   He and many of the other miners interviewed were critical of
mine inspectors for being too cozy with Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always called two or three days before they came out to
tell the company they were on the way and for the next two or three
days we shoveled, swept and wet down all the dust we could find,''
Conklin said, fingering a brown pill bottle.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1978 when he realized the how much harm the asbestos had
done to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was climbing up a ladder to work on the roof of the barn and
all of a sudden, I couldn't breathe. I just held on knowing that
the asbestos had gotten me,'' he says, patting the hand of his wife
of 53 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Conklins' lives and future changed. The 35 cows that he and
Margaret had milked twice a day and were going to provide enough to
live on when he retired, were soon sold off.
</P>
<P>
   He lowers his head and raises his thick glasses and rubs his
eyes. Margaret clutches his arm a little tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Conklin says he's not going to let anger burn him out, but the
anger is always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrong. If Vanderbilt didn't care enough about its
workers, why didn't the government step in? Everything got tried up
over what the company called the fibers. It didn't matter what they
called it, it was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fingers tell the tale
</P>
<P>
   About a mile away, on the main street of Edwards, down from the
one store and tiny cafe, two other Vanderbilt veterans sit in an
immaculate living room and compare notes on life in the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Minckler spent almost half of his 65 years working for
Vanderbilt. Bill Fuller, who is 68, did more then 26 years at the
same company and at St. Joe's, a zinc mine across the road.
</P>
<P>
   As a yellow canary looked on from its cage, the two men tried to
recall the group of young men they started at the mines with
decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After a litany of ``He's dead,'' ``He's gone,'' and ``Nope, he
passed also,'' the men became quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm lucky,'' Minckler says in a soft but raspy voice.
Of the 52 guys I began with at the mine, all but three are dead and
most of them died young, in their 40s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer took a bunch of them. The rest just couldn't breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk about other acquaintances who must use tanks of oxygen
to make it through the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get on that oxygen, they won't be around much
longer,'' Minckler says, shaking his head mournfully.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives are far from pain-free. As the two old friends used
their precious breath to tell stories, they compared notes on the
private anguish of being unable to suck in a chest full of air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be able to mow my lawn in 20 minutes,'' Minckler
said. ``Now, if I'm lucky and it's not too hot, it can take four
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller doesn't even try to do anything strenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't walk to the window without stopping,'' he says, ``and
that's no way for a man to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Conklin, they target their anger at both Vanderbilt and the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know why Vanderbilt lied about the danger. It would be bad
for business and no one would work for them,'' says Fuller. ``But
what about the government? Why don't they care? This asbestos, or
whatever Vanderbilt wants to call it, is not a secret. The
graveyards are filled with proof that those fibers are dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   What sparks their fury more than almost anything else, they say,
is that company doctors hid their illness from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as if they didn't know,'' Minckler said. ``Hell,
just look at our fingers. They're clubbed. Everybody's are like
that. It's a sign that the lungs aren't working.''
</P>
<P>
   Clubbing, a bulbous distortion of the fingertips and nails, is
caused by a prolonged state of inadequate oxygenation. Asbestos
specialists say it's rare today and usually only found when there
has been poor medical treatment or no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew we were sick. We took company physicals every year.
They knew whose lungs were shot, but they wouldn't tell us and they
wouldn't send us to a specialist,'' Minckler says.
</P>
<P>
   Local doctors miss signs
</P>
<P>
   Most of the asbestos disease cases were not reported to workers
by company doctors or diagnosed by other physicians in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this was because they didn't recognize it when they saw
it, or because they didn't want to anger Vanderbilt, is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   When deteriorating health and increasing difficulty breathing
forced the miners and millers to seek other opinions, usually at
their own expense at medical centers far outside St. Lawrence
County, physicians often quickly? diagnosed asbestosis, lung cancer
and other significant respiratory impairment.
</P>
<P>
   `Asbestos by any standard'
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerrold Abraham is director of environmental and
occupational pathology at Upstate Medical University in Syracuse
and has fought the battle over asbestos in talc for years.
</P>
<P>
   His cluttered office in the crowded, red-brick pathology
department is probably one of the world's largest storehouses of
knowledge on the health effects of the fine white powder.
</P>
<P>
   The two rooms house an eclectic accumulation of voluminous file
folders, overfilled cabinets, floor-to-ceiling shelves brimming
with medical charts, death certificates, studies on talc going back
to the 1920s, and hundreds of slides with the slivers of organs of
miners.
</P>
<P>
   It looks chaotic, but Abraham can find anything he's looking
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me that Vanderbilt can get away with not
calling the fibers what they are _ asbestos,'' Abraham says. ``What
should bother everyone is that Vanderbilt and the government say
they're not harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt's Kelse, who acknowledges that Abraham is ``a good
pathologist,'' says, ``Vanderbilt has never said that overexposure
to our talc or anyone else's talc is safe. It isn't. Talcosis is
different from asbestosis. But there's not much difference in the
X-rays.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham peers over the top of his glasses at a dozen
microphotographs spread atop a long table.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fibers from the mill at Vanderbilt mine,'' he says,
holding a photo up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is from the lung of a Vanderbilt miner,'' he says,
reaching for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're identical. Anyone can see that,'' Abraham says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My findings in reviewing the autopsy lung tissues of these
miners show disease attributed to asbestos by any competent medical
standard,'' he says. ``You get OSHA and the mine inspectors to say
why they don't believe it's asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt fights hard
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position,'' Kelse said, ``has always been just call the
stuff what it is. Whatever the health effect that's demonstrated as
a result of overexposure to these fibers, you regulate it and
control it to avoid those health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But regulation is precisely what Vanderbilt has been fighting
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1983 letter to the Department of Labor, lawyers for
Vanderbilt challenged OSHAs acceptance of NIOSHs determination that
asbestos in their mine was tremolite and was harming the health of
the miners.
</P>
<P>
   OSHAs decision ``portends disastrous economic consequences,''
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such talcs are going to be considered as asbestos both the
paint and ceramic tile industries will eliminate the use of talc''
and Vanderbilt will be forced out of business, the letter
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   A note to Vanderbilt employees on May 27, 1988 said: ``We are
certain that the aspect of labeling our product as asbestos as
required by the OSHA regulations would lead to a rapid loss of our
business. The public panic over asbestos is such that our operation
could not survive the stigma attached to such a label.''
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, then-company president Hugh Vanderbilt came
to the mine to rally the miners. A portion of his speech is vividly
etched in the minds of the miners who heard it.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Fuller was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a nicer dressed, more well-spoken man in my
life,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The mine captain gathered all of the day-shift miners and
millers in the carpenter shop.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt, attired in a dark suit and tie, stood before the
talc-smeared miners and told them not to worry about the debate in
OSHA on whether to define the fibers in the talc as asbestos
because everything was under control.
</P>
<P>
   The miners' depositions differed on how much money Vanderbilt
said he had spent _ hundreds of thousands or millions _ but all
agreed that Vanderbilt then told his workers, it would be okay,
that if all else failed, he had a senator in his back pocket, and
he made a show of patting his wallet. He said none of them had to
worry about their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Documents touted asbestos
</P>
<P>
   Neither Abraham's works, Wineburgh's X-rays nor the repeated
studies by NIOSH investigators has diminished Vanderbilt's
insistence that there is no asbestos in its talc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a single study that showed there was
asbestos in what we mine,'' Kelse said in an interview earlier this
month, ``nor has it very been shown that any miner has ever gotten
asbestos from our talc operations.''
</P>
<P>
   But going back years, Vanderbilt's own documents tell a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   In a January 2, 1975 letter from Vanderbilt to the Georgia
Pacific Corp. in Portland Oregon, the sales office wrote that ``in
assuming the business of the International Talc Company, we will
continue to market five fibrous asbestiform talcs,'' and then went
on the list them.
</P>
<P>
   The letter concluded by saying Vanderbilt would ``label bags
containing these products with an asbestos caution label as
follows: CAUTION _ PRODUCT CONTAINS ASBESTOS FIBERS. AVOID CREATING
DUST. BREATHING ASBESTOS DUST MAY CAUSE SERIOUS BODILY HARM.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time there was no one here at Vanderbilt that had good
mineralogical expertise or a full understanding of what OSHA's
regulations were all about,'' Kelse says. ``The people here didn't
understand that there are two varieties of tremolite and they
assumed that meant that the company would have to label some of its
talc products as asbestos-containing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they hired a mineralogist who said, `What are you doing?'
So the company stopped'' the labeling.
</P>
<P>
   International Talc, which mined from the same area that
Vanderbilt mines, sold at least seven different products called
Asbestine. Court documents show they contained as much as 50
percent asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents show that prior to the advent of OSHA in 1972
and the agency's concerns about asbestos as a risk to workers,
Vanderbilt capitalized on and exploited the facts that its talc
products contained asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Talc's long history
</P>
<P>
   Talc has been mined and milled in St. Lawrence County since
1878, when Henry Palmer opened America's first talc mine, on a farm
near Talcville. By the end of World War II the county was
honeycombed with deep shafts and pits, some mom-and-pop operations,
others producing thousands of tons of minerals. The miners dug not
only talc, but zinc, lead and other minerals. The one common fiber
throughout the mines was asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vanderbilt continues to say it isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 the Saranac Laboratory documented that asbestos,
anthophyllite, tremolite and four other fibers, were plentiful in
the mines.
</P>
<P>
   A book published by Vanderbilt in 1966 to celebrate its 50th
anniversary described the importance of the talc and asbestos
mixtures that it sold to different manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition of Frederick Kuehl, a mining engineer who worked
for International Talc for 27 years and ended up a general manager,
talked of the mine that Vanderbilt bought having various types of
asbestos and they were mined depending on what the customer needed.
</P>
<P>
   The tremolite portion went mostly into (ceramic) wall tiles and
paints, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted a fibrous type of ore you would pick the veins
that contained more anthophyllite, Kuehl said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Arthur Rohl, a mineralogist with Mount Sinai School of
Medicine and consultant to OSHA, testified that all the talc mines
of St. Lawrence County contain asbestiform material. His studies of
the Gouverneur Talc Mines found that the ore mined contained 60
percent tremolite, anthophyllite and a small amount of chrysotile.
</P>
<P>
   Effects continue today
</P>
<P>
   The impact that Vanderbilt, the asbestos industry, the American
Mining Congress and the National Stone Association had in the '70s
and '80s on OSHA's definition of asbestos continues to have
ramifications today, well beyond the sickened talc miners.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced last week that
it had found trace amounts of anthophyllite asbestos in crayons.
But the two labs who did the government's analysis also found much
larger quantities of what OSHA's laboratory in Salt Lake City
called ``transitional fibers.'' Scores of labs across the country,
testing crayons for local school boards and state governments,
found the same fibers and called them asbestos, as defined by the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Unless or until OSHA decides to revisit the asbestos debate, the
agency must follow the decisions the industry pressured it to make
in 1980s. Since OSHA's laboratory does the analysis for the Mine
Safety and Health Administration, this may be skewing the results
of sampling done by mine inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   With rare exceptions, OSHA's analysis of MSHA's testing reported
no asbestos detected in samples from talc mines in New York,
taconite mines in northern Michigan and Minnesota and vermiculite
mines in Virginia and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Davitt McAteer, MSHA's director, said in a January interview
that he and his technical staff are mystified at the apparent
contradictions between no asbestos being found and reports from
unions, physicians and miners themselves of significant
asbestos-related diseases among the work forces at these mines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conditions have improved somewhat at Vanderbilt.
Better ventilation has been installed, and some workers have newer
protective gear, although the dust is still a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   As the miners in New York's talc country continue to do what
their fathers and grandfathers did for more than a century, they
still must wonder if their stories will end differently.

 CHRON   Secrets Of Success By Michael Bauer  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The An family have made their reputation on crab,
probably the best in San Francisco, and on garlic noodles prepared
in a separate kitchen by Helene An or one of her children.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their empire started at Thanh Long and has expanded to
Crustacean in San Francisco and a wildly popular branch in Beverly
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, people don't know what they're missing when they
head straight to the crab. One of the best starters around is the
Lemongrass Beef Skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Thin slices of beef are marinated twice, first in pineapple
juice and then in soy sauce, shrimp paste, lemongrass and toasted
sesame seeds. This marinade also is brushed on during grilling,
which adds even more character to the meat.
</P>
<P>
   At home you can make a meal of these wonderful appetizers, or
serve them before a grilled main course.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1998, the family remodeled Thanh Long, adding more seats
and sprucing up the interior with restful murals, comfortable
chairs and banquettes. Cloths drape each table, and there's a wine
list that has some interesting selections to accompany the crab, as
well as other Asian-inspired dishes like the Lemongrass Beef
Skewers.

   &UR; Tenderizing with pineapple. &LR;  This juice has an enzyme that
works as a natural tenderizer for the beef.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A second marinade. &LR;  Garlic, onion, soy sauce and fish sauce
form the base for an additional marinade. It's also used to keep
the beef moist during grilling.

 &LR; LEMONGRASS BEEF SKEWERS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds beef sirloin tips, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup pineapple juice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup toasted sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon shrimp paste (see Notes)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced fresh lemongrass
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons powdered lemongrass root (see Notes)
</P>
<P>
   Bamboo skewers
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Toss the beef, pineapple juice and 2 tablespoons of the
vegetable oil in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least
30 minutes and up to 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over
medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until tender, about
5 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce, sesame seeds, fish sauce, shrimp
paste, minced lemongrass and lemongrass powder. Bring to a boil.
Add to the bowl with the beef and toss to combine. Cover and
refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a grill (medium heat).
</P>
<P>
   Remove the beef from the marinade. Reserve marinade. Thread one
slice of beef on each skewer. Grill the beef until cooked through,
brushing occasionally with the reserved marinade during the first
part of cooking, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Notes: &LR;  Shrimp paste is available in Asian markets. To make it
at home, mash cooked shrimp with a small amount of water. Powdered
lemongrass root also is available in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PER SERVING: &LR;   &LR; 185 calories, &LR;   &LR; 29 g protein, 0 carbohydrate, 7 &LR;

 CHRON   Wine Potpourri  
 Stupid Wine Gizmos  
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
 SAN FRANCISCO  _ Late-night television viewers know all about
stupid pet tricks. David Letterman, the gap-toothed perennial
freshman, parades out a string of goofy humans and innocent animals
that proceed to embarrass everyone except their owners.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since this is a full-service wine column, Potpourri presents
Stupid Wine Tools, which are not exactly tricks, but if you fork
out good money for one of these tchotchkes, you might feel like
you've been tricked.
</P>
<P>
   Wine gadgets have been around for a long time. Who can forget
the Wine Crystal, a piece of cut glass, suspended from a faux-gold
chain that had a small hook on one end. Supposedly, if you dropped
the crystal into a glass of wine, securing it to the rim of the
glass with the hook, the wine would miraculously improve. It was a
sort of high-tech wine silk-purse-from-a-sow's-ear Stupid Wine Tool
(SWT).
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was pyramid power. Place a case of young wine under
a pyramid and faster than you could say Tutankhamen, the wine was
transformed into an aged treasure. Trader Vic, who placed wine
under a pyramid in his San Francisco restaurant many years ago, was
not immune to the lure of SWTs.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes The Deja Vu Wine Bottle Restoration Kit. This
unbelievably wasteful product stretches the limits of SWT.
</P>
<P>
   In a box too large for the meager contents lie the materials
needed to ``restore'' 12 bottles ``of rare vintages for display.''
Included are corks (not wine corks), cheesy-looking labels,
capsules and a small bottle of Deja Vu Extract. After washing out
the bottles, you fill them with water and add a few drops of the
extract ``to imitate the color of red wine,'' then cork the bottle,
put a capsule in place and paste on the label. All of this for the
extraordinary price of $34.95!
</P>
<P>
   Or, what about Scotch Rocks? OK, this example of excess out of
Scotland is more accurately a Stupid Spirits Tool (SST), but I
couldn't pass it up.
</P>
<P>
   Scotch Rocks is a box of 10 trays, each containing four
compartments filled with water from the Chapeltown Glenlivet Spring
in the Scottish Highlands. The ready-to-freeze trays are sealed at
the source. Single malt whisky distillers claim that their whisky
tastes best with a splash of pure water from the source at the
distillery.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, this Scottish tchotchke will cost you $8 a box,
including the Douglas clan blue-and-green tartan wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   I've likely missed some real jewels, favorites of wine drinkers
everywhere. If you have a favorite Stupid Wine Tool, let me know by
e-mail at  &LR; food &LR; sfgate.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Corks and Screw Caps &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now that some of the dust has settled surrounding the expensive
Napa Valley red wine in a screw-cap bottle, I'd like to add my two
cents.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of background for those who haven't heard: Plump Jack
Winery, owned by Getty P &LR; e &LR; re&AMP;Fils and San Francisco Supervisor
Gavin Newsom, recently released 150 cases of its 1997 Reserve
Cabernet Sauvignon in bottles with a screw-cap closures.
</P>
<P>
   According to Newsom, the owners were tired of Plump Jack
customers complaining about corked wines. A corked wine is tainted
with a nasty-smelling chemical that is believed to come from the
cork-washing process or possibly occurs during bottling. Screw
caps, say the Plump Jack people, do not cause the corky problem.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, the chemical causing the corky problem has
been found in bottled water with screw tops, as well as in other
beverages, including orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the gutsy move by Plump Jack Winery is
admirable. You could even say, it's about time somebody did it. But
the initial announcement was made at the Napa Valley Wine Auction,
not the place you're likely to see wine in screw-cap bottles.
Subsequent announcements were splashed all over the local media,
including two earlier mentions in The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of a commitment is Plump Jack Winery making with
just 150 cases of wine?
</P>
<P>
   For years, the wine industry has been urging members to stop
closing bottles of inexpensive wine with a cork, a natural product
that eventually could become scarce. These wines normally are
consumed within a few days of purchase and not intended to age,
which is the sole reason for sealing a bottle of red wine with a
natural cork.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus needed to get the California wine industry moving
toward screw-cap closures for some wines is to have a large winery
like Gallo screwing caps on its inexpensive Zinfandel. Or to have
Kendall-Jackson putting screw tops on its popular Chardonnay. Or
Robert Mondavi can set the example with a screw-cap closure on his
Fum &LR; e &LR;  Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   A paltry 150 cases of a $135-red wine in a screw-cap bottle is a
publicity stunt, not an industry-leading statement.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beringer Cooperage &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the highest costs of making wine is in cooperage, the oak
barrels and tanks that are essential for aging most red and some
white wines. French oak barrels cost about $650 each; American oak
barrels, a relative bargain, cost about $400 each.
</P>
<P>
   To help control these prices while enhancing wine quality,
Beringer Wine Estates will develop an in-house cooperage to supply
a portion of the increasing need for wine barrels. Heading up the
new cooperage is Master Cooper Keith Roberts, formerly general
manager at Mendocino Cooperage.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who expects to start producing barrels in time for the
2001 harvest, believes that cooperage is a winemaker-driven
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope, ultimately,'' he says, ``is to tailor-make our
barrels to the winemaker's specification for a particular wine.''
</P>
<P>
   The new cooperage will produce barrels only for Beringer Estates
wineries: Beringer Vineyards, Chateau Souverain, Chateau St. Jean,
Meridian Vineyards, Stags' Leap Winery and St. Clement Vineyards.

 CHRON   Taster's Choice  
 By Robin Davis  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
 SAN FRANCISCO  _ Hot weather means cold drinks, so we had today's
panel taste seven different lemon-lime sodas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We limited the tasting to those specifically flavored with lemon
and lime, because many sodas described as citrus are predominantly
grapefruit. The sodas were tasted just slightly chilled so the
flavor could come through.
</P>
<P>
   One brand scored marginally higher than the others, but many
sodas scored well. However, one panelist noted that in general none
of the sodas had much lemon-lime flavor, but rather tasted more
like carbonated sugar water.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists voted  &UR; 7-Up &LR;  (2 liters, $1.59 at many supermarkets)
tops, though not all considered it their favorite. Two panelists
liked the fizziness and found the flavor refreshing. One thought it
would be particularly refreshing served over ice. But others
thought it was thin and watery, and another detected a strange
aftertaste. Four would buy it; one might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place was a tie between  &UR; Safeway &LR;  (2 liters, $1.29 at
Safeway) and  &UR; Sprite &LR;  (2 liters, $1.59 at many supermarkets). Those
who didn't care for Safeway seemed to like Sprite, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists thought the Safeway soda was nicely balanced, but
others found it too sweet. One described it as ``cloying'' and
another thought it lacked lemon-lime characteristics. Three would
buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Some tasters thought Sprite was too sweet and lacked citrus
flavor, while others found it well balanced. Three would buy it,
one might buy it and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Storm &LR;  (2 liters, $1.59 at many
supermarkets), made by Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. and a relative
newcomer to the market. Panelists found this soda sweeter than the
others, and some thought it wasn't fizzy enough. Two panelists also
noted a bitter aftertaste. Three might buy it and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were divided on  &UR; Shasta &LR;  (2 liters, $1.09 at Cala),
which placed fifth. Some liked the citrus flavor and good bubbles.
But others thought it tasted too chemical and processed. Three
would buy it and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Albertson's and Santa Cruz but they scored
too low to rate.

THE RACE TO DECODE HUMAN DNA ENDS; RIVALS AGREE TO COOPERATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of fitful negotiation that seemed to flame out in a
final angry exchange in February, the two sides racing to decode
the human DNA have contrived a last-minute truce. The first element
of the resurrected pact is likely to be a joint announcement next
week of the effective completion of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is too late for a pooling of DNA sequencing efforts,
the truce will include agreement for the competitors to publish
their genome findings in the same issue of a journal.
</P>
<P>
   It may also provide for a joint annotation of the genome, the
critical process of identifying the location and role of the genes
on the genome.
</P>
<P>
   Should the two sides cooperate in such an interpretation of
their data, a step that has at least been under discussion, the
truce could develop into a broader pact.
</P>
<P>
   The truce also implies a cessation of public criticisms between
the two parties, the Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md., and an
international consortium of academic centers supported largely by
the National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust, a London
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the institutes and the trust decline to discuss the
deal, the trust has said it will hold a news conference on the
human genome next Monday, and sources close to Celera say a joint
news conference will be held at the White House at which the two
sides will announce the progress of their respective efforts on
sequencing the genome.
</P>
<P>
   Sequencing means determining the order of the three billion
chemical units in the DNA of the human chromosomes. The genome
sequence is expected in time to revolutionize knowledge of the
human body and the practice of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The rival teams appear to have been driven together by a
calculus that cooperation outweighed the attractions of laying
claim to one of science's greatest prizes independently, especially
now that each has achieved successes that vindicate its own
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has established the validity of its high-risk genome
sequencing strategy, which the consortium's two senior scientists
had predicted would be ``woefully inadequate.'' The consortium has
generated a draft genome sequence that can be searched for human
genes, a principal objective of the human genome project.
</P>
<P>
   Celera was set to declare victory in achieving an effectively
complete genome assembly many months before the consortium could do
so. But Celera's business plan is to sell genome data and genomic
analysis tools to the community of university scientists from which
the consortium is drawn. Claiming victory might have alienated
potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium could have attacked Celera's genome as not being
the real thing _ it still has many small gaps and makes use of the
consortium's data _ while going on to declare its own independent
victory, though perhaps as late as 2003. The alternative, which it
seems now to have embraced, was to accept Celera's proposal of
declaring joint victory on Celera's timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celera doesn't want the NIH to lose,'' said Dr. Norton Zinder,
a microbiologist at Rockefeller University who is a member of
Celera's scientific board.
</P>
<P>
   Zinder and Dr. Richard Roberts, the research director of New
England BioLabs and chairman of Celera's scientific board, have for
many months pushed for the two sides to collaborate and, when that
idea foundered, at least to cooperate by coordinating publication.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they did not wish the institutes, the federal patron
of most biomedical research, to seem to have suffered defeat at
Celera's hands, and that the human genome was too precious a
scientific achievement to be marred by priority disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discovery and presentation of the human genome, one of the
most important attributes of man, should be a time of great joy and
happiness,'' Zinder said. ``For there to be all this vitriol and
hatred just doesn't seem right.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, a Nobel laureate, said that the announcement of
sequencing the human genome ``should be a great celebration of
humankind, not a race with a clear winner or loser.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zinder said talks began last October when Dr. Eric Lander of the
Whitehead Institute, one of the five largest centers in the
consortium, approached Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting took place on Dec. 29 that included Dr. J. Craig
Venter, president of Celera, and Dr. Francis Collins, head of the
NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting went badly and quickly bogged down in issues like
Celera's rights to distribute a combined set of human genome data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was there was no referee at the meeting who could
have taken these guys by the scruff of the neck,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks finally broke off in February in a fault-finding
exchange of letters. It took a long time for bridges to be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Zinder approached the institutes' new acting director, Dr. Ruth
Kirschstein, and tried to arrange a second meeting that would
exclude Collins, whom he felt had been in part responsible for the
December failure. In any case, Venter refused to meet again with
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   A second negotiation was arranged for March and at the last
minute both Venter and Collins attended. ``Ruth insisted Francis
had to come and wouldn't say a word; Francis swore he would be like
a monk at that meeting, but he spoke up,'' and that meeting broke
down too, Zinder said, adding that Venter ``put the same deal on
the table as is there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirschstein said through a spokeswoman, Anne Thomas, that she
had no recollection of promising Dr. Collins's silence and that the
deal now being offered by Celera was not what was on the table
then.
</P>
<P>
   Collins declined through his press secretary, Cathy Yarbrough,
to comment on the negotiations with Celera. But he has always
affirmed the policy of completely free and open access to the human
genome. Because Celera has demanded protection against its data
being resold by its commercial rivals, data access policy has been
a regular stumbling block to agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Following a cooling-off period after the failed March meeting,
talks were held between Venter, Collins and Dr. Ari Patrinos,
director of the Energy Department's part of the human genome
project. From the post-March talks, an agreement eventually
emerged.

 CHRON   The Working Cook

 Bagged Shredded Vegetables Can Save a Cook's Bacon 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; SAN FRANCISCO &LR;  _ Because one can only eat so many chicken
breasts in a lifetime, I'm always looking for new varieties of
fast-cooking protein.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked tofu was new territory for me, but now I'm a convert _
and so are many of my colleagues on the Food staff. It has a
pleasant texture &QL; 
similar to the Indian cheese &LR;   &LR; paneer, and is delicious when paired
with peanuts and eggs in the Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe, Fried Rice with
Spicy Tofu &AMP; Vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Fried rice is a great way to use up leftovers from last night's
takeout, but you don't need that excuse to make it. You can prepare
a batch of rice the night before and then chill it. Don't use
freshly cooked, warm rice, which will get mushy. Fluff the rice
with a fork before refrigerating it to prevent it from hardening
into food sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this recipe so quick is using prepared vegetables,
which seem to be in every market these days.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Waters would never approve, but these ready-to-use
vegetables certainly go in that wok nice and easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Roast Halibut with Potato Coins &AMP; Red Pepper Coulis also
calls for prepared vegetables _ in this case, jarred roasted red
bell peppers, which are transformed into a coulis to dab on the
fish.
</P>
<P>
   When you sear the fish, use high heat to get a crispy, golden
crust, which will contrast well with the piquant sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bean Chili with Pork &AMP; Tomatillos is a great
summertime chili with fresh corn and light, acidic flavors from
green chiles and tomatillos. The spice level is medium-hot, but
garnished with sour cream, it barely raises a sweat. Add more
serranos if you prefer more heat.

   FRIED RICE WITH SPICY TOFU &AMP; VEGETABLES
</P>
<P>
   Smoked tofu is available at health-food stores and in the
health-food section of many supermarkets. Wildwood brand makes a
``Mild Szechuan'' version that is great in this recipe. Preshredded
cabbage and carrots are available in the produce section of many
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound sugar snap peas
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Combine the soy sauce and chile oil in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the eggs in a medium bowl; season lightly with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Assemble all the ingredients near the stove. Heat 1 tablespoon
of the oil in a wok or large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the eggs and quickly scramble, breaking them into bite-size
pieces. Remove from the pan and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the wok. Place over high
heat. When sizzling, add the garlic; cook and stir about 30
seconds. Stir in the snap peas, carrots and cabbage. Add the water
and stir-fry until the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the rice and stir-fry until incorporated, about 1 minute.
Drizzle in the soy sauce mixture and stir into the rice.
</P>
<P>
   Add the egg, tofu and green onions. Stir-fry until the rice is
completely heated through. Stir in the peanuts.

   BLACK BEAN CHILI WITH PORK &AMP; TOMATILLOS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried black beans
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds fresh tomatillos, husked
</P>
<P>
   3 red onions
</P>
<P>
   Two 7-ounce cans green chiles
</P>
<P>
   5 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   3 serrano chiles
</P>
<P>
   21/2 pounds boneless pork butt
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 teaspoons salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 quart chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 cups water
</P>
<P>
   3 ears yellow corn
</P>
<P>
   Sour cream, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400.
</P>
<P>
   Soak the beans overnight in a large pot of water, or do a quick
soak: Place beans in a large pot and cover with twice as much
water. Bring to a boil, then immediately cover and take off the
heat. Let sit for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, place the tomatillos in a lightly oiled roasting pan.
Roast until soft, 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chop the onions and green chiles into large dice. Mince the
garlic and serranos. If you don't want too much heat, seed the
chiles.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the pork into 1-inch cubes. Season to taste with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, then add enough of the
remaining oil to cover the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot,
add the meat (work in batches) and brown well on all sides. Remove
meat from the pan with a slotted spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Drain all but 1 tablespoon oil from the pan. Add the onions and
cook, scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Saute
for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Add the garlic and serranos; saute for a few minutes. Add the
canned chiles and the tomatillos, crushing the tomatillos into
chunks with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Add the meat and beans to the pot, then add the broth and 3 cups
water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a steady simmer and cook for
45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the extra cup of water as
needed to allow beans enough liquid to simmer freely.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off corn kernels with a sharp knife. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   After 45 minutes, check the beans _ they should still be
somewhat firm. Add 2 teaspoons salt, then simmer until the beans
are tender, 15 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the beans are tender, add the corn kernels. Taste for
seasoning. Serve garnished with sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

 CHRON   Cook's Books  
 By Andy Lax  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
 SAN FRANCISCO  _ When I was 5 years old, my parents took me on
vacation to Niagara Falls. For breakfast one morning, we went to a
diner that served only desserts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not one to question my parents, I studied the display cases full
of layer cakes, custards and pies before settling on a wedge of
coconut cream pie. This was the delicacy of Gilligan's Island and I
figured if it was good enough for the castaways, it was good enough
for me. I ate my breakfast in ecstasy. Little did I know I was
participating in a great American tradition _ pie for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diner Desserts,'' by Tish Boyle is a book about such
remembrances. While many cookbooks celebrate exotically flavored
creme brulees and towering souffles, ``Diner Desserts'' cuts
through all confectionery pretension and takes us back to our
childhood innocence. These are recipes that remind us of times when
the important decisions were who you would take to the junior prom
and whether you'd have the cherry pie or a hot fudge sundae.
</P>
<P>
   With a lifetime of diner eating and a diploma from Ecole de
Cuisine La Varenne in Paris, Boyle knows her stuff. After
``learning some of life's most important lessons in diners,'' she
says, she is well equipped not only to provide quality recipes but
to share the deep-rooted emotions and memories embodied by these
sweets.
</P>
<P>
   But to ensure that these memories don't end up in frustration
over tough pie crust and runny pudding, Boyle offers tips and clear
instructions. Armed with tidbits of diner history and personal
reminiscing, you can proceed with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The book is well organized and as sleek as the chrome that
glints from the black-and-white photographs of America's diners. It
begins with chapters on selecting the correct ingredients and the
proper equipment and then moves to the goods. The recipes range
from pies to cakes, puddings and doughnuts, and end with favorite
recipes from the soda fountain. While a recipe for root beer floats
may seem unnecessary, this one comes with words of wisdom on
selecting the right root beer.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I was just 5, I have never forgotten my first taste
of coconut cream pie, and Boyle's lives up to my expectations. The
pie crust tended to stick to the foil that weighted it during
baking but it still turned out tender and flaky. The custard is
updated with coconut milk, and is topped with swirls of barely
sweetened cream.
</P>
<P>
   Humble as it is, Chocolate Malt Pudding is a conversation topic.
Those who weren't pudding fans as kids may not be captivated, but
those who were will be transported back to family dinners in
Michigan and cafeteria lunches in Kansas. Though the chocolate
flavor is mild, the pudding is rich and the malt notes are warming.
</P>
<P>
   Buttermilk Doughnuts are a real hit. Dressed up with a simple
dredge of powdered sugar, they are exactly what doughnuts should
be. Deep-frying imparts a thin crust that shelters a dense interior
spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon meringue pie and chocolate layer cake may never make the
menu in temples of  &LR; haute cuisine &LR;  but they have already earned
their place as symbols of Americana. These are the recipes on which
we grew up, over which life's lessons were learned and memories
made. In ``Diner Desserts,'' Tish Boyle opens up an American
institution and provides us a way to bring the diner back home.

   DINER-STYLE POWDERED BUTTERMILK DOUGHNUTS
</P>
<P>
   From Diner Desserts, by Tish Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   31/2 cups cake flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   1 cup powdered sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   Instructions: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking
powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add the sugar and
stir the dry ingredients with a whisk until combined.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, melted butter,
egg and vanilla until blended. Make a well in the center of the
flour mixture and pour the buttermilk mixture into it. Using a
rubber spatula, stir until the mixture forms a soft, moist dough.
</P>
<P>
   Dust a work surface with flour. Scrape the dough onto the work
surface and lightly sprinkle the top of the dough with flour.
Gather the dough into a ball and knead it gently 5 or 6 times, or
until smooth. Roll or pat the dough into a round roughly 10 inches
in diameter and 1/2 inch thick. Transfer the round to a baking
sheet, cover it with plastic wrap, and place it in the freezer for
15 minutes, or until firm.
</P>
<P>
   Using a 3-inch doughnut cutter (or a 3-inch round biscuit cutter
and a 3/4-inch cutter or pastry tip for the hole), cut out 7
doughnuts and holes from the dough. Gather the scraps together,
reroll 1/2 inch thick, and cut out 3 more doughnuts and as many
holes as possible. Place the doughnuts and holes on a baking sheet
or 2 plates, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while heating
the oil for frying.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the oil into a deep-fat fryer or large straight-sided
saucepan to a depth of 2 to 3 inches. Heat the oil to 370. Line a
baking sheet with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Fry the doughnuts and holes in small batches, turning once, for
2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Using a slotted spoon,
transfer to the paper towels to drain, then place on a wire rack to
cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   When the doughnuts and holes are completely cool, place the
powdered sugar in a medium bowl. Generously dredge the doughnuts
and holes in the sugar, shaking off the excess. Serve the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 doughnuts and about 16 doughnut holes.

 CHRON   At the Source  
 By Karol Saekel  
 c. 2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Sierra Foothills Cherries  
 SONORA, Calif.  _ In the Sierra Foothills, life is a bowl of
cherries for just a short time, but now is that time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last weekend saw the first cherry pickers head for the orchards
at Sierra Glen Ranch in Sonora. That's several weeks later than the
beginning of cherry season in the Central Valley, but at 3,500-foot
elevation, the seasons get condensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still had a frost on May 9 this year,'' says Gaye Wolf,
who, with her husband, Don, owns the old ranch, which began as a
1861 stage coach stop on the Tuolumne County road linking Columbia
and Twain Harte.
</P>
<P>
   When the Wolfs came to Sierra Glen 15 years ago, the ranch's
orchards were filled with apple trees, the area's historic main
crop. But the Wolfs diversified, planting Christmas trees, berries,
pears and some stone fruit, including cherries _ sweet Bings and
Rainiers and tart Montmorencys. Now they have 30 acres of cherries
under cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfs originally intended the sour cherry trees to be
pollinators for the others. But they soon found there was a market
for the sour fruit itself, primarily in restaurant kitchens, but
also at Berkeley Bowl and Monterey Foods, two Berkeley markets
favored by produce connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bings and Rainiers are best eaten out of hand, the
Montmorencys need to be cooked. In Europe, they are favored in cold
summer fruit soups, in preserves and, lightly stewed, as a garnish
to seared foie gras. In America, they star in old-fashioned pies.
</P>
<P>
   Gaye Wolf bakes a lot of cherry pies in the roughly three weeks
the Montmorencys are around, mostly for the small shop on the
ranch. She offers both open, single-crust pies and _ her favorite _
a version with a sweet crumb topping made with flour, butter, sugar
and oatmeal. The oatmeal, she says, adds a pleasantly nutty flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of modern preferences, the ranch baker uses vegetable
shortening for her pie crusts _ ``no animal fat, unless somebody
special orders a pie made with butter'' _ and pastry flour, which
she says makes for superior texture. She sells her pies both whole
and by the slice.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can also purchase stone fruit and berries _ either
heading into the orchards to pick it themselves or already picked
for them. In addition, the little shop sells jams and jellies,
muffins, turnovers and cookies and, come fall, apple dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the sweet eating cherries are available. The sour
Montmorencys are usually about three weeks behind, but Don Wolf is
reluctant to commit to an exact date, except to hope that they'll
be ready by the July Fourth holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's heat wave quickened the ripening, but a cold spell
could slow things down. Sour cherries, it seems, are really sweet
on sunshine.

ARUM TALKS OF DE LA HOYA-MOSLEY REMATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although Oscar De La Hoya hinted at retirement
following his loss to ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley on Saturday, it
appears he has decided to continue his career.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, said in a story in Wednesday's
Las Vegas Review-Journal that De La Hoya will fight a rematch with
Mosley, the new World Boxing Council welterweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   A rematch clause in the contracts for Saturday's fight said both
fighters would be guaranteed $10.1 million for a rematch, which
will take place in Las Vegas in November or February.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following Saturday's bout, De La Hoya gave Mosley
credit for the victory. However, after spending a good hour in his
dressing room, De La Hoya came out to a post-fight news conference
complaining about the decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt he no longer could get a fair decision because
of the politics in boxing. He also said he thought he won by one
point.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, I spoke with at least 35 veteran boxing writers
after the fight. Only one had De La Hoya winning, by one point.
Another had it a draw. The rest had Mosley winning by at least two
points, many of them by three, four and even five points.
</P>
<P>
   This reporter had Mosley by four points, 116-112.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely not retiring,'' Arum said. ``It was a
tremendous shock to him because he didn't expect to lose, and it
was a tremendous disappointment, but he's going to fight again.''
</P>
<P>
   The rematch could take place at the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   Arum also addressed an issue that long has been debated - should
Robert Alcazar remain in De La Hoya's corner as lead trainer? De La
Hoya previously has brought in well-known trainers Jesus Rivero,
Emanuel Steward and Gil Clancy to ``assist'' Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the boxing world, Alcazar gets little respect. He is
considered a good trainer for amateur boxers, but lacking enough
skills to guide a world-class prize fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Alcazar) was back, the outcome would be the same,''
Arum said. ``You saw one guy (Mosley) adjust midway through the
fight, and you saw the other guy doing the same thing round after
round after round.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet)It was March 21, 1963, one of the biggest, and
ultimately saddest, nights in L.A. boxing history. Three world
championship fights were on tap, and they would be contested at
beautiful Dodger Stadium, still in its sparkling infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimino ``Sugar'' Ramos of Cuba squared off with Davey Moore of
Kentucky in the main event for the world featherweight belt before
26,142. In the 11th round, Ramos knocked down Moore, who hit his
head on the bottom rope. The fight was stopped by referee George
Latka, Ramos earning the knockout victory and taking Moore's belt.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the sorrow was about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been with Davey (Moore) in training camp,'' said John
Hall, former columnist for the Los Angeles Times and Orange County
Register. ``When the fight was over, he leaned through the ropes
and said, ``It wasn't my night.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we were starting to talk to him in the dressing room and
he just got drowsy, put his head down and went to sleep. And he
never woke up. Later at the hospital, we were all shocked when the
doctor told us he had only a 50-50 chance to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore died two days later from a brain injury suffered when his
head hit the rope, which, at that time was not required to have a
half inch of padding surrounding what is nothing more than a steel
cable, as is required today.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time boxing was held at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Furthering the agony of the evening, Hank Weaver, a popular
television sportscaster, was killed in an automobile accident
leaving Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet)An interesting doubleheader will take place Saturday on
Showtime. Mike Tyson will take on Lou Savarese in a 10-round
heavyweight bout. And Zab Judah will make the first defense of his
International Boxing Federation junior welterweight belt against
Junior Witter.
</P>
<P>
   The telecast, which will be on taped delay, will begin at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet)Locals Antonio De Santiago of Baldwin Park and Michael
Anchondo of La Puente will fight in separate undercard bouts
tonight at the Pond of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   De Santiago (9-2) will take on Nobohito Honmo (14-4) of Japan in
a 6-round junior lightweight bout. Anchondo (1-0) will square off
with Victor Guerrero (2-1) of Gilroy in a four-round featherweight
bout.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Gonzalez (22-0, 13 KOs), of Huntington Beach and the La
Habra Boxing Club, will fight Jacobo Garcia (12-21, 5 KOs) for the
Mexican light heavyweight championship in the main event.

 AWAITING FAD DIET FACTS 
 &HT;     DON'T EXPECT RESULTS FROM USDA-UC DAVIS STUDY ANY TIME SOON  
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO &LR;  _ Consumers waiting for the federal government to
referee the battle of the fad diets shouldn't stop counting their
calories anytime soon.
<P>
   In a widely reported proclamation last month, Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said the government, working with
researchers at the University of California at Davis, had embarked
on a study of popular diets. But the researchers say they have yet
to get the approval or the funding they need to begin.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they do get the $3 million they are requesting,
Davis researchers say it will be as long as seven years before
results are released. By that time, the nation will have likely
moved past its fascination with today's high-fat, low-carbohydrate
fad diets.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman announced plans for the definitive study May 30 at a
Department of Agriculture national nutrition summit in Washington,
D.C. The story landed on the front pages of major newspapers,
including The Chronicle, and was soon fodder for commentators and
editorialists across the country.
</P>
<P>
   No one was more surprised than Christopher Gardner, assistant
professor in UC Davis' School of Medicine and the lead researcher
of the proposed study.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed study, which would measure the health of 240
dieters over five years, had only a week earlier been forwarded the
USDA for approval. And that was after Davis officials had denied it
funding, Gardner says. It would have been impossible for the USDA
to have reviewed the study by the time Glickman announced it.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Glickman got ``carried away,'' says one staffer who
works for USDA deputy undersecretary Eileen Kennedy, whose office
in charge of research for the agency. Media reports didn't help.
Some portrayed the study as a battle between only two diets or said
implied the study was already underway.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of how a mere proposal became a national news story
began in February, when Glickman presided over something called
``The Great Nutrition Debate'' on CNN. Cardiologist Robert Atkins,
who promotes a diet that allows unlimited fat and meat but
restricts carbohydrates, went head to head with internist Dean
Ornish, who is pushing an extreme low-fat diet, and Barry Sears,
whose complex diet is called The Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in the interest sparked by the debate, Glickman was
shopping around for some research into fad diets. Janet King, the
director of the USDA's Northern California nutrition research
center which had recently moved to the Davis campus, handed a
one-page summary of the proposed study to Glickman's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was only a proposal, Glickman told the nation the
study was about to be launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to do something about being overweight and from
what I've seen, they're willing to try anything,`` Glickman told
reporters at the time. ``Why these weight-loss diets remain so
popular remains a source of extreme curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Once word got out, reporters called the campus, people
volunteered to be in the study and colleagues asked Gardner what
was going on.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, nothing was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people in editorials saying the study we're doing is
wrong and we haven't even done anything yet,'' he said. ``It just
really snowballed after the announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The study proposes a look at four diets, including the USDA food
pyramid. Five researchers, including three Davis-based USDA
scientists, will work intensely with dieters, who will be divided
into groups of 60 to test best-selling diet books and USDA
guidelines. Then, the dieters will be sent off to see how well they
do on their own. In addition to any weight loss, researchers will
study the long-term effects of the diets on things like insulin
levels, bone loss and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to learn what changes happen to hormones like insulin
in order to determine in the long run how effective these diets
will be,'' says Peter Havel, a Davis nutrition professor who is
part of the research team. ``We know most people can lose weight
but we've never looked at how the diets effect physiology and how
people can avoid gaining (weight) back.''
</P>
<P>
   But the study might never happen. The official word from the
USDA earlier this week is that no money has been approved.
Information on existing diet research is being gathered and will be
presented in the fall. The agriculture department will then
consider whether the Davis study _ or a study by some other team of
researchers _ should be funded. Money for the study to settle the
great diet debate likely won't be in place until the 2002 budget,
according to a spokesman for the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should have been funded a long time ago and I think it
ultimately will be,'' says Judith Stearn, Davis professor of
nutrition and internal medicine and one of the researchers poised
to study the diets. ``It isn't research on the human genome, but
it's information people need to help everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   There is good news. She and other members of the team think the
premature publicity might help the study's chances for funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how it happened, but as they say any publicity is
good as long as they spell your name right.''

 &HT;    Arms out of joint
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Until it hit home during spring training 1999, Kerry
Ligtenberg was unaware of the procedure, much less how prevalent it
has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know what `Tommy John surgery' was till it
happened to me,'' the Braves reliever said. ``I'd see guys with big
scars on their elbows and say, `Whoa, that must be bad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   All Ligtenberg needs to do these days is look around the
clubhouse, or almost anywhere in the Braves organization. Big scars
abound, both big-league and minor-league scars. They are evidence
of an increasing number of Braves pitchers who have undergone Tommy
John surgery, reconstruction to repair the ulnar collateral
ligament in the elbow. Forget tennis elbow. Pitcher's elbow is
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 pitchers in Atlanta's major-league camp last spring,
nine have had or will have Tommy John surgery, named for the former
pitcher who underwent the procedure first, in 1974. The four
highest-profile Braves patients are Ligtenberg, John Smoltz, Odalis
Perez and now Rudy Seanez, the reliever who will undergo surgery
June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 71 pitchers in the Braves minor-league spring training
camp, 11 have had or will have the procedure. That's 20 Braves
pitchers out of 102. The numbers are alarming and somewhat baffling
to the Braves, but they are not unique to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   INJURY'S INCREASE PUZZLING
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wrong, but I don't have an answer,'' said
Dick Balderson, the Braves director of player personnel. ``I don't
think there's a clear-cut answer. It's not just the Braves but
major league baseball that's being overwhelmed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what puzzles me,'' Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone
said. ``Who in that group has accumulated any (significant) innings
(pitched)? One. John. That's what befuddles me. You can explain
Smoltzie a little bit, the wear and tear over the years. But you
can't when somebody hasn't accumulated a significant amount of
innings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, this year we've had more high-profile people that
have needed reconstruction and raised people's eyebrows to say,
'Geez, what's happening?''' the Braves' team orthopedist, Dr. Joe
Chandler, said. ``But I think it's happening everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. James Andrews, the noted Birmingham orthopedic
surgeon who has performed the surgery on nearly all of the Braves
pitchers, at least two high school pitchers picked in the recent
free-agent draft had the surgery. One had it on draft day and awoke
to discover which team had drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   In the College World Series, at least three pitchers on one team
had undergone Tommy John earlier in their careers. Toronto's David
Wells, the winningest pitcher in the AL also has had the surgery _
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``A MULTI-FACTORAL PHENOMENON''
</P>
<P>
   Such success stories give encouragement to pitchers. So does a
somewhat false sense of security about the recuperative powers of
one of baseball's most serious surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest thing about this is (that) people have this
concept that you tear it, you fix it, it's better than ever. A
bionic elbow,'' Chandler said. ``And that's just not true. Nothing
is better than God's creation.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chandler and the Braves, what's of greater and more
immediate concern is, why 2K? Chandler, for one, has ``a whole
bunch of theories'' for what he calls ``a multi-factoral
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One is pure bad luck,'' he said, ``the wrong (arm) angle at
the wrong time.'' Chandler and Andrews agree that it runs in
cycles. Some years, a number of injuries require Tommy John
surgery; other years, none does.
</P>
<P>
   Genetics. ``Genetically, everybody's made differently,''
Chandler said. ``It's definitely a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics. ``Poor mechanics can pinch the elbow in throwing a
ball,'' Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   Improved detection and diagnosis. ``One reason we think there's
an epidemic (in torn elbow ligaments and surgery) is we're able to
detect and diagnose it more,'' said Chandler, citing improved
magnetic resonance imaging and diagnostic and surgical techniques.
``We're more attuned to it, aware of it.'' Doctors and baseball
trainers and management also are more knowledgeable about the
rehabilitation process needed after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Little League Learning Curve. Chandler, Andrews and their
colleagues have found that in many young pitchers requiring the
surgery the elbow damage initially happened when pitchers started
throwing breaking balls at age 12. Or even younger.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Smoltz watched a Little League all-star game in which
one pitcher had a remarkably full repertoire. ``He was throwing a
fastball, knuckleball, curve, something of a screwball,'' Smoltz
said. The pitcher was 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the kid,'' Smoltz said. ``I would change
everything I did as a kid. I would try to get an amendment that no
kid from the age of 12 down, at least, could throw anything but a
fastball and a change. From 10-12, I was snapping curveballs. I had
a nasty curve. Luckily, I threw them correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   INJURIES ACCUMULATE OVER TIME
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz also recalls playing high school doubleheaders every
Tuesday and Friday in Lansing, Mich. He would pitch every opener,
then play shortstop in the second game. But Smoltz _ who had
arthroscopic elbow surgery in 1994 and 1998 before tearing his
medial collateral ligament this spring _ knows that his injury was
more an accumulation of pitching 2,414 1/3 big-league innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people will tell you, with this injury, it (happens) on a
fastball,'' he said. ``But it's an accumulation of torques and
stress on your arm.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an accumulation, Chandler says, that starts far too early
and cries out for better prevention at a very early age. ``I think
there's micro-damage that occurs through the years, from throwing
breaking balls when you're too young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said many Little Leaguers not only throw curveballs too
early but incorrectly _ not overhead but with a more precarious
sidearm motion that simulates a slider. ``Slider mechanics put the
most stress on the elbow,'' he said. ``There's more of a snap, a
higher velocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors contribute to Tommy John. Chandler cites the use
of aluminum bats in high school and college; the bats force more
pitchers to throw more breaking balls at a younger age. And young
pitchers overdo weight training. ``Baseball is a flexibility
sport,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz realizes the big-league big-money allure, too. ``Part of
it now is what we make and what we do,'' he said. ``The emphasis is
so much stronger now at a younger age that it's just a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GROW
</P>
<P>
   ``On the big-league level,'' Mazzone said, ``I can see where a
young pitcher might have a tendency to overthrow, to stay in the
big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are more and more _ and younger _ minor-leaguers
who've required Tommy John surgery. Chandler says that the majority
of those injuries in the organization are partial tears of the
ligament. ``On top of old wear and tear,'' he said. ``The acute,
new injury was probably the one straw that broke the camel's
back.''
</P>
<P>
   With improved diagnostic, surgical and rehabilitative
techniques, doctors are less hesitant to prescribe surgery, and
pitchers are more likely to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more concerned last year, about the stress fracture I
had in my elbow,'' said Seanez, who missed the last six weeks of
last season. ``I don't feel anywhere near as bad about my ligament
as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seanez knows that he will have to have patience during a
rehabilitation that takes anywhere from 12 to 18 months. He knows
it from several talks with Ligtenberg and Smoltz. What the Braves
don't know, however, is why they have been hit by a glut of Tommy
John surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not that our organization is encouraging any
pitch that's detrimental to the arm,'' Chandler said. ``On the
contrary, from the very beginning, we try to minimize stress on the
arm.''

`TROUBLE-MAKING' DOCTOR FIRED AFTER TRYING TO HELP MINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. George Wineburgh stood up for sick and dying New York miners
whose suffering was being ignored by most of the medical community.
For his efforts he was fired from his job and ostracized by doctors
in two counties.
</P>
<P>
   Wineburgh practiced at New York City's largest hospital for 16
years before moving, with new wife and four Labrador retrievers, up
to the peaceful North Country in March 1982. He was eager to start
his new job as the radiologist at Ogdensburg's Barton Hepburn
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was going to be a piece of cake, you know, no
stress, a handful of cases, a great change from the big city. Boy
was I wrong,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long before the skills Wineburgh gained becoming
a board-certified radiologist started generating questions within
the pile of X-rays waiting on his desk each morning. The films were
from the patients examined overnight, usually for assorted trauma,
aches and pains and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cracked ribs, bruised kidneys and clogged arteries,
Wineburgh was finding something unexpected: the distinctive shadow
of a lung damaged by asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept seeing four, five, six cases every single week, week
after week, classic asbestosis,'' Wineburgh says.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned the other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the clinicians that I asked said, `Ah, they're just
smokers. Yeah, they're miners, but they're all smokers. That's the
reason, so we don't mess with them,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Wineburgh was sure that what he was seeing was asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's distinctive. If you know what you're looking for there's
no way to confuse it with something else,'' he says.``Asbestosis is
one of 14 (X-ray) findings that is unique, that can be one thing
and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of cases of asbestos he was finding grew _ first 8,
then 19, then 37. By the end of three months he had X-rays from 50
patients in which he diagnosed asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   Other doctors still insisted it was emphysema _ chronic
obstructive lung disease or COPD _ from smoking, and claimed they
had the pulmonary function tests _ the amount of air a lung can
hold _ to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the numbers were all wrong, completely opposite of what
they should have been for COPD,'' Wineburgh explains. ``Emphysema
is called an obstructive lung disease and the lungs are
over-expanded. With asbestosis the lungs are small - restrictive
lung disease - completely opposite numbers. There should be no
confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   He was uncomfortable about what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it. It smelled. Nobody wanted to stand up for
the miners, nobody was being clinically objective. It was like they
were under the thumb of the mining company,'' the 55-year-old
specialist recalls.
</P>
<P>
   As the numbers increased, Wineburgh's frustration grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``These miners were desperate. They weren't getting any better
and they weren't getting any answers. Some were dying,'' he says.
``Doctors were telling them to stop smoking, but some of them never
smoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Wineburgh asked the unions for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were supposed to stick up for the miners. But they said
they had been told that if they raised a stink, demanded that the
safety regulations be followed, management said they would close
down the mines,'' Wineburgh says. ``So they too did nothing. Just
breathe in, breathe out, and keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Wineburgh sent the 50 cases to the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these guys are out of the mines. Asbestosis is a
reportable disease. You guys have got the authority,'' he told
them. ``So here you are.''
</P>
<P>
   The state shipped the X-rays to the Selikoff Institute for
Occupational Medicine in New York City. There, a specialist
confirmed that Wineburgh was right in almost all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Then the health department contracted with Wineburgh to lead the
examination of all the X-rays taken between April 1982 and March
1983 at six hospitals in a two-county area of people 40 years old
and older.
</P>
<P>
   About 22,000 films of 9,442 patients were examined. Wineburgh
and his team found chest abnormalities in 500 patients. Those
X-rays were evaluated by what the health department called ``an
internationally recognized'' expert.
</P>
<P>
   She found that 71 percent of the X-rays of Wineburgh's 500
``were indeed consistent with chest abnormalities indicative of
asbestos exposure,'' says Dr. Edward Fitzgerald, who co-authored
the state's report and is assistant director of the bureau of
environmental and occupational epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   Lengthy interviews were conducted to pin down the work history.
The largest number of the patients who had diseased lungs worked in
talc mining or milling. The next highest group afflicted were
workers from the paper mills, which used large amounts of talc, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas DiCerbo, the associate director of the New York's
Division of Occupational Health, said the state ``jumped in
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   To address concerns that asbestosis was being undiagnosed or
misdiagnosed, he says, his department sent physicians to the north
country to meet with the medical societies and local physicians to
try to do some education, ``to alert them to what they should be
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners of the mine agreed to talk to us and we explained
our concerns,'' DiCerbo said, but he declined to discuss whether
his department thought there was asbestos in the mine's talc.
</P>
<P>
   For his efforts, Wineburgh lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contract with the hospital was canceled three days before
it was to be renewed,'' he says. ``Most of the medical community
thought I was a trouble-making traitor. Working with the Health
Department of New York State to try to get help for hundreds of
miners made me a traitor to the physicians of two counties.''
</P>
<P>
   Wineburgh is not alone in being ostracized for trying to help
miners exposed to asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Radiologists in Libby, Mont., who first raised the alarm that
vermiculite miners at a now-closed W.R. Grace and Co. mine had
asbestosis, left town soon after. Another specialist in Northern
Minnesota told the state about finding asbestosis and other
respiratory disease in taconite miners in the Iron Range. He soon
moved his practice to another state.

course. That's how medicine should be practiced.''

   SEOUL _ When Christopher McCarthy, a 22-year-old American
soldier, escaped from U.S. military custody after he was accused of
murdering a South Korean bar hostess for refusing sex with him, it
fed the belief among South Koreans that Americans believe they're
above the law.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was apprehended eight hours later and was sentenced by
a South Korean court this month to eight years in prison. However,
that incident was the latest in a series of events, including the
surprisingly successful summit between North and South Korea, that
has stoked calls for less interference from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a very strong anti-American sentiment
right now, but I think it's growing,'' said Jung-Hoon Lee,
professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.
``The summit contributed to it because of its focus on independence
and autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunification of the two Koreas is seen by some South Koreans as
an issue that can be resolved by Koreans only.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kim Jong Il's new look ... (showing) he can be friendly,
smile, be jovial, a very confident leader, (some people) feel, we
can do some business with this guy and Americans only serve as a
possible roadblock,'' said Lee. ``So that sort of feeds on
anti-American sentiment that was already there. There's a sense
that we should do this alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have always been factions in Korea _ especially
among the left-wing and the younger generations - who believe U.S.
troops should go home.
</P>
<P>
   Massive student demonstrations in the 1970s and '80s are
characterized as anti-American but were more directed at the
military dictators who ruled South Korea, said Lee. But because of
the military alliance between the two countries, the United States
was seen as tolerating or approving of the dictatorships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many students still feel Korea is being used by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States thinks of Korea as their colony,'' said Soo
Jin Park, a 25-year-old student at Yonsei University. ``Not on
paper, but by the way they act, Koreans get that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the 37,000 American troops in Korea should leave
``because we're not at war and I see no reason for them to stay in
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   While such sentiments are common on university campuses,
analysts agree they do not represent the mainstream view in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a growing belief _ even among people who would
identify themselves as pro-American and have no desire to see
American troops withdraw _ that Washington needs to treat Korea as
more of an equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, I must say Korea is controlled by the United
States in many ways,'' said Rev. Young Joon Cho, pastor of Chung
Dong First Methodist Church in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Pagoda Park in downtown Seoul is filled with elderly men playing
chess, practicing calligraphy or just passing the time. In one
corner, a retired sociology teacher who would give his name only as
Mr. Kim is holding court with an audience of at least a couple
dozen, lecturing on U.S.-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States shouldn't look down at Korea,'' he said.
``We're not the Korea of 50 years ago. They should respect Korea as
a full sovereign country and let us solve our own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Foreign Ministry believes it is ready for an adjustment
in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, our relationship has been one of dependence on
U.S. aid,'' said Sung-Hwan Kim, deputy director of the Ministry's
North American bureau. ``Now I feel we're equipped with the
requirements (for a more equal partnership).''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. recognizes that the relationship is an evolving one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea has changed from the poorest country in the world in the
fifties and sixties to one of the richest,'' said a U.S. official
based in Korea who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There's a
constant need to re-evaluate the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the displeasure towards Americans stems from the Status
of Forces Agreement, which in part governs how U.S. soldiers who
commit crimes or wrongdoings in Korea are handled. From little
things, like not paying traffic tickets, to violent crimes, such as
murder, Koreans feel Americans get away with too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (American soldiers) are outside of their campus, they are
not restricted by Korean law, and that's not right,'' said Byung
Chan Son, who owns a small energy consulting firm in Seoul.
``Korean people are very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the agreement is currently being renegotiated, as it
periodically is. Kim of the Foreign Ministry said Korea has
proposed several changes, such as requiring indicted American
soldiers to remain in Korean custody instead of American military
custody and requiring American military facilities _ where air and
ground pollution are not subject to regulations _ to adhere to
basic environmental guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the United States must make an effort to ... give the
Korean public at least an appearance that it respects Korea, treats
Korea as an equal partner and that there's a balance in the
bilateral relations,'' said Lee.

TO WIN AGAIN

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Alfredo Mondragon is from a Mexico so far removed
from modern times, he doesn't know his age and he can't express why
he supports this country's Institutional Revolutionary Party _ the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just what we do,'' the Mazahua Indian from rural Mexico
state said. He stood motionless in soiled work clothes among a
throng of 100,000 cheering for the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   High school teacher and union member Flavio Bernal, on the other
hand, has no trouble defending his party with a militant's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico we live with social peace that the PRI has
guaranteed,'' the 31-year-old Guadalajara resident said, pumping
his fist. ``We know the party has made mistakes, but we don't give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian peasant and the earnest teacher _ both bused to
Mexico City for a recent rally _ are just two faces of a vast quilt
of support that helps sustain the PRI, the world's longest ruling
political party. For 71 years the PRI (pronounced, ``Pree'') has
controlled this country's presidency and most other political
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI faces its toughest test ever when Mexicans elect
their next president on July 2. Its candidate, veteran government
economist Francisco Labastida Ochoa, is locked in a bitter fight to
the end with Vicente Fox Quesada, a former Coca-Cola executive and
rancher who has mounted the most effective opposition campaign in
Mexico's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I entered politics in 1988, my mission has been to
drive the PRI from Los Pinos (the Mexican White House),'' said Fox,
candidate of the conservative National Action Party and coalition
Alliance for Change. ``Mexico can't live with the PRI anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades in power _ and half the population in
poverty _ the PRI has a lot of incumbent baggage to carry. If it
loses the election, most political analysts agree, the party would
slide into crisis and jettison its national leadership. But don't
expect it to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``That party has a structure and breadth nobody is going to give
up,'' said Mexico City analyst Joel Estudillo.
</P>
<P>
   The party's boosters argue that while Mexico may be riddled with
problems, the party rose from ashes of the 1910 Mexican Revolution
and managed to turn a feudal backwater into an industrial,
oil-producing nation. The party's enemies, however, say the PRI has
perpetuated corruption and enriched an elite. They blame the party
for forcing millions of Mexico's poor to emigrate to the United
States, and plunging the country into repeated economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Among its detractors, the PRI is often scornfully referred to as
``the system'' or ``the official party'' or simply, ``the
dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Its core support, some analysts say, is now only about 30
percent to 35 percent of Mexico's 58.7 million voters. But a
well-known leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is also running
for the presidency, so the opposition vote is split, which helps
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this divided opposition vote, most opinion polls
show that Fox and Labastida are in a dead heat now among likely
voters. Fox is trying to syphon votes from Cardenas and both are
fighting for the undecided, which could be as much as 20 percent of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has enormous advantages in this war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the party is pointing a shotgun and firing
everywhere,'' said Mexico City political analyst Edna Jaime. ``It's
using everything possible to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has sought to project a ``new PRI,'' more democratic and
more willing to engage in fierce but fair competition with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For this election, the PRI hired cutting-edge U.S. campaign
strategists, like James Carville, President Clinton's advisor, to
help poll voters and fashion messages. The Austin, Texas-based
Public Strategies Inc., which shapes communications for campaigns,
has assisted in developing international relations.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, when it appeared that Fox was dramatically gaining
ground, the party also called in some controversial old-fashioned
party leaders to join the cause. At least one advisor, Manuel
Bartlett, has a reputation for strong-arm tactics. It's never been
proved, but many Mexicans even think he engineered outright fraud
in the 1988 presidential race to give the PRI the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win an election you have to be inclusive,'' said Javier
Trevino, a Harvard University-educated international affairs
advisor to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign needs everyone in the party on board to help,
Trevino said, and election rules are so tight today nobody can
commit fraud at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election we are going to continue to transform the
PRI,'' he added. ``But first we have an objective, which is to win
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   A key part of that strategy remains the PRI's traditional
network of ``corporatist'' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven decades, the PRI has built a web of pro-party unions
and associations that incorporate farmers, oil workers, industrial
workers, industrialists and government employees into the party's
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   True believers say they support the party because of its rebel
roots and flexible, mixed ideology, borrowing from socialism and
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of my family died in the revolution,'' said Victor
Montelongo, an organizer for a PRI farmers' group in Guanajuato
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some sympathizers say they don't trust anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil you know is better than the devil you don't,'' said
Rosa Espinoza, a secretary with the Mexican Confederation of
Workers, a massive pro-PRI union.
</P>
<P>
   And many support the party because it means perks in a poor
country.
</P>
<P>
   Government workers often receive housing subsidies, loans and
other benefits to offset low salaries. Poor people who seize land
to build houses on are incorporated into the PRI's ranks by local
party bosses, who help them obtain public services or tap into
electrical lines for free power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a great political culture of patronage,'' said
Jaime, the political analyst. ``The PRI hasn't been a military
dictatorship. It's been authoritarian but also inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico's political system has modernized in recent years and
opposition parties have begun to run more municipalities and
states, the PRI's patronage structure has begun to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist anymore,'' Jaime said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's final big rally in Mexico City on June 18 was packed
with people from PRI-affiliated groups, including unionized
teachers bused in from Jalisco, oil workers from Veracruz,
government workers all of stripes, and farmers and Indians from
Puebla and the state of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll of 1,330 likely voters surveyed
between June 10 and June 19 found Labastida had a 53-to-29-percent
advantage over Fox in rural areas, which are about 30 percent of
the electorate. The poll also found Labastida now has a three-point
lead over Fox, who, in a poll by the same company in May had a
five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mexico's peasant farmers, who are on the lowest rungs of
the educational ladder, still regard the PRI and the government as
synonymous. They feel they owe the party their vote _ the PRI
distributed land after the revolution _ and they are grateful for
the few cash benefits the federal government gives them as
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandparents voted for the PRI and so do we,'' said
Rosario Parra, 49, a Nahuatl Indian who was bused by the party from
rural Puebla to the PRI rally in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI has given us things like Procampo (cash subsidies for
farmers) and Progresa (a new program that offers cash for the
poorest of families),'' Parra added.
</P>
<P>
   A special watchdog congressional commission has filed at least
seven complaints with Mexico's Attorney General, charging that
evidence strongly suggests that the PRI is coercing votes using
these federal programs and turning some government workplaces into
virtual campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the state-run oil company Pemex and a federal
family-welfare office, for example, have complained that managers
are under pressure to recruit votes for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Another PRI campaign practice _ passing out free gifts of food,
bags of cement and other goods _ is not necessarily illegal if
these goods are privately supplied. But charges are pouring in to
watchdog groups that state and local officials are supporting these
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Labastida campaign is firing back, arguing that no charges
have been proved, and that Fox of trying to discredit the campaign
process because he could lose.
</P>
<P>
   At his Mexico City rally, Labastida said: ``Only those who
already sense defeat proclaim anticipated fraud, which only exists
in their imagination or because of their sense of desperation.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The party that has governed Mexico for seven
decades has become as familiar to U.S. policymakers as the litany
of difficult issues dividing the giant neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling party is tossed out in July 2 presidential
elections, though, American officials would quickly praise the
result as a healthy development in Mexico's democratic evolution, a
badly needed breath of fresh air for the rough-and-tumble politics
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, turning the tables on 71 years of one-party
rule in Mexico would present new challenges to the United States,
even as it opened the door to a whole new chorus of long-stifled
political voices across Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be happy to have a new party, because there would be new
elites,'' said Mexico expert Louis Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with those changes would come complications, countered
Robert Leiken of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten into the habit very much,'' he said, ``of
dealing with the ruling party.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, of course, the U.S. government takes no sides in
Mexico's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government must deal with whomever is elected, whether
the victor is Francisco Labastida Ochoa, banner carrier of the
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish
acronym, PRI; or opposition candidate Vicente Fox Quesada, of the
National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican people will vote and make their own decision,''
President Clinton told reporters earlier this month, when Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo (of the PRI) paid a visit to the White
House for his 11th bilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the answer is little different.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Labastida nor Fox has promised any significant departure
from policies that have led to increasingly close ties between the
United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. diplomats and senior administration officials insist
that the bricks and mortar of U.S.-Mexico relations _ NAFTA, twice
yearly cabinet-level meetings on key issues and ongoing cooperation
on more than a dozen issues ranging from narcotics trafficking and
environmental concerns to illegal border crossings and water rights
_ are strong enough to withstand an overturning of the old
political order in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty about our relationship with Mexico is that it goes
so deep, from the local, federal and regional levels,'' said Mike
Hammer, a Latin American expert with the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``A change at the top will have some effect,'' Hammer said,
``but it won't alter what's already in place.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that U.S. policymakers aren't watching
Mexico's elections closely. An overthrow of the PRI, after all,
could have potentially huge impacts on the United States, simply by
dint of the deep and wide nature of U.S.-Mexican relations.
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind the two nations are tightly woven.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the North American Free Trade Agreement wed the
two nation's economies, two-way trade between the United States and
Mexico hit $197 billion in 1999. That accounted for nearly 10
percent of this country's total global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 60 percent of the cocaine, as well as much of the
marijuana and heroine, consumed by Americans flows into the country
through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And American drug users pump more than $50 billion into the
narco-trade each year. Much of that winds up in Mexico, where it
stokes a ring of crime and corruption at the root of death,
destruction and the undermining of Mexican democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And, with Americans and Mexicans making 300 million legal border
crossings each year, not to mention illegal smuggling and
immigration, it's getting harder all the time to distinguish
between Mexican problems and American ills.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop of growing integration between two very
different countries that just happen to be neighbors, Mexico
analysts in this country have long regarded Mexico's one-party rule
as a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it's brought stability _ of a sort _ to a
country with which the United States shares a 2,000-mile-long
border.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small achievement, given the vast disparities between
the two countries, the pernicious influence of druglords in Mexico
and the history of political violence and repression across much of
Central America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   And the PRI has provided a known entity to U.S. policymakers.
They'd had years to get to know Zedillo. A Yale-trained economist,
Zedillo had held two cabinet positions under Mexico's former PRI
leader, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, by the time Zedillo
took office in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's political predictability, though, has come at a price,
beginning, said Goodman, with a lack of imagination and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just have one set of decision-makers, you end up in
paralysis,'' said Goodman, dean of international studies at
American University in Washington. ``That's been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The impact has gone far beyond questions of good governance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Zedillo's efforts to root out corruption and bear down
on drug kingpins, Mexico has made little headway against violent
and well-funded druglords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Mexican government) has not disrupted the activities
of the major drug cartels,'' the State Department reported three
months ago in its annual review of international counter-drug
efforts. ``Chronic problems of corruption, weak police and criminal
justice institutions, budget constraints and severe poverty in
rural areas where drug crops are cultivated hamper Mexico's ability
to combat drug trafficking effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   One-party rule hasn't helped, said Leiken, author of the
forthcoming book, ``Melting Borders,'' a look at the Mexican
community in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main impediment to change, in terms of corruption, is the
lack of alternacy in power _ the kind of immunity and impunity that
that has created among important political figures,'' he explained.
``When you have a one-party system, it lends itself to that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fox victory wouldn't wipe out Mexican corruption, certainly,
nor would it run off the druglords.
</P>
<P>
   A government shake-up would, however, present a new
administration with the necessity to start with a clean slate. At a
minimum, that would force organized crime to dance the risky ballet
involved in courting contacts in a new government.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself could be a stride in the right directi so many
other endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's certain, said Goodman, no matter who wins on July 2:
``We really need them, and they really need us.''

   SEOUL _ When Christopher McCarthy, a 22-year-old American
soldier, escaped from U.S. military custody after he was accused of
murdering a South Korean bar hostess for refusing sex with him, it
fed the belief among South Koreans that Americans believe they're
above the law.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was apprehended eight hours later and was sentenced by
a South Korean court this month to eight years in prison. However,
that incident was the latest in a series of events, including the
surprisingly successful summit between North and South Korea, that
has stoked calls for less interference from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a very strong anti-American sentiment
right now, but I think it's growing,'' said Jung-Hoon Lee,
professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.
``The summit contributed to it because of its focus on independence
and autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunification of the two Koreas is seen by some South Koreans as
an issue that can be resolved by Koreans only.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kim Jong Il's new look ... (showing) he can be friendly,
smile, be jovial, a very confident leader, (some people) feel, we
can do some business with this guy and Americans only serve as a
possible roadblock,'' said Lee. ``So that sort of feeds on
anti-American sentiment that was already there. There's a sense
that we should do this alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have always been factions in Korea _ especially
among the left-wing and the younger generations - who believe U.S.
troops should go home.
</P>
<P>
   Massive student demonstrations in the 1970s and '80s are
characterized as anti-American but were more directed at the
military dictators who ruled South Korea, said Lee. But because of
the military alliance between the two countries, the United States
was seen as tolerating or approving of the dictatorships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many students still feel Korea is being used by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States thinks of Korea as their colony,'' said Soo
Jin Park, a 25-year-old student at Yonsei University. ``Not on
paper, but by the way they act, Koreans get that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the 37,000 American troops in Korea should leave
``because we're not at war and I see no reason for them to stay in
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   While such sentiments are common on university campuses,
analysts agree they do not represent the mainstream view in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a growing belief _ even among people who would
identify themselves as pro-American and have no desire to see
American troops withdraw _ that Washington needs to treat Korea as
more of an equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, I must say Korea is controlled by the United
States in many ways,'' said Rev. Young Joon Cho, pastor of Chung
Dong First Methodist Church in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Pagoda Park in downtown Seoul is filled with elderly men playing
chess, practicing calligraphy or just passing the time. In one
corner, a retired sociology teacher who would give his name only as
Mr. Kim is holding court with an audience of at least a couple
dozen, lecturing on U.S.-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States shouldn't look down at Korea,'' he said.
``We're not the Korea of 50 years ago. They should respect Korea as
a full sovereign country and let us solve our own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Foreign Ministry believes it is ready for an adjustment
in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, our relationship has been one of dependence on
U.S. aid,'' said Sung-Hwan Kim, deputy director of the Ministry's
North American bureau. ``Now I feel we're equipped with the
requirements (for a more equal partnership).''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. recognizes that the relationship is an evolving one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea has changed from the poorest country in the world in the
fifties and sixties to one of the richest,'' said a U.S. official
based in Korea who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There's a
constant need to re-evaluate the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the displeasure towards Americans stems from the Status
of Forces Agreement, which in part governs how U.S. soldiers who
commit crimes or wrongdoings in Korea are handled. From little
things, like not paying traffic tickets, to violent crimes, such as
murder, Koreans feel Americans get away with too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (American soldiers) are outside of their campus, they are
not restricted by Korean law, and that's not right,'' said Byung
Chan Son, who owns a small energy consulting firm in Seoul.
``Korean people are very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the agreement is currently being renegotiated, as it
periodically is. Kim of the Foreign Ministry said Korea has
proposed several changes, such as requiring indicted American
soldiers to remain in Korean custody instead of American military
custody and requiring American military facilities _ where air and
ground pollution are not subject to regulations _ to adhere to
basic environmental guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the United States must make an effort to ... give the
Korean public at least an appearance that it respects Korea, treats
Korea as an equal partner and that there's a balance in the
bilateral relations,'' said Lee.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Alfredo Mondragon is from a Mexico so far removed
from modern times, he doesn't know his age and he can't express why
he supports this country's Institutional Revolutionary Party _ the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just what we do,'' the Mazahua Indian from rural Mexico
state said. He stood motionless in soiled work clothes among a
throng of 100,000 cheering for the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   High school teacher and union member Flavio Bernal, on the other
hand, has no trouble defending his party with a militant's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico we live with social peace that the PRI has
guaranteed,'' the 31-year-old Guadalajara resident said, pumping
his fist. ``We know the party has made mistakes, but we don't give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian peasant and the earnest teacher _ both bused to
Mexico City for a recent rally _ are just two faces of a vast quilt
of support that helps sustain the PRI, the world's longest ruling
political party. For 71 years the PRI (pronounced, ``Pree'') has
controlled this country's presidency and most other political
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI faces its toughest test ever when Mexicans elect
their next president on July 2. Its candidate, veteran government
economist Francisco Labastida Ochoa, is locked in a bitter fight to
the end with Vicente Fox Quesada, a former Coca-Cola executive and
rancher who has mounted the most effective opposition campaign in
Mexico's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I entered politics in 1988, my mission has been to
drive the PRI from Los Pinos (the Mexican White House),'' said Fox,
candidate of the conservative National Action Party and coalition
Alliance for Change. ``Mexico can't live with the PRI anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades in power _ and half the population in
poverty _ the PRI has a lot of incumbent baggage to carry. If it
loses the election, most political analysts agree, the party would
slide into crisis and jettison its national leadership. But don't
expect it to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``That party has a structure and breadth nobody is going to give
up,'' said Mexico City analyst Joel Estudillo.
</P>
<P>
   The party's boosters argue that while Mexico may be riddled with
problems, the party rose from ashes of the 1910 Mexican Revolution
and managed to turn a feudal backwater into an industrial,
oil-producing nation. The party's enemies, however, say the PRI has
perpetuated corruption and enriched an elite. They blame the party
for forcing millions of Mexico's poor to emigrate to the United
States, and plunging the country into repeated economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Among its detractors, the PRI is often scornfully referred to as
``the system'' or ``the official party'' or simply, ``the
dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Its core support, some analysts say, is now only about 30
percent to 35 percent of Mexico's 58.7 million voters. But a
well-known leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is also running
for the presidency, so the opposition vote is split, which helps
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this divided opposition vote, most opinion polls
show that Fox and Labastida are in a dead heat now among likely
voters. Fox is trying to syphon votes from Cardenas and both are
fighting for the undecided, which could be as much as 20 percent of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has enormous advantages in this war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the party is pointing a shotgun and firing
everywhere,'' said Mexico City political analyst Edna Jaime. ``It's
using everything possible to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has sought to project a ``new PRI,'' more democratic and
more willing to engage in fierce but fair competition with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For this election, the PRI hired cutting-edge U.S. campaign
strategists, like James Carville, President Clinton's advisor, to
help poll voters and fashion messages. The Austin, Texas-based
Public Strategies Inc., which shapes communications for campaigns,
has assisted in developing international relations.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, when it appeared that Fox was dramatically gaining
ground, the party also called in some controversial old-fashioned
party leaders to join the cause. At least one advisor, Manuel
Bartlett, has a reputation for strong-arm tactics. It's never been
proved, but many Mexicans even think he engineered outright fraud
in the 1988 presidential race to give the PRI the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win an election you have to be inclusive,'' said Javier
Trevino, a Harvard University-educated international affairs
advisor to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign needs everyone in the party on board to help,
Trevino said, and election rules are so tight today nobody can
commit fraud at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election we are going to continue to transform the
PRI,'' he added. ``But first we have an objective, which is to win
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   A key part of that strategy remains the PRI's traditional
network of ``corporatist'' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven decades, the PRI has built a web of pro-party unions
and associations that incorporate farmers, oil workers, industrial
workers, industrialists and government employees into the party's
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   True believers say they support the party because of its rebel
roots and flexible, mixed ideology, borrowing from socialism and
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of my family died in the revolution,'' said Victor
Montelongo, an organizer for a PRI farmers' group in Guanajuato
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some sympathizers say they don't trust anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil you know is better than the devil you don't,'' said
Rosa Espinoza, a secretary with the Mexican Confederation of
Workers, a massive pro-PRI union.
</P>
<P>
   And many support the party because it means perks in a poor
country.
</P>
<P>
   Government workers often receive housing subsidies, loans and
other benefits to offset low salaries. Poor people who seize land
to build houses on are incorporated into the PRI's ranks by local
party bosses, who help them obtain public services or tap into
electrical lines for free power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a great political culture of patronage,'' said
Jaime, the political analyst. ``The PRI hasn't been a military
dictatorship. It's been authoritarian but also inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico's political system has modernized in recent years and
opposition parties have begun to run more municipalities and
states, the PRI's patronage structure has begun to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist anymore,'' Jaime said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's final big rally in Mexico City on June 18 was packed
with people from PRI-affiliated groups, including unionized
teachers bused in from Jalisco, oil workers from Veracruz,
government workers all of stripes, and farmers and Indians from
Puebla and the state of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll of 1,330 likely voters surveyed
between June 10 and June 19 found Labastida had a 53-to-29-percent
advantage over Fox in rural areas, which are about 30 percent of
the electorate. The poll also found Labastida now has a three-point
lead over Fox, who, in a poll by the same company in May had a
five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mexico's peasant farmers, who are on the lowest rungs of
the educational ladder, still regard the PRI and the government as
synonymous. They feel they owe the party their vote _ the PRI
distributed land after the revolution _ and they are grateful for
the few cash benefits the federal government gives them as
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandparents voted for the PRI and so do we,'' said
Rosario Parra, 49, a Nahuatl Indian who was bused by the party from
rural Puebla to the PRI rally in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI has given us things like Procampo (cash subsidies for
farmers) and Progresa (a new program that offers cash for the
poorest of families),'' Parra added.
</P>
<P>
   A special watchdog congressional commission has filed at least
seven complaints with Mexico's Attorney General, charging that
evidence strongly suggests that the PRI is coercing votes using
these federal programs and turning some government workplaces into
virtual campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the state-run oil company Pemex and a federal
family-welfare office, for example, have complained that managers
are under pressure to recruit votes for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Another PRI campaign practice _ passing out free gifts of food,
bags of cement and other goods _ is not necessarily illegal if
these goods are privately supplied. But charges are pouring in to
watchdog groups that state and local officials are supporting these
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Labastida campaign is firing back, arguing that no charges
have been proved, and that Fox of trying to discredit the campaign
process because he could lose.
</P>
<P>
   At his Mexico City rally, Labastida said: ``Only those who
already sense defeat proclaim anticipated fraud, which only exists
in their imagination or because of their sense of desperation.''

   U.S. WATCHING MEXICAN ELECTION CLOSELY, EXPECTS LITTLE CHANGE IN
RELATIONSHIP
</P>
<P>
   (800&AMP;ADD)
</P>
<P>
   With MEXICO-PRI-$ADV25.
</P>
<P>
   Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary
categorlections.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government must deal with whomever is elected, whether
the victor is Francisco Labastida Ochoa, banner carrier of the
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish
acronym, PRI; or opposition candidate Vicente Fox Quesada, of the
National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican people will vote and make their own decision,''
President Clinton told reporters earlier this month, when Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo (of the PRI) paid a visit to the White
House for his 11th bilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the answer is little different.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Labastida nor Fox has promised any significant departure
from policies that have led to increasingly close ties between the
United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. diplomats and senior administration officials insist
that the bricks and mortar of U.S.-Mexico relations _ NAFTA, twice
yearly cabinet-level meetings on key issues and ongoing cooperation
on more than a dozen issues ranging from narcotics trafficking and
environmental concerns to illegal border crossings and water rights
_ are strong enough to withstand an overturning of the old
political order in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty about our relationship with Mexico is that it goes
so deep, from the local, federal and regional levels,'' said Mike
Hammer, a Latin American expert with the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``A change at the top will have some effect,'' Hammer said,
``but it won't alter what's already in place.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that U.S. policymakers aren't watching
Mexico's elections closely. An overthrow of the PRI, after all,
could have potentially huge impacts on the United States, simply by
dint of the deep and wide nature of U.S.-Mexican relations.
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind the two nations are tightly woven.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the North American Free Trade Agreement wed the
two nation's economies, two-way trade between the United States and
Mexico hit $197 billion in 1999. That accounted for nearly 10
percent of this country's total global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 60 percent of the cocaine, as well as much of the
marijuana and heroine, consumed by Americans flows into the country
through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And American drug users pump more than $50 billion into the
narco-trade each year. Much of that winds up in Mexico, where it
stokes a ring of crime and corruption at the root of death,
destruction and the undermining of Mexican democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And, with Americans and Mexicans making 300 million legal border
crossings each year, not to mention illegal smuggling and
immigration, it's getting harder all the time to distinguish
between Mexican problems and American ills.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop of growing integration between two very
different countries that just happen to be neighbors, Mexico
analysts in this country have long regarded Mexico's one-party rule
as a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it's brought stability _ of a sort _ to a
country with which the United States shares a 2,000-mile-long
border.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small achievement, given the vast disparities between
the two countries, the pernicious influence of druglords in Mexico
and the history of political violence and repression across much of
Central America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   And the PRI has provided a known entity to U.S. policymakers.
They'd had years to get to know Zedillo. A Yale-trained economist,
Zedillo had held two cabinet positions under Mexico's former PRI
leader, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, by the time Zedillo
took office in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's political predictability, though, has come at a price,
beginning, said Goodman, with a lack of imagination and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just have one set of decision-makers, you end up in
paralysis,'' said Goodman, dean of international studies at
American University in Washington. ``That's been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The impact has gone far beyond questions of good governance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Zedillo's efforts to root out corruption and bear down
on drug kingpins, Mexico has made little headway against violent
and well-funded druglords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Mexican government) has not disrupted the activities
of the major drug cartels,'' the State Department reported three
months ago in its annual review of international counter-drug
efforts. ``Chronic problems of corruption, weak police and criminal
justice institutions, budget constraints and severe poverty in
rural areas where drug crops are cultivated hamper Mexico's ability
to combat drug trafficking effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   One-party rule hasn't helped, said Leiken, author of the
forthcoming book, ``Melting Borders,'' a look at the Mexican
community in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main impediment to change, in terms of corruption, is the
lack of alternacy in power _ the kind of immunity and impunity that
that has created among important political figures,'' he explained.
``When you have a one-party system, it lends itself to that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fox victory wouldn't wipe out Mexican corruption, certainly,
nor would it run off the druglords.
</P>
<P>
   A government shake-up would, however, present a new
administration with the necessity to start with a clean slate. At a
minimum, that would force organized crime to dance the risky ballet
involved in courting contacts in a new government.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself could be a stride in the right direction for two
countries so dependent on each other in the drug war, as in so many
other endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's certain, said Goodman, no matter who wins on July 2:
``We really need them, and they really need us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday
night rejected a Democratic proposal to let the federal government
offer prescription drug benefits to all 39 million people on
Medicare, as it considered legislation to help private insurance
companies offer such coverage with federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   By a party-line vote of 22-12, the committee defeated a proposal
by Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., that would have authorized the
government to offer a standard package of drug benefits throughout
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee of any particular benefit that our
constituents will get if the Republican bill is enacted,'' Cardin
said. ``The Republicans say this would be an entitlement program,
but there is no specific benefit that seniors are entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for people who are elderly or
disabled, but generally does not cover drugs for people outside the
hospital. One-third of the elderly have no insurance to cover drug
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House Republican bill, the details of drug insurance _
benefits, premiums, co-payments and deductibles _ could vary from
one private insurer to another, so long as the total value was
equivalent to that of a standard policy defined by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Cardin's proposal encapsulated the differences
between the two parties. Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., argued against
the Cardin proposal, saying: ``We don't want the government to
control health care. It has not done a particularly good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Republicans said it was unnecessary for the government
itself to provide drug benefits because private insurers would do
the job with federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Merck-Medco Managed Care, a unit of Merck &AMP; Co., the worldwide
drug manufacturer based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., said Wednesday
that it wanted to offer drug coverage under the House Republican
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Congress, Per G.H. Lofberg, chairman of
Merck-Medco, said, ``We would work to develop a prescription
drug-only plan that we could offer nationwide in competition with
others in what we expect will be a highly competitive market.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Cardin said, ``I don't know whether my constituents in
Maryland will have this Merck plan available to them five years
from now.'' Cardin said he feared that insurers would move in and
out of the market for drug benefits, just as health maintenance
organizations have moved in and out of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders said they hoped the full House would
pass their Medicare bill by the end of next week, when lawmakers
leave town for Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Tarplin, an assistant secretary of health and human
services who attended Wednesday's session of the Ways and Means
Committee, said, ``We strongly oppose this bill.'' On the House
floor, Democrats will have an opportunity to offer a proposal of
their own as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether a Medicare drug bill becomes law this year
_ and no one can be sure _ House Republicans said they hoped that,
by taking up the legislation, they could inoculate themselves
against attacks by Democrats exploiting one of the most potent
political issues in this fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill says that all Medicare beneficiaries would
have a choice of two or more private drug plans. If insurers did
not voluntarily enter a particular market, the government could
offer financial incentives to draw them in.
</P>
<P>
   But a critique of the House Republican bill, prepared by the
Clinton administration, said: ``Insurers are unlikely to
participate unless bribed. The new Medicare bureaucracy could
increase payments to insurers to bribe them to participate. This
will make insurers hold out to get higher payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the administration said, the Republican proposal
``relies on a flawed trickle-down theory that would end up
subsidizing insurers, not seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Republican
bill would cost $39.7 billion over the next five years and $158
billion from 2001 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that beneficiaries would pay premiums averaging
$37 a month, or $444 a year, for drug coverage under their
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republican leaders have not shown any sense of
urgency, though they acknowledge that millions of low-income
Medicare beneficiaries cannot afford the drugs they need. The
chairman of the Finance Committee, Sen. William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del., who is in a tight re-election race, has said he wants the
panel to vote next month on comprehensive Medicare legislation,
including drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republican leaders are wary, fearing that the cost of
drug benefits could explode.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican bill defines a model drug insurance policy,
known as ``standard coverage.'' Under this policy, a Medicare
beneficiary would pay an annual deductible of $250 and would pay
half of the next $2,100 a year in drug costs. Most patients would
then be responsible for their own drug expenses, but the
beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs would be limited to $6,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, each insurer would negotiate with drug companies to
obtain drug price discounts comparable to those now secured by
large purchasers like hospitals and HMO's. Medicare patients would
get these discounts regardless of whether they had reached the
limits of their drug insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debate focused on the proper role of government.
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said: ``Democrats are
for an affordable, guaranteed benefit under the Medicare program.
Republicans want to basically privatize this benefit, as they've
always wanted to privatize Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways
and Means Committee, said: ``The Republicans have no confidence in
providing assistance directly to our aged. Rather, they want to
subsidize the private sector, the HMO's, the insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said: ``The Republicans have been
trying to figure out how to shove money down the throats of
insurance companies who don't want to offer drug benefits. The
Republicans think that that's the only way it can be done. They
don't trust Medicare. They would like to see it wither on the
vine.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would offer what the elderly want: more
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said President Clinton and
congressional Democrats were offering ``a one-size-fits-all plan on
a take-it-or-leave-it basis.'' A person who uses one or two
prescriptions a month should not have to buy the same insurance
policy as a person who uses 10 or 15, Weller said.
</P>
<P>
   Tillie Fowler of Florida, vice chairwoman of the House
Republican Conference, said: ``Unlike the Clinton-Gore plan, we
give all seniors and the disabled the right to choose an affordable
prescription drug benefit that fits their needs. Americans can
choose a Cadillac plan, or they can opt for a more affordable Honda
plan.''

`JOE LOUIS: THE BOXER WHO BEAT HITLER': GOOD AND EVIL IN THE RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Budgeted earlier as TV-LEWIS-REVIEW)  
(Editors: production notes at end of review) 
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not only were the boxers heavyweights in the 1938 match between
Joe Louis and Max Schmeling. So was the symbolism. Black versus
white. Freedom vs. Fascism. Good vs. evil.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to capitalize on the propaganda while commenting on it, a
new ``Biography'' on A&AMP;E on Thursday night has been titled ``Joe
Louis: The Boxer Who Beat Hitler.'' (Would that it had been so.)
</P>
<P>
   Louis' son points out the irony in his father's representing the
free world when at home he was denied equality. We hear that
Schmeling _ who was pelted with banana peels and paper cups at
Yankee Stadium _ was miscast as an evil Nazi. He wasn't a member of
the National Socialist Party and had been criticized at home for
having a Jewish manager.
</P>
<P>
   With its potent mix of racial politics, history and celebrity _
not to mention the thrill of boxing _ the Joe Louis story makes an
ideal candidate for the long-running ``Biography'' series. (This
month A&AMP;E is presenting 27 premieres on the series, including the
sublime, Mary Magdalene, and the ridiculous, Hulk Hogan.)
</P>
<P>
   Because of their straightforward and predictable format, the A&AMP;E
biographies work best when good film is available (not likely with,
say, the forthcoming presentation on Peter the Great). The Joe
Louis film is very good. There's an eerie beauty in old
black-and-white boxing clips, which seem balletic rather than
bloody. No ``Raging Bull'' viscera here.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Biography'' style (that is, an absence of style), the
Joe Louis story unfolds as an allegory, resonant with overt and
hidden meaning. ``In an era of prejudice and segregation Louis was
uniquely popular,'' we are told. Then, ominously, ``There was an
unexpected price to pay for being the torchbearer.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case allegory seems appropriate. Louis was an iconic
figure, as important symbolically in his day as Muhammad Ali would
be a generation later. Louis' life moved in a Hollywood arc,
beginning poignantly in in 1914 in a sharecropper's cabin in
Alabama and ending poignantly in 1981 with a celebrity-packed
funeral at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the times, and his personality and ambition, he was
designated the good Negro, the opposite of Jack Johnson, the black
boxer who terrified whites with his belligerence and open affairs
with white women. (Johnson's story was told, with perhaps more
noise than enlightenment, in the 1970 movie ``The Great White
Hope,'' based on the Broadway play.) Louis presented himself as a
clean-living, modest man and made sure he was never photographed
next to a white woman. (He kept his extramarital arrangements
quiet.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, he wasn't allowed to forget his place. In Pompton Lakes,
N.J., where he trained, he became a celebrity. Feeling warmly
toward the locals, he bought the town an ambulance with proceeds
from a fight but then was denied the opportunity to buy the
handsome house he wanted because he was black. Newspapers referred
to him racially, as the Dark Destroyer, the Sable Cyclone, the
Brown Bomber.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, comments his son, ``he was the only black man
who could legitimately beat up a white man and get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Hitler and Mussolini, Louis may have been just another
heavyweight champ. But his boxing ascent coincided with Fascism's
rise, and his fate was sealed. His 1935 defeat of the Italian boxer
Primo Carnera was Round 1 in the propaganda fight.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmeling was a shrewd fighter. When he faced Louis in 1936,
he had studied his opponent and knew his weak spot: a tendency to
drop his left hand after throwing a punch, leaving himself open.
Schmeling knocked him out. Next time, however, Louis was better
prepared. In their 1938 rematch, which would prove to be Louis'
apotheosis, Schmeling was hit so hard he wept.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II began, Louis became an icon for black
recruitment, helping to urge prospective soldiers to overcome their
doubts about serving in the white man's army. He was instrumental
in helping desegregate that Army, not only by encouraging
enlistment but by using his influence to combat racial bias on
military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Like many veterans, but for different reasons, he came home to
find his glory days diminished, even though he was still young. He
retired from boxing in 1949, then returned two years later to try
to pay off his enormous tax debt.
</P>
<P>
   His denouement was long and sad. He took up drinking and drugs
and began hearing voices coming out of air-conditioning units.
Muhammad Ali, representing a new era, refused military service and
otherwise rejected Louis' values, calling him an Uncle Tom. But in
the end Ali came to Louis' funeral to pay his respect. Respect was
due.

NEW TECHNOLOGY IS AIMED AT INCREASING WEB PRIVACY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Major Internet companies and the World Wide Web's
standard-setting body Wednesday unveiled long-awaited technology
that would alert computer users before they visited Web sites that
collect more personal information than they are willing to share.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new standard, called Platform for Privacy
Preferences, or P3P, was billed as just one step in improving the
state of privacy on the Internet, it was immediately denounced by
some privacy advocates as a way for companies to avoid new laws and
a tool that would give consumers a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the technology proves to be widely accepted by
Internet companies and Web sites, it would give consumers a way to
more easily control whether and how companies track their Web
movements and gather information about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to give users on the Web more control,'' said
Daniel J. Weitzner, an official with the World Wide Web Consortium,
or W3C, which develops open standards to promote universal Web
access and interoperability between Web sites and different
technologies. ``We hope that it will make privacy policies easier
to find, easier to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The standard has been under development for about three years by
the consortium, AT&AMP;T labs and major companies like IBM, Microsoft
and America Online. An online civil liberties group, the Center for
Democracy and Technology, has also been involved in the project.
The standards were unveiled in New York Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, P3P sets standards to allow Internet browsers to
automatically read privacy policies that have been posted on Web
sites using the new standard. The browsers then will go only to
sites that follow the preferences preselected by the computer
users. It will alert them before going to any Web sites that
collect more information than they are willing to give.
</P>
<P>
   For the technology to work, however, it will be have to be
implemented by the millions of Web sites on the Internet. As of
Wednesday, the White House and 13 other Web sites _ mostly the
companies and groups involved in the project _ had created privacy
policies that could be read by P3P enabled software.
</P>
<P>
   Deidre Mulligan, a lawyer with the Center for Democracy and
Technology who has been involved in the project since its
inception, said the focus now was to work with industry groups to
aggressively promote the new standard and persuade Web sites to
start using it.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have already developed software that converts
written privacy policies to the code needed for P3P-enabled
browsers to read them.
</P>
<P>
   And the first software that will let computer users begin using
P3P in their browsers will be introduced next week by a company
called YouPowered. That new software, called Orby Privacy Plus, has
four settings users can choose: private, cautious, trusting and
open.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and AOL-Netscape said they hoped to have software
plug-ins for their browsers later this year. The standard will also
be part of the next version of the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is falling in line behind the project.
</P>
<P>
   Webwasher.com, a German privacy software company affiliated with
Siemens, called P3P ``too little, too late.'' P3P will damage
privacy by aggregating personal information and releasing it to any
Web site with a compliant privacy policy, said Dr. Horst Joepen,
the chief executive. A group of privacy advocates also criticized
the standard as a ``complex and confusing protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not view P3P as technology that will promote privacy,''
said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, which released a report on P3P with a company
called Junkbusters; Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility; and Chris Hunter, a doctoral candidate at the
University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communications.

CLIPPERS' JOHNSON TAKES CARE OF BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers remain a team without a coach with
the NBA Draft less than a week away and the contracts for their
assistant coaches expiring at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's bothering coaching candidate and current assistant
Dennis Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't worry about it,'' said Johnson, who talked about his
situation at USC on Wednesday after helping the Clippers work out
four potential draftees. ``I do my job and don't worry about
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a three-time NBA champion as a player, has spoken to
Elgin Baylor, vice president of basketball operations, and Andy
Roeser, executive vice president, about the position but said he
hasn't had talks recently.
</P>
<P>
   My job ``is to work the kids that are coming in and to do my
job,'' Johnson said. ``That can speak bigger volumes than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have also discussed the position with Denver
Nuggets assistant coach John Lucas and former Georgetown coach John
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have said they still hope to have a coach in place
before the June 28 draft.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for a Clippers draft without a coach. In
1998, between the stints of former coaches Bill Fitch and Chris
Ford, the Clippers took Michael Olo wokandi with the No.1 overall
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Workouts
</P>
<P>
   Draft workouts on Wednesday included Syracuse defensive stopper
Etan Thomas, the Big East Defensive Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the 6-foot-9 shot blocker has come from mid-first
round teams. Both Houston (ninth) and Seattle (17) want a second
look and Dallas (12) might want a second workout, Thomas said. The
Clippers pick at No.3 and No.18 in the first round and No.30, the
first pick in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Thomas, the Clippers brought in 7-foot-1 center
Ndongo N'Diaye, who played for Delaware; 7-foot-2 center Soumaila
Samake, who played for Cincinnati in the International Basketball
League last season; and, 6-foot-8 forward Keniel Daniels from
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   N'Diaye, from Senegal, has received attention since a strong
showing in the Chicago pre-draft camp. He has visited Golden State
and plans to visit Dallas and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   It's been a busy week for the Clippers. LSU 6-foot-9 power
forward Stromile Swift worked out for the team last Friday. Swift,
a sophomore, has been projected by many draft pundits as the No.2
pick to Vancouver ... On Saturday, the Clippers looked at Morris
Peterson, Michigan State's 6-foot-7 swingman ... Among the players
the Clippers brought in on Sunday were Missouri point guard Kenyon
Dooling and Connecticut point guard Khalid El-Amin. Both are
possible selections at the 18th pick ... On Monday the Clippers
looked at UCLA's 6-foot-7 swingman JaRon Rush and Hidayet Turkoglu,
a 6-foot-8 forward from Turkey. Turkoglu has been compared to
Philadelphia free agent Toni Kukoc.

<P>
   After decades of paying higher premiums for life insurance than
white customers, nearly 2 million black customers and their
families nationwide are going to be compensated in a settlement
reached Wednesday with one of the nation's biggest insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company, American General, said that it was making
restitution of $206 million, mainly to the black customers and
their heirs who, until as recently as April, paid as much as 33
percent more than white customers for small policies intended to
cover burial expenses.
</P>
<P>
   American General also agreed to pay fines of $7.5 million to
regulators in five states, Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee
and Alabama, where most of the insurance was sold, and to
contribute $2 million to the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   One black policyholder, Bessie Jones, a 71-year-old grandmother
in Sarasota, Fla., told state insurance regulators who uncovered
the racially biased practices, that she bought at least a dozen
policies with face values of about $1,000 from a company now owned
by American General. On one of several policies she cited, she said
she paid premiums of 90 cents a week and had paid more than $1,600
for the $1,000 death benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nelson, the insurance commissioner in Florida who, along
with private class-action lawyers negotiated the settlement on
behalf of all 50 states, called the long history of discrimination
tragic. And he added: ``It's incomprehensible that this practice
continued up until recent days.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had begun to take steps to end the practice
as soon as it became aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say individual policyholders and their heirs are
likely to receive a few hundred dollars each, with up to 11.5
percent of the $206 million going to the lawyers, led by the New
York firm of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &AMP; Lerach, which
specializes in class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   About $50 million of the money has been designated for both
black and white customers who, regardless of the rates they were
charged, paid more over the years in premiums than the few hundred
dollars that these policies would pay.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was the first step in setting things right with
millions of of poor blacks who paid more for their insurance
because the companies calculated that they would have shorter life
spans than white customers. While regulators say millions of these
policies remain in effect, the two-tiered actuarial policy was
outlawed in the early 1960s. And the insurance industry now
acknowledges that poverty rather than race led to shorter lives for
many of those against whom the companies discriminated.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 companies have low-cost burial policies on their
books. Florida is already investigating four of these companies
that it thinks charged higher rates to poor blacks and, in some
cases, Hispanics. Those four companies are all subsidiaries of
bigger companies: the United Insurance Co. of America, a unit of
Unitrin Inc.; the Monumental Life Insurance Co., a unit of Aegon;
the Liberty National Life Insurance Co., a unit of the Torchmark
Corp.; and the Life Insurance Co. of Georgia, a unit of ING Group.
Both Aegon and ING are Dutch companies with growing operations in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge step in the right direction,'' said the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, whose Rainbow Coalition Wall Street project
concentrates on equality for minority members in financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no doubt that millions of other cases awaited
resolution. ``My grandmother had these kinds of policies when I was
growing up in Greenville, S.C.,'' he said. ``They would pay 25
cents a week. The insurance man and the rent man would come by
every week and when you could only pay one, you paid the insurance
man because all the old folks wanted a dignified burial.''
</P>
<P>
   American General said the nearly 5 million discriminatory
policies on the lives of more than 2 million peo- ple, plus 4.3
million others held by both black and white customers were sold by
companies it acquired over the last 20 years as it was expanding to
become one of the nation's largest insurers. On about 400,000 of
these policies, the company said, customers have paid or would have
paid premiums that exceeded the face value of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the policyholders were making regular monthly
payments to an American General subsidiary, American General Life
and Accident in Nashville, American General said it discovered the
two-tiered system only after Florida insurance regulators
subpoenaed company records last October.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida investigators had begun looking into the sales of
small burial policies, sometimes referred to as industrial policies
because they were originally designed for low-paid industrial
workers, after receiving complaints from some customers that they
had paid more in premiums than the policies on their lives were
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials said that American General executives began
negotiations on settling the state's concerns earlier this year but
that the insurer kept collecting higher premiums from blacks than
whites until April, when Florida demanded that the practice stop.
Talks between the state and the insurance company had broken off,
but they resumed after the so-called cease-and-desist order was
issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not condone this practice,'' American General said in a
statement when it stopped collecting the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Robert M. Devlin, the chief executive
of American General, said it was ``imperative that we move swiftly
and responsibly to correct an unfortunate historical practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president at A.M. Best Co., the
insurance rating agency, said the settlement would not have a major
financial effect on American General, which has assets of about
$110 billion, making it the nation's fourth-largest life insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to potential harm to sales, Mayewski said: ``There's
always some impact when you're in the news for something that is
not overly favorable. I think the organization has decided, right
or wrong, that the best thing to do is settle this and put it
behind them and move on.''

</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he was hopeful that other companies that followed
racially biased practices would settle rather than wage long,
drawn-out court battles.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said his Rainbow Coalition had been independently
reviewing the records of insurance companies during the days of
slavery and segregation. His group has reported that some companies
sold life insurance policies on slaves with the master as the
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   The two-tier pricing system, he said, ``is a concrete,
documented exploitation and violation and we now need a commitment
to heal the breach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he had a ``very good meeting'' with American
General executives at their headquarters in Houston after they
announced the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret we had a slavery system,'' he said. ``It's no
secret we had legally segregated society. The issue now is how in
some meaningful way to end the policy and to pay the people who
were exploited.'' &QL;

TEAMSTERS, WOOED BY GORE, FLIRT WITH ANOTHER SUITOR, NADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The labor movement's rocky relationship with the Gore campaign
takes a new turn Thursday when James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters
president, appears alongside Ralph Nader at a news conference and
is expected to shower praise on him.
</P>
<P>
   Teamster officials said Wednesday that Hoffa was not prepared to
endorse Nader for president but would urge that any presidential
debates include him and Pat Buchanan rather than being limited to
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
Democratic and Republican nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mathis, the Teamsters' political director, said the
union wanted the debates to include Nader, who seeks the Green
Party's nomination, and Buchanan, who wants to be the Reform
nominee, because they were likely to raise the issues the Teamsters
most care about: trade, globalization and their effect on the
American worker.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, the Hoffa-Nader appearance Thursday, in
Washington, will be a pointed reminder to Gore that large segments
of organized labor remain bitterly unhappy with him over his
support for the China trade deal, which cleared a huge hurdle with
passage in the House last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Clinton administration began pushing normalized
trade relations with China, Gore has been trying to placate labor
leaders and their rank and file, whose support is considered
crucial in November. But though he won the endorsement of the
AFL-CIO last fall, the Teamsters, with 1.4 million members, and the
United Automobile Workers, with 800,000, have so far withheld their
backing, largely because of their anger over the trade bill, which
the unions fear will speed an exodus of American manufacturing jobs
to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call to include Nader and Buchanan in a debate is all
about putting trade in the forefront,'' Mathis said. ``Part of the
idea behind the news conference is to highlight the fact that
Nader, and to some extent Buchanan, are the two presidential
candidates talking about these issues, and talking about them in a
way we agree with.''
</P>

   Nader is to give a speech to the Teamsters' executive board in
Washington Thursday, before the news conference. Teamster officials
are lavishing more praise on him than on Buchanan, noting that
unlike Buchanan, he has often complained that shortcomings in the
nation's labor laws make it too hard for workers to form unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Hoffa has been on the record that there's no way we would
support Buchanan,'' Mathis said. ``Nader is top to bottom much more
in tune with labor, and he has a history of supporting workers,
while Buchanan is somewhat of a Johnny-come-lately. It's not out of
the question for us to endorse Nader.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Teamsters, the autoworkers have expressed interest in
Nader's campaign. Last month, shortly before the House approved the
China trade bill, Stephen P. Yokich, the UAW president, announced
that his union would explore Nader and other alternatives to the
nominees of the two major parties. He denounced Gore and President
Clinton, saying they had ``once again sided with multinational
corporations against workers here and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, flew to Detroit to
have lunch with Yokich Wednesday, largely to discuss the
endorsement that the autoworkers have withheld from Gore, labor
officials said. Sweeney, one of Gore's most powerful backers, has
also been one of the most enthusiastic, saying that while labor
disagrees with the vice president over the China deal, they are
aligned on most issues.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore's efforts to mend fences with labor suffered a
setback last week when he named Commerce Secretary William M. Daley
chairman of his campaign. Many union leaders saw the appointment as
a slap in the face because Daley was the Clinton administration's
chief strategist in the Capitol Hill fight over the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Mitchell, the AFL-CIO's communications director,
acknowledged Wednesday that Nader's campaign was attracting labor
support. ``I hear a lot of people saying Nader has a very good
message,'' Mitchell said. ``But the practical matter is we have to
figure out how to elect a president who will stand up for workers
every day. No candidate's going to be perfect, and we don't have
the luxury of supporting a message candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yokich is facing considerable heat from within the UAW about the
reluctance to endorse Gore. Douglas Fraser, a former president of
the union, lashed out against Yokich's position in a speech last
week before an association representing thousands of retired union
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UAW should endorse Gore,'' Fraser said in an interview.
``The reason is there is no viable alternative. Nader is not an
alternative. Politics is not playing a game. Nader's done some
constructive things, but the simple fact is he has zero chance of
being elected president. The politics of the situation is every
vote Nader gets is a vote he takes away from Al Gore, not George
Bush. He shouldn't be playing around, because he has absolutely no
chance, no matter what his virtues are.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krell, the UAW's spokesman, said: ``We haven't closed the
door on Gore. We've just opened the door to Nader.''

necessitate some asset shedding, but Universal's key media and

 &HT;    Testimony focused on direction of bullets
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Bullet holes in the front door convinced him that
agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were the
aggressors in their Feb. 28, 1993 raid on Mount Carmel, Houston
attorney Dick DeGuerin testified Wednesday in the Branch Davidians'
wrongful-death lawsuit against the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the bullet holes I saw had smooth edges from bullets
coming from the outside,'' DeGuerin said.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin told the seven-member advisory jury and U.S. District
Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco that he entered Mount Carmel
seven years ago to try to get the Davidians to surrender and take
their chances in court. He was enlisted to represent David Koresh
by the Davidian leader's mother, Bonnie Haldeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a parallel interest I had, I thought, with the FBI,''
DeGuerin said.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin told Houston attorney Cynthia Chapman _ who is
assisting her husband, attorney Mike Caddell _ that Mount Carmel
had a pair of hollow-core steel front doors. Only the door on the
right had bullet holes, according to DeGuerin.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman poked a hole through paper to illustrate a bullet's
entry and exit patterns, causing the government to complain that
her object lesson wasn't legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think so?'' Smith asked. ``Overruled.''
</P>
<P>
   Government attorney James Touhey asked DeGuerin during his
cross-examination about DeGuerin's testimony before Congress in
1995. Then, DeGuerin said ``almost all'' the bullet holes in the
front door came from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lawyer's way of covering all your bases,'' DeGuerin
said. ``I don't know that every bullet hole in the door was from
the outside. I know all I saw or ran my hand over were from the
outside. It was a typical lawyer's wishy-washy way of talking.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin also told Touhey that Koresh reported sending all the
Davidian men to their rooms before the ATF raid and telling them,
``do not fire until I give the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposing attorneys each thought DeGuerin's testimony buttressed
their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a majority of the bullet holes came from the outside, it
indicates the ATF fired the first shot,'' Caddell said. ``Remember,
they said bullets erupted through the front door at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradford, government co-counsel, said DeGuerin's
testimony helped the government by showing that Koresh ``put people
in rooms to shoot, to start firing.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the $675 million lawsuit played a portion of
the 9-1-1 call by Wayne Martin, the late Waco attorney who was a
Davidian. Jurors intently followed the transcripts given them. The
tape captured the chaos that reigned as ATF agents and Davidians
shot it out, resulting in the deaths of four ATF agents and five
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Martin opened the call by blurting, ``There are men, 75 men
around our building shooting at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Larry Lynch of the McLennan County Sheriff's Department
responded, ``Mount Carmel?'' That prompted Martin to yell, ``Tell
them there are children and women in here and to call it off!''
</P>
<P>
   Periodic gunfire interrupted both men's efforts to work out a
cease-fire _ each side accusing the other of firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they attack us, we're going to fight to the last man,''
Martin promised.
</P>
<P>
   The government also played portions of the 9-1-1 tape, trying to
counter the plaintiffs' portrayal of the Davidians as the raid's
victims. One dealt with a conversation between Koresh and Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what we have,'' Koresh said. ``You don't know
what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll end up like this ATF, BATF,'' Koresh said. ``You guys,
you're going to get a big butt-whipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Koresh also told Lynch, ``We knew you were coming and
everything. You see we knew before you even knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs Wednesday also presented depositions from several
women at Mount Carmel. All of them said they were not warned about
the ATF raid and did not carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped deposition, Annetta Richards, who was 63 years
old at the time of the raid, said a bullet whistled through her
bedroom window ``within inches of my face. Then I got on my hands
and knees and crawled out into the hallway.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards said she saw the Wendel children hiding there. Their
mother, Jaydean, died in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid a bullet might hit the baby

   ATLANTA _ Replacing a ligament isn't as complicated as it
sounds. In fact, elbow ligament replacement surgery, known as
``Tommy John surgery,'' usually takes one to two hours to perform,
doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players make up 90 percent of those affected by elbow
injury, although golfers, football players and tennis players also
can be hurt. And serious tears usually require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was performed first on then-major-league pitcher,
Tommy John in 1974. John seemed was on his way to his best season
in 1974 with the L.A. Dodgers when he injured his pitching elbow.
Dr. Frank Jobe of Los Angeles performed the surgery that ended up
saving John's career. John sat out the 1975 season and returned to
the field in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is done primarily on pitchers, who after throwing
some 200 pitches a week can develop serious pain in their arms,
said Michael Rooks, a metro Atlanta orthopedic surgeon. The pain
can become so severe that it can keep a ball player from throwing.
</P>
<P>
   During elbow ligament replacement surgery, the physicians takes
a ligament from another part of the body _ typically the wrist,
foot, forearm or calf.
</P>
<P>
   Then they drill small holes in the elbow's bones and weave the
new ligament through the holes, according to Dr. William Ross, an
orthopedic surgeon at the Emory Clinic. The ligament is tied
tightly to form a triangle, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about a year for patients to recover from the surgery,
said Dr. Matthew Levy, orthopedic surgeon for St. Vincent's Charity
Hospital in Cleveland. ``However, some players have been pushing
the envelope,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Rooks said that pitchers usually need at least six months of
physical therapy after surgery, and it might take much longer for
them to regain their fastball.

NEW DOPING ACCUSATIONS CAST SHADOW AS THE OLYMPICS NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Sydney Summer Games less than three months away,
athletes and Olympic officials say that chaos and deficiencies in
drug testing threaten the credibility of any performance that
requires strength, endurance and speed.
</P>
<P>
   New anti-doping agencies have been created and new drug tests
may soon gain approval, but the Olympic movement is hounded by the
perception that its athletes are not clean and that its top
officials do not do enough to stop them. Fueling the speculation
are accusations by a former U.S. Olympic Committee official, a
flurry of swimming world records that other athletes view
suspiciously and inconsistency in policies among sports federations
and individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest furor, the former head of the USOC's drug-testing
program has claimed that in recent years half of the U.S. athletes
who have tested positive for banned substances have not been
punished. Wade Exum, who made that accusation through his lawyer on
Tuesday, asserted in a letter dated June 5 that the USOC was
``deliberately encouraging the doping of athletes without
considering the consequences to their health.''
</P>
<P>
   The USOC has denied the accusations, portraying Exum as a
disgruntled employee whose job had been in jeopardy because of the
creation of an independent drug-testing agency.
</P>
<P>
   But many athletes may not care whether Exum's charges are true.
Many of them have long questioned the determination of the USOC to
root out the problem of drugs. In part to allay these suspicions,
the USOC will shift to independent testing after Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Holman, America's premier miler, is a vocal anti-drug
advocate who has proposed regular, volunteer drug testing among
athletes. ``It's depressing,'' he said. ``This is going to give
more people confirmation that sport is dirty. It wasn't like it was
a revelation. It merely confirmed what I was thinking all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion and inconsistency exist on many levels. Three of the
28 international Olympic sports federations, for tennis, cycling
and soccer, have not agreed to uniform punishments for doping
offenses. And only three federations, for archery, swimming and
weight lifting, have fully agreed so far to out-of-competition drug
tests to be conducted by the newly established World Anti-Doping
Agency before the Sydney Games. Unannounced, out-of-competition
testing is considered the only reliable way to catch cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some high-profile track and field athletes who tested
positive for banned substances have gone unpunished by their own
countries. Cuba has refused to suspend the world record-holder in
the high jump, Javier Sotomayor, even though he tested positive for
cocaine last summer at the Pan American Games. Jamaica, too, has
cleared the sprint star Merlene Ottey, even though she tested
positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet last July. However,
their participation in Sydney remains in doubt. Both have appealed
suspensions by track and field's world governing body. A decision
is expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some important steps have been taken to increase the reliability
and credibility of drug testing at the Sydney Games. Four hundred
out-of-competition tests will be taken in Sydney before the Games
even begin, and independent observers will monitor the testing to
lessen long-held international suspicions that positive tests were
often covered up.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the chance that a test will be approved for Sydney
for the detection of a synthetic version of the hormone EPO, which
increases oxygen-carrying capacity and is believed to be widely
used in track and field and cycling. The board of directors of the
Tour de France is expected to announce Thursday or Friday whether a
French-developed test will be used in this year's race.
</P>
<P>
   However, the International Olympic Committee is insisting on
further scientific replication of the test. Dr. Patrick Schamasch,
the IOC's medical director, said in an interview Friday that it was
``50-50'' whether an EPO test would be approved for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Holman said the history of foot-dragging by the IOC led him to
believe that no test for EPO would be in place for Sydney. ``I can
almost hear the excuses,'' the miler said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more optimistic, like Rob Housman, assistant director
of strategic planning for the White House drug policy office, which
has been forcefully pushing for more reliable drug testing in
Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a new reality in Sydney,'' Housman said. ``We
will likely have an EPO test, or close to one. Any athlete who is
thinking about cheating has to think that if he does, he might get
caught. Managing the tests and the results will be aboveboard and
above reproach. We'll have greater confidence from athletes and the
public that results are not being tampered with and that people who
are caught will be punished and their medals stripped.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Shorter, gold medalist in the men's marathon in 1972 and
chairman of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which will begin operating
independently of the USOC after the Sydney Games, said he was
confident that international governmental pressure on the IOC would
result in an EPO test for the 2000 Summer Games. Innocent athletes
deserve to be protected by tests for substances like EPO and human
growth hormone, he said. If the tests are not ready for Sydney,
Shorter said, ``That says that every performance in these Games
involving endurance and strength is suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism is already roiling around a Dutch swimmer, Inge
-de Bruijn, who has tied or broken seven world records since late
May. Suspicions have been particularly aroused by her record of
56.69 seconds in the 100-meter butterfly, a stunning 1.19 seconds
below the world record formerly held by the American Jenny Thompson
in a race where standards are usually set by hundredths of a
second.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This follows the 1996 Atlanta Games, where the swimming was
marred by suspicions that an Irish swimmer, Michelle Smith -de
Bruin, used performance-enhancing drugs to win her three gold
medals. She later was suspended for four years for manipulating a
urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   Don Talbot, coach of the Australian swim team, told reporters in
Australia: ``It's an unfortunate fact of life now that anybody that
swims fast, makes big improvements, immediately comes under
suspicion. It's really sad, because good athletes should be able to
glory in their wins and not be criticized for them.''
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn has said that her improvements had come by ``training
like an animal,'' not through performance-enhancing drugs. Her
supporters believe that her neck-to-toe bodysuits can increase
speeds significantly. Paul Bergen, the respected American coach who
works with de Bruijn in Portland, Ore., said that some of the
reflexive skepticism about swimmers ``is out of legitimate concern,
but now it's almost gotten to the point of sour grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone to suspect that I would be coaching using the
method of cheating bothers me,'' Bergen said. ``But it's almost
like the more you say she's clean as a whistle, the more you keep
drumming up controversy. We'll take her training to Sydney and see
who wins and loses. They can do all the pre-complaining they want.
She made a major lifestyle change coming to this country, killing
herself in the weight room, changing her stroke, giving up her
family and boyfriend to do this for two and a half years. But it's
almost like, `oh, she cheated,' instead of recognizing her hard
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of drug testing in the United States has
received a severe blow in the wake of the accusations made by Exum,
the USOC's former drug chief. He said in an interview that he could
not be more specific in his charges of drug-testing deficiencies,
on advice of lawyers, and that he was contemplating filing a
lawsuit against the USOC. One of the few black administrators on
the Olympic committee, he has also charged the group with racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Blackmun, the senior managing director of sports resources
for the USOC and Exum's former boss, said Exum had made similar
allegations internally but an investigation by outside counsel had
shown the charges to be unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I categorically deny the proposition that the USOC has done
anything to assist athletes in doping,'' Blackmun said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, USOC officials concede that the national governing
bodies of various sports, which actually mete out punishment for
doping offenses, have not always vigorously prosecuted positive
tests. But Blackmun said he had seen no evidence to suggest that
half of Americans who tested positive for drugs in recent years
went unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain open to discussing any alleged improprieties,''
Blackmun said. ``But despite numerous requests, all he's willing to
provide are vague generalities.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other concrete issues to address. Even if an EPO test
is approved, scientists and drug officials admit, tests for other
performance-enhancing substances believed to be widely used, such
as human growth hormone, insulin growth factor and sophisticated
steroid creams and gels that can be flushed from the body in 24 to
48 hours, will not be available in Sydney, thus minimizing the
credibility of all clean tests.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding EPO, the French test, which uses a urine sample, can
detect the use of the synthetic hormone for only three days,
Schamasch said. Australian scientists have designed a blood test to
detect long-term use, but it provides only an indirect indication
of EPO and is legally less reliable. If approved, both methods
could be used as screenings in 300 EPO tests before and during the
Sydney Games, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter said the IOC should employ the EPO test in Sydney to put
athletes who intend to cheat at a psychological disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Tour de France is willing to stake its reputation and
risk legal challenges, the IOC should do the same thing,'' Shorter
said. If the I.O.C. does not show a good-faith effort to employ the
tests, he said, the Australian government should nationalize drug
testing and take it out of the IOC's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Housman of the White House drug policy office worried about the
future of the Olympics. ``There is something beautiful and
wonderful about the Olympic Games,'' he said. ``Almost all the
nations come together in peace and compete honorably. If it doesn't
mean anything anymore, if it's not the athlete but his pharmacist
competing, why watch it?''  &QL;

WEST CALLS THIS TITLE THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is early Wednesday morning, and I call an old
friend, Jerry West, mastermind of the Los Angeles Lakers' world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you feel?'' I wonder.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause.
</P>
<P>
   As you might know, Jerry West has in recent days become the
Howard Hughes of the Lakers, a reclusive figure who failed to make
an appearance at any of their games in the NBA Finals against the
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are a lot of things to feel good about,''
says West finally. ``And there are some things I feel bad about
that have nothing to do with basketball that I don't care to
discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no one not Jerry Buss, not Phil Jackson, not Shaquille
O'Neal, not Kobe Bryant, not anyone who takes the goings-on with
the Lakers any more seriously, or stressfully, than West.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he has even admitted that physicians have advised him
that it isn't conducive to good health for him to watch Laker
playoff games, a recommendation he has ignored on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't Monday evening, and he relates he had no idea that
the team he built had won the seventh world title in its L.A.
history until he received a phone call from a friend who informed
him of such a development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say this was the best one,'' says West when I ask
him where this NBA title rates with the others he's been involved
in with the Lakers one as a player and six as an executive across
the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when the playoffs came, we were expected to win. And
anything less would have resulted in widespread criticism for a lot
of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was tremendous pressure on this team to win. I thought
from the start we had the best team, but the best team doesn't
always win in the NBA. You never know for sure what will happen.
Injuries can hurt you, and we certainly were hurt when Kobe Bryant
sprained his ankle and missed a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West lives in Bel Air with his wife and two sons.
</P>
<P>
   He earns $4 million a year from Buss, and has three more years
remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   He has a secure legacy in his sport both as a Hall of Fame
player it is his likeness that appears on the NBA logo and as a
general manager with a keen eye for personnel and a deft
understanding of team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   In the madhouse that was the Laker locker room after their
title-clinching 116-111 win over the Pacers, Jerry Buss made it a
point to pay tribute to Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have never happened without Jerry West,'' said the
Lakers owner, over and over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   And he's right, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But all the glowing tributes make Jerry West uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers to stay quietly in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   He detests attention.
</P>
<P>
   He constantly implores me not to mention the vital impact he's
had on the Lakers, the fact he had the courage to put his
reputation on the line at the NBA Draft in June of 1996 when he
traded a proven commodity, Vlade Divac, to Charlotte for a
17-year-old high school senior named Kobe Bryant, the fact he
coaxed Shaquille O'Neal to sign with the Lakers at a time when
O'Neal was seriously leaning toward re-upping with the Orlando
Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see the way Shaq and Kobe have developed into two
of the most incredible players in the league,'' says West. ``How
good can Kobe get? Oh, Lord! Remember, he's only 21, and learning
all the time. And he wants to get better. That's the good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so does Shaq. I honestly think Shaq is going to get a lot
better. I know he's not that far away from becoming a better
free-throw shooter. He'll reach that point. I think before he's
through he has a chance to become the greatest center who ever
played the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't think some people realize how good Shaq is.
Not only does he have great athletic talent, but he's such a great
competitor. He's like your worst nightmare if you're an opposing
player. He's not only very big, but he's also very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West has been a sacred part of the Los Angeles scene since
he joined the Lakers as a rookie out of West Virginia in 1960, the
year the team moved here from Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   He has grown fond of the area, and has developed a bond with
followers of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't measure how good it makes me feel to see the
enormous community pride that has grown around the Lakers,'' says
West. ``I remember when I first played here, and we often had
crowds of three or four thousand. And now everyone seems to have
warmly embraced the Lakers. This is a special time in Southern
California. We've waited a long time for a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   It was too long for Jerry West, who admits the Lakers'
frustrations of recent seasons have taken their toll on him.
</P>
<P>
   He should now be rejoicing in the Lakers' epic achievement and
he is but there is a restraint in his gladness that leaves one
concerned.

ACCUSATIONS GROW THAT MOSCOW SPIES ON PRO-DEMOCRACY PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Against a backdrop of legal assaults on tycoons,
harassment of free-thinking journalists and a general tightening of
the state grip on things, Russia's leading pro-democracy political
party now says federal intelligence agents are spying on it.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security
Service, has yet to comment on the accusation, posted on the Web
site of Russia's Yabloko Party (www.yabloko.ru) and echoed in a
scathing letter from Yabloko's iconoclastic leader, the federal
legislator Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the charge gained weight this week when two St. Petersburg
students who are Yabloko members claimed that federal agents tried
to recruit them as political spies _ and, when the two refused,
engineered their ejection from St. Petersburg's Baltic State
Technical University.
</P>
<P>
   The two students, both 20, were conditionally reinstated this
week after their complaints became public. The university rector,
Yuri P. Savelky, asserted in an interview Wednesday that the entire
affair was an innocent misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   But Yavlinsky disagreed, noting that one student said the agents
asked him about Yabloko's financing and his own ties to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating an atmosphere of surveillance and blackmail will lead
to enormous losses for our country,'' Yavlinsky wrote in a letter,
made public, to Nikolai Patrushev, the chairman of the security
service, known everywhere as the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore that, Yabloko and a new pro-democracy party,
the Union of Right Forces, announced a quasi-merger Wednesday, a
move aimed at strengthening Russian political support for a ``civil
society.''
</P>
<P>
   The term, almost a mantra in Russian politics these days,
connotes a land in which there is common agreement that everyone
has to play by and obey the same rules. Putin has been an ardent
advocate of such a society, even as he has been roundly accused of
subverting its most basic principles in places like Chechnya or
with the skirmishing over media freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   But as is true about much of what is unfolding in Russia these
days, it is not at all clear whether Putin himself approved of or
even knew about the security service's work.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that various arms of the Russian government
have heightened their scrutiny of potentially disruptive figures _
from Yabloko to the independent press tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky _ in
ways that evoke unpleasant memories of Soviet repression.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Putin is the mastermind of these forays _ or is
fighting a rear-guard action against them _ no one outside the
Kremlin appears to know.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, two 20-year-old students at Baltic State's
aircraft and rocketry department, Dmitri Barkovsky and Konstantin
Suzdal, claimed that they were approached in late May by two agents
from the security service who asked questions about their studies,
then gravitated to their political work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started asking me about the structure of the Yabloko
party and about different ways of financing Yabloko's election
campaigns,'' Barkovsky, a fourth-year student at the university,
said in an interview Wednesday. ``I tried not to respond to their
questions, but they started threatening me.''
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper reports, the FSB agents said Yabloko was
spying for foreign powers and appeared to have more money at its
disposal than might be expected of an independent political
faction.
</P>
<P>
   Barkovsky, who calls himself an ardent Yabloko activist, later
wrote a letter of protest to Patrushev, the security service's
chairman, calling the pressure ``persecution of my family for
public expression of my political views.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after the meeting with security service officials on May
31, Barkovsky was barred from taking his exams at the university,
and was shortly expelled. Suzdal, who could not be reached, also
was removed from classes.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation Wednesday, the university rector, Savelky,
said both students had missed their final exams without explanation
and had been failing classes because their political activity
interfered with their studies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, he said, FSB agents had met with Barkovsky last
month as part of a continuing effort to recruit ``smart and
well-educated students'' to their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably had some problems and misunderstood each
other,'' he said, ``because as far as I know, there was a big
scandal at the St. Petersburg FSB office, and they are going to
fire the officer who talked with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the St. Petersburg nor the Moscow FSB spokesmen would
comment Wednesday on any aspect of the controversy.

ENERGY SECRETARY FACES TOUGH QUESTIONS ON LOS ALAMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for rewriting throughout; change in byline; story grows by
about 80 words)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson weathered a
bipartisan storm of criticism Wednesday over his handling of the
latest security breach at Los Alamos National Laboratory, even as
he assured Congress that investigators now believed that the
mysterious case of nuclear lost and found at the laboratory was not
a result of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson told a Senate hearing that the FBI had determined
that the two computer hard drives that were found last Friday
behind a copying machine inside the laboratory were the same
devices containing nuclear weapons data that had been missing from
a Los Alamos vault.
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials said the FBI, which is working with a
grand jury conducting a criminal investigation of the security
lapse, had recovered fingerprints from the outer wrapping of the
drives and from the area where they were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The two hard drives contained data on U.S. and foreign nuclear
weapons and were intended for use by the government's Nuclear
Emergency Search Team, a sort of SWAT team responsible for
disarming nuclear weapons in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The drives, stored in locked kits inside a vault in the
laboratory's X Division, which designs nuclear weapons, may have
disappeared as early as March 28, officials said Wednesday. But
their loss was not reported to the laboratory's director until May
31.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which was notified June 1 about the hard drives'
disappearance, is now focusing on a handful of the 26 employees who
had unrestricted access to the vault where the drives were stored.
Three people have already flunked FBI polygraphs and have given
contradictory answers about their knowledge of the hard drives,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI does not believe the hard drives were ever moved out of
the X Division, officials added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that the FBI has authenticated'' the drives,
Richardson said Wednesday. ``I am pleased, too, that it appears
that they did not leave the X Division,'' he said. ``I am pleased
that there does not appear to be espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was very little about Wednesday that was pleasing
to Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee
Wednesday morning quickly turned into a grilling. Lawmakers were
incredulous when Los Alamos and Energy Department officials,
testifying along with Richardson, said that there were no rules
preventing certain laboratory employees from signing the hard
drives out or from walking out with the hard drives. Officials said
the rules were being quickly changed for the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet officials also acknowledged that because the hard drives
were classified secret, rather than top secret, they could be sent
by regular mail to another government building.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of sending secret material through the mail led to
another security incident at the Energy Department about eight
months ago, officials said Wednesday, but they refused to describe
it in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was assailed by lawmakers of both parties Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans renewed their calls for Richardson to resign,
one of the most senior Democratic senators said the energy
secretary had shown contempt toward Congress by failing to appear
at a Senate hearing last week to explain the disappearance of the
hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in this Congress a long time, 48 years, and I have
voted upon several occasions for resolutions providing for contempt
of Congress,'' said the lawmaker, Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia. ``And I wouldn't have any hesitancy about voting for such
a resolution concerning you.''

POLITICAL MEMO: SOCIAL SECURITY, THAT RISKY ISSUE, IS ON THE
TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore stopped here Wednesday
to talk about Social Security, and used charts and statistics to
lead a friendly audience to a predictable conclusion: that his
approach to retirement security was more prudent and a better deal
than the plan advocated by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What may be more surprising, given the issue's long history of
political sensitivity, is that Social Security is being debated at
all.
</P>
<P>
   There are risks for both parties. It is still not clear that
Bush's decision to push for private investment accounts within
Social Security, the biggest change in the retirement program since
its inception, will not blow up in his face, as some Democrats have
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear either that deriding Bush's plan will help
Gore turn out older voters who could tip the scales in swing
states, or that he can avoid seeming out of step with younger
voters for whom stock investing is an opportunity rather than a
``risky scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   The rival presidential campaigns have largely avoided discussing
any of the potentially painful measures that might have to be taken
to ensure that Social Security remains solvent as the population
ages. Bush has focused instead on the rewards of investing, while
Gore has stressed that the fast-growing federal budget surplus
makes it possible to add new retirement benefits inside and outside
of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But Social Security is squarely on the agenda for the
presidential race, even if the two campaigns have not fully
determined the political calculus that surrounds it.
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone else, it was President Clinton who put the
issue on the table by calling two years ago for a national debate
on it. His effort did not find any bipartisan common ground, in
part because Republicans feared that he was leading them into a
trap where any proposals they made would be subject to demagoguery
by Democrats. But the debate inspired by his involvement helped
educate voters about some of the options, including individual
investment accounts. Because of the stock market boom, voters
proved more intrigued by the idea than some Democrats had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem for the campaigns is that voters do not seem
to have fully sorted out where they stand. A New York Times poll
last month found that 47 percent of voters felt Gore would do a
better job of dealing with Social Security, compared with 39
percent for Bush. But when asked about private investment accounts,
the centerpiece of Bush's plan, 51 percent said it was a good idea
and 45 percent said it was a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   The differences of opinion are most marked across generational
lines. Among 30-to-44-year-olds, Bush's personal accounts plan was
favored by 66 percent and opposed by 30 percent. Among people 65
and over, 27 percent favored private accounts, and 67 percent
thought they were a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in recognition of the appeal of investing to younger
people, Gore rolled out a proposal this week to create savings and
investment accounts outside of the Social Security system. The plan
calls for the government to match deposits on a sliding scale, with
most of the government subsidies going to low- and middle-income
people.
</P>
<P>
   In making the proposal, Gore sought to reframe the debate as
being not over whether investing amounts to casino economics, which
he had occasionally seemed to suggest, but over whether it has a
place within Social Security, a program built on a guaranteed
government benefit unaffected by the ups and downs of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that Gore's scare-tactic approach played very
well,'' said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord
Coalition, a fiscal policy research organization. ``I'm being
hopeful here, but maybe the climate has changed enough that you can
have a substantive debate on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has seemed intent in the last two days on addressing the
issue not so much along generational lines as along class lines.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see Bush's Social Security proposal as a way to
cement their party's appeal to what they view as an emerging
investor class, made up of people across income levels who have
grown comfortable making choices about how to handle their money.
Gore, by contrast, is increasingly pitching his proposal at working
people struggling to take advantage of the good economy, and is
implicitly casting Bush's approach to Social Security and economic
policy as one designed for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put an end to the days when savings are a scramble,
if not an unaffordable luxury,'' Gore said before leaving Des
Moines for Minnesota and a meeting with Gov. Jesse Ventura, whose
popularity with independent voters has led the Gore camp to
cultivate him throughout the campaign. ``This is the choice in this
election: Are you for working people?'' Gore asked the crowd of
supporters at a carpenters union hall here.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of how the wealth amassed by many people
in the last decade is upsetting traditional political calculations,
Gore also set out his own plan Wednesday for reducing the federal
estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had long opposed reductions in the estate tax as a
giveaway to the rich. But 65 Democrats joined the Republican
majority in the House to pass legislation earlier this month to
repeal the tax, and the party has found itself on the defensive
over the issue. Democrats, including Gore, have become increasingly
sensitive to pressure from farmers and small-business owners, who
say the tax endangers their ability to pass their holdings along to
another generation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, which his campaign said would cost $7 billion over
10 years, is similar to a plan backed by House Democratic leaders
and would focus its benefits on family farms and small businesses.
Rather than repealing the tax entirely, as the House Republican
bill would do, Gore's plan would increase the value of a farm or
small business that would be exempt from estate taxation. With some
minimal estate planning, a married couple running a farm or
business could eventually exempt $5 million of their estate under
Gore's plan; such planning currently allows the couple an exemption
of $2.6 million.

NORTH KOREA'S MISSILE PLEDGE PAVES THE WAY FOR NEW TALKS
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ North Korea has reaffirmed its pledge to the United
States to stop flight-testing its long-range missile, paving the
way for talks very soon with the Clinton administration on further
curbs on the missile program, a senior administration official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean announcement came after the administration
lifted some economic sanctions on Monday and was welcomed as a
``positive statement of their commitment,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But the North Korean pledge did not alter the administration's
resolve to move ahead with its missile defense program, which has
been largely justified on the assumption that North Korea could
have the ability to hit the United States with nuclear or
chemical-tipped ballistic missiles by 2005, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight-testing is only one element of North Korea's missile
development and such concerns as engine-testing and improving
launching sites by the North Koreans will be addressed in the
coming talks, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking en route to China with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, the official said that in return for the reaffirmation,
announced in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Wednesday, the
United States would announce specific dates for the resumption of
talks between North Korea and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   These talks could begin as soon as the end of the month,
officials said. The first round of talks took place in March last
year in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming session, the United States will deal with North
Korea's ``development, deployment, testing and export of
missiles,'' as well as the country's nuclear program, the senior
official said. One goal of the talks is to seek ``verification'' of
North Korean pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Since the summit meeting of North and South Korean leaders last
week, Pentagon officials have emphasized that although North Korea
agreed last fall to suspend the testing of the Taepodong 1 missile
it fired over Japan in 1998 _ a suspension it reaffirmed on
Wednesday _ the North Korean military has not suspended development
of a new generation of missiles known as the Taepodong 2.
</P>
<P>
   A national intelligence estimate last year concluded that by
2005 North Korea could complete development of the Taepodong 2, a
missile capable of reaching the United States with a nuclear
warhead.
</P>
<P>
   A new estimate is being prepared for President Clinton,
officials said last week, and is expected to reach similar
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   As Albright landed here to meet with Chinese leaders on a range
of issues, her aides sought to walk a fine line between lauding the
outcome of the landmark summit meeting between the two Koreas last
week and keeping a lid on what Washington sees as misplaced
euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were also anxious to make clear that the United
States had its own lines of communication with North Korea,
separate and apart from what went on at the summit meeting in
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the senior official, who briefed reporters on Albright's
plane, said that Wednesday's statement reaffirming the moratorium
of flight tests was part of a choreographed script worked out
between the United States and North Korea at talks in Rome at the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement there, the official said, was that Clinton would
formalize the easing of sanctions, the North Koreans would
reconfirm their moratorium, and then the United States would move
ahead with the dates of the missile talks.
</P>
<P>
   Behind these steps lies the overall strategy worked out by
Clinton's special envoy to North Korea, former Defense Secretary
William Perry. That strategy revolves around a finely tuned series
of moves to lift sanctions as North Korea begins to freeze its
nuclear arsenal and end sales of missile technology to countries
Washington suspects of sponsoring terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But the three days of amiability at the Korean summit meeting
surprised the administration and left officials faced with
uncomfortable diplomatic pressure to ease up on its missile defense
program just as the U.S. presidential election is about to get
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Washington's NATO allies have questioned whether the
North Korean missile threat was serious enough to deploy a missile
defense shield that antagonizes Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the administration's unchanged position on North Korea's
missile capacity, Albright's aides said they noted that the tone of
the statement from Pyongyang was more generous than in the past.
For example, the senior official said that the statement used the
firmer word ``moratorium'' rather than ``suspension,'' which was
used by the North Koreans last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said that the easing of sanctions would have
``a positive effect'' on plans for a senior North Korean official
to visit the United States for talks with the administration. Such
a meeting has been broached for some time but has yet to take
place.
</P>
<P>
   The statement concluded with an appeal to the United States to
honor North Korea's sovereignty and improve bilateral relations so
that North Korea could then ``work to clear the United States of
its worries.'' Asked what this phrase meant, a State Department
official said, ``It's nice, but we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   After her quick visit to China, which is scheduled to last less
than 36 hours, Albright will fly to Seoul to learn firsthand
details of the summit meeting from South Korea's president, Kim Dae
Jung.

 GREEKS RALLY TO KEEP rELIGIONS ON ID CARDS  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ Thousands of Greek Orthodox clerics and
followers flooded the center of this capital Wednesday to demand
that the government retract its decision to remove religious
affiliations from citizens' identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying Greek flags and crucifixes and chanting, ``Greece is
Orthodoxy,'' they cheered as as the head of the Greek Orthodox
Church defended the faith as indivisibly bound with the country's
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resist, my dear Christians,'' the church leader, Archbishop
Christodoulos, said he as offered 90 minutes of anti-government
jabs. ``The forces of globalization and religious marginalization
are out to get us.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest follows a call last month by Prime Minister Costas
Simitis' Socialist government to enact a privacy code that bars
citizens from declaring details of their faiths, occupations,
family status and thumbprints for identity cards. The government
says it wants to help protect religious minorities' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The church, which sees itself as a guardian of Greek tradition
and the move as an assault on the Orthodox Christian character of
Greece, has said the affiliations on the cards should be optional
and has called for a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   As teams of priests and nuns directed crowds of followers _
organizers put the number at 800,000 while the police gave
estimates of 130,000 to 200,000 _ the archbishop chided the
political leadership. ``You should invite us, not shun us, for
discussion,'' he said. ``What are you afraid of?''
</P>
<P>
   Greek Orthodox clerics contend that Simitis' decision was part
of a bid to appear ``more European'' ahead of the European Union
endorsement on Tuesday of Greece's entry into the group.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Christodoulos responded to the decision on the
identity cards by denouncing Simitis as a dictator and calling his
decision a coup d'etat, arguing that the clergy endorsed his
re-election in April on the condition that he would consult with
the religious leadership before pressing his change for the
identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious,'' a close aide to the prelate, Metropolitan
Prokopios, said, ``that the identity-card issue is just the start
of a storm of reforms, ultimately leading to what the Socialists
have long sought, a divorce from the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar though smaller protests rattled the country 13 years ago
as Andreas Papandreou moved, but later stopped, plans to seize
control of church property, including prime real estate that the
present government is eyeing to build a lavish resort, ahead of the
2004 Olympics here.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll in a daily here, Eleftherotypia, found that 46.1
percent of those surveyed opposed Simitis' effort to ban religious
affiliations from identity cards and that 40 percent supported it.

GET A ROPE! SOMEBODY'S NABBED THE DUKE!

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Get a rope!
</P>
<P>
   In a crime that strikes at the soul of Fort Worth and Texas,
outlaws have stolen John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   When last seen, Wayne's portrait was in its exalted position
overlooking a dining-room corner at Angelo's Barbecue, the
definitive Fort Worth barbecue-and-beer hall for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a daring midevening heist last Thursday, three young
desperadoes snatched the Duke off the back wall and Duke-napped him
out the front door _ all before a disbelieving and slow-reacting
happy-hour crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dadgummit!'' said an angry Skeet George, 49, son of the
restaurant's founder, Angelo George. ``Somebody's got to be pretty
durned low to take John Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Great Angelo's Caper. About 9 o'clock, just as the
usual Thursday crowd was nearing critical mass, a young woman and
two tattooed young men in baggy clothes stood huddling around
something in the restaurant's back corner.
</P>
<P>
   The woman and one of the men then rushed out the door, squeezing
something tightly between them with the second man close behind. By
the time nearby customers noticed the sudden absence of Big John,
they ran outside to see only a light-colored Infiniti sedan
speeding away in a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   With the dining room full of witnesses, not one shouted, ``Hold
it, pilgrims!''
</P>
<P>
   They proved no more helpful than the stuffed bear at Angelo's
front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what gets me,'' George said. ``They all saw it. But
they just kept on drinking beer. Nobody wanted to get up or get
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   With a laugh, he added, ``Heck, I'd have given them all another
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   The portrait rustlers now lead the list of Cowtown's Most
Wanted. If caught, they should be tied up and forced to eat
chain-restaurant barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   If I were Skeet George, I'd be watching eBay.
</P>
<P>
   He's offering a reward: ``It'd be worth a few rib dinners to get
it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The oval, lacquered Wayne portrait was given to the Georges in
the early 1980s by a regular customer from Oklahoma, Skeet George
said.
</P>
<P>
   He does not describe it as a likely target for art thieves.
``It's just a big drawing, mounted on wood,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's worth much. Somebody just wanted a real
cheap Father's Day present.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wayne portrait is not the first artifact lifted from
Angelo's dining room, which is lined with hunting trophies, fishing
keepsakes and such informative signs as, ``It's easier to SHOW your
I.D. than for ME to get out of JAIL.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a giant buffalo's head vanished from a post high over
the dining room. A few weeks later, an anonymous call sent the
Georges searching miles away in Haltom City, a Fort Worth suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was out back behind a garage,'' Skeet George said.
``Somebody felt guilty. Either that, or they just didn't have
anyplace to hide a buffalo head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dukenapping is the latest in a series of jolts to tradition
at Angelo's, a barbecue hall immortalized in travel guides, author
Dan Jenkins' novels and ``Texas Monthly'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   First, after 30-plus years of relying on ceiling fans and
ice-cold beer for summer cooling, the restaurant relented and added
air conditioning. Then, to meet 1990s appetites, Angelo's began
smoking chickens and turkeys to go with its barbecued beef brisket
and pork ribs. The serve-yourself drink cooler now offers several
flavors of Diet Snapple.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1993 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition,
medalist Simone Pedroni of Novara, Italy, was quoted rhapsodizing
about Angelo's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italian food is Rossini,'' he said, naming the Italian opera
composer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angelo's is John Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wayne is gone.
</P>
<P>
   So is a little bit of Texas.

 &HT;    Texan hopes to be first from state to make a U.S. Olympic
wrestling team
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Olympic wrestling trials begin this week in
Dallas, a city historically better suited to hosting pro rasslin'
than big-time freestyle and Greco-Roman competition. Yet, there
figures to be one wrestler there who'll be cheered like he's a lost
member of the Von Erich clan _ Brandon Slay.
</P>
<P>
   The Amarillo native, seeded No. 1 in the 167-pound freestyle
competition, aims to become the first born-and-bred Texan to make
the U.S. Olympic wrestling team. If he can do that, he should have
a serious shot at winning a medal, even the gold, at the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to be an Olympic champion. If I'm going to the
Olympics, I'm not going just so I can be there,'' Slay said earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas turns out Olympic wrestlers about as often as Nebraska
grows a great surfer or Mississippi churns out a champion ice
skater. It's not climate so much as history that's to blame for
Texas' shortfall on the mat. Most people have long since forgotten
it, but there once was a time, before World War I, when the
University of Texas not only had a wrestling team, it was one good
enough to whip Oklahoma State, then known as Oklahoma A&AMP;M. But when
Oklahoma left the old Southwest Conference in 1920 and Oklahoma A&AMP;M
followed in 1925, wrestling dried up in the SWC.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas high schools, the sport was an orphan. The University
Interscholastic League didn't sanction it until two years ago.
Until then, the sport found only a few spots where it gained a
measure of acceptance, including some suburbs of Dallas and in
Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Slay was six years old when his father, Doug, a former wrestler
for the University of Alabama, took him to the local YMCA for some
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year was really rough,'' Slay recalled. ``I never
won a match. The first match I finally won it was because the guy
didn't show up. I came home angry, hurting and I thought about not
going back, but I kept going back. Maybe it was because I set small
goals and continued to add to them. I wanted to be the best in the
city. Then, the best in the area. Then, the best in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A real boost for Slay came in 1990 when, as a 15-year-old, he
won the 182-pound weight class in Greco-Roman wrestling and made
the cadet national team. He finished third in the cadet-level world
championships in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   Making international level teams exposed him to some top
coaches, and if you're going to be a wrestler in Texas, Amarillo is
as good a spot as any.
</P>
<P>
   Slay said, ``Texas is so big as a state. We'd go to other
states. Oklahoma is three hours away. In high school we went to
Oklahoma City, Santa Fe, N.M., and Liberal, Kan., for
tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   FAR AWAY FROM HOME
</P>
<P>
   At Amarillo, Tascosa won three state titles and became one of
the nation's top recruits in his weight class. Yet, wrestling in
college was not a no-brainer decision.
</P>
<P>
   Slay said, ``A lot of people thought I was a better football
player than wrestler. They have a Super Team, from New Mexico,
Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. I was Super Team player of the
year. Zach Thomas had won it the year before. It was real tough to
make a decision. I was thinking about being a blocking fullback or
a middle linebacker in college. But I had the chance to be the best
in wrestling rather than just another good football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Slay was noticed as far away as the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good competitive spirt. He was very committed and he
was working on his skills year-round,'' said Roger Reina, Penn's
wrestling coach. ``It was a good fit between what he wanted to do
and what we offered.''
</P>
<P>
   Slay chose Penn as much for its noted undergraduate business
school, the Wharton School, as for its wrestling program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus is beautiful. When you're on it, you're in awe of
the historic beauty. But three or four blocks away is one of the
worst areas of Philadelphia,'' Slay said. ``That was an eye opener.
I was born and raised in a conservative town and went from there to
the fifth-largest city in the U.S. Traffic was horrible. People
were everywhere. I was 30 hours from home. My folks weren't getting
a chance to see me wrestle, or even see me. Going from public high
school in Texas to the Ivy League was a big change. I was the only
Texan in my hall. Ninety-eight percent of the people I hung around
with weren't like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Slay had to learn some lessons they weren't teaching in the
ivy-covered halls.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I'd always trusted everybody unless they gave me a
reason not to. But you can't trust everyone. You've got to watch
your back, take care of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was his accent. Vowels could stretch out as long as
the Texas plains. Friends chuckled when he asked for iiice tea,
whiiite riiice or a Spriiite.
</P>
<P>
   ``My accent and my mind-set changed,'' Slay said. ``I'm still
extremely proud to be a Texan, but going to Penn opened my eyes to
different cultures, to diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   AIMING FOR SYDNEY
</P>
<P>
   At Penn, Slay twice reached the NCAA finals at 167 pounds and
earned a dual degree in management and finance. He was, however,
ready for a change of scenery. He moved to the Olympic training
center in Colorado Springs and has been training for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to get out of Philadelphia. Now I can drive
downtown and park for a quarter. I don't have to stand in long
lines,'' Slay said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest obstacles to making the team is Joe Williams,
a former University of Iowa star. Heading into this year Slay had
never beaten Williams. But Reina said, ``He has a track record of
beating opponents that had beaten him in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   This April, at the National Open, Slay upset Williams 5-3.
Because of that Slay gets to sit out of the trials competition
until Saturday, after the winner of a mini-tournament for Williams
and others in his weight class has been determined. Then, Slay and
the winner of the mini-tournament will wrestle best
two-out-of-three to see who represents the U.S. in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge advantage,'' Slay said. ``The other guys have four
matches to wrestle. The winner could be injured or tired.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Slay should have a huge home-mat advantage because
he'll be the only Texan for the Reunion Arena crowd to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it makes a huge difference in the popularity here,''
Slay said of the trials. ``Texas has one of the best crop of
athletes. I believe Texas can compete with any other state. We're
known for football and we're amazing at it. We put time, money and
effort into that. Sometimes other sports are left by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandon's been a real advocate of Texas wrestling,'' Reina
said.
</P>
<P>
   He, and others, have a growing number of believers. The National
Wrestling Coaches Association is having its meeting in Dallas prior
to the trials to show support for a state that's finally
recognizing the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited. We realize the potential,'' Reina said.

TEXAS PREPARES 
FOR GRAHAM EXECUTION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas finds itself center stage again, awash in
an international spotlight as the state prepares to carry out its
222nd execution Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The main character this time is Gary Graham, a 7th-grade dropout
who has parlayed what originally was a capital murder case so
unremarkable it got virtually no media coverage into one of the
most contentious and highly publicized cases in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to think we live in a rather fine place, and I think
that Texas is being showcased by some for political reasons as not
such a fine place,'' Lt. Gov. Rick Perry said Wednesday. ``I will
continue to defend Texas' honor in every way that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments came at an unprecedented news conference that he
and Texas Attorney General John Cornyn called in an effort to stem
what they contend is a misinformation campaign waged by Graham's
attorneys and supporters who insist Graham is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally felt it was important for us to be able to
explain, again, what type of super due process that criminal
defendants are entitled to and in fact receive _ and in fact Mr.
Graham has received _ in reviewing their cases,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's execution date _ his eighth in 19 years _ comes at a
time of heightened scrutiny of the death penalty partly because of
presidential politics and Gov. George W. Bush's assertion that
Texas has never put to death an innocent person.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumed Republican nominee for president, was
campaigning in California Wednesday but expected to return to Texas
by Thursday so that he, rather than Perry, would take
responsibility for the decision on Graham's fate should parole
officials recommend leniency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's likely opponent, Vice President Al Gore, stayed at arm's
length from the death penalty debate in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of capital murder in the robbery and shooting death of
Bobby Lambert in a Houston supermarket parking lot, Graham was 17
when he arrived on death row in 1981. The next year Texas carried
out its first execution since the death penalty was reinstated in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime Wednesday night or Thursday, Graham was to be moved
from death row at the Terrell Unit in Livingston to the Huntsville
Walls Unit, where the death chamber is located. Prison officials do
not divulge the time or the route they will take when transporting
prisoners the 90 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of Graham's attorneys is expected to be in Huntsville if
Graham is put to death by injection at 6 p.m. Houston attorney Jack
Zimmermann said his client told him Tuesday to stay in the city and
work on the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as Graham met with family members, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, attorneys and a Muslim minister at the Terrell Unit, the
18 members of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles weighed his
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Their deliberations _ as in every death penalty case the board
has reviewed _ were carried out behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is disgusting that the board meets privately to make
decisions that are so public,'' said Jackson, a civil rights leader
and one of several well-known personalities campaigning for Graham.
``(The board) communicates through faxes, e-mails and through phone
calls. It should meet publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked Bush to show ``some compassion and bold leadership'' by
sparing Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, Bush cannot grant Graham a 30-day reprieve
unless the parole board recommends it because former Gov. Ann
Richards took such action in 1993, Cornyn said. The board also
could recommend a commutation to a life sentence or a pardon for
the crime, Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman Gerald Garrett said the decision likely will not
be announced until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a day before he had to cast his own vote on Graham,
Garrett insisted he had not yet made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's where I am: We have the facts, the jury trial, and the
multitude of (appeals),'' he said. ``Most of the issues have
already been addressed by courts. My job is to stay focused on the
facts . . . My dilemma is the fact of cases vs. all the other
issues attached to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to make a decision based on the most emotional
argument put forward. Misinformation abounds . . . and I don't
wholeheartedly endorse the notion that the facts are subject to
interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the board decides a case before execution day. Garrett
said he extended the deadline in the Graham case to allow defense
attorneys and prosecutors time to supplement their filings.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes sent the board
Wednesday a day-old sworn affidavit from a bailiff at Graham's
trial. The bailiff reported Graham said after the verdict, ``Next
time I'm not going to leave any witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was convicted largely on the testimony from a single
eyewitness. Defense attorneys have attacked the testimony of
Bernadine Skillern of Houston as unreliable. They claim to have two
other eyewitnesses who were working at the store that night _ Ron
Hubbard and Sherian Etuk _ who say Graham was not the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn and Perry countered Wednesday with documents they say
call into question the credibility of those witnesses. The
documents included:
</P>
<P>
   A copy of an affidavit Hubbard gave in 1993 in which he stated
the shooter ``did not look at me so I could not see his face, but I
noticed he was about 5 feet 6 inches.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the police offense report in which Etuk told
investigators ``she could not see his face due to the glass windows
and dark parking lot but could tell he was backing away from the
complainant with his left hand down to his side (and) his right
hand at his waist.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Rob Owen, who once was part of Graham's defense
team, dismissed the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard's and Etuk's eyewitness accounts are more credible than
Skillern's because they testified about the shooter's height, not
facial characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain types of recollections are more reliable than
others,'' Owen said. A person's height ``is harder to mistake than
facial features.'' &QL;

SUBWAY RIDE BY ROCKER CREATES SECURITY RISKS
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rocker, a Major League Baseball official said
Wednesday, has made the No. 7 train more famous than Duke
Ellington's A train.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington took the A train to Harlem; Rocker says he is going to
take the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium. Major League Baseball, though
no official said it publicly, does not want Rocker, the Atlanta
relief pitcher, riding any subway to the Braves' games with the
Mets next week. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the city would try to
prevail on him not to take the train and on the Braves not to let
him take the train.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the Braves' top executives said Wednesday that it was
Rocker's business to get to Shea by the transportation of his
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't discussed it, nor will I discuss it'' with Rocker,
John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager, said by telephone
from Atlanta when asked about the closer's stated intention. ``It's
a nonissue for me. Guys travel to the ballpark however they like.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton, the Mets' center fielder, who is on the
disabled list, said he did not think Rocker would use the subway.
``There are too many security risks involved,'' Hamilton said. ``On
the baseball field, you've got some type of protection. If you're
talking about riding the subway, you are on someone else's turf. I
still can't understand why the guy is bringing more attention to
himself than is needed. Just play the game. Get four games over
with, and get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Rocker might miss the Braves' four-game visit to New
York when he was banished to the minor leagues earlier this month,
to work on his control, the club said. But his demotion came a day
after he harangued the Sports Illustrated reporter who wrote the
article quoting him as disparaging large segments of society,
including some that ride the No. 7 train in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view was that Rocker would not return to the
Braves in time for the series starting next Thursday, if he would
rejoin them at all. But then another reliever, Rudy Seanez, was
injured, and Rocker returned. His initial relief appearance showed
that his control had not improved, and some of his early words
indicated that he hadn't changed there either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I get to New York, I'm getting on the 7 train,''
he told USA Today Baseball Weekly this week. ``I'm taking it to
Shea Stadium. I won't be in a cab. I won't be on the bus. I'll be
on that train. And I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in a car, not on the bus, not in a taxi with a driver named
Gus. Security concerns have been high; if Rocker follows through
with his plan to take the train to the game, baseball and city
officials may be in a state of consternation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Mr. Rocker chooses to do, the NYPD will be prepared
and will have adequate coverage,'' said Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman
for the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Wednesday at his daily news conference, this one in
Central Park, Giuliani said: ``We thought when he went down to the
minor leagues that this was something we could wait on. But now he
is back. So we have been preparing a plan, and we will probably
announce it tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview on WFAN, Giuliani said 450 to 500 police
officers, including some in plainclothes, would be at Shea for the
games. He suggested that officers will be on the train, too, if
Rocker is. For a regular game, police officials said, the Shea
Stadium detail consists of one lieutenant, four sergeants and 40
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have security watching him to make sure nothing
happens to him,'' the mayor said, adding that the city would treat
the pitcher the way it would a visiting head of state ``or someone
from a foreign country and there are threats toward him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, while not taking the visit and potential problems
lightly, have tried to give the appearance that everything is
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday about team security, Schuerholz said: ``We're
just doing what we normally would do. Whatever extra protection we
take to certain places, that's what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Is New York one of those places? ``Yes, it is,'' he said. ``But
that's just standard procedure for us, nothing beyond our extra
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves play in Montreal just before their trip to New York,
and Kevin Hallinan, baseball's executive director for security,
will meet with them there to review plans.
</P>
<P>
   Shea Stadium is expected to be packed or nearly packed for the
games. The Mets said the advance sale for three of the games is
about 35,000. The Friday night game is close to a sellout. That
game will be followed by fireworks. Baseball and city officials
hope those are the only fireworks that explode during the series.  &QL;

NATIONS CUTTING AID TO THE JOBLESS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Seventy-five percent of the world's estimated 150
million unemployed workers have no jobless benefits, and even the
most generous countries have been cutting back on assistance to the
unemployed, the International Labor Organization said Wednesday in
its annual assessment of global working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the report said the cutbacks represent a
significant threat to economic development because they undermine
the financial security of employed workers.
</P>
<P>
   Worker protection in Wednesday's insecure job environment is
essential, said Roger Beattie, the report's chief author, ``because
people who are well protected are far more willing to accept such
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Somavia, director general of the Geneva-based ILO, said
that recalcitrant countries could ``eventually suffer a destructive
backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. agency's World Labor Report 2000 said workers in Europe
enjoy the most generous unemployment benefits, but even its wealthy
countries reduced them in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also trimmed back benefits, and has slipped in
a ranking of which countries offer the most generous worker
protection, the study reported. Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan,
New Zealand and the United Kingdom, also provide a lower level of
benefits than countries in the top tier of the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
Switzerland make up the top-tier countries with the most benefits
for the greatest number of workers.
</P>
<P>
   An entrenched system of benefits in much of Europe, and the
resistance to efforts to pare it back, have raised criticism that
the European countries are too burdened with social costs to
compete effectively with more free-wheeling economies.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie rejected such criticism as ``naive'' and said that the
study indicated that countries can put a secure floor under workers
while still growing their economies. The ILO study showed that the
most generous countries, such as Spain, replace between 63 percent
and 77 percent of wages to the unemployed. New Zealand is among the
lowest, at 23 percent wage replacement. Canada and the United
States provide about 58 percent of replacement wages.
</P>
<P>
   However, the two North American countries and the United Kingdom
also provide unemployment benefits for only 12 months, which is
described as short in the report. Also, neither the United States
or Canada provides a second layer of unemployment assistance when
initial insurance benefits are exhausted.

NBA hopes marketability grows off Lakers' title
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ When the Los Angeles Lakers won this year's NBA
championship, beating the Indiana Pacers in six games, there were
hugs all around, champagne showers and victory cigars being fired
up everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just in the league's front office.
</P>
<P>
   The Dream (Team) Factory that is the NBA is back in business,
and the Lakers are the product that is being pushed. It's Showtime
all over again _ at least everyone is hoping so _ with Kobe Bryant
and Shaquille O'Neal teaming to form the Magic Johnson and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Back when the latter two were in their heyday, the NBA achieved
a remarkable marketing fission _ appealing to both Madison Avenue
and the streets. There is the hope that Bryant, 21, and O'Neal, 28,
will have a similar impact on the blacktop and in the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   But the only way that will happen is if they continue to win.
</P>
<P>
   Championships, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Bryant and O'Neal) work very well together,'' said
Johnson, who now has a minority stake in Lakers ownership, ``just
like Kareem and I knew each other's moves. At the end of the game,
we just looked at each other. We didn't have to say who wanted it.
We already knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have learned to coexist and finally learned that they
need each other to win championships. But they have gradually
matured and said, `You know what? We can both be stars and win
championships and be bigger stars after doing that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They can make each other be remembered, forever, by winning
championships,'' Johnson continued. ``They have to look at each
other and say, `You know what? Let's build our legacy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the potential is quite clear: Once you win this, build
on that. And keep on winning and keep on entertaining the fans, and
you'll have a legacy like Kareem and I have. People, when they say
your name, they instantly think of winners. They remember you.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys played this game. Only a few are remembered. And
the ones who are remembered are the ones who win. That's what it's
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite.
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson should have said is that the ones who win are the
ones who are marketed for mass consumption. And after a season when
the NBA's once-rosy television ratings plunged like Internet stock
prices, the search is on for the cure.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, which broadcast 34 regular-season games this season, drew
an average rating of 3.4 (each rating point translates to 1,008,000
homes), down 21 percent from last season. And Turner Sports, which
broadcasts games on TBS and TNT, claimed a drop-off of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Pat Riley, who guided those Showtime Lakers to four
of their five championships in the 1980s, cited several possible
reasons for the downward spiral in television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, there were only one or two games on television
(per week),'' Riley said. ``There wasn't the Internet; there wasn't
DirecTV; there wasn't TNT. All of these people have games on now.
Maybe it's diluted.''
</P>
<P>
   But many around the league say the lag in TV ratings was
expected, especially with the echoes of the disastrous lockout
season of 1998-99 still being faintly heard throughout the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured this (downturn) could happen,'' said Wizards
majority owner Abe Pollin. ``This is a transitional season. We're
still feeling some of the effects of the lockout. Some people got
turned off by the NBA and decided to do other things with their
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have that kind of disruption, things don't usually
return to normal right away. We're optimistic (that the increased
interest caused by the playoffs) will carry over to next season and
everything will be up next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   While this year's Finals featured many viewer-friendly games,
especially the aerobically paced 116-111 series ender, the biggest
problem facing the NBA is that so far there is no Michael Jordan to
have everyone wishing to ``be like Mike.'' The league and its
corporate partners hitched most of their marketing efforts to
Jordan's wagon, so why should they be surprised when no one is
interested anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than learning its lesson, however, the NBA has worked
itself into a lather trying to find a worthy successor to his
Airness _ Grant Hill, Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan or Vince
Carter. And while many of them have Jordan's camera-friendly good
looks, a touch of his charisma or his flair for the game, none has
really caught the public's fancy. Not yet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because while they're all talented players, none has the
one quality that set Jordan apart from the rest _ an ice-cold will
to win. We admire ability, but we really love winners, and Jordan
was the ultimate winner.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the next Jordan is not driving the lane in your
nearest arena; he's instead driving a golf ball down the nearest
fairway. Tiger Woods has supplanted Jordan as the ultimate
big-stage performer, which is the biggest _ perhaps only _ reason
golf has usurped the NBA among the league's target demographic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports ratings are cyclical. It's not an unbroken line up or
down,'' said Neal Pilson, a former head of CBS Sports who now runs
his own television sports consulting company. ``You can't anoint
the next Michael Jordan. I think they stumbled a little this season
trying to do that (by putting Carter and Bryant on TV so often).
</P>
<P>
   ``The public will anoint the next Michael Jordan. In fact, the
public already has. His name is Tiger Woods, a guy who transcends
all sports, like Michael did.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has to be hoping that the Lakers, who look like they
could be winners for a long time to come, bring back many of those
viewers. And that Bryant will pan out to be the next Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget I was not even the focus and didn't get deep
into the playoffs the first six years of my career,'' said Jordan,
now president of operations for the Washington Wizards. ``The
public is going to see that the league is stacked with talented
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the players and teams need some maturing and
seasoning before they get to the level of the Lakers, Celtics and
Pistons of old. They set the standard for the modern game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the second half of the problem facing the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   While the league thrived during the heyday of Johnson's Showtime
team, the main reason was because of the intense rivalry the Lakers
had with Larry Bird's Celtics. The league now has to find a
comparable rival for these Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Many teams are gearing up for just such a challenge, making
overtures toward impact free agents like Duncan, Hill, Tracy
McGrady, Toni Kukoc, Eddie Jones, Jalen Rose, Reggie Miller, Brian
Grant, Rashard Lewis, Ron Mercer, Cuttino Mobley and Derek
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal scenario _ from the league's perspective, mind you _
would be for the New York Knicks to somehow find the fountain of
youth (``paging Alonzo Mourning please report to Madison Square
Garden''), matching the two biggest marketplaces in an annual
celebrity death match.
</P>
<P>
   Or having O'Neal's old team, the Orlando Magic, use its vast
salary-cap space to sign big-name free agents like Duncan and Hill,
immediately creating an Eastern Conference power capable of
challenging the Lakers both on the court and in Q factor.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe even having one of these new young stars emerge as a
genuine heir to Jordan, possessing the same ability to drive his
teammates to unimagined competitive heights.
</P>
<P>
   Anything to get the Dream Factory churning out a new set of
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new set of players and teams is going to give everyone the
effect that the league is not quite the same,'' Jordan said.
``Along with a lot of younger players coming in who don't have the
experience they possibly need to be put in the forefront as stars.
But they will evolve as their maturity matches their talent. So
will some teams. The league is going to be fine.''

BUSH ADDRESSES 
HISPANIC JOURNALISTS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush on Wednesday continued his quest
for Latino support by wooing the National Association of Hispanic
Journalists in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Urging the journalists to join him in making education their top
priority, Bush continued with a policy theme he trumpeted earlier
in the day during his 12th trip to California in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to make sure we close the gap of hope is to make sure
that every child gets educated,'' Bush said. ``For those of you who
are objective journalists, I ask you to look at the record in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the Hispanic heritage and traditions in the
state. I intend to take that attitude to the White House should I
be fortunate enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected president, Bush said, he would encourage small
business and free trade and support bilingualism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will pledge to you that I will welcome the Hispanic heritage
in America,'' he said. ``I will reject the English-only
movements.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP presidential candidate said he's hoping to dash
lingering stereotypes that his party is unsympathetic to immigrants
and uninterested in improving public schools as a way to help
struggling Hispanics in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an image that some have ascribed to the Republican
Party,'' he had said in Los Angeles. ``I'm setting a different tone
_ a different attitude toward the newly arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Houston visit spoke volumes about his campaign
priorities. Just a week ago, he skipped the GOP state convention in
Houston after saying his support in Texas was solid and his time
was better spent making new friends in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party of Bush's expected presidential opponent,
Al Gore, continues to be favored by most Hispanics, but Bush's
hopes of making inroads are riding high _ in part because of his
success in converting supporters in Texas, where he captured almost
half the Hispanic votes in his 1998 gubernatorial re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he paid his one-hour visit to the Hispanic
journalists' convention because he considered it important to meet
personally with its influential members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want their vote and I'm willing to come ask for the vote,''
Bush said, adding that his welcoming remarks were intended to show
that ``my vision for America includes everybody.``
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen protesters waved placards and chanted anti-death
penalty slogans in front of the Westin Galleria Hotel during Bush's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   At times outnumbered by the media contingent on hand to cover
Bush, the group paced up and down the sidewalk. One member carried
an upside-down American flag _ generally a symbol of distress _
while another kept time on a bongo drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush says `death row', we say `hell no,''' they demanded,
between warnings of ``no justice--no peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Graham's scheduled execution Thursday may have provided the
catalyst for the peaceful demonstration, but the protesters said
they oppose all capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said the Democrats are just as culpable as the
Republicans when it comes to executions.
</P>
<P>
   Njeri Shakur said Gore was ``strangely silent'' over the Graham
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's letting Bush take all the heat for this, but he supports
the death penalty, too'' Shakur said. ``The Democrats and the
Republicans are very much in agreement with the issue.''

Alou, Lima interest Yankees
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The New York Yankees have expressed interest in a possible deal to
acquire Astros outfielder Moises Alou and starting pitcher Jose
Lima.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Gerry Hunsicker declined Wednesday to discuss
specific trade rumors or players involved but said he is not
surprised by the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deadline is July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a team in last place like we are approaching
the halfway point, there's going to be a lot of speculation
regarding your veteran players,'' Hunsicker said before Wednesday's
game with the Dodgers. ``So I'm not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Following three NL Central titles, the Astros have been a major
disappointment with the worst record in the majors through nearly
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Yankees being mentioned in a deal for Alou and Lima
are outfielder Ricky Ledee, top infield prospect Alfonso Soriano
and a minor-league pitching prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who has one year remaining on a five-year contract worth a
little more than $25 million, has a no-trade clause in his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ```It's the first time in my career that my name has been
mentioned in trade rumors during the season,'' said Alou.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors are just rumors. Usually, I am asked if I'd agree to go
to this place or that place, and that hasn't happened here. I have
a no-trade agreement. If I don't want to go anywhere, I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker would not say whether he has approached Alou about
waiving his no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless he changes his mind in regard to being traded, that's a
moot point,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Lima has been one of the team's biggest disappointments
following a 21-win season a year ago. He is 1-10 with a 7.07 ERA
but has pitched well in his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister called me from the Dominican and said she heard it
on the radio,'' Lima said. ``I guess I'd say I'm shocked. I hope it
doesn't happen. I have my family here and a home here. But if it
does, then I am a baseball player and I will do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hunsicker: ``It would be somewhat impractical for me to
think about trading starting pitching when it's so scarce.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees reportedly have been making a push to acquire
Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa or Detroit outfielder Juan
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox also have expressed interest recently in
Alou.

UCLA ANALYSTS EXPECT STATE BOOM TO CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California's robust economy is expected to
continue to expand in the coming years, albeit at a more moderate
rate, a University of California, Los Angeles, survey predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released Wednesday by the UCLA Anderson School of
Business, also predicts nonfarm employment will rise by 3.8 percent
this year, up from 3.1 percent in 1999. A slower growth rate of 2.6
percent is expected in 2001, followed by a rate of 2.5 percent in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year will be the best year in the last decade,'' said Tom
Lieser, executive director of the Anderson Business Forecast. ``We
will also probably turn the corner and see a moderation of these
growth numbers later this year.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a large interest rate hike last month, but it doesn't
appear that it has done damage to the California economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At its May 16 meeting, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee
raised the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 6.5 percent. Over
the last year the Fed has raised short-term interest rates by 1.75
percentage points in an effort to curb inflation at a time of rapid
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the figures (in this report) show is that we are going to
have a good year in 2000, much better than anyone expected,'' said
Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a good solid economy but there are risks,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said one of the risks is another interest rate hike when
the Federal Reserve meets next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate hike or not, the latest data on regional
employment trends show that Central California is leading the state
in both nonfarm employment growth and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Employment growth in the 10-county area was up 3.4 percent
through May from a year ago, compared with 3.0 percent for the
seven counties in Southern California and 2.8 percent for the
counties of the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento areas combined.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Stockton-Lodi area, Central California
continues to experience double-digit rates of unemployment.
Unemployment rates are highest in Fresno County, 13.5 percent, and
Merced County, 13.4 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The high unemployment figures reflect the fact that Central
California's economy is based on agriculture, said Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, inland Riverside and San Bernardino
counties continued to lead in employment growth - an increase of
5.5 percent through May.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making a transition from an agricultural to an
urbanized ... economy,'' he said. ``A lot of manufacturing firms
are moving from Los Angeles and Orange counties. Also, Palm Springs
has become a year-round economy, not one just based on tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Employment grew by 2.2 percent for the year to date in Los
Angeles County, compared with 1.6 percent in 1999. In San Jose in
Santa Clara County, it was up by 2.1 percent vs. 1.3 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also forecasts permits in 2000 for 154,000 housing
units, declining slightly in 2001 to 151,000 before rebounding the
next year to 159,000.
</P>
<P>
   With limited new housing coming to the market, prices continue
to increase. For Los Angeles County, the average price of a home
was predicted to increase by 5.9 percent this year, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
   While home prices continued to outpace construction, the survey
also found that consumer spending was expected to remain at record
levels before experiencing a slight slowdown in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending, as measured by taxable sales, will continue
to reflect gains in personal income and employment in the coming
year. The exceptional impact from large amounts of wealth created
in recent years should continue, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lieser, California will enjoy a 7.8 percent
increase in taxable sales this year, which will be followed by
slower gains of 6.3 percent in 2001 and 6.1 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just rich people doing this,'' said Lieser. ``In
order for us to see such strong gains in consumer spending, there
has to be very strong across-the-board spending, including (for)
homes, cars and appliances.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong sales gains this year follow a 9.3 percent increase
in taxable sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The survey predicts that total immigration will average 250,000
people through 2002, and the population will grow overall by 1.6
percent per year in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   With the increase in population, both state and local officials
will have to deal with the problems that growth brings, said Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some major infrastructure problems to deal with,'' he
said. ``On all of the 405 freeway, for example, commuters run into
traffic congestion seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lieser: ``Once the Legislature and governor agree on a
budget in Sacramento, we will see a lot of new money for
transportation. It will be a boost that is sorely needed.''

CITY SHOWS ITS LOVE TO LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Please take a step back.'' The command was
directed at a convivial crowd surging to show its love for the
Lakers Wednesday, but we all would do well to heed it.
</P>
<P>
   For a few short hours on the longest day of the year, Los
Angeles showed us her most flattering profile. Her multiethnic face
was sunlit and serene. The residents of Greater Los Angeles who
shortcircuited their power lives long enough to soak in the Lakers'
NBA Finals victory parade were in for a shock, the kind transmitted
by the electricity we are capable of manufacturing when we're a
people united instead of divided along city and county and cultural
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew L.A. loved us,'' Laker reserve guard Derek Fisher said
at one point, his eyes wider than the patch of fans-free road ahead
of the motorcade. ``But I never knew L.A. loved us this much.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher could be forgiven for feeling as though he stepped onto a
double-decker bus on First St. and was transported back to his
hometown of Little Rock, Arkansas, where everybody knows his name.
Who knew L.A., a mega-metropolis with a well-documented mean
streak, was still small and neighborly enough to wrap its arms
around anything in a big, warm embrace?
</P>
<P>
   There were enough people camped along a dozen-block stretch of
Figueroa Street to fill a scrapbook of memories, not to mention a
couple of Rose Bowls. We haven't seen such thick columns of
advancing creatures since our house was overrun by ants.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people baked in the sun for hours without complaint
(or incident) just so they could catch a fleeting look at the 2000
NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the well-heeled denizens of the Staples Center lost their
simple sense of wonderment while acquiring the kind of wealth
needed to afford those courtside season seats. But it would appear
their gilded insouciance is no more representative of L.A.'s
citizenry than were the hoodlums who marred Monday's
championship-clinching celebration.
</P>
<P>
   We caught a few people crying as the double decker buses
carrying L.A.'s newest champions lumbered up the street like
Arvydas Sabonis or Sam Perkins in the paint against Shaquille
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Crying tears of ardor, mind you, not tears of disappointment or
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew sports figures in this city still had the power and
grace to stir us out of our lethargy like that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Please take a step back.'' Even as we celebrated the beginning
of what looks to be a beautiful decade for O'Neal and Kobe Bryant
and Lakers basketball, we couldn't help sense we were seeing an
ending of sorts, too.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ron Harper, A.C. Green, Rick Fox, Brian Shaw, Glen
Rice, Robert Horry, Bryant and O'Neal step one-by-one to the
microphone and address the throngs outside the Staples Center, we
felt not unlike a parent on the day her child steps forward to
receive his or her high-school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a significant moment, but also sort of a sad one,
because the future inevitably will bring changes to a relationship
that is held dear.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with these Lakers, who won't all be back next season to
defend the title they won together. Fisher, as hard as he works and
as humble as he stays, is too short to fit coach Phil Jackson's
specifications for a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   And Rice, for as hard as he tried this year to fit in, might be
too selfish at heart to operate as a cog in Jackson's triangle
offense.
</P>
<P>
   We could see those two players packaged in a deal for a bonafide
power forward. We could see Harper retiring to rest his arthritic
knees and John Salley repairing (again) to the broadcast booth.
</P>
<P>
   In sports as in life, the only certainty is change. That's why,
when we caught all the players milling around the balcony stage at
the Staples Center, it was a frame we wanted to freeze in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please take a step back.'' Oh how we wish Lakers executive
vice president Jerry West would have been around to hear those
words, not that we can imagine him ever heeding them. West built
the team that united a city but hasn't been able to enjoy any of
the fruits of his labor.
</P>
<P>
   Far from completing him, the Lakers' success has depleted him,
draining him of his energy, his joy, his perspective.
</P>
<P>
   We're saddened to hear he's contemplating retiring because of
the public scrutiny, which is unrelenting. We know where he's
coming from when he says he gets beaten down by the steady stream
of feedback from people who can make his heart skip a beat with
their malevolence.
</P>
<P>
   We've been there, felt that.
</P>
<P>
   But as a wise friend once reminded us: Nobody can hurt us
without our permission.
</P>
<P>
   If West wants to retire because he's tired of the day-to-day
grind after all these years, fine. But he shouldn't let the public
or his own demons drive him out.
</P>
<P>
   We hope coach Phil Jackson kidnaps West this summer and subjects
him to hours of yoga in a room filled with aromatherapy candles.
Who knows? Maybe the same methods Jackson used to sharpen the focus
of O'Neal and Bryant could work the opposite on West's focus.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been so lovely if on this day West had been able
to see his Lakers through Los Angeles' eyes. We guarantee he would
have been moved to tears by what he saw.

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS IS PAYING $7.6 BILLION FOR CHIP MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Instruments Inc., the semiconductor giant, said Wednesday
that it would acquire the Burr-Brown Corp., which is also a
computer chip maker, for $7.6 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Burr-Brown is a leader in analog chips, as is Texas Instruments,
but the two companies' product lines are complementary rather than
overlapping in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, which was announced after trading closed Wednesday,
Texas Instruments said it would issue 1.3 shares of its stock for
each share of Burr-Brown. That $113.425-a-share offer represents a
56 percent premium for Burr-Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments shares closed down $3.625, to $138.75, on the
New York Stock Exchange. Burr-Brown closed at $72.625, down $2.75,
in Nasdaq trading. In after-hours trading, Burr-Brown shares surged
to as high as $102.9375, while Texas Instruments shares were flat.
</P>
<P>
   The digital revolution has actually proved a boon to the makers
of analog chips, devices that process continuous electronic signals
rather than ones and zeros. This is because humans cannot see or
hear digital code, so analog chips have to step in to convert
digital signals into usable form for things like computer monitor
displays and speakers. Digital cell phones, DVD players and DSL
modems all use analog chips.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Burr-Brown strengthens Texas Instruments' position in the
data converter and amplifier segments of the analog semiconductor
market, where it has little or no market share. Data converters are
analog semiconductors used to convert signals from analog to
digital and back again. Amplifiers are used to detect and
strengthen low-level signals.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments, which is based in Dallas, is primarily strong
in digital signal processors, or DSP's, specialized chips often
used in conjunction with analog circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as serious about analog as we are about DSP,'' Tom
Engibous, the chairman, president and chief executive of Texas
Instruments, said in a conference call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Burr-Brown are elite developers of
high-performance analog products,'' Engibous said. ``This
combination means that TI will have a leading position in
essentially every high-performance analog category and the ability
to offer almost any analog component that touches a DSP.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr-Brown will become part of Texas Instruments' organization
devoted to catalog analog semiconductors, which are off-the-shelf
parts used in many products. This is the third acquisition by Texas
Instruments in the last 12 months to expand in this area. Last
October it acquired the Unitrode Corp., which makes chips that
extend a cell phone's battery life, for $1.25 billion in stock. In
November, it bought Power Trends, a maker of circuit board devices,
for $145 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Instruments' strength in DSP will introduce our
high-performance analog and data converter products into new
applications,'' said Syrus Madavi, Burr-Brown's chairman, president
and chief executive. ``The makers of Internet appliances and
communications systems will have the best of both worlds in one
company, with complementary components to optimally meet their
total signal processing requirements,'' he said in the conference
call.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments executives said they planned to retain
Burr-Brown's headquarters and one manufacturing site in Tucson,
Ariz., as well as two technology development centers in Atsugi,
Japan, and Livingston, Scotland. They also intend to keep
Burr-Brown's 1,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Producing analog chips cost less money than making digital ones,
because analog chips do not require _ and often cannot use _ the
latest process technology. One reason is that packing circuits ever
closer together, which increases the speed of digital chips, only
causes noise and heat problems for analog ones.
</P>
<P>
   Analog chip design is still as much art as science, and benefits
little from modern computer-aided design software. So analog
companies are dependent on design power of the human kind,
engineers with years of experience. Because these experts are hard
to come by, the barrier to entry in the analog business is
surprisingly high.

   BUSH RESPONDS TO SENATORS
</P>
<P>
   Five moderate Republican senators who support abortion rights
sent a letter on April 12 to Gov. George W. Bush, the party's
presumptive presidential nominee, asking him to ``take the lead''
in changing the Republican platform's anti-abortion plank. They
also invited Bush to lunch. On Tuesday, they got a response _ to
the lunch invitation.
</P>
<P>
   One senator, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he still sought
a ``more specific response'' on abortion and remained hopeful he
would get it. Bush and platform leaders have said they intend to
leave the plank _ which calls for an end to legalized abortion and
the appointment of judges who ``respect the sanctity of innocent
human life'' _ as it is.
</P>
<P>
   As for the lunch, Bush indicated he would try to make one if his
schedule permitted, Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW PROPOSAL ON COMPUTER EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush Wednesday proposed another $80 million
annually in federal grants to not-for-profit education centers in
low-income neighborhoods that help teach children and adults to use
computers. ``The great challenge facing America is whether all
people will have access to new technologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The setting in which he introduced his plan, a Hispanic
neighborhood in Los Angeles, was arguably more significant than its
details. Bush has frequently appeared with minorities to bolster
his claim of being a new kind of Republican and is aggressively
courting the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, he flew to Houston to speak to the annual
convention of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.
Last year, Bush provoked complaints from minority journalists at a
conference in Seattle when he declined an invitation to address
them.
</P>
<P>
   NEW CHOICE IN MICHIGAN RACE
</P>
<P>
   The already close Michigan Senate race between the incumbent
freshman Republican, Spencer Abraham, and his Democratic
challenger, Rep. Debbie Stabenow, tightened a bit further this week
with the entry of Mark Forton, a Reform Party candidate and
supporter of Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Forton, a 53-year-old former Republican leader in politically
powerful Macomb County, will probably not sway legions of voters,
but might cause Abraham problems by attracting Republicans upset by
the senator's efforts to help loosen immigration restrictions to
let companies hire more foreign workers. Forton said he would make
immigration a top issue.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH SURGES IN CONNECTICUT
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush has erased the nine-point advantage Vice
President Al Gore had among Connecticut voters in April, a new poll
released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University showed. The two
presidential candidates are now in a virtual tie, with Gore at 43
percent and Bush at 42 percent, well within the poll's margin of
sampling error of 2.7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   THRESHOLD SET ON QUALIFIERS
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan panel supervising the presidential debates said
Wednesday that candidates qualifying for the first debate on Oct. 3
would be determined by results of five national polls on Sept. 26.
The panel's chairmen, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. and Paul G. Kirk Jr.,
said that anyone with average support of 15 percent or more in the
polls would be invited to the debate, to be held at the University
of Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the other debates, on Oct. 11 at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 at Washington
University in St. Louis, are to be based on polls taken just before
them. Despite objections by Pat Buchanan, Ralph Nader and other
third-party candidates, officials said the threshold would not
change. Buchanan argues that Kirk and Fahrenkopf, respectively
former Democratic and Republican chairmen, should not decide which
third-party candidates qualify.

URANIUM ENRICHMENT PLANT IN OHIO CHOSEN FOR CLOSING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ky., Md.)   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The private company that runs the nation's only two
uranium enrichment plants said Wednesday that it would close one of
them in a year, in Portsmouth, Ohio, because of high costs and a
depressed market for reactor fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The other plant, which is in Paducah, Ky., would remain open.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to close the Ohio plant, which would eliminate
about 1,000 jobs, drew criticism from Congress. The Energy
Department, which sold the plants two years ago, has asked pointed
questions recently about whether a shutdown is advisable. Under the
privatization law, the plants were supposed to remain open until
2004, but there was an escape clause if the private entity, the
United States Enrichment Corp., fell into financial difficulties.
The Bethesda, Md., company told the Treasury Department earlier
this week that it had done exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Until the company's board acted Wednesday, workers, managers and
elected officials in the area of both plants had been apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deeply regret having to take this action, but we clearly
could not continue to operate two production plants,'' said William
H. Timbers, the president and chief executive, in a statement. He
said he would ask the government to hire many of the workers for
environmental restoration at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, however, issued a critical statement.
``The decision is just the latest in a series of shortsighted
decisions aimed at bolstering the corporation's near-term standing
on Wall Street,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. ``The
decision announced today leaves unanswered fundamental questions
affecting the employees, the corporation's future and USEC's
ability to carry out important national security obligations to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The security obligation is a reference to a deal struck between
the United States and Russia, to take highly enriched uranium from
the former Soviet weapons program and dilute it for use in reactors
in this country. The company, continuing to carry out the deal
after the federal government sold the factories, agreed to a price
that is now well above the market level.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, whose district includes the plant,
said he would ask the Treasury Department to seek an injunction
against closing the plant. Among other problems, he said, if
Portsmouth is closed and the Russians prove to be an unreliable
supplier, the Paducah plant would not have sufficient capacity to
provide for the American nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he is preparing legislation to renationalize the
uranium enrichment business.
</P>
<P>
   Both the plants take in uranium in the two most common forms,
uranium-238 and uranium-235, and sort them to raise the proportion
of uranium-235, the type that is most useful in nuclear reactors.
The enrichment technology used at both plants was developed during
World War II, to make the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. That
technology uses far more electricity than newer systems developed
in Europe and the former Soviet Union, which are now commercial
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   And the market for enrichment has also been depressed by the
deal with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Paducah plant, 16 miles west of the Kentucky city, was built
between 1951 and 1954 on a 5,000-acre site. The Portsmouth plant,
which is just south of Piketon, Ohio, in the southern part of the
state, was built between 1952 and 1956. A third Cold War-era
gaseous diffusion plant, at Oak Ridge, Tenn., was shut by the
government in 1985.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Danny Wuerffel was on top of the world in January 1997. He had
just quarterbacked the University of Florida's football team to its
second straight 12-1 season and, this time, the postseason produced
ecstasy instead of agony. The Gators were national champions.
</P>
<P>
   Wuerffel collected the Heisman Trophy and Florida collected the
Sears Trophy. It was a dream season.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans and the Louisiana Superdome _ site of the Gators'
52-20 national title romp in a Sugar Bowl rematch with Florida
State _ came into play again for Wuerffel. Three months later, the
Saints selected Wuerffel in the fourth round of the NFL draft.
Later that year, he started two games for New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three seasons in the NFL, Wuerffel participated in
a third of the Saints games, splitting time with the Billy Joes _
Tolliver and Hobert _ and a handful of others. He made six career
starts, but lacked the magic that surrounded him in college, where
he set records by the bushels and finished his career as the
second-leading passer in SEC history.
</P>
<P>
   With a suspect offensive cast at best, Wuerffel completed 126 of
258 pass attempts for 1,404 yards. In three years, he tossed nine
touchdown passes but was intercepted 16 times and sacked 46 times.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 1999 season, the Saints added free agent
quarterback Jeff Blake and drafted strong-armed Marc Bulger out of
West Virginia. Wuerffel was released.
</P>
<P>
   But, we haven't heard the last of Wuerffel.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to revive his career, the 6-foot-1, 208-pound
quarterback signed on with the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe and spent
the spring calling the signals for former Florida coach Galen Hall,
a fixture in the developmental league since its initial states-side
kickoff in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Wuerffel led NFL Europe in passing and threw for a
league-record 25 touchdowns during the regular season. On Sunday,
he will attempt to lead his Dusseldorf, Germany-based team to the
World Bowl title when the Fire faces the Scottish Claymores in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Small potatoes? Better than no potatoes. Wuerffel is back in a
championship game. He's sweaty again and feeling a rhythm. And he's
piling up numbers, just like old times.
</P>
<P>
   His NFL future is still in limbo. But, so too, were the futures
of Brad Johnson and Jon Kitna before their stints in NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Wuerffel's record-setting passing season comes one year after
Lawrence Phillips set NFL Europe rushing records. Phillips parlayed
his success into an incentive-laden contract with the San Francisco
49ers and had the Bay Area dancing with preseason expectation. The
new Phillips, however, reverted back into the old Phillips and the
49ers and Phillips parted ways at midseason following a run of
insubordination by the one-time, first-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Wuerffel may be able to generate some excitement following his
breakout season in Europe. He may be an afterthought on a team's
camp roster, but should he stick, Wuerffel could contribute more
than Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Capable, young quarterbacks are in high demand in the NFL and
Wuerffel has both qualities, as well as responsibility.

IN BRAZIL, SOMA WANTS TO BE A NASDAQ FOR LATIN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In five tiny rooms on the fourth floor of a
glassed-in building in the middle of downtown Rio de Janeiro is a
little stock exchange with large pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite plummeting trade volumes around the region, the
Sociedade Operadora do Mercado de Ativos, or Soma, wants to be the
next Nasdaq _ and not just for Brazil, but for all of Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent volatility of stock markets abroad only shows how
companies need to have a local listing,'' Romeu Pasquantonio,
Soma's managing director, said in a recent interview. ``Besides,
for many companies, listing on the Nasdaq is just not feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the fall, the exchange plans a series of conferences
in Brazil and other Latin American nations to bring technology and
Internet companies together with investors. In the first steps,
private companies would offer blocks of shares and seats on their
boards to experienced venture capitalists in exchange for seed
financing. The shares, which would then be listed on Soma, would be
open for trade periodically _ anywhere from once a week to once a
month, Pasquantonio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many venture capital companies entering the market
now that don't have any way to exit their investments,''
Pasquantonio said. ``We want to provide that exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Soma was founded in 1996 by a group of brokerage houses that
wanted to create a market for small-capitalization companies in
Brazil. It is modeled after Nasdaq _ instead of a central trading
floor, there is an electronically linked network of broker-dealers
who trade stocks by way of computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Before Soma's creation, the Brazilian market was dominated by
the stock exchanges in Rio and Sao Paulo, with listing prices well
out of reach of most of Brazil's small and medium-size businesses.
Soma, with its $3,000 annual listing fee, offered an alternative to
companies that needed to raise a relatively small amount of money.
At the end of 1997, Soma had 34 listed companies. Today, it has
120.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the relatively low cost for companies to list their
shares, Soma says that its advantage over the Sao Paulo stock
exchange, or Bovespa, is that its system guarantees that investors
will always have a buyer when they want to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Soma hopes that the start-up companies it cultivates
will go on to have their initial public offerings on the exchange,
which would then be open to all investors.
</P>
<P>
   Now that volatility on the Nasdaq has caused international
financing for Internet companies to slow to a trickle, Soma's local
one-stop shop for financing is expected to be popular among
Brazilian companies as well as investors.
</P>
<P>
   But although all indications point to Soma's continued growth,
some uncertainly still surrounds the prospects for Brazilian
financial markets as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt about Soma's potential, but it is still too
soon to be talking about it being the next Nasdaq,'' said Claus
Buckmann, director of the Rio de Janeiro brokerage house Fator CVC.
``We are living through a moment of very low liquidity in general.
Everything depends on how the market as a whole develops in
Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   At Soma, volumes are at a seven-month low, down to a daily
average of $1.1 million last month. On the Bovespa, volume fell to
a six-month low in May, when an average of $369.9 million changed
hands each day.
</P>
<P>
   To try to build trading activity, the Bovespa announced late
last week that it would enter negotiations with the New York Stock
Exchange to participate in a proposed global linkup of stock
exchanges in 10 nations. For Soma, experts say that a partnership
with the Nasdaq appears to be the next logical step.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the globalized world, there is no more room for small
regional stock markets,'' said Alfried Ploger, the president of the
Association of Open Capital Companies, a trade group here. ``There
has to be an orientation toward global agreements, and those who
don't participate are going to be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq, which has exported its system of trading abroad and
began operating a Japanese version on Monday, has been looking
closely at Latin America. Nasdaq representatives visited Soma
recently, as well as other stock markets in Latin America, to open
talks on the creation of a regionwide exchange for small-cap
stocks. Though Pasquantonio said the discussions were preliminary,
he did not discard the possibility of an operational agreement with
the Nasdaq in the future.

OFFICERS CHARGED IN N.J. IN BEATING OF MAN WHO DIED AFTER ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A former lieutenant and four police officers in
the Orange, N.J., Police Department were charged Wednesday with
federal civil rights violations in the beating and assault of a man
who died an hour after being mistakenly arrested in connection with
the murder of another police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The five-count indictment handed up in U.S. District Court here
was the culmination of a 14-month federal and state investigation
into a case that was riddled with police mistakes, multiple charges
of police brutality and wrongful arrests following the April 8,
1999, murder of the police officer, Joyce Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   The case led to upheavals in both the Essex County prosecutor's
office, which supervised the initial investigation into the murder
of the officer, and the Orange Police Department. It eventually led
Gov. Christie Whitman to remove the county's first black, female
prosecutor, Patricia A. Hurt, who directed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, one of the police officers beat the
man, Earl Faison, 27, when he was stopped on the street three days
after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   He was kicked and punched by the officer while handcuffed and
lying on the sidewalk, said Robert J. Cleary, the U.S. attorney for
New Jersey, and was beaten by four of the officers after being
placed in the back seat of a police car. One of those same officers
later robbed Faison at gunpoint in a stairwell at Orange police
headquarters, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that a fifth officer, Brian Smith, 30,
sprayed pepper spray in Faison's mouth and nose at close range
while he was being held in the stairwell area. The indictment
charges all five with conspiracy to cover up the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Faison, an East Orange resident and an aspiring rap artist, died
at police headquarters about an hour after he was initially stopped
by police. If found guilty in the case, the officers face a maximum
of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the incident ``an act of vigilantism'' by police
officers, Joseph R. Lewis, the special agent in charge of the
Newark office of the FBI, added: ``It went against the fabric of
law enforcement and all that it stands for. A man, his family and
the law enforcement community suffered because these officers
served as judge and jury for Earl Faison.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Smith, an Orange resident, the others arrested
were his brother, former police lieutenant Thomas Smith, 35, of
Caldwell, who retired from the force in December on disability;
Andrew Garth, 31, of Bloomfield; Tyrone Payton, 34; and Paul
Carpinteri Jr., 36, of Orange. Four of the five officers were
arrested at their homes early Wednesday morning and Brian Smith
turned himself in to FBI agents later in the morning. They all
appeared before U.S. Magistrate Dennis Cavanaugh Wednesday, who set
bail at $150,000 for Thomas Smith and $100,000 for the others. An
arraignment was set for June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining their clients' innocence, the lawyers for all of the
men portrayed them as the victims of lies and ``outrageous
allegations'' by fellow Orange police officers who testified before
a federal grand jury, and of the powerful machinery of federal
prosecutors, the FBI and the Civil Rights Division of the U.S.
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure brought in this case,'' said Peter
Willis, a lawyer for Brian Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But for Earl Williams, Faison's father, who had contended from
the beginning that his son had been beaten, the indictments were a
vindication of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But until we find out exactly who was involved and what took
place, we will have a lot of folks dissatisfied,'' he said,
expressing his suspicion that others were involved in the death of
his son.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Carnegie was shot once in the stomach and once in the
head by a robbery suspect whom she chased in her patrol car. Her
death produced an adrenaline-fueled investigation that led to the
arrest of three suspects. Among them was Faison, who was in a cab
stopped by the police on April 11.
</P>
<P>
   When they sought to question him, he fled. When officers caught
him, they said, they found he had an illegal 9-mm automatic pistol.
Police had already recovered another gun which they said had been
used in the killing. Arrested on April 10 was a Newark man, James
Coker, who was said to have bragged about killing the officer, and
a 24-year-old East Orange resident, Terrance Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Faison died in police custody, Hurt, the Essex
County prosecutor, formally charged Everett, who appeared at his
arraignment with a black eye and a number of bruises. She defended
investigators and not only denied allegations by Everett's lawyers
that he was beaten by police, but said that her investigation of
Faison's death had found no evidence that he was beaten.

MARY BENSON, 80, WHO WROTE OF SOUTH AFRICA'S STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Mary Benson, an author, journalist and political
campaigner who wrote passionately about the struggle for racial
equality in her native South Africa, died at home in London on June
19, said her literary agent, Felicity Bryan. She was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Benson's books included a novel, ``At the Still Point,'' and
biographies of Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela, his wife at the
time, written while Mandela was still serving his long prison term
and decades before he would become president of South Africa. In
her memoir, ``A Far Cry: The Making of a South African,'' Benson
told how her early racial prejudice gave way to a wholehearted
repudiation of white minority rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, she grew close to many of the leading figures in
the anti-apartheid movement, and her tiny apartment in St. John's
Wood became an unofficial refuge for South Africans working for the
cause in London.
</P>
<P>
   It was Benson whom Mandela sought out one evening in 1962 when,
after slipping illegally out of South Africa to raise support
abroad, he made a quick side trip to London. She had been expecting
Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress; when she opened the
door, Mandela was standing beside him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think what I gave them to eat, because I am a very
indifferent cook, but it was quite an extraordinary evening,''
Benson recalled in 1996, describing how Mandela paced up and down
her apartment, brimming with ideas. ``He talked so excitedly and
with such enthusiasm. It was unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Benson was born into the privileged world of country clubs
and servants in white South Africa in 1919. Passionate about films
and bored by life at home, she traveled to Hollywood on a cargo
ship as a teen-ager, using a mix of charm and determination to win
interviews with Jimmy Stewart and other movie stars, about whom she
then wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Restless and daring, Benson served as an aide to various British
generals in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. She worked as
a volunteer with displaced persons after the war, before becoming
secretary to the director David Lean.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1948, when she read Alan Paton's ``Cry, the
Beloved Country'' that Benson saw her country with new eyes and
discovered the cause that was to be her life's passion. She began a
correspondence with Paton (she was also to develop intense
correspondences and lifelong friendships with Athol Fugard, among
others) and campaigned in London for the rights of black Africans.
She helped found the Africa Bureau with the Rev. Michael Scott, an
Anglican priest who championed Namibian independence and with whom
she fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   Benson returned to South Africa in 1957, becoming secretary of
the defense fund for the 156 people, Mandela among them, who had
been charged with treason for opposing the country's apartheid
laws. Compelled to leave the post when she became ill with a
debilitating form of arthritis that was to dog her throughout her
life, Benson turned her attention to writing. When the ANC was
banned, she continued to support its leaders, visiting Mandela when
he was forced underground and at least once accompanying him in a
car in which he posed as her chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   Among Benson's first books was a history of the outlawed ANC,
published in the United States as ``South Africa: The Struggle for
a Birthright.'' In 1964, after reporting on the political trials
that resulted in long prison terms for the ANC's members, Benson
was placed under house arrest and her passport was confiscated. She
left the country in 1966, returning only once in the next 24 years
_ for a month in 1968, to be at her father's deathbed _ but
continued to write about South Africa through the late 1990s. She
never married.
</P>
<P>
   Among other projects, Benson also edited Athol Fugard's
``Notebooks'' and wrote a number of radio plays for the BBC. She
was also the author of ``Athol Fugard and Barney Smith: Bare Stage,
a Few Props, Great Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   On the occasion of Benson's 80th birthday in December, Mandela
sent a message from South Africa. ``It reminds me of all the great
help you gave to me and my family while I was in prison,'' he
wrote. ``I send you all my thanks and appreciation of your generous
friendship over half a lifetime.''

IN EXPANSION EFFORT, FIDELITY REVISES MANAGEMENT AND UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the privately controlled financial giant
in Boston that manages nearly $1 trillion, shuffled its top
executives and reorganized its businesses Wednesday as part of its
effort to move beyond managing mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   James C. Curvey, 65, president and chief operating officer, said
he would leave both posts, but remain at the company. Curvey has
served for three years as the top executive under Edward C. Johnson
III, the chairman and chief executive of Fidelity and son of the
company's founder.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Reynolds, 48, will succeed Curvey as chief operating
officer, effective July 3, and will also be a vice chairman. He
currently runs Fidelity's institutional retirement plans. In his
new role, he will oversee that operation, as well as the brokerage
business.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Pozen, 53, president of FMR Co., the unit that
includes Fidelity's vast mutual fund management operations, was
also promoted to vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   During Curvey's tenure, Fidelity was transformed from the
largest mutual fund manager into a full-service asset management
company where investors could trade stocks online or from pagers
and hand-held devices, invest in initial public offerings, manage
their estates, set up charitable contributions and open retirement
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In an acknowledgment of the organization's growing complexity,
Curvey said Fidelity would take a more traditional corporate
structure and create three operating units overseen by vice
chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned 65 a couple weeks ago,'' said Curvey, who is a vice
chairman. ``It's time to move some younger people into key
management spots. This is important for the company's long-term
management planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Curvey will return to his previous job running Fidelity Capital
and Ventures, which now includes Fidelity's venture capital
investments and a host of other interests, including life insurance
and telecommunications holdings, as well as the transportation
company Boston Coach.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that the reorganization does not clarify is the
question of who will one day succeed Johnson, who turns 70 this
month. Reynolds and Pozen will report to Johnson. The title of
president will not be filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tipped the title to Reynolds, but not the power,'' said
James H. Lowell III, a former employee of Fidelity and editor of a
newsletter that tracks Fidelity. ``That's very Fidelity. It's all
about competition. I think it's very healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   A third contender to succeed Johnson is his eldest daughter,
Abigail P. Johnson, 38, a senior vice president who is the largest
shareholder of FMR Corp., the holding company that owns Fidelity
Investments. While some in the industry say she will one day run
the company, Fidelity itself did not indicate that possibility
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll stay in the same role,'' Curvey said. ``This
organization doesn't change that at all.''  &QL;

THAI DONOR TO DEMOCRATS TO PLEAD GUILTY 
</HEADLINE>
  By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Thai businesswoman at the center of the
investigation into how the Democratic Party raised money from
Asians in 1996 agreed Wednesday to plead guilty to funneling
$690,000 in illegal donations to the party.
</P>
<P>
   The businesswoman, Pauline Kanchanalak, will enter guilty pleas
to two felony counts. Her sister-in-law, Duangnet Kronenberg, who
assisted her in the scheme, has agreed to plead guilty to one
felony count, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The department said in a statement that Kanchanalak made the
illegal donations to gain access for herself and Thai business
executives to President Clinton and administration officials.
Public records showed that Kanchanalak attended at least 26 White
House events after Clinton's election in 1992. Clinton was present
at 10 of those events, and Vice President Al Gore attended two. On
three other occasions, Kanchanalak met with officials of the
National Security Council, the White House agency that coordinates
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The donations were illegal because Kanchanalak falsely
identified the donors, most of whom were foreigners and were thus
prohibited from making campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   More than $457,000 of the donations were provided to the
Democratic National Committee and five state Democratic Party
committees in connection with a White House ``coffee'' session at
the White House on June 18, Justice Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At that event, Kanchanalak and four Thai business associates
discussed U.S.-China policy with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One of those in attendance at the meeting was a client of
Kanchanalak's, Dhanin Chearvanont, a major Thai industrialist whose
company is considered the largest single foreign investor in China.
</P>
<P>
   Kanchanalak's lawyer said Wednesday that she had decided to
plead guilty because of what he said was a ``lengthy and aggressive
government prosecution that has completely consumed her life.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said prosecutors had threatened
to bring charges of international money laundering against
Kanchanalak if she did not plead guilty to some of the fund-raising
charges. Kanchanalak and Kronenberg both agreed to cooperate with
the investigation by the Justice Department's campaign financing
task force.

ADVERTISING: CRIES OF RACISM ENSNARE FORD IN ACTORS' STRIKE
</HEADLINE>
 By KEITH BRADSHER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Stung by accusations of racism for having used makeup
to darken the face of a white stunt driver during the filming of a
television commercial, the Ford Motor Co. said late Wednesday that
it would postpone filming new commercials until a nationwide strike
by unionized actors against advertising agencies is resolved and
that it would review its policies on makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, one of the nation's largest advertisers, acknowledged
criticism by the actors' unions that its advertising agency, Young
&AMP; Rubicam, darkened the nonunion driver's face during the filming
of a commercial for the Lincoln LS sports sedan on Saturday in Palm
Springs, Calif. Jim Trainor, a spokesman for Ford's Lincoln-Mercury
division, said that the company would not broadcast the disputed
footage and that the company did not approve of any activity that
could be construed as misrepresenting the ethnicity of an actor.
</P>
<P>
   The unions, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation
of Television and Radio Artists, accused Ford of making the stunt
driver appear to be a black man for a commercial that also featured
a nonunion black actor outside the car during another sequence.
Trainor disavowed any racist intent and said the features had been
darkened solely to make the driver less noticeable in the
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Young &AMP; Rubicam had initially dismissed objections by
the unions, which held a small protest in Los Angeles on Tuesday at
the offices of the Ford Dealers Advertising Association of Southern
California. The actors' unions ``know better than anyone that it is
standard practice to conceal the features of the driver in a car
commercial shoot,'' David Murphy, the president of Young &AMP;
Rubicam's office in Irvine, Calif., said in a statement. ``The
focus of car commercials has always been the car and not the
driver. In fact, a precision driver for car shoots typically wears
dark clothing, gloves, turtle neck and sometimes even a ski mask to
achieve a nondescript look.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy added in the statement that the driving sequence
featuring the stunt driver would be used in several commercials
including both white and black actors outside the vehicle. But
after a phone conversation with officials from the actors' unions,
Ford executives decided to discard the footage, halt filming during
the strike and begin talks with the unions on makeup policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a union labor issue, it's not a race issue,'' and Ford
does not want to become the center of attention in the strike,
Trainor said.
</P>
<P>
   Trainor said that although it was common for automakers to want
no more than a silhouette of a driver to be visible in a
commercial, the use of makeup during the filming on Saturday had
not been planned. ``If you're in Palm Springs and the light is
coming through the tinted glass more than you expected and you
don't have a ski mask, then you might bronze the guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trainor initially said Wednesday morning that the use of makeup
was common, but later said Ford's advertising staff could not
provide examples. Other advertising industry officials said the
darkening of stunt drivers' faces with makeup had never been
common. An official at another big auto advertising agency, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the strike, said
that his agency never used makeup, preferring tinted glass instead
to make the driver less visible and keep the emphasis on the car.
</P>
<P>
   Peter M. DeLorenzo, a longtime auto advertising manager who now
owns and runs autoextremist.com, a year-old Internet site for news
on the auto industry and auto racing, said that using makeup to
darken a stunt driver's features was unusual. ``I shot commercials
for 20 years; we never did that,'' said DeLorenzo, who worked for
four large auto advertising agencies during those years, although
not for Young &AMP; Rubicam. ``It was common to tint the glass just so
that whoever was driving wasn't prominent.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors' unions, which initially accused Ford of having
``revived the long-dead minstrel show,'' said they were pleased
with the company's decision to suspend filming of television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Trainor said that during the strike, no new commercials would be
filmed for Lincoln-Mercury or Ford brand cars and trucks or for
Ford's corporate image campaign. And he said he did not know if
European automakers owned by Ford _ Volvo, Jaguar and Aston Martin
_ would also stop filming.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began on May 1. Actors are now paid each time a
commercial is shown on network television but earn only a flat fee
for commercials used on cable. The actors want to be paid each time
for all network and cable ads, but the ad agencies want to change
all payments to a flat fee for all network and cable ads.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the latest flare-up in the strike. RSA U.S.A.,
a commercial production agency, was criticized by the unions and
civil rights groups last month for having promoted the opening of
an office in nonunion South Africa with an advertisement showing
the bare breasts of a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have also criticized as strike breakers the football
players Kurt Warner and Terrell Davis for filming a nonunion
Campbell's Soup ad and the basketball player Shaquille O'Neal for
shouting ``I'm going to Disneyland!'' for an instant television
commercial after the Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA championship on
Monday. Union membership is mandatory for all who appear in
commercials, including athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the filming of the Ford commercial comes at an
awkward time for the automaker, which is seeking greater public
recognition as a progressive company on safety and environmental
issues. Ford produces as many car and minivan models with the
federal government's top, five-star crash rating as all other
automakers combined. Tailpipe emissions from all sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks made by Ford are far cleaner than the
law requires. And Ford acknowledged the safety and environmental
drawbacks of sport utility vehicles at its annual meeting in
Atlanta last month, vowing to improve the vehicles in both
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Ford endured another embarrassing racial dispute four years ago
in connection with its advertising. The company and its advertising
agency in Europe, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, were criticized for having
superimposed white faces on four blacks and a Sikh in a photo of
British Ford workers that was used in a Ford advertising campaign
in Poland. Ford apologized then and paid $2,300 to compensate the
workers.

`MONDAY NIGHT' DECISION IS NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The identity of Al Michaels' new boothmates on ABC's ``Monday
Night Football'' should be known soon, even by Friday. If Dan Fouts
is one of the choices _ he is at least the leak of the week _ who
is the other?
</P>
<P>
   One imagines that Don Ohlmeyer, who is producing the ``Monday
Night'' overhaul, wants to stun the television world. Decent as
Fouts is, he would be a safe, traditional choice as his TV career
at CBS and ABC has never been memorable.
</P>
<P>
   In this convoluted episode of ``Secret Star Search,'' Fouts
could be Coach Ohlmeyer's decoy, faking a move from college
football but going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   One move made by ABC Wednesday was cutting Lesley Visser as
``Monday Night's'' sole sideline reporter. Ohlmeyer plans to hire
two reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the booth, though, Ohlmeyer must create credible buzz,
although he can't hire John Madden, Phil Simms, Terry Bradshaw,
Howie Long or Cris Collinsworth, and Jimmy Johnson didn't want to
unretire for Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't pick a more difficult time to pull something like
this off,'' one industry official said.
</P>
<P>
   The silly suggestions that Ohlmeyer cast comedians like Chris
Rock or Billy Crystal presumes that they are qualified to offer
much more than one-liners or will devote more than a sliver of
their busy schedules to football.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer's choice is said to be someone ignored by the news
media speculation about his overhaul of the post-Boomer Esiason
booth. That talent pool still includes the Teletubbies, Monica
Lewinsky and Eminem.
</P>
<P>
   An inspired choice would be ESPN's Andrea Kremer. She is ESPN's
best football reporter and highly respected by players. Before
ESPN, she worked at NFL Films as a producer, where she built her
knowledge of football's intricacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her greatest strength was preparation,'' said Steve Sabol, the
president of NFL Films. ``She would never go into anything
uninformed.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not widely known, but she would undoubtedly generate
enormous publicity as the first woman to call NFL games regularly.
Gayle Sierens called one regional game for NBC in 1988. Certainly,
Kremer's hiring would raise the attention level and critical
scrutiny accorded 30-year-old ``Monday Night.''
</P>
<P>
   She would be held to a higher standard because she is a woman
and monitored for her chemistry with her partners and the strength
of her voice.
</P>
<P>
   But if she succeeded in making a strong transition from live
reports and taped features to booth commentary, she would most
likely rope in female viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kremer has been overlooked by Ohlmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't been contacted, although I recommended her for the
sideline job,'' Sandy Montag, her agent, said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the notion of Kremer in the booth ``is not the craziest
idea in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``She has as much football knowledge as many men in
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Football smarts may not be the ticket for the ``Monday Night''
job. Controversy and unpredictability look like the prerequisites,
although there are few such personalities with those qualities.
Even Madden, unpredictable on his best days, has never been
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The gold standard for ``Monday Night'' controversy was Howard
Cosell, and he produced no known clones. When he quit the show in
1983, Cosell took all controversy with him as if he had invented
it.
</P>
<P>
   Rush Limbaugh auditioned for ABC, but his politics make him a
long shot, despite his Cosellian divisiveness. He also broke the
omerta by publicly discussing his tryout. Another disputatious
voice, Jim Rome, the host of cable's ``The Last Word,'' is locked
into a deal with Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   So as ABC operates under Ohlmeyer's cone of silence, we await
his bombshell _ if he actually has one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Networks Interactive, creator of the science fiction cult
classics Barbarian Moron and Whirl Girl, has acquired the
interactive science fiction assets of the Los Angeles-based
Centropolis Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   No price was disclosed for the acquisition..
</P>
<P>
   Centropolis has produced science fiction films like ``Stargate''
and ``Independence Day,'' and owns mothership.com, a sci-fi Web
site. Its Centropolis Interactive division will be merged with
USA's SCIFI.com, to become the largest presence in science fiction
interactive entertainment on the Internet, company executives said.
The site will be free to Web users, and not subscription based.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, said the producer Dean Devlin, who is a partner at
Centropolis Entertainment, is that the combined network, called
SCIFI.com, will attract not only hard-core fans, but ``broaden
science fiction to a lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask most people they say they like sci-fi movies,'' he
said in an interview Wednesday. The site would include a new slate
of entertainment programming, including films, music and online
games. ``It has to start with a dream,'' he added.

LAKERS HAVE THEIR DAY IN THE SUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A championship season that was part Shaq thunder,
part Kobe lightning, produced a celebration Wednesday that was all
sun and fun, with vows of another title run.
</P>
<P>
   Just 48 hours after clinching the Lakers' first championship
since 1988, they were promising a repeat in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown L.A. was hot and bright for the midday parade and rally
- an appropriate setting for the hottest, brightest team in the
NBA. Sunglasses were needed just to protect from the bright glare
bouncing off the Larry O'Brien Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   But no cue cards were needed for the Lakers as they addressed
about 100,000 fans outside Staples Center on 11th Street. They knew
just what the city wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long 12 years,'' said Kobe Bryant. ``We finally
brought the championship back to where it belongs, and that's here
in the city of Los Angeles. We're looking forward to coming back
next year and trying to do it again. Thank you for your support. We
love you all.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, Bryant set it up, and Shaquille O'Neal finished.
</P>
<P>
   The theme from ``Superman'' played, O'Neal put out his arms in
mock flight, then stirred up the faithful once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caaan youuuu dig it?'' the NBA Finals MVP bellowed. ``Like
Kobe said, the trophy is home, and where it belongs, and we're
gonna get another one next year. Caaan youuuu dig it?''
</P>
<P>
   All 14 players attended, together for perhaps a final time.
Third- leading scorer Glen Rice is a free agent who seems destined
to play elsewhere, but he used the occasion to make a public
commitment to stay if the team will re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you all, I look forward to being back here next
year to do it again,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency and the need to infuse new, young talent could also
mean the end for Laker veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, A.C. Green
and Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say I'm probably happier than anybody else on
this stage,'' Shaw enthused, ``because I took a different path to
get here. This is the seventh team I've been on. I finally came to
a team that won a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   He closed with a tribute to O'Neal, who helped Shaw come close
to the title once before, when the two were Orlando Magic teammates
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq, we would not be here without him - `The Big Champion,'
'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, O'Neal could not let the occasion pass without giving
himself one more Big Nickname in a season in which he adopted a new
one every few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, I am no longer `The Big Aristotle,' '' he said,
referring to the name he chose upon winning the regular-season MVP
award. ``I want to be known as `The Big Shakespeare.' Because it
was Shakespeare that said, `Some men are born great, some achieve
greatness, some have greatness thrust upon them,' and it was great
doing it this year for the city and for everybody else. And we're
going to try to get one next year. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson recalled bringing this group together for the
first time in a gym at UC Santa Barbara at training camp in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it shows what a group of people can put together to make
this many people feel great about basketball,'' he said. ``My hat
goes off to you. These guys put it together, and my coaching staff
and the management, (owner) Jerry Buss and (executive) Jerry
West.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks, confetti and Kool and the Gang's ``Celebration''
closed out the party.
</P>
<P>
   And for the lone member of the team who wore the uniform for the
last celebration, in 1988, it was the perfect ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be here once again,'' Green said.

HIGH STAKES IN ANNUAL, LAST-MINUTE WRANGLING IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With an unusual number of important issues
hanging in the balance, state lawmakers will convene here Thursday
for what is supposed to be the last time this year, having almost,
but not quite, struck deals on hate crimes, gun control and sexual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   This is Albany's annual high-wire act, in which Gov. George
Pataki, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate
majority leader, Joseph Bruno, each wait for the others to blink,
and much of the important business does not get done until the
last, frenzied days. But the stakes are higher than usual, given
the political and substantive weight of the issues under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   On issue after issue, officials in one or two of the three camps
have reported in the last few days that after intensive
negotiations there was an agreement in principle _ though the
complex and contentious work of bill-drafting remained _ only to
have one side or the other steadfastly deny any such agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, some of the criminal justice issues have
been linked, so that there may not, in the end, be deals on any of
them unless there are deals on all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be surprised if all of it comes together, and I
would not be surprised if none of it does,'' a top legislative aide
said Wednesday, as negotiations among the three leaders and their
staffs continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
   There have been sporadic talks on a bill to change the
Republicans' much-maligned rules for holding presidential
primaries. All sides agree an accord is still possible, but none
consider it highly likely, if only because the negotiators are
dealing with so many other issues.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other highly charged proposals that have been
discussed appear unlikely to produce agreement, including raising
the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.75; making information on every
doctor's history of malpractice suits, judgments and settlements
available to the public through a Web site; adding judges to the
New York City courts to relieve overcrowding; and easing
Rockefeller-era drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday was originally scheduled to be the last day of
the legislative session, but with so many issues unresolved,
Silver, a Democrat, and Bruno, a Republican, agreed to have the
Assembly and the Senate return for one day, Thursday. There is
nothing to prevent them from convening again later in the year, but
Bruno has ruled that out, saying that if there are no agreements
Thursday, the Senate will pass its own versions of several bills, a
take-it-or-leave-it gesture to the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of hate crimes, where there is no real disagreement,
has become mired in ego-driven squabbling, and while a deal still
seems likely, it is far from certain. The Assembly and the Senate
have passed similar bills providing longer criminal penalties for
crimes whose victims are singled out due to bias based on race,
sex, religion, age, sexual orientation or disability, an idea
supported by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that for some time, there has been agreement on a
package of gun controls, much like those proposed earlier this year
by the governor, that would be among the most restrictive in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But the gun bill has been tied to an overhaul of New York's
sexual assault laws, an issue that got new impetus with last week's
attacks on women in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a Republican, and the Senate leaders are seeking
tougher penalties for a variety of sex crimes, and they want to
give prosecutors the right to appeal sentences and bail settings in
sex crime cases. The Assembly's version raises some penalties, but
focuses on improving services for victims, including ensuring
coverage of emergency room services and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have made concessions, particularly the Democrats,
but there are still some significant differences.

HEARING SPURS OPTIMISM AMONG DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON - Having finally had their day to speak, many of the
Dodgers players emerged from Wednesday's six-hour appeals hearing
optimistic their suspensions would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   In what was described as a tedious, detailed presentation of new
evidence and candid statements in support of the players' actions
during a May 16 fight at Wrigley Field, players union
representatives and players gave their versions of what happened
that night to Paul Beeston, chief operating officer for the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston now must sort through the information before ruling on
the suspension appeals. Sixteen players, three coaches and an
on-field assistant were suspended a total of 89 games and $77,000
from the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players had a chance to say what they had to say,''
players association general counsel Gene Orza said from his hotel
room Wednesday night. ``I would not expect a decision within the
next 48 hours. There's a lot of information for Paul has to
digest.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson, vice president of on-field operations for
baseball, handed out the suspensions and was at the hearing, but he
declined comment on the appeals.
</P>
<P>
   When the appeals were filed, the Dodgers and the union contended
many of the suspensions would be reduced or dropped once the
appeals were heard. After being given the chance to explain their
actions to Beeston, the overwhelming feeling was many of the
suspended parties, including many of the core players, would have
their suspensions dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you don't want to look bad and reduce the thing, but I
felt like I shouldn't get one day or get fined one dollar,'' said
Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield, suspended five games and fined
$5,000. ``Just by the fact that (Robinson) made the decision
without hearing everybody's views, are you going to put your pride
aside and say, 'OK I was wrong?' I know that's the million dollar
question, but if you don't put your pride aside, that's unfair
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, save Alan Mills (he was traded to Baltimore) and
attorneys for the players association each spoke. The players
explained to Beeston their thought process during the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence was presented on behalf of the central figure in the
case, Dodgers backup catcher Chad Kreuter. He was the first one in
the stands after allegedly being struck in the back of the head and
having his cap stolen. Kreuter's agent, Scott Boras, said Kreuter
was only trying to restrain the individual until security was able
to move in.
</P>
<P>
   Also presented during the hearing were the findings of director
of security for Major League Baseball, Kevin Hallinan, which stated
there was insufficient security at Wrigley Field. Also introduced
to Beeston was a doctors note stating Kreuter suffered a sprained
neck from the original slap in the head that triggered he incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the evidence, the film or video and the stills,
portray a very proper line of what went on, and I think they have a
very sound foundation and new evidence they didn't have before,''
Boras said. ``The reason that Chad was in the stands, and it's now
in evidence, is he was assaulted and not that somebody took his
cap. Chad's had his cap taken, as many major-leaguers have, many
times, but he was trying to prevent a perpetrator from leaving the
scene of a crime and there was no security around.''
</P>
<P>
   Each player got to go through their role, and their purpose, in
the altercation, which is what made the ordeal so laborious. The
hearing came nearly a month after Robinson ruled May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's finally coming to an end,'' pitcher Darren
Dreifort said. ``It makes you feel bad for all people that have to
go through murder trials that get dragged out for a year, two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez and F.P. Santangelo were each suspended five games.
Mike Fetters was suspended four games. Antonio Osuna, Chan Ho Park,
Terry Adams, Eric Karros, Shawn Green, Eric Gagne, Dreifort, Todd
Hundley, Geronimo Berroa, Onan Masaoka were each suspended three
games.

WHITE HOUSE ADMITS POSSIBLE PRIVACY VIOLATIONS OF COMPUTER USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (DELETES names of Web sites in 12th graf)  
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House conceded Wednesday that it may have
violated federal privacy guidelines when it ordered its Office of
National Drug Control Policy to stop using a software device that
tracks computer users who view the government's anti-drug
advertisements on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To monitor traffic on its Internet sites for children and their
parents, the White House's drug policy office has employed computer
files known as ``cookies,'' which are placed in computers
electronically _ usually without the knowledge of users _ to
monitor their Internet travels.
</P>
<P>
   The software is widely used on many commercial web sites to
record information about the shopping habits and other interests of
their users. But White House officials said that they saw a
distinction between companies tracking customers and the government
doing similar monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't have to worry when they're getting
information from the government that the government is getting
information from them,'' said an administration official who worked
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The firm that installed the devices, DoubleClick, a New York
advertising company that specializes in the Internet, said it used
the monitoring software to measure which ads were most effective in
sending computer users to the drug office's Web sites. The
arrangement was set up by Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, which handles
the drug office's advertising account.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick outraged privacy-rights advocates and prompted an
investigation of the company by the Federal Trade Commission
earlier this year when it said it would merge anonymous data about
Web surfers with personal information it has in other databases.
The company has since suspended the plan, awaiting the outcome of
negotiations between the industry and the FTC on voluntary privacy
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally anonymous,'' a DoubleClick spokesman, Josh Isay,
said of the monitoring it does for the drug policy office. ``It's
not used for profiling. It's not shared with anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Most large commercial Internet sites, including those of The New
York Times and other news organizations, make use of cookies.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House, concerned about privacy violations, ordered
the practice stopped after it was reported this week by Scripps
Howard News Service. The White House also required the destruction
of any data gathered by DoubleClick and another contractor, the
Coleman Design Group of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Coleman Design, visitors to a drug office Web
site for parents were tracked by software that had been installed
without the knowledge of even drug office officials, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take all steps necessary to halt these practices
now,'' the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said. White House
officials said that they did not know if other government sites
monitored users but that if they did the practice would stop.
</P>
<P>
   The drug policy office operates two anti-drug Web sites, one for
children and another for parents . It will spend $12 million this
year, part of a $130 million advertising budget, to direct computer
users to those sites.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the drug policy office's campaign on the
Internet, computer users who visit certain youth-oriented Web sites
receive banner anti-drug ads at the top of their screens. If the
users click on those ads to reach the drug policy office, cookies
are installed, which can then track their movements.
</P>
<P>
   The drug policy office also made deals with various search
engines so that computer users who search the Internet with
drug-oriented terms such as ``pot'' or ``weed'' or ``huffing'' _ a
slang word used for sniffing inhalants _ would receive anti-drug
banner advertisements on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Drug policy office officials said they had no idea they had
crossed any lines of propriety. ``We thought we were doing the
right thing,'' said Donald Maple, a senior policy analyst at the
office, ``and we thought we were being very sensitive to the nature
of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, sent a firmly
worded letter to the drug office Wednesday asking officials to
explain how they had reached such arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta's directive to the drug policy office Wednesday was not
the first time it has been forced to scale back its anti-drug
campaign. In January, drug policy officials said they would stop
scrutinizing scripts of television shows under a widely criticized
financial agreement with the networks that had encouraged them to
include anti-drug messages in the plots of shows.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the two-year-old arrangement, White House drug policy
officials reviewed more than 100 episodes of shows like ``E.R.''
and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' before they ran. Drug policy officials
said they would continue to reward networks for shows with strong
anti-drug themes, but that they would not review the shows'
contents until they had been televised.

LAZIO FACES UPHILL ROUTE FOR GAY VOTERS' SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Think of running for statewide office in New York as
a series of treacherous political calculations. Especially if you
are a Republican in a Democratic state. Especially when it comes to
gay rights, at a time when your party wants to show a tolerant
face, as you collect support from conservatives not often
sympathetic to gay causes.
</P>
<P>
   Do you, for example, campaign through the dairy farms around
Saratoga, and thus shore up critical upstate support? Or march down
Fifth Avenue in Manhattan with thousands of gays and lesbians for
the Heritage of Pride parade and thereby show an effort to reach
out to voters not normally considered your base?
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio _ he of conservative backing but a generally
moderate record in Congress _ is facing such choices in his bid for
the U.S. Senate, one of a number of decisions that gays and
lesbians within his party and out are closely watching. Not to
mention nongay voters, in a race that polls have indicated is
essentially tied. This time, he chose the cows. And now, naturally,
comes the noise.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a speech to Bronx
County Democrats on Wednesday night briefly mentioned his decision
not to march as an example of the differences between their
campaigns. And a group of gay advocates ridiculed his choice on the
steps of City Hall as proof that he was a conservative in moderate
clothing. And even some surprised Republicans questioned the
decision, albeit quietly, as something that, in the words of one,
``would not help Rick Lazio in the gay community, adding: ``Their
support is neutral at best. But it would not hurt him with his own
constituency. There was no downside to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Lazio, said the candidate should be
judged not on attendance at one parade but on what he considered a
solid voting record in Congress on issues of concern to gays and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not just the parade that has people worked up.
His decision not to march comes amid a series of tests in recent
days on gay rights, an issue that his party has long wrestled with.
</P>
<P>
   Gay supporters in his party are watching what stance he may take
_ none as of Wednesday night _ on a bill the Senate passed Tuesday
that would make hate attacks on gays a federal crime. House
Republican leaders are expected to try to kill it, though there is
some feeling that it may come up for a vote before Election Day.
McLagan said Lazio would wait to see what version, if any, came up
in the House before stating an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who has declined to co-sponsor previous legislation in
the House related to hate crimes, said he backed a hate crimes bill
that passed in the Republican-controlled New York state Senate two
weeks ago. It is expected to sail through the Democratic-controlled
Assembly and be signed by Gov. George E. Pataki, a moderate
Republican who is trumpeting Lazio's candidacy. Lazio declared his
support only after the bill passed and after first wavering on
whether he supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Gays make up an estimated 5 to 7 percent of the New York
electorate, sizable enough to influence a very tight race. But that
may not be the point.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, sensitive to charges of right-wing extremism, have
been moving toward the center in the last several years and have
taken steps to show tolerance as a way to draw independent and
``swing'' voters who hold no strong allegiance to either party.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans,
a gay political organization based in Washington, said a remarkable
shift has occurred in that candidates across the country now reach
out to a group they had previously shunned. Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas met with gay political representatives last year in what
Tafel termed an unprecedented meeting for a presumptive Republican
presidential nominee. The New York chapter of the Log Cabin
Republicans exulted last month over acceptance of its first
delegation to a state-nominating convention and has posted a
picture on its Web site of its chapter leader shaking hands with
William D. Powers, the state Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, Tafel said, has a mixed voting record on issues of
concern to gays, consistently supporting financing for several
federal AIDS programs, for example, while declining to co-sponsor
the hate crimes legislation in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, Lazio has faithfully attended Log Cabin
briefings and is generally seen as a friend to the group; the
president of the New York chapter said it had been promised a
meeting with Lazio within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay Democrats are attacking him more out of loyalty to their
party,'' he said. ``This is partisan politics and not gay
politics.''

PROTESTERS TAKE OVER NIKE WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Protesters took control of the Nike Web site on Wednesday and
redirected visitors to a site urging organizations to gather at and
disrupt a world economic summit planned for later this year in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, the footwear company, said the action made its site
inaccessible for up to 7 hours to some visitors starting at 10 a.m.
Eastern time Wednesday, and the company said it was working with
law enforcement officials to determine the origin of and group
responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it'll be too hard to find out who did it,''
said Corby Casler, a company spokeswoman, adding that it was
unclear whether the company or the government would be able to take
any action in response to the attack. ``Knowing who did it and
being able to prove it are two different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Casler said that Web site that was attacked is the main
e-commerce site for Nike, but said it was too soon to tell whether
the company lost revenue, and, if so, how much.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, though it has come under attack for its treatment of
workers at overseas factories, which critics allege are sweatshops,
is not the first to have its Web site redirected or defaced by
so-called hacktivists. Groups opposing a variety of corporate and
government activities have increasingly taken to cyberspace to put
their own messages in place of an institution's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Nike site was redirected to a site of an
organization called S11 Alliance based in Australia. On the site,
the group is described as a network of groups and individuals
concerned about ``the growth of corporate power and the direction
of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if S11 was involved in the actual redirection.
E-mail inquiries sent to S11 were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's Web site calls for protesters to use
nonviolent means to shut down the World Economic Forum 2000, a
gathering of economists, academicians, executives and government
officials, to be held on Sept. 11 to Sept. 13 in Melbourne,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The site does not specify particular grievances against Nike,
except to include it on a list of World Economic Forum
participants, along with companies such as Exxon, Honeywell,
McDonald's, Phillip-Morris and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike is used to dealing with this type of thing,'' Casler
said.

WRESTLER'S BEST MOVE MAY HAVE BEEN TO COLORADO

<P>
   DALLAS _ Kerry McCoy didn't want to chance any more near misses.
</P>
<P>
   He had already lost a berth in the super-heavyweight finals at
the 1998 freestyle wrestling World Championships, after a
controversial decision overturned his semifinals victory.
</P>
<P>
   He had already seen, too, a berth in the 1999 Worlds slip away
when he lost his final World Trials bout to Stephen Neal, after he
had become the only man to defeat Neal that year.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, a 1994 and 1997 NCAA heavyweight champion for Penn State,
didn't want another near miss when it came to the 2000 Olympic
team. So in September he decided he couldn't afford any near misses
with his focus. He left his job as a Penn State assistant wrestling
coach and moved to the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   By moving to Colorado, McCoy has brought his Olympic goal
closer. He defeated Neal, who had gone on to win the 1999 World
title, at the USA Wrestling nationals in April. The victory earned
McCoy a berth in the finals of the U.S. Olympic Team Trials, which
start today at Reunion Arena in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be bitter and say, `Well, my time is gone,' or say,
`He's done it, but I can beat him.' I chose to look at it as the
latter,'' he said. ``The main thing is to make the Olympic team,
and \Rthe move\S has put me in great position.''
</P>
<P>
   With his berth in the finals, McCoy again has the upper hand on
Neal, whom he defeated in the 1997 NCAA finals. The past season has
provided a big boost of confidence for McCoy, who took full
advantage while Neal recovered from post-Worlds shoulder surgery.
McCoy has 2000 World Cup and Pan American Championships titles to
his credit, as well as a 16-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   His coach at the Olympic Training Center, 1992 Olympic champion
Kevin Jackson, believes McCoy will continue that dominance in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just needed to put himself in an environment where
he could get quality workouts, and also work on things that
opponents would try to do to him,'' Jackson said. ``I felt that
would put him over the top. He was very close on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   While on his own, McCoy let his freestyle training sometimes
take a backseat to other duties. In addition to his assistant
coaching job with the Nittany Lions, he also served as chairman of
the NCAA Student-Athlete Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, a 1992 junior world champion, did better than many
athletes despite his outside interests. In 1995-96 he took a
redshirt year at Penn State and finished third at the 1996 Olympic
Team Trials. After finishing fifth at the 1998 U.S. nationals, he
won the World Trials before his controversial loss at Worlds.
</P>
<P>
   At the Worlds in Iran, McCoy had defeated Alexis Rodriguez of
Cuba 1-1 on a referee's decision in the semifinals. The Cuban team
protested, and FILA, the governing body of the sport, reviewed the
match. Instead of having the two athletes wrestle again, FILA gave
Rodriguez a 4-1 victory. Rodriguez went on to win the world title,
while McCoy finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy just missed a chance at qualifying for the 1999 Worlds. In
the U.S. team trials finals in June, Neal won the first bout of the
best-of-three series, 2-1, in overtime. McCoy won the next bout,
3-1, in overtime, then lost the third bout 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The loss prompted McCoy to move to the Olympic Training Center.
Since then, with his room and board paid for, he has worked
full-time at wrestling, surrounded by top-level training partners
and coaches. He believes the extra training showed at nationals,
where he got the early jump on Neal in the finals and won, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to let him control the pace of the match. That's
the game you play,'' McCoy said. ``I've definitely gotten better on
the bottom, and learned to turn guys better. But when you're
training like this, the big thing is you don't tend to doubt
yourself as much.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's finals, McCoy will meet the winner of the
challenge tournament, which takes place today and tomorrow. He said
he cannot afford to assume it will be Neal he sees in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two to three guys who are really good. If it's
Steve, after nationals he's going to be coming that much harder,''
he said. ``But I've wrestled all the top guys in the world and
beaten them all. My time is not past.''

POLITICS SEEN IN TIMING OF GAS PRICE PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Bay Area gas prices soared to a record
$1.86 a gallon in April, there were no accusations of price gouging
from the White House, no talk of subpoenas being issued to
oil-industry executives and no far-reaching political uproar.
</P>
<P>
   But when gas prices in the Midwest rocketed into the same
stratosphere this week, Washington went into full hissy-fit mode,
demanding action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an election year,'' said Tyler Dann, an oil-industry
analyst with Banc of America Securities in Houston, Texas. ``This
whole thing is a politically motivated event.''
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, California consumer advocates expressed
frustration yesterday that Washington waited until now to embrace
gas prices as an important issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly unfair,'' said Dan Jacobson, consumer program
director for the California Public Interest Research Group in
Sacramento. ``It would have been great for the federal government
to look at this earlier, when California drivers were getting
gouged at the pump.''
</P>
<P>
   Although state Attorney General Bill Lockyer launched a probe
into California's sky-high gas prices _ resulting in no immediate
solutions _ the federal government has been virtually silent
regarding the plight of Golden State motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're perceived as being a rich area,'' said Linda Sherry,
spokeswoman for Consumer Action, a San Francisco grassroots
organization. ``People pooh-pooh our representatives when they say,
`poor Bay Area.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation
into California's high gas prices more than two years ago, in part
due to pressure from California Sen. Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   But that probe is all but invisible compared to the FTC's
high-profile assault on pump prices in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Katz, a spokesman for the commission in Washington, D.C.,
said the California probe is a ``nonpublic investigation,'' which
means that the FTC is not required to announce its findings, or
even to confirm whether a probe is under way at all.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, confirmation of the Midwest probe came from no less
an authority than FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky, and members of
Congress have been told that subpoenas of oil-industry executives
will be issued shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California investigation is different from the
investigation in the Midwest because it's a significantly more
complicated type of investigation,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say how the California case is more complicated
than that of the Midwest, or why the Midwest probe appears to have
been given a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   Katz added that no details of the West Coast investigation would
be divulged by the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GAS22 (81847 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But in a letter to the FTC chairman yesterday, Boxer noted that
``numerous'' subpoenas for oil-industry pricing documents have been
issued as part of the California investigation, and that ``evidence
of harassment and intimidation'' has been uncovered relating to oil
companies' treatment of independent dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I understand that building a complex antitrust case
takes considerable time, I am disappointed that the FTC's
investigation has not yet concluded and brought tangible results
for California consumers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein called
on the FTC to examine recent jumps in gas prices nationwide ``and
to ensure that consumers in California and the Midwest are not
subject to undue price hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   As gas prices climbed past the $2 mark in the Chicago and
Milwaukee areas, Vice President Al Gore adopted a considerably more
assertive tone in a statement issued late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely concerned about the conduct of the oil
companies that may have led to these unreasonable price
increases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that oil company profits surged by nearly 500 percent in
the first half of the year, Gore said that ``these enormous and
unreasonable profits suggest that big oil is gouging American
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Republican presidential rival Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas told reporters in Los Angeles yesterday that Gore himself
is partly to blame. ``I want to remind people that this
administration is devoid of an energy policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also faulted the Clinton administration for being unable to
spur the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost
production.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers, meeting in Vienna, agreed yesterday to increase
output by 3 percent, or about 700,000 barrels a day. But analysts
said this would do little to reduce pump prices in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's enough,'' said Banc of America's Dann.
``If you think prices today are uncomfortable, they're going to
stay uncomfortable for the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northern California branch of the American Automobile
Association said Tuesday that Bay Area gas prices are holding
steady around an average $1.70 for a gallon of self-serve regular
unleaded _ about 25 cents above year-ago levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``When California was trying to draw attention to high gas
prices, the rest of the nation wasn't experiencing the same thing
and so it wasn't seen as a big problem,'' said Paul Moreno, a
spokesman for the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe with what's going on in the Midwest right now, that will
change,'' he said.

 MP3 SUMMIT ATTRACTS TOP GADGET PRODUCERS  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA  
 c. 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ While major record labels are fretting over how to
deal with the popularity of the file-sharing program Napster,
consumer electronics manufacturers are rushing to cash in on it.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known manufacturers such as RCA, Sony and Samsung showed up
at the two-day MP3 Summit here to promote a spate of new digital
players that are about to flood the market. In one measure of how
big the field is growing, Texas Instruments has designed digital
signal processors used in more than 30 portable audio players.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the original Diamond Rio MP3 player, which stored
about an hour of music, this new generation of digital jukeboxes
lets music fans take hundreds, if not thousands, of songs out on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   For example, HanGo Electronics Inc. of South Korea shipped a
second version of its Personal Jukebox this week. The $800 device
stores about 100 hours of music, the equivalent of 1,500 songs, in
a box that's about 6 inches long and 3 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our customers are travelers,'' said Mike Hamer, sales
director for MP3factorydirect.com, the San Diego Web site that
handles sales of the Personal Jukebox. ``You can fly from here to
Australia and never hear the same song twice.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar product set to go on sale later this year is Creative
Lab's Nomad Jukebox, a 14-ounce device the size of a CD player but
also capable of storing 6 gigabytes of MP3, WMA or .WAV files.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rapidly emerging jukebox categories cuts the desktop
computer out of the equation with an all-in-one jukebox plugged
into the home stereo or television to handle MP3s, CDs, DVDs,
e-mail and about everything else except the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to get MP3 beyond just the tech community,''
said Dave Arland, public relations director for Thomson Consumer
Electronics, which makes products under the RCA brand. ``I want to
get my mother into MP3s.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson debuted five new versions this week of the Lyra portable
digital music player that it introduced at last year's MP3 Summit.
RCA plans to have the new models, including a $300, 2-by-2 inch
player and a $400 bookshelf MP3-CD stereo system, on retail store
shelves in various stages between now and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The last on the market will be RCA's Digital Media Manager, a
``computer dressed up like an audio component,'' that will cost
less than $1,000, Arland said. The device can store more than 2,000
MP3 songs and play DVDs and CDs. And using a regular TV set, the
unit can be used to organize songs by genre, along with accessing
data like TV program listings from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MP322 (79002 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The company has identified a certain class of consumers who may
be scared of computers, particularly older consumers who did not
grow up with a computer mouse in their hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've identified them as D.I.F.M. _ Do It for Me,'' Arland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a lesser-known company called ZapMedia.com Inc. of
Atlanta also displayed its ZapStation, another Internet-connected
device that can store 10,000 MP3-compressed songs, organize play
lists, plays CDs and DVDs and send and receive e-mail. ZapMedia,
which is trying to land deals with broadband providers that would
lower retail costs for consumers, signed a $270 million partnership
last month with the Gannett Co. to link the ZapStation to Internet
content, such as news from USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Another player in the field is Lydstrom Inc., a Boston company
that started selling its SongBank SL machine on the Internet last
week. The $800 unit can store a digital music collection of up to
7,000 songs. The product can also copy, or rip, songs from CDs in
one-quarter of the actual playing time without the need for a
desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Diamond Multimedia's new Rio Receiver is able
to play music streamed from a home computer through existing phone
lines to other rooms in the house. The company also unveiled its
newest Rio 600 digital audio player, which sports a sleeker design
and the ability to expand from its base of 32 megabytes of storage
up to 340 MB.
</P>
<P>
   For a virtually unlimited supply of songs, a San Diego company
called Fun eBusiness displayed the prototype for an
Internet-connected jukebox that is designed like the old
1950s-style Wurlitzer that used to be the centerpiece of many a
malt shop.
</P>
<P>
   This modern Wurlitzer, which the company hopes to roll out in
August, has a catalog of more than 200,000 MP3 songs and will be
marketed to bars and restaurants.

HANDSPRING LOOKS GOOD TO INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KELLY YAMANOUCHI  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Handspring Inc. saw its stock surge 35 percent
on its first day of trading yesterday, a signal of investor
optimism in the company's handheld product and the strength of that
market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Handspring rose $6.94 to $26.94 as the Mountain View,
Calif., company ended the day with a market capitalization of $3.37
billion. By comparison, Handspring's chief rival, Palm Inc., rose
to a high of $165 on its first day of trading before plunging to
yesterday's closing price of $27.75.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were undoubtedly impressed with the two executives
leading Handspring: Chairman and Chief Product Officer Jeffrey
Hawkins and President and Chief Executive Officer Donna Dubinsky.
The two founded Palm but left the company two years ago after it
became a part of 3Com Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, with Hawkins behind it, it was a good deal, and
investors know that,'' said Michael Falbo, an analyst with IPO Pros
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   James Johnson, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, agreed. ``You've
got the founders of Palm in management, they do have a
differentiated product, there is a lot of movement in PDA (personal
digital assistant) space overall.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of HANDSPRI (70637 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  However, the path leading to yesterday's impressive performance
was not smooth. The company had initially planned to raise up to
$300 million but was advised to lower its prices after Palm stock
plummeted in April.
</P>
<P>
   Handspring eventually decided to sell 10 million shares at $20
each, raising $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Handspring's Visor handhelds are similar to the Palm III line,
but they include a unique slot, called Springboard, that lets users
add devices such as cellular phones, MP3 players and digital
cameras. Handspring's lowest-priced configuration is also slightly
cheaper than Palm's entry-level models.
</P>
<P>
   Handspring's entry into the handheld market comes at a time when
consumers increasingly are turning to portable devices such as
notebook computers, handhelds and cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company's filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission indicated that the number of installed handheld
computers will reach 32.5 million units in 2003, from 8.2 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Handspring is going to shake up retail a bit,''
Johnson said. ``They bring to the table another option.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of HANDSPRI (70637 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Analysts were impressed with Handspring's showing yesterday given
the shaky condition of the IPO market. ``The IPO market has been
relatively weak, and the fact that Handspring was able to do so
well actually was an exception rather than the rule,'' said Steven
Tuen, an analyst with IPO Value Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Handspring can successfully compete against Palm remains
to be seen. Thus far, it has gained 31 percent of the U.S. retail
electronic organizer market compared with 57 percent for Palm.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuen said Handspring will have its hands full. ``Palm is so
much larger and will prove to be a fierce competitor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the analyst said Handspring will not necessarily be in
for the roller-coaster ride that Palm has taken. ``I think the
investors that went into Handspring learned from the experience,''
he said.

A SCRAMBLE TO SALVAGE SPRINT-WORLDCOM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct wording at end of 10th graf, which begins:
Worldcom faces...)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing mounting opposition from regulators to its $115 billion
deal to acquire Sprint, WorldCom is considering selling broad
swaths of Sprint's operations, including Sprint's entire
long-distance unit, people close to the companies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continue between the company and the Justice
Department, which is reviewing the deal's antitrust implications in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Mario Monti, head of the European Commission's competition
ministry, now appears inclined to block the deal over concern that
the combined company would have too much control over the world's
long-distance telephone market as well as a stranglehold on
Internet traffic in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the deal involves two American companies, the
European Commission has the power to block it. The commission,
based in Brussels, Belgium, is the executive arm of the 15-nation
European Union. It claims jurisdiction over any merger involving
companies that do more than $200 million in business in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear since the deal was announced last year that
the combined company would at least have to sell Sprint's Internet
business, and the Justice Department appears to have accepted that
element of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the European regulators would prefer that the combined
company spin off WorldCom's UUNET Internet operation, the world's
No. 1 Internet carrier. WorldCom executives have said that they
would rather scrap the acquisition altogether than sell UUNET.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, is mainly concerned about the
power a combined Sprint-WorldCom would hold over the long-distance
telephone business in the United States, according to people close
to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's chief executive, has long been
prepared to sell off Sprint's consumer long-distance operation as
well as the Sprint brand. But the Justice Department appears also
to want a divestiture of Sprint's unit that sells long-distance
services to business customers. WorldCom was built on serving
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the approval discussions said Wednesday that
WorldCom expected its talks with the Justice Department to conclude
by the beginning of next week, at the latest. Monti is to meet this
week with regulators and officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom faces particular resistance in Europe, in part because
many European officials believe it failed to follow through
properly on a pledge to spin off the MCI Communications' Internet
business after WorldCom agreed to buy MCI in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   To win approval of that acquisition, WorldCom promised to sell
MCI's Internet business to Cable and Wireless of Britain. But Cable
and Wireless later complained to the European Commission that the
sale was incomplete, failing to include some employees as well as
some contracts. WorldCom settled the dispute privately, and the
European Commission did not pursue the issue. But the affair left a
bad taste with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once burned, twice shy,'' said Maurits Dolmans, an antitrust
lawyer in Brussels for Cleary, Gottlieb Steen &AMP; Hamilton. ``This
time the commission is going to make very, very sure that any
spinoff of Sprint's Internet business is carried out quickly,
fully, completely and will be entirely enforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the European Commission's rules, the case must be decided
by July 5. But the European and U.S. regulators are almost sure to
coordinate their demands.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps in recognition of the inevitable, WorldCom is now
considering a plan to sell off Sprint's entire long-distance
business, in addition to Sprint's Internet operation. Such a plan
would almost surely appease the regulators but would skew the
financial plan that underpinned the acquisition in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the deal is Sprint's wireless telephone
operation, one of the biggest in the United States. Neither
WorldCom nor the old MCI owned a significant wireless network, and
WorldCom hopes to generate a lot more revenue by adding Sprint's
wireless offerings to its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sprint's wireless unit is growing quickly, it remains
highly unprofitable. Last year, it lost $2.5 billion on $3.2
billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the main attraction of WorldCom's stock has long
been its robust growth in per-share earnings. With the exception of
its acquisition of the Wiltel communications network a few years
ago, WorldCom has shied away from acquisitions that would dilute
its per-share earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's wireless unit trades as a ``tracking stock,'' which
helps isolate its losses from the financial results of the parent
company. But in deciding to pay $115 billion for Sprint, WorldCom
was counting on billions of dollars of cost savings from combining
the Sprint and WorldCom long-distance operations.
</P>
<P>
   But if WorldCom is forced to sell Sprint's long-distance
operation, it will not be able to realize those savings, throwing
into question the financial structure of the original deal. One way
out of this quandary would be to sell Sprint's long-distance unit
to another company that could generate similar cost savings. But if
the Sprint long-distance unit were sold to, say, a foreign company
or a Bell local carrier, the cost savings that could be realized
would be far smaller.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, unless it could renegotiate the deal with Sprint,
WorldCom would effectively end up paying a lot more than it had
planned for Sprint's wireless operation. That raises the prospect
that selling off Sprint's long-distance business in exchange for
regulatory approval would end up a Pyrrhic victory.

<P>
   Dr. Elvin Abraham Kabat, a retired Columbia University
microbiologist who contributed substantially to the field of
immunology and the fundamental understanding of antibodies, died
last Friday at a nursing home in North Falmouth, Mass. Kabat, a
former resident of Manhattan, was 85.
</P>
<P>
   He was a founder of immunochemistry, the study of the chemical
reactions and phenomena of immunity. In that, he continued the work
of his mentor, Dr. Michael Heidelberger of Columbia, who was
regarded as the father of modern immunology.
</P>
<P>
   Kabat was Heidelberger's first graduate student in the 1930s,
when Heidelberger established that antibodies were proteins. Armed
with that insight, Kabat vastly extended the research into their
chemical composition and activity, including their roles as a
component of gamma globulin, the fraction of blood serum used to
combat infectious diseases like measles and hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the two scientists shared Columbia University's Louisa
Gross Horwitz Prize for outstanding research in biochemistry. Their
association endured 59 years until Heidelberger's death in 1991 at
age 103.
</P>
<P>
   Kabat was honored that year with the country's highest award for
scientific achievement, the National Medal of Science. It cited him
for ``his seminal contributions in the field of immunology, and for
bringing the field to its present prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   Antibodies, and specifically gamma globulin, are produced by the
body to counter toxins, bacteria and other antigens. Kabat set the
course for mapping their molecular structure.
</P>
<P>
   He compiled a comprehensive body of analyses, measurements and
other data into an atlas published by the National Institutes of
Health, which distributed it as a reference to researchers
worldwide. He also traced sugar units in blood substances, which
explained different immunological responses stimulated by blood
groups A, B and O.
</P>
<P>
   His studies shed light on the basic mechanisms of
immunohematology and blood banking. He also developed a laboratory
technique used in the study of multiple sclerosis and other human
autoimmune diseases, in which the body's immune system attacks
other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Manhattan and graduated from City College in
1932. He received a master's in 1934 and a doctorate in 1937 in
biochemistry at Columbia, after which he spent a year in Uppsala,
Sweden, as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Columbia faculty in 1941 and successively held
professorships in microbiology, and human genetics and development.
He retired in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Besides publishing hundreds of scientific articles, he was the
author or co-author of several textbooks. He was a member of the
National Academy of Sciences and a consultant to the National
Institutes of Health. He also sat on a panel of the World Health
Organization that established training programs for immunologists
from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Kabat is survived by his wife of 57 years, Sally Lennick Kabat;
three sons, Jon Kabat-Zinn of Lexington, Mass., Geoffrey, of New
Rochelle, N.Y., and David, of Pelham, N.Y.; and six grandchildren.

GUILTY PLEA IS ACCEPTED IN STRANGLING DEATHS OF 8 WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ A 28-year-old man admitted Wednesday that
he strangled eight women here over two years, entering a guilty
plea that will spare him the possibility of execution.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Kendall L. Francois, had confessed details of the
murders when he was arrested in 1998, police said, but he pleaded
not guilty to charges of first-degree murder at his indictment.
Later, when Francois tried to change his plea to guilty _ a step
that would avoid the possibility of execution _ the Dutchess County
district attorney, William V. Grady, refused to accept it, saying
he wanted to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Grady said Wednesday that he still favored execution, but that
he allowed Francois to plead guilty chiefly because some victims'
relatives did not want details of the crimes made public at a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the families do not want their children and
grandchildren needlessly exposed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grady added that although he believes that Francois was not
insane at the time, the defendant does have clear psychological
problems that might lead a jury to decide against the death
penalty. Theoretically, that would make it possible for Francois to
be paroled someday.
</P>
<P>
   Francois, who contracted HIV in 1995, said in court Wednesday
that he had received no medication during his 22 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood before Judge Thomas J. Dolan of County Court,
Francois' one-word answers were murmured and barely audible. Dolan
and Grady asked him to speak up several times.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of detail in his answers enraged Heidi Cramer, the
daughter of a victim, Sandra Jean French. Outside court, she said
she had expected a full description of Francois' actions and
remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a public disclosure of everything he did to our
mother,'' she told reporters. ``His mother can go visit him in jail
any time. I can't go visit my mother, except in an urn in my
closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois has admitted storing the decomposing bodies of victims
in his home for two years. His mother, Paulette Francois, who lived
with him in the house, was never charged with any crime, and has
made virtually no public statements about the case since her son's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in a written statement given to reporters by her lawyer,
she expressed sympathy for the victims' families and gratitude
toward prosecutors for accepting the guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed that death followed by more death is
not a solution and never will be,'' she wrote.

 VERDE TURNS BROWN AND DRIES UP AFTER GOBBLING ITS GREENBACKS  &HT;     By DON FOST  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apparently, Kermit the Frog had it right: It's
not easy being green.
</P>
<P>
   Verde Media, a San Francisco Internet company devoted to all
things environmental, sent its employees packing last week, as
management said it had run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   The firm appears dead just after it got off the ground. It
launched in April, on Earth Day, seeking to provide a wide range of
green content, from healthy living to ecotourism to the science and
politics of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   It was launched by Ted Turner's son-in-law, Peek Garlington III,
and company press releases listed Turner among the funders. Reached
in Atlanta on Tuesday, Garlington was vague about the fate of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was at liberty to talk to you but I really can't,''
he said. ``We are in negotiations with two separate
counter-parties. I can't talk about the disposition or what we're
doing with our company.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate on what he meant but said he expected to
have an announcement next week.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Rickenbacker, the executive vice president of
programming, was one of the few staffers to remain on duty at the
company's Bush Street offices, but Rickenbacker did not return
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to other investors also were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Former employees _ there were an estimated 40 to 50 people
working there _ describe a company full of people passionately
committed to the environment, done in by overspending and a
problematic software system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Verde's problem may have been dreaming too big for the
market,'' said Michael Mechanic, an editor. ``We all had really big
dreams. We may have been better off starting a little bit
smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Lizette Wilson, a reporter, said even in the final weeks, the
company sent employees on a whitewater rafting trip. (When Wilson,
a former colleague of mine at the Marin Independent Journal, got
the call on her cell phone on St. Patrick's Day that she got the
job at Verde, she let out a loud whoop and yelled to editors,
``I've been dot-commed!'')
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and others also said the company spent millions on a
software system that proved too slow to post content at Web speed.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Neagle, a former news editor at The Chronicle, joined Verde
four months ago and said the end did not come as a complete
surprise, as it followed a series of ``disquieting rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great place to work,'' Neagle said. ``The editorial
product was really good. I'd go back if I thought there was a
chance to succeed. All of us would.''

SNAP SHUT: NBC Internet was, from its inception, a confusing
animal. It was formed when the NBC television network struck a deal
to hard-wire its Web properties with the Web portal Snap (developed
by Cnet) and the community-builder Xoom.com. When
business-to-business became the big buzzword, NBCi acquired B2B
software firm Flyswat.
</P>
<P>
   It's now paying the price for that diffusion: Its stock has
plummeted from $106.13 in January to $13.44 yesterday, it announced
an earnings shortfall last week and it has suffered through dot-com
advertising drops and management turnover.
</P>
<P>
   But Will Lansing, who joined as chief executive officer this
spring, is moving to straighten things out. Lansing is eliminating
the Snap and Xoom brands, pushing NBCi to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   He figures he'll spend $100 million a year during the next three
years in promoting that brand, and with $200 million in ``soft
promotion'' from NBC _ which owns 40 percent of the company _ the
total will come close to a half-billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   He's got big ambitions. ``We see Yahoo and AOL as our
competition,'' he said in a phone interview yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a risky gambit.
</P>
<P>
   Internet analyst Lowell Singer of Robertson Stephens says that
while NBC is a great brand to build on, Snap and Xoom also have
consumer awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Snap and Xoom were big enough to get them into the
top 10'' sites on the Web, Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing said only the names will go away; NBCi isn't eliminating
any jobs. He plans to keep the company at about 780 people, still
hiring talent but getting rid of some positions through ``selective
weeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The company may appear on the ropes, but Lansing holds a long
view. ``These are the early days,'' he said. ``There's still a big
population that has to choose how to access resources and content
on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JUST WONDERING: If dot-com mania constituted a ``new economy'' as
so many magazines and Web sites would have us believe, then do the
hard times befalling dot-commers in the wake of this spring's
Nasdaq downturn constitute the new new economy?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; BREAKING THE MOLD: Never mind the stereotype of some
purple-haired, nose-pierced Webhead reading the riot act to old
media. On stage at this week's Newspaper Association of America
convention at the Moscone Center was burly silver-haired Shaun
Higgins, director of marketing and sales for the Spokesman Review
in Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins took part in a panel on newspapers and the Web, and
while other panelists had good if not groundbreaking ideas, Higgins
_ despite his old-media looks _ stood out for these unorthodox
comments:
</P>
<P>
   --``I want complete separation between print and online.'' (By
that, he means the online unit must be autonomous enough to move at
Internet speed, while maintaining the ability to post the
newsroom's content as soon as the paper goes to press.)
</P>
<P>
   --``It surprises me how much more our readers know than our
writers about topics our writers are writing about. We have to tap
into people who aren't journalists but who are better than our
journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   --``In online, the standards don't have to be as high, because
the costs aren't as high.'' (In other words, feel free to use those
amateurs, and to post at Internet speed, as long as you maintain a
good corrections policy.)
</P>
<P>
   That sort of blunt talk will almost surely cost Higgins his
friends in the newsroom, but he says it's making his Web site a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE GLASS PALACE, REVEALED: As the wraps come off Revolution
magazine _ a new title from Imagine Media devoted to dance music _
the secrecy shrouding the locale of the publication's launch party
has also lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's party will be the first-of-its-kind event at what the
mag's reps are calling ``the glass palace,'' a 15,000-square-foot
warehouse in the Presidio, across from the newly redeveloped Crissy
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Publicists imagine thousands of people dancing until 3 in the
morning, with contortionists, go-go dancers, models and
skateboarders doing their thing to films, slides, videos and the
funky beats provided by DJs.

<P>
   The only catch is: It's invitation only.

EDITORIAL: DECISION TIME ON GARY GRAHAM
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   We seldom comment two days in a row on the same subject, but the
case of Gary Graham, who is scheduled to die by lethal injection at
6 p.m. Thursday in Texas, merits concentrated attention. It has
demonstrated to the nation the serious deficiencies in a capital
punishment system that Gov. George W. Bush defended again Wednesday
as ``fair and just.'' Graham's situation has also exposed the
timidity of both Bush and his Democratic presidential opponent, Al
Gore, in addressing the risks of wrongful execution of inmates who
have been deprived of fair trials.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are on the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, the tiny
state agency whose members are scheduled to vote by phone or fax by
noon Thursday on whether to approve Graham's application for a full
or conditional pardon, a 120-day reprieve to permit a hearing, or a
commutation of the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The board has now received sound guidance from Rodney Ellis, the
president pro tem of the Texas Senate and the state's third-ranking
official. Noting the ``serious concerns'' that have been raised
about Graham's conviction for murder based on the testimony of a
single witness, and the contrary testimony of other witnesses, he
urged the board to delay the execution pending a hearing ``to
consider all of the evidence'' before making a recommendation to
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   It is not asking too much to insist on a fair hearing,
especially when a life is at risk. Perhaps at the 11th hour Bush
can demonstrate the leadership that has been missing so far in this
case.

 Wells Fargo Hit With Racial Bias Suit  
 By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 THE San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An activist group filed suit yesterday in a
Texas federal court, charging Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. with racial bias in
the home lending section of its Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ACORN, a national organization representing low-income people,
said a community locator feature on the San Francisco bank's Web
site refers prospective home buyers to neighborhoods based in large
part on their race. For example, the bank's Internet ``Community
Calculator'' feature refers people who live in predominantly black
communities to ZIP code regions with large black populations in the
area where they plan to move.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ACORN said, the Wells site classifies neighborhood
``lifestyles'' based on blatant racial stereotypes. According to
ACORN, the site says some inner-city, black-majority communities
have a ``distressed neighborhoods'' lifestyle, characterized by
single parenthood, high unemployment and a taste for ``urban/new
adult contemporary music, chicken takeout, bars and dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WELLS22 (98595 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``I don't know how much more stereotyped you can get,`` said Mike
Daniels, a Dallas civil rights lawyer working for ACORN.
</P>
<P>
   ACORN wants Wells to drop the features it considers offensive
from the site. It also wants the bank to step up mortgage lending
in Dallas-area minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo spokesman Jon Ferchen said the bank hadn't had a
chance to review the lawsuit and couldn't comment specifically on
it. But, he said, the bank has a strong fair-lending record and is
the nation's leading mortgage lender to ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Community Calculator on our Internet site, for relocating
home buyers, is designed to help customers make informed buying
decisions using criteria such as education levels, housing
characteristics, household by type, crime index and population,''
Ferchen said. The service ``is not designed to use race as a tool
to guide home buyers' decision making.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo didn't write the neighborhood descriptions itself.
The bank buys the material from Internet startup HomeFair.com,
which, in turn, uses demographic data and lifestyle descriptions
supplied by CACI Marketing Systems, a Virginia market research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of WELLS22 (98595 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Because this is a matter in litigation, we feel it is
inappropriate to comment,'' CACI Managing Director David Huffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for HomeFair's parent, Homestore.com, said the
company's service ``does not violate the rights of any protected
class.''
</P>
<P>
   An unscientific test of Wells Fargo's community locator
suggested that people who live in predominately black neighborhoods
will be referred to other areas with large African American
populations.
</P>
<P>
   When the locator was told that a home buyer living in San
Francisco's largely black Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood was
moving to New York City, the service steered the buyer to similar
communities in Brooklyn, Newark, N.J., and East Orange, N.J.

 REVIEW: Wireless Net Devices Still Need Work  &HT;     By HENRY NORR  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; Cell phones, pagers, PDAs _ think of a
category of portable consumer electronics and someone's racing to
turn it into a wireless Internet access device.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks I've been testing three of the latest
entries in this category: the OmniSky system, which adds a wireless
modem to a Palm V or Vx; a bundle from Compaq that combines a radio
modem with the company's new iPAQ Pocket PC; and the BlackBerry
957, a superpager from an up-and-coming Canadian company called
Research in Motion (a.k.a. RIM).
</P>
<P>
   For the handful of users who simply have to have constant online
access wherever they go, all three products are probably better
than any current cell phone. But they're all expensive, and the
OmniSky and Compaq products are slow and, at least in my testing,
riddled with bugs. For the average Internet junkie, they're just
not ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RIM BlackBerry 957
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the three devices, the only one that consistently worked as
advertised was the BlackBerry 957.
</P>
<P>
   This new $499, 5.3-ounce unit is the latest addition to a line
of two-way pagers RIM has offered for several years. But while the
Waterloo, Ontario, company's previous models looked like slightly
overgrown beepers, the 957 could pass for a Palm, except that it
has a miniature 33-key keyboard instead of Palm's buttons and
pen-input area.
</P>
<P>
   The 957's 2.2-inch-square screen is of the gray-green reflective
type, but it's exceptionally crisp and clear. I found it easier to
read than any Palm except the color IIIC model.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it's so good is that it's not a touch screen _ you
control the device not with a stylus but with a thumb-operated
wheel on the upper right side, which does double duty as an Enter
button, and a second button just below it that functions as an
Escape key.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, you choose among the many options the device offers
by scrolling, then picking from lists and menus. When you need to
enter text, you bang it out on the tiny keyboard, normally with
your two thumbs. It sounds awkward, but it's easy to learn and
surprisingly speedy.
</P>
<P>
   Built into the BlackBerry, in addition to e-mail software, are
the standard personal-information applications: address book,
calendar, alarm clock, memo pad and task list. The startup screen
has 13 icons, but the rest of the system is text-based. Visually,
it's a little like working on a DOS PC _ the system actually runs
on a vintage 1986 Intel 386 processor _ but without DOS' arcane
complexities.
</P>
<P>
   Like virtually every other personal digital assistant these
days, the BlackBerry comes with a cradle that attaches to your PC,
plus software for synchronizing data with just about all the
leading personal-information-management programs for Windows.
(There's no support for the Mac.)
</P>
<P>
   The cradle also functions as a charger for the BlackBerry's
built-in lithium battery.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the original Palm VII, the BlackBerry doesn't require a
special e-mail address _ it comes with software that forwards your
regular mail. (I used RIM's Desktop Redirector application for
Windows, which forwards messages from your inbox, but the company
also provides software that works with Microsoft Exchange server.
There's also a separate version available for Internet service
providers.)
</P>
<P>
   Messages are forwarded to a paging network that retransmits them
over the air. It operates at only 9.6 kilobits per second, but
since it transmits only bare text _ no fancy formatting, no
attachments and, so far, no viruses _ it feels surprisingly quick.
</P>
<P>
   When I first set up the BlackBerry, it refused to forward
anything but a small subset of my incoming mail, and it took a
couple of calls to RIM tech support to get the problem resolved.
Both times I called, however, technicians answered on the second or
third ring, and both were knowledgeable, patient and friendly.
Since they fixed the problem, the device has worked like a charm.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, I found the BlackBerry a remarkably effective e-mail
solution. My only real gripe is that it doesn't offer any way to
select multiple messages to delete in one operation.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WIRELESS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Beyond that, the only serious drawback to the BlackBerry _ a
significant one in this day and age, especially considering the
price of the device and service _ is that for now it's limited to
e-mail; the standard version provides no access to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   That will change soon, to a degree _ RIM has contracted with a
San Francisco company called Neomar to develop a BlackBerry version
of its microbrowser based on the Wireless Application Protocol
(WAP), which offers access to a limited range of online information
and transactions from their phones.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, RIM this week announced plans to work with
Oracle on the new AskAtOracleMobile service, which will provide
free information such as flight schedules, stock prices and
directions through an automated e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OmniSky for Palm V and Vx
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OmniSky's product combines a radio modem from Novatel Wireless,
software from Aether Systems and service over AT&AMP;T's Cellular
Digital Packet Data (CDPD) network. You have to provide your own
Palm V or Vx ($329 or $399, respectively), but everything else _
hardware, software and service agreement _ comes in one $299 box.
Unlimited monthly service is $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Novatel modem latches neatly around the Palm, matching the
distinctive flaring base of the V and Vx. The combination is much
bulkier than the sleek Palm V models by themselves but not much
larger than other Palms or most Windows CE devices.
</P>
<P>
   (Novatel also makes a version of the same modem for the Palm
III, IIIe and IIIx; it's bundled with software and wireless service
by Go America _ see
www.goamerica.net/html/showcase/products/minstrelIII.)
</P>
<P>
   The hardware design is certainly elegant, and it's much sleeker
than Compaq's bulkier add-on, but it also has a significant
drawback Compaq managed to avoid: You have to remove the modem to
put the Palm in its cradle, which you have to do regularly because
that's the only way to charge the Palm V/Vx internal battery. And
since the modem relies on its own lithium battery, you have to
charge that separately, using a different AC adapter and cable.
</P>
<P>
   With the service, you get a mail account at OmniSky.net, but you
can also check mail at up to six other Internet (POP3) mail
accounts. Unlike the BlackBerry, which receives messages whenever
it's on, the OmniSky checks for mail only when you tell it to. By
default, it first gets just message headers and the first 500 bytes
of each message; you then select those for which you want the full
text, so actually getting to the substance of your mail involves a
number of steps.
</P>
<P>
   You can, of course, set the device to get the full text on the
first pass, but that exacerbates what's already the worst problem
with OmniSky mail: It's horrendously slow. In my testing it
retrieved only 15 to 25 headers per minute. It also gets the oldest
messages first, so if you haven't used it for a day or two you have
to slog through all the old stuff before you get to your latest
missives.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with already received headers and messages is also a
problem. You can select all and delete, but if you're not ready to
do that you have to file or delete each message one by one; as with
the BlackBerry, you can't select multiple messages.
</P>
<P>
   As for Web browsing, the good news is that the OmniSky lets you
get at a far wider range of content than the Palm VII: In addition
to working with sites that support Palm's limited Web Clipping
query format, OmniSky offers content optimized for its small screen
and modest bandwidth from more than 2,000 sites, including most of
the most popular destinations on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The OmniSky software steers you to these sites by building in
links to them, organized by category (Finance, Travel, Shopping,
News, etc.). But if you're not satisfied with the optimized content
and want to visit other sites, you can simply write in the URL and
take your chances. The software tries to reformat standard HTML
pages for the small screen, but the results are mixed at best: When
I checked ZDNet's AnchorDesk, for example, I had to scroll through
five whole screens of clutter before the real copy even appeared.
</P>
<P>
   At a maximum of 19.2 kilobits per second, all of this happens
painfully slowly.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of WIRELESS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The worst problem, though, is the unreliability of the service. I
encountered frequent problems _ often the Palm couldn't find the
modem, or it would report that it couldn't find the site I'd
requested and politely suggest that I try again in a few minutes.
These problems occur at all times of the day and in a variety of
locations, including places where the service has worked
previously.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I can't see spending $300 up front plus $40 a month for
something as flaky as this service has been for me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Compaq iPAQ Pocket PC Wireless Bundle
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I received Compaq's new iPAQ Pocket PC handheld just a week ago,
and the wireless modem and software for it arrived only a few days
ago. Consider this a preview rather a review.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq hasn't even set pricing yet for the bundle it plans to
offer, although it announced the product more than two months ago.
Separately, the iPAQ itself is $499; the Compaq jacket that slips
over it and provides a slot for PC Cards plus an extra battery is
$149; and the Aircard radio modem Compaq is using, made by Sierra
Wireless, lists for $549. That's $1,197 without even counting the
software _ which comes from a Vancouver, British Columbia, company
called Infowave _ or monthly service fees.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even if Compaq offers a discount for the whole
package, as a spokesman says it will, it will almost certainly cost
much more than the two products reviewed above.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq says it's marketing the product mainly at information
technology departments seeking to offer wireless services for
corporate employees, rather than at individuals; the Infowave
software included in the bundle works only with Microsoft Exchange
servers.
</P>
<P>
   Simply as a PDA, without regard to the wireless option, the iPAQ
looks like a big winner, at least for those willing to give
Microsoft's Pocket PC software a chance. Compared with the
Hewlett-Packard Jornada 545 Pocket PC I reviewed in April, the iPAQ
is thinner and lighter and has twice as much memory (32 megabytes).
With a 206-megahertz Intel StrongARM processor, it's also far and
away the zippiest PDA I've ever tested, and it has the brightest
color screen _ much better than the Jornada, the Palm IIIC or even
my beloved Cassiopeia E-100.
</P>
<P>
   You use an Infowave utility to go online with the wireless
modem; it provides authentication, compression and encryption. Once
you're connected, though, you use Microsoft's Pocket Outlook and
Internet Explorer for mail and Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to any Web site, but it's pretty slow _ it usually
took more than 30 seconds to display a new page. And in my brief
testing, I ran into even more glitches than with OmniSky and the
Palm V.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Explorer does a decent job at displaying some sites on
the small screen, but with others _ including, ironically,
Infowave's own front page _ it draws a blank, literally. And in
some cases, such as SFGate and even MSN.com, I could get to the
site's front page but not to subordinate pages.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the iPAQ looks like a terrific PDA, but the wireless
bundle, whatever its price turns out to be, clearly needs lots of
work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Bottom Line &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, I firmly believe, we'll all be carrying wireless
Internet access devices of some sort. Before that can happen,
though, prices have to come down and bandwidth has to go up _
dramatically. And the hardware, software and service providers will
have to make their offerings far more trouble-free than this year's
latest products seem to be. If not, RIM and its trusty 1980s-era
technologies may end up ruling the wireless roost.

EDITORIAL: ZIMBABWE'S CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe's 20 years as an independent nation, one man has led
it _ Robert Mugabe. He has never faced a serious challenge. But
this weekend the country is to choose a new parliament, and polls
show that the opposition would win a fair election. Zimbabweans may
have decided that ``Mugabe'' and ``Zimbabwe'' should no longer be
synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has responded to the prospect of defeat with demagoguery,
violence and intimidation. Gangs of his thugs roam the countryside,
killing and beating opposition activists. The balloting and vote
count may be flawed, as the government is limiting the number of
election observers. The outside world, especially South Africa and
Zimbabwe's smaller neighbors, must press Mugabe to end the
violence, hold a clean vote and vote count and abide by the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe began his presidency by providing schools and health care
to the poor, but over two decades he became an autocrat surrounded
by corrupt and brutal men. One reason Zimbabwe has sent 11,000
troops to war in Congo, it is alleged, is that his generals profit
from trading in Congo diamonds. The war costs Zimbabwe millions of
dollars a month, while half the nation is unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mugabe has the support of all but three of Parliament's 150
members, and no strong opposition arose until last year, when the
Movement for Democratic Change was born to take part in rewriting
the constitution. Mugabe's draft, which would have broadened his
powers, lost in a popular referendum in February. Shaken by the
defeat, he began exploiting the issue of land reform. All major
parties endorse breaking up large farms, owned mainly by whites,
and distributing the land to poor blacks. For 20 years Mugabe did
little. Now, instead of beginning an orderly process with
compensation for landowners, he has encouraged his supporters in
the violent takeover of white-owned farms. They have killed one
farmer and beaten dozens of black farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed has spread. The opposition cannot campaign in much
of the countryside. At least 29 of its candidates and backers have
been killed, and many others raped or beaten, often as police stood
by. Recently the government offered the opposition some air time
and has begun to denounce violence, but has still made no real
effort to stop the thugs.
</P>
<P>
   It is now impossible for the election to be free. But the
opposition is determined to participate and could win if Mugabe
allowed the vote and vote count to proceed without fraud. This
means calling off his thugs, sending out word not to meddle with
ballots, and allowing all observers access to polling stations and
the counting process.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain, the European Union and the
Commonwealth nations should warn Mugabe that he and his cronies
will lose visas for foreign travel and their overseas bank accounts
if Zimbabwe's democracy dies. But Western nations are not trusted
or beloved by most Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
   The most important voice is that of South Africa, which has been
disappointingly silent. President Thabo Mbeki and the rest of
southern Africa's presidents should speak out publicly, as Botswana
has done. Southern African nations have a powerful interest in
keeping Zimbabwe from political and economic collapse.

UGLY DOG REPEATS AS FAIR CHAMP

   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Cisco Systems, one of the world's most
valuable companies, now has another feather _ or perhaps one should
say dog hair _ in its corporate cap.
</P>
<P>
   Nana, the world's ugliest dog, ``works'' at Cisco's Petaluma
office, where canines mix with the high-pressure Telecom Valley
work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Morones of Santa Rosa, an administrative assistant at
Cisco, shares her cubicle with Nana, a 17-year-old part Chihuahua,
part question mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call her a canardly,'' Morones said. As in ``canardly tell
what she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges at the Sonoma-Marin Fair World's Ugliest Dog Contest know
Nana as their favorite. Three times in the last five years,
including last year and again last Friday night, Nana has been
named world's ugliest dog.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for an elderly pooch plucked off the streets as a stray
and adopted by Morones from an animal shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with her,'' Morones said. ``I already had four
Chihuahuas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nana and her owner were invited onto the Tonight Show, starring
Jay Leno, after winning the homely hound contest last year. Apart
from a local TV appearance and a newspaper interview, no media
offers have come so far this summer.

RAHAL'S PLANS FOR CART INCLUDE TEXAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interim CART president and CEO Bobby Rahal can name-drop with
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   His partner in Team Rahal on the Championship Auto Racing Teams
circuit is late-night talk show host David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rahal and his wife, Debi, joined President Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton at the White House for a state dinner in
honor of His Majesty Mohammad VI, king of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say that CART is not looking at a race in Morocco,''
Rahal deadpanned yesterday morning, before leaving his business
empire in Columbus, Ohio, for a round of meetings at the
sanctioning body's headquarters in Troy, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal has been up to his mustache in greetings and meetings
since Friday, when he was chosen by CART's board of directors to
replace Andrew Craig as president and chief executive officer for
an undisclosed period. Rahal may not have any quick fixes for the
schism that exists between CART and the rival Indy Racing League.
But his rise to power _ and Rahal would cringe at that description
_ is likely to have almost immediate impact on the schedule at
Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said he is eager to speak with longtime friend Eddie
Gossage, TMS' executive vice president and general manager, about
the possibility of bringing a CART race to the track in Fort Worth
as early as the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken to Eddie as friends,'' said Rahal, who knew
Gossage during his days as a public relations representative for
Miller Brewing Co. on the CART circuit. ``Both he and I believe we
could put on one hell of a motor race \Rat TMS\S. I will say there
have been discussions, but nothing is formalized. If we go and are
able to put something together, I would certainly hope it would be
in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said he had not spoken with Gossage about racing at TMS
since being promoted last week. And Rahal also issued this
disclaimer for the 1.5-mile TMS quadoval and its 24-degree banked
turns:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to restrict the horsepower output for next year.
That would be taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
   The horsepower and speeds generated by CART's turbocharged V-8
engines was a genuine concern for Gossage during the summer of
1996, when he talked sanctioning agreements with both Craig and IRL
founder Tony George. TMS was designed, first and foremost, as a
NASCAR-style racetrack, right down to those high-banked, 24-degree
banked turns.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to attract and accommodate open-wheel
Indy-cars, the track also was built with ``dual banking.'' That
concept featured 8-degree banking built into the turns below the
24-degree banks. The lesser-banked turns supposedly would prevent
CART cars _ which have been clocked at more than 245 mph at the
California Speedway _ from ripping through the corners at TMS at
230-plus mph. Gossage deemed those speeds unreasonable for a safe
and competitive show back in 1996, when he opted to sign with the
IRL.
</P>
<P>
   An engineering flop, dual banking was eliminated when the track
was reconfigured and repaved between April-June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But CART's four engine manufacturers remain married to the
turbocharged formula. Horsepower figures are one of the great
secrets of the motorsports universe. But a figure between 800 to
900 horsepower is a safe estimate for the current generation of
CART engines produced by American Honda, Ford Motor Company,
Mercedes-Benz and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the IRL is in the first season of operating with
downsized 3.5-liter engines. The IRL's normally aspirated
Oldsmobile Aurora and Nissan Infiniti V-8s crank out anywhere from
650 to 700 horsepower. That was more than enough to create an
afternoon of NASCAR-style side-by-side racing, and drafting, and
the closest finish in IRL history during the Casino Magic 500 on
June 11.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL formula is a proven perfect fit for TMS. How can CART
compete with that here, and on the other ovals where it already
races?
</P>
<P>
   Knock off horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be looking at a 150 to 200 horsepower reduction,''
Rahal said. ``We've tried to govern that by aerodynamically
`spoiling' the cars. And the reality is ... the engines just
produce too much power. We will push our manufacturers ... there
already has been a lot of good discussion on how we can govern
these engines more so for 2001, perhaps with \Rair\S inlet
restrictors. While it's going to be expensive to some degree, we've
got to get the product better on the racetrack. That will allow us
to run normal wings and see the racing we want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   And we all want to see CART racing at Texas Motor Speedway.
SPOTLIGHT ON...
Mayfield enjoying status after tapping Earnhardt
His bump-and-run victory at the expense of Dale Earnhardt
apparently has elevated Jeremy Mayfield into some kind of overnight
NASCAR Winston Cup cult hero.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield did beat ``The Intimidator'' at his own nasty game on
the final lap of the rain-delayed Pocono 500 on Monday at Pocono
International Raceway, using his front bumper to root Earnhardt out
of the lead. But overlooked amid Mayfield's chest-beating act is
this big-picture fact _ 15 races into the 34-race season, Earnhardt
remains a serious contender for an unprecedented eighth Winston Cup
championship.
</P>
<P>
   After the bump, Earnhardt recovered to finish fourth. He earned
165 points, picking up 41 points on series leader and native Texan
Bobby Labonte. With midseason approaching, Earnhardt is only 57
points behind Labonte in the chase for the one prize missing from
his life. Consider that after 15 races last year, Earnhardt stood
seventh, 475 points behind leader and eventual champion Dale
Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got beat. He \RMayfield\S got me,'' said Earnhardt, mindful
that he was crucified for a similar move against Terry Labonte at
Bristol Motor Speedway in August. ``All in all, it was a good day
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, meanwhile, has spent the week blowing stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I've blown up two answering machines and \Ram\S working
on a third,'' said Mayfield, who scored his third career Cup
victory. ``A lot of them \Rcalls\S came from friends and from
family, but I got a ton of messages from people I don't even know.
They were just excited. I can't blame them. I'm pretty excited
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's ``move'' also has proven popular in cyberspace. On
Tuesday afternoon, Mayfield participated in a live chat on NASCAR
Online (www.nascar.com), where a typical session draws
approximately 6,500 hits. Mayfield, however, logged 61,000 hits _
nearly 10 times the norm and a record for the popular site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nice that so many people are happy for us,'' said
Mayfield, driver of the No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus. ``You call it a
`move' or whatever, but it's just hard-nosed racing. A lot of
people talk about Dale Earnhardt; he came up the hard way and
drives that way. So did I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnhardt ... he doesn't really race you, like, dirty, like he
used to wreck you all the time. He doesn't do that anymore. He just
races hard, and the same thing I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The fan who fired a can of beer at Mayfield's Ford from behind
the pit wall at Pocono (and missed) certainly disagreed with
Jeremy's self-assessment.
</P>
<P>
   So did the 50,726 fans (51 percent) who predicted in a NASCAR
Online poll that Earnhardt would win that elusive eighth
championship in 2000 and elevate himself to ultimate Winston Cup
cult hero.
PIT STOPS Cheever stays course Three races remain between Eddie
Cheever Jr. and an improbable Indy Racing Northern Light Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But if form holds, Cheever will emerge as Indy Racing League
champion after the season-ending Mall.com 500 at Texas Motor
Speedway on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever, driver of the No. 51 Excite &LR; Home Dallara/Infiniti,
ended the Oldsmobile Aurora's 34-race stranglehold on the series
and gave Nissan North America its first victory at Pikes Peak
International Raceway on Sunday. Cheever will take a tenuous
eight-point lead over Buddy Lazier into Atlanta Motor Speedway on
July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Every driver who has won the June race at PPIR has captured the
championship: Tony Stewart (1997), Kenny Brack (1998), and Plano's
Greg Ray, who won both races at Fountain, Colo., last season.
</P>
<P>
   Given that history and the current Infiniti V-8s reliability,
Cheever said it was unlikely that he would switch to the
next-generation Nissan 35-A this season. But Frank Honsowetz,
manager of Infiniti motorsports, said a second car could be entered
with the updated engine at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest enhancement is the engine is going to be at the
\RIRL\S minimum weight of 330 pounds. We're over that weight right
now,'' Honsowetz said. ``The center of gravity is going to be
lower. And it'll be two inches shorter at the rear, which is a
direct interchange with the competitor's engine. Everybody at
Nissan North America is ecstatic.'' Last laps The Toyo Tires Street
Legal Challenge will be added to the AAA Texas Friday Street Night
program at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis beginning tomorrow. The
series is open to any competitor with DOT street-legal tires, a
current inspection sticker and mufflers. For information, call
(972) 878-2641.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schumacher's victory in the waterlogged Canadian Grand
Prix on Sunday was the 40th of his Formula One career. The Ferrari
ace is only one victory behind the late Ayrton Senna for second
place on the career F1 list.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon will be gunning for an unprecedented sixth
consecutive Winston Cup road-course victory at Sears Point Raceway
in Sonoma, Calif., on Sunday. Gordon is tied for first in all-time
road-course victories with Richard Petty, Bobby Allison and Rusty
Wallace. The last word ``I did it. I did it. I don't believe, but I
believe it, actually.''
</P>

TEXAS A&AMP;M SAVORS TWO RECRUITS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ Like most everyone connected with Southern
Laboratory High School, Kevin Augustine is sad to see Nick Anderson
move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss him. We'll all miss him,'' said Augustine,
financial-aid officer at nearby Southern University who does
volunteer work at the school. ``But you know who is going to miss
him the most? The babies. The little ones here at the school
idolize him.''
</P>
<P>
   At Southern Lab, grades kindergarten through 12 are on the same
campus adjacent to Southern University. And if the younger set at
the school is going to miss Anderson, a Texas A&AMP;M basketball
recruit regarded as one of the top college prospects this year,
then the feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss them, too,'' Anderson said. ``I like to clown around
on the court sometimes. I'll make a dunk and start dancing, just
for them, and they really love that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but little kids just like me. I guess it's
something natural. Sometimes I'll go to their PE classes and play
basketball with them and let them beat me. It makes them feel
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand that there's reason for a warm feeling for anyone
besting the Southern Lab star. The 6-foot-6 Anderson and his
teammates won four consecutive Louisiana Class A state
championships while posting a 124-9 record. The Joel
Hawkins-coached Kittens have won eight consecutive titles during
his 12 seasons as basketball coach and dean of students at the
tuition-funded public high school.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was more often than not the leading scorer the past
four years, but guard Trayvean Scott was the point guard who made
it all happen. Both signed with the Aggies in November and are
regarded as key building blocks in A&AMP;M coach Melvin Watkins'
fledgling program, which boasted the Big 12 freshman of the year
last season in guard Bernard King of Gibsland, La.
</P>
<P>
   With Kansas recruit DeShawn Stevenson headed for the NBA,
Anderson ranks among the Big 12's most highly regarded freshman
recruits, along with Texas' Brian Boddicker and Missouri's Travon
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just an unbelievable talent,'' Watkins said of Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the 12 years, he is the one,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Anderson helps Watkins rebuild the Aggies' basketball
program, he must first get a high enough ACT score. Anderson said
he is only a point shy of achieving the NCAA minimum of 18 to be
eligible as a freshman. He should get results of a test he took in
April by the end of the month. He already has plans to retake the
test if necessary. Bryant is in a similar predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right there,'' Anderson said of a passing mark. ``I came
out of the test in April with a good feeling. I'm going to pass it.
But if I don't, I'm going to enroll at A&AMP;M anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson can practice as a partial qualifier as a freshman and
have three years of eligibility remaining. Scott, with a typical
take-charge attitude, said his buddy is going to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we start practice in October, I want to see Nick
practicing to play _ next season,'' said Scott, who carried a 3.7
grade-point average this spring and passed a qualifying test as a
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Anderson's potential collegiate position, Watkins
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick could be effective at three positions,'' he said, naming
off guard and both forward spots. ``But he's just going to play.
He'll make me play him, somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   An athletic player with an effective shot out to 15 feet,
Anderson averaged 23.7 points and 14 rebounds last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick is blessed with rare athleticism that you don't find in
many kids,'' Hawkins said. ``He is also one of the better high
school quarter-milers in the nation and doesn't even train for the
event. Things come easy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   While those who follow recruiting know all about Anderson, Scott
may be the sleeper in A&AMP;M's recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1 guard averaged 21.4 points and 9.3 assists last season.
But A&AMP;M didn't take him just to get Anderson. The two made up their
minds on their college choice independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trayvean adds immediate depth to the backcourt,'' Watkins
said. ``The biggest value he brings is his court awareness. He will
come in and challenge for playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Pastner, the celebrated walk-on guard at Arizona who
coached Anderson and Scott on the Houston Hoops AAU team that won
the national championship last summer, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind he proved last summer he was the best young
defender in America _ period,'' Pastner said. ``Trayvean can shoot
the ball. He can handle \Rit\S. He takes great pride in his
defense, and not many kids do that. He will open up a lot of eyes
as a freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott is nothing if not confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams usually try to deny me the ball to keep me from
shooting,'' Scott said. ``But since I bring the ball up most of the
time, that's hard to do. If they get up on me, I'll go by them. Do
that two or three times, and they back off. Then, I'll shoot. But
playing with Nick, the defense has had to play honest most of the
time anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastner, meanwhile, calls Anderson the type of player ``you
build a program around.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott agrees, citing his friend's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is give Nick the ball and he will deliver.
He is a great finisher,'' Scott said. ``I've seen Nick jump
``over'' people. And all you have to do is have someone on the
other team who can compete. Someone who Nick knows or hears about,
and he is the man. I've seen Nick play against bigger guys and just
totally dominate a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson did just that in the 68-42 state championship victory
over Grambling High this year when he scored 25 points, pulled down
19 rebounds, blocked 11 shots and passed out seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick totally destroyed them,'' Hawkins said. ``And you
wouldn't expect to see that in a state championship game, because
there are two pretty good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said he once thought both would go to Houston. Then
Vanderbilt and Notre Dame got interested in Scott because of his
academic qualifications. But both players said they were won over
by A&AMP;M's coaching staff, the chance to play for Watkins and the
lure of being part of a resurgence of Aggies basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to get thrown into the fire,'' Scott said.
``The only question is how we respond. You say A&AMP;M is not used to
winning, but the players in the program now ``are'' used to
winning. You're going to be hearing a lot about A&AMP;M basketball in
the next two, three years.''

RANGERS WAIT TOO LONG TO BRING BACK RYAN GLYNN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Hum along now, if you will, to that famous
baseball song from ``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where have you gone,
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Glynn? A nation
</P>
<P>
   Turns its lonely eyes to you.
</P>
<P>
   Whoo, whoo, whoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know, it doesn't have quite the same catchy rhythm as
Joe DiMaggio, but you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Where the ding-dong dickens has this kid been, for crying out
loud?
</P>
<P>
   Glynn returns today, finally, and not a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, give or take another Rangers' butt-kicking or
three, the young right-hander up from Triple-A Oklahoma slammed the
door on the Dodgers for eight impressive shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   No other Rangers' starter this season has strung eight zeros
together in the same game, but then, you didn't need me to tell you
that.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Glynn's timely conquest of the Dodgers, the
Rangers contritely handed him his bus ticket back to the minors,
telling him, in so many words, that there was no room at the inn.
</P>
<P>
   Shutting out the NL West contenders was fine and dandy but that
didn't mean he could just walk in here and crack this vaunted
Rangers' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   So, Glynn, who must have been privately asking himself what a
guy has to do win a job around here, quietly went back to Oklahoma
and the Rangers promptly went into the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days, five miserable combined starts from Darren
Oliver, Esteban Loaiza and Mark Clark and one nine-game losing
streak later, Glynn will finally get another crack.
</P>
<P>
   He's coming back because an orthopedic specialist told the
Rangers yesterday that there's something wrong with Oliver's arm.
</P>
<P>
   Duuuuhhhhhh!
</P>
<P>
   I could have saved them a lot of money. A few of us, including
Oliver himself, have been suggesting the same thing for a couple of
weeks now.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I've heard all the excuses why Glynn couldn't stay. I'm
just having a hard time buying them considering what we've seen the
past couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and Clark have fat contracts. Big money is on the line.
And for the Rangers to have any hope of defending their AL West
title, they need Loaiza to snap out of it and pitch as he did in
the second half last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do it, it has to be the right time,'' manager Johnny
Oates tried to explain again last night before the Rangers and
Twins met in the second game of a three-game series. ``It's easy to
tell people what should and shouldn't be done. Those people who
have all the answers don't have to deal with the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequences? You mean like another strong performance from
Glynn? Or one or two less from one or more of the scoreboard
assassins mentioned above? Yeah, that would be hard to live with.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, sometime over the past two wretched weeks, there had to
be a place where a guy with a 0.00 earned-run average could have
helped. Heck, in that time span, the starter who was listed ``No.
3'' in the Redhawks' rotation _ behind Glynn and left-hander Doug
Davis _ was traded to Florida for Dave Martinez and has made
back-to-back brilliant starts (1.95 ERA) for the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But I guess Chuck Smith couldn't pitch here, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan Glynn, at that point, wasn't going to pitch but three
times in four weeks,'' Oates said, which begs one question: Why?
``It wasn't the right time to start revamping this club.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to make changes too quick. We made some big
mistakes if 10 weeks into the season we have to make major
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, so?
</P>
<P>
   ``For the investment we've made,'' Oates continued, ``how are
you going to know in 10 weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   Please. It's not as though the jury's still out on Mark Clark.
At $5 million a year, he's a bigger bust than Dolly Parton. Release
him and eat his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver has been complaining of a tired arm for weeks and should
have been rested two starts ago. Loaiza, who treats a lead like a
bar of soap, has been inexplicably ineffective. Maybe he needs a
few weeks in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put Loaiza out there on the market right now and see what
happens,'' Oates said. ``Teams would be lining up to try and get
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, they probably would, which is more a comment on the
state of pitching in the big leagues than any vote of confidence in
Loaiza. But in his three June starts before last night's outing
against the Twins, he'd coughed up 14 earned runs in 131/3 innings.
That just won't do.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand general manager Doug Melvin and Oates not
wanting to give up on the season in mid-June. They shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that they have $19 million invested in Oliver over
the next three years and that there are no guarantees that Matt
Perisho or Glynn are sure-thing, bona fide big-league starters.
</P>
<P>
   But it's definitely time to find out, before the season gives up
on the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back, Ryan Glynn. You've been gone too long.

TESTIMONY PUTS SKAKEL AT SCENE OF MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn._ A boyhood friend of Michael Skakel's testified
in court Wednesday that Skakel admitted years later that on the
night their 15-year-old friend Martha Moxley was murdered in 1975,
he was in the tree directly above where her body was found the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Andrew Pugh, said that Skakel, then also 15, had
``an attraction, an infatuation'' with Moxley. Pugh lived across
the street from the Skakels and around the corner from the Moxley
family in the exclusive Belle Haven section of Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   He testified Wednesday that he believed that Skakel, a nephew of
Ethel Kennedy, had committed the murder. When he confronted his old
friend with that suspicion in a 1991 telephone conversation, he
said, Skakel denied that he killed her but admitted that he had
been in the Moxleys' yard the night she died.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh was one of the two final witnesses called by prosecutors
Wednesday in their effort to persuade a juvenile court judge to
refer the case to Superior Court, putting Skakel, 39, on trial as
an adult. He is now charged in the case as a juvenile. If convicted
as an adult, he could face 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's swift completion of its case in this
``reasonable cause'' hearing offered a striking contrast to the
investigation of the case, which dragged on for nearly a
quarter-century until Skakel's indictment early this year. The
hearing will resume next Wednesday with the defense witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual case against Skakel, in which an adult is charged
with murder as a juvenile, has already broken legal ground. It is
the first juvenile court proceeding fully open to the media and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's final witness was Judith Kallen, an official
with the State Department of Children and Families. The prosecutor,
Jonathan C. Benedict, sought to demonstrate that the Connecticut
juvenile justice system has no mechanisms for dealing with a
criminal offender over age 18, suggesting that Skakel must be tried
as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   By law, inmates in juvenile detention must be released at age
18, she testified, adding that state officials now use
psychologists and other experts to determine whether a juvenile
defendant should be tried as an adult, focusing on the child's
chances of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   But Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, pointed out during
cross-examination that this case was like no other. He suggested
that the nearly 25-year delay in bringing the case to court had
provided state officials ``a crystal ball'' showing all they needed
to know about Skakel's chances of rehabilitation and becoming a
productive member of society.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman asked Kallen if that was sufficient evidence of
potential for rehabilitation. Under a 1975 law, one requirement of
transferring a juvenile case to Superior Court is a finding that
``the safety of the community requires that the child continue
under restraint for a period extending beyond his majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Kallen told Sherman that she did ``not have that kind of
expertise,'' adding, ``I have never had to look back at somebody's
behavior over a 24-year period.'' Sherman quickly replied, ``Not
until now.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sherman presents his case next week, Judge Maureen Dennis
will determine whether to transfer the case to Superior Court, to
allow a trial to proceed before her in juvenile court without a
jury, or to dismiss the matter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has made it clear that the rules relating to a
``reasonable cause'' hearing allow her wide latitude, and she also
admonished both Benedict and Sherman, who have given frequent
interviews, to reread the ethics guidelines for lawyers about
talking to the media.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the first day of the pretrial hearing, two former
classmates of Skakel's testified that he confessed to the murder in
the late 1970s while at a school for troubled youths in Maine. One
of them, Gregory Coleman, completed his testimony Wednesday
morning. Coleman, who was convicted of a robbery in the 1980s, was
brought from a prison near Rochester, where he is serving a
yearlong sentence for criminal trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his testimony Wednesday came in response to questions
from Sherman about his requests for money and for help from
Connecticut officials. Coleman has received neither for his
testimony, though he acknowledged that he had made several mistakes
in his testimony before a grand jury in the Moxley case in 1998 and
that his abuse of drugs and alcohol over more than 20 years had
affected his memory.
</P>
<P>
   But Skakel's sister and brothers, who filled a first row in the
courtroom, seemed to pay most attention to the testimony of Pugh,
the former family friend. He said that he and Skakel had been close
when they were teen-agers, but had drifted apart after the Moxley
murder and had little or no contact during the 1980s. But in 1991
they bumped into each other at Christ Church in Greenwich, where
Pugh was attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed resuming their friendship, Pugh testified, but he
said he told Skakel in a subsequent telephone conversation that it
``could be difficult for me because I had some doubts as to his
involvement'' and asked if Skakel had committed the crime. ``He
said `No,''' Pugh testified. ``He told me that he had been on their
property,'' but that he had nothing to do with Moxley's death.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Pugh conceded that Skakel never
specified which tree he meant on the Moxley property, but the
witness said he believed it to be the tall pine in the Moxley yard
that he and Skakel had climbed frequently as children. Moxley's
body was found under it on Oct. 31, 1975, her head bludgeoned with
a golf club taken from a set that belonged to Rushton Skakel,
Skakel's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``That conversation kind of, shall I say, addled me slightly,''
Pugh testified Wednesday.

HILL TO RETURN NEXT WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Ken Hill will return to the starting rotation next
Wednesday in Seattle, a little more than six since he slumped over
in pain on the Edison Field mound, the result of a strained
rib-cage muscle.
</P>
<P>
   That means one of the pitchers in the starting rotation has to
go, and the likely candidate is Seth Etherton, whose start Friday
against the Twins will be his last here -- at least until the next
Angels pitcher goes down. Etherton is 2-1 with a 5.20 ERA in five
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Before his injury, Hill was 3-4 with a 7.41 ERA. In his final
rehab start for Triple-A Edmonton on Tuesday, he gave up three runs
(two earned) and seven hits in 5 fr 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tuesday) I felt pretty good,'' Hill said. ``With rehab, I
went at it pretty good. It's just different because of the hitters.
They have one thing in mind -- make the big leagues -- so they're
swinging. It's tough to evaluate how good your stuff really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill made 90 pitches Tuesday, and manager Mike Scioscia said he
believes Hill will be able to throw up to 100 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident he's ready to take the ball,'' Scioscia said.
``The command early was good, but it wasn't later in the game.
That's a battle a lot of pitchers have. But he came out of spring
pitching very strong, and we're looking forward to having those
results again.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hill, stepping on a major league mound for the first time
since May 9 will be like starting the season again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question it's going to be like that,'' Hill said. ``It's a
new season for me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hill is about to return, a couple others are not close.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI exam performed on pitcher Scott Schoeneweis confirmed he
has a strained oblique muscle in his right side. Schoeneweis said
he might have injured himself hitting when playing in Arizona under
National League rules on June 11. He had to leave his next start
last Friday when pitching in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable for his return, and consequently,
Schoeneweis is frustrated: ``I've got nothing to say. I'm not
talking to you guys until after I pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jason Dickson was scheduled to start tonight for
Edmonton in his rehab assignment, but instead was in Anaheim
Wednesday having an MRI performed on his right shoulder. The MRI
showed further wear and tear on his labrum, and as a result he has
been shut down indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson originally went to the disabled list with a strained
hip, but later felt strain in his surgically repaired shoulder as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival has blown two of his last three save
opportunities, but Scioscia reiterated his faith in his closer.
Overall, Percival has 17 saves (tied for second in the league) and
five blown saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something about Troy Percival,'' Scioscia
said. ``This guy is one of the premier closers in baseball.
Everyone in their career, everyone in a season is going to hit a
bump in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy was not effective (Tuesday) night or in Tampa (last
Wednesday). But this guy will be there in the end. That's why we
consider ourselves a championship-caliber ballclub. As long as his
arm continues to feel as well as it has, there's no question he'll
be out there.''

   Matchup: Tim Belcher (1-0, 1.69 ERA) will start for Anaheim
against Kansas City's Jay Witasick (1-6, 6.19). The start will be
Belcher's second this season, and if it is anything like the first,
the Angels are in good hands. Belcher gave up just one run and five
hits in 5 fr 1/3 innings in an 8-3 victory over Baltimore last
Saturday. -- Joe Haakenson
