SANTANA DOMINATES GRAMMY AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some may have laughed when Carlos Santana, the
psychedelic guitarist of the '70s, informed the public that an
angel called Metatron had prophesied his return to pop dominance.
After Wednesday night's 42nd Grammy Awards at the Staples Center
here, there are going to be a lot of young musicians praying to
Metatron.
</P>
<P>
   Santana was unbeatable. In every category that his group,
Santana, was nominated, it won, including the night's top honors _
album of the year (``Supernatural''), record of the year (an award
given to his single ``Smooth'') and song of the year (``Smooth''
again). By night's end, Santana had walked away with eight awards,
tying Michael Jackson's 1983 record for the most Grammys won in a
single year. Santana's ninth award, for song of the year, was
presented not to Santana, but to the song's writers, Rob Thomas of
Matchbox 20 and Itaal Shur. (The winners were selected by the
10,000 voting members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences.)
</P>
<P>
   The night was one of vindication for Santana, who never won a
Grammy when he did his most important work with his bilingual,
polyrhythmic psychedelic jam band in the early '70s. (He had only
received one previous Grammy, for best rock instrumental in 1988.)
</P>
<P>
   With guest appearances from pop stars like Lauryn Hill, Eric
Clapton and Thomas, Santana's new album, ``Supernatural,'' rose to
No. 1, and became an across-the-board commercial, critical and now
Grammy triumph after years of diminishing returns on his recordings
and tours.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Santana said he was proud Wednesday night ``to be
able to demonstrate to the people that deepness and class can be as
profitable as shallowness and crass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This validates the idea that quality and quantity can go
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Santana's success was a running joke on stage before the
televised portion of the awards show even began. ``First, I want to
say thanks to Carlos Santana,'' Sheryl Crow said on accepting her
Grammy for best female rock vocalist, ``for not being in this
category.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Santana was the main topic of conversation for
award-winners including Sting, B.B. King and Tito Puente, who
thanked Santana for the royalty checks he had received from ``Oye
Como Va.'' Chris Perez of the Chris Perez Band, which won an award
for best Latin rock or alternative album, said, ``I think I was
conceived to his music.''
</P>
<P>
   With strong performances early in the show from Marc Anthony and
Ibrahim Ferrer, as well as another fiery Ricky Martin production to
compete with his star-making appearance last year, the Grammys
Wednesday doubled as a victory parade for Latin music's latest
invasion of the American pop consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Martin, despite having leaped to pop stardom after
his performance at the Grammys last year, was not shown much love
by Grammy voters. In all four categories he was nominated in, he
lost, including best pop album and best male pop vocal performance,
both of which went to Sting.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-rhyming white rapper Eminem took both best rap album
and best rap solo performance. The Roots with Erykah Badu won for
best rap performance by a duo or group. The smooth-singing trio TLC
also had a strong night early on, collecting three rhythm-and-blues
awards, including best R-and-B album. The upbeat country
neotraditionalists the Dixie Chicks, who performed their murder
ballad ``Goodbye Earl,'' won two country awards, including best
country album for ``Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Latin-tinged music, the other major trend of last
year was the dominance of bubblegum teeny-pop. The genre, which
received poor representation live when the Backstreet Boys showed
their limitations with a medley of past Grammy-winning hits,
received one major award: the 19-year-old Christina Aguilera won
for best new artist. Representing the youth genre, her acceptance
speech was like that of a schoolgirl late with a homework
assignment. ``Omigod, you guys,'' she said. ``I seriously do not
have a speech prepared whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the veterans receiving their first Grammys were Cher for
best dance recording with her comeback hit ``Believe''; the hard
rock pioneers Black Sabbath, for best metal performance; June
Carter Cash, for best traditional folk album; Caetano Veloso, for
best world music album; and Barry White, for best male R-and-B
performance and best traditional R-and-B vocal performance.
</P>
<P>
   Sting sprang an upset in the male pop vocal category with a
victory for ``Brand New Day,'' beating out Anthony and Martin.
Sting also won for pop album.
</P>
<P>
   The award for best Mexican-American performance was given to a
Spaniard who was brought up in Mexico, Placido Domingo, for ``100
Anos de Mariachi.'' Tom Waits won for best contemporary folk album
with ``Mule Variations.'' And Diana Krall picked up best jazz vocal
album with ``When I Look In Your Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other fields, Stravinsky was the Santana of the classical
world: Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony's
performance of his ``Firebird'' and ``Rite of Spring'' won best
classical album, best engineered classical album and best
orchestral performance, while his ``Rake's Progress,'' conducted by
John Eliot Gardiner, won best opera recording.

GEDNEY GETS HIS MEETING, SIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Gedney just wanted the Cardinals' brain trust to look him
in the eye and account for deserting him in his time of need. He
needed the closure.
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, they took him up on it, and because they did,
he took them up on a one-year, make-good contract offer. He signed
Wednesday for the NFL minimum $440,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gedney's agent, Howard Bush, arranged a meeting for Gedney with
Cardinals General Manager Bob Ferguson, general counsel Michael
Bidwill, special assistant to the president Rod Graves, and Coach
Vince Tobin after Gedney passed a team physical three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He needed that meeting before he would sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just my chance to vent, have them hear me, and treat me
as a person,'' Gedney said.
</P>
<P>
   Gedney missed last season following two major surgeries for
ulcerative colitis. As the second surgery approached last July, he
received a phone call from Ferguson telling him the final two years
of his contract had been voided. He'd been cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it's a business, but the way they handled it was
what I was so appalled at,'' said Gedney's wife, Kathy.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed to speak for the community. It was perceived publicly
as a cold-hearted move, and the team took a huge public relations
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The move was unpopular with the players and coaches as well.
According to Gedney, Tobin told him in their meeting that the
organization embarrassed itself by severing Gedney's support
system. He no longer had access to the team's medical personnel,
training facilities, nor was he allowed to come to practice after
recovery to be with his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Coach Tobin said meant a lot to me, to have someone say
that to my face,'' Gedney said.
</P>
<P>
   Gedney said he was further chafed when the Cardinals called in
December and made overtures about bringing him back for the final
month last season and then failed to follow through. So he and his
family were skeptical when the team expressed renewed interest this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Wednesday, Gedney, his wife and their two children were
at a place they said they never expected to be, on center stage at
the Cardinals' Tempe facility. Even team owner Bill Bidwill, who
claimed he didn't know the Gedneys were coming over for a news
conference, stumbled across them on their way out and shook
Gedney's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gedney has received a clean bill of health not only from his
personal physicians but also those of the team. He is believed to
be the first professional athlete to come back from this condition.
</P>
<P>
   To Gedney's surprise, the Cardinals, suddenly short on tight
ends and perhaps wanting to stop the public relations bleeding,
were a willing partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been easy for them to ignore me and not open up
that can of worms again,'' Gedney said. ``My hat's off to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gedney lost his salary, the Cardinals continued to pay
his medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Gedney, 29, has returned to his playing weight of
257 pounds after dropping to 215. Dr. Wayne Kuhl, a Cardinals
physician, described his recovery as ``remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cardinals continued their run at unrestricted
free-agent defensive end Marco Coleman, who became expendable with
the Washington Redskins after they signed Pro Bowl free agent Bruce
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's Atlanta-based agent, Brian Ransom, listened to a
last-minute offer from the Redskins after the Cardinals seemingly
had gained the inside track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on a couple of things,'' Ransom said. ``We're
trying to sort through it.'' &QL;

BRADLEY BRINGS UNDERDOG CAMPAIGN TO WASHINGTON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT McCLURE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seeking at least a symbolic victory for his campaign,
underdog Democrat Bill Bradley on Wednesday launched an intense,
five-day bid to come from behind with the help of
independent-minded Washington voters.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Vice President Al Gore in Iowa, New Hampshire
and Delaware, Bradley jetted to Seattle in a longshot bid to look
like a winner in the non-binding primary vote here next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating that a win here could catapult him to victories a
week later in delegate-rich New York and California, Bradley made a
beeline for a campaign rally Wednesday night at Seattle Community
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington state has a real opportunity to send a message
across the country,'' Bradley said. ``The independent voter of
Washington is going to decide who's going to be the next
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing an enthusiastic group of about 350 people _ mostly of
student age and young professionals _ Bradly spoke of ``a world of
new possibilities, guided by goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly emphasized his support for handgun registration,
universal health care, improved race relations, environmental
protection and better schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're living in a time of unprecedented prosperity
when we can do things we could never do before, and I personally
think we should be fixing our roof when the sun is shining.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent five minutes of his 28-minute speech on the vice
president's record, recalling among other things, Gore's votes in
Congress supporting tax breaks for segregated Southern academies
and Gore's entanglement in the 1996 campaign fund-rasing scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley emphasized that while Gore supports registration of new
handguns, he is for registration of all handguns. And Bradley said
his health care plan would insure all Americans while Gore's would
leave millions uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Although pundits have begun to write off Bradley because of his
early Eastern losses, fewer than 250,000 Democrats have actually
voted so far. Here in Washington, approximately 1 million votes are
expected to be split between the Democratic and Republican
presidential candidates next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington primary is a non-binding ``beauty contest.'' But
it is Bradley's last chance to shine before primaries March 7 in
New York, California and primaries or caucuses in 14 other states.
Those states include Washington, where caucuses will select most of
the state's delegates to the Republican and Democratic conventions
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the week after that, another 11 states hold primaries or
caucuses, effectively deciding the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Bradley swung into Washington late Wednesday, his
campaign had started firing away at frontrunner Gore, who is backed
by much of the state's Democratic political establishment,
including Gov. Gary Locke.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to slice into Gore's double-digit lead in the polls,
Bradley launched a radio ad questioning Gore's votes in Congress on
abortion and gun control, and his stance on health care in the
current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington has the distinction of being the first state where
(Bradley) has run these negative radio attack ads,'' said Todd
Webster of the Gore campaign. ``He is a desperate candidate running
a desperate campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley staffers acknowledged they are banking a lot on
Washington, but denied they are desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is a man of longstanding conviction who has been
honest with the American people about who he is and who he always
has been,'' said Bradley campaign spokesman Mo Elleithee.
</P>
<P>
   Elleithee said Gore has mis-stated several of Bradley's
positions. In a debate Monday night, for example, Gore said
Bradley's plan for medical care would stick Medicaid recipients
with $150-a-month vouchers, Elleithee said, when in fact Bradley's
plan would put Medicaid recipients on the same medical plan enjoyed
by federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Bradley will stick with his
previous strategy, seeking votes in the relatively liberal Seattle
area, or whether he branches out to the rest of the state.
Wednesday, he opened campaign offices in Spokane and Vancouver.
Another is planned in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley plans to campaign in Washington at least until Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything Washington voters have made clear in past
elections, it's that they are fiercely independent,'' Elleithee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Bradley was introduced by Seattle Mayor Paul Schell,
who Bradley said was the first elected official to endorse him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Washington don't take our orders from Iowa or New
Hampshire or the national media,'' Schell said. ``We have a chance
to send a message next Tuesday that will be heard around the nation
and will affect New York and California and all the other states
and change the course of this election.''

BELTRE A DODGER AT HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ After an offseason of distraction in which
Adrian Beltre eventually had his request for free agency denied _
though the appeal process continues _ he's finally found a place to
get away from it all. He's found peace on the field.
</P>
<P>
   So with his allegiance still pledged to the Dodgers _ and all
signs pointing toward the Dodgers retaining his rights _ there is
one uncertainty in Beltre's mind. The 20-year-old third baseman is
wondering how he's going to be treated by the home fans when the
club begins the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they understand that I wasn't trying to do anything,
that it was my right,'' Beltre said as he took part in his first
spring workout Wednesday. ``I hope they still like me. I want to
get in there and have things be normal like they were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other issues, but Beltre doesn't wish to discuss them.
There's a pending hearing on a grievance filed by the players
association, and also ongoing contract talks that could end the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are eager to end the case and that could happen by
the end of the week, sources said. Beltre's agent, Scott Boras, and
Dodgers managing partner and CEO Bob Daly are expected to talk
either today or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite not needing to lock up Beltre with a long-term contract,
the Dodgers seem willing to do a deal if it eats away an
arbitration year. To do that, it would have to be a three-year
deal. But it's unlikely the Dodgers would spend more than $4
million since Beltre has less than two years major-league
experience. There is time to make a deal because a hearing is weeks
away.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has been difficult on Beltre, who missed the first
month of winter ball waiting for commissioner Bud Selig to make his
ruling in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a little bit tough because I'm one of those guys who
likes to concentrate on just baseball,'' Beltre said. ``I don't
like to be worrying about what's in the paper or whatever. I just
like to come here and practice and play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay here. I'm happy to be here. What's happened is
in the past. I came here to practice. The business part is between
(agent Scott Boras and Dodgers managing partner Bob Daly.)''
</P>
<P>
   __ Short(stop) and long of it: Jose Vizcaino wants a chance to
win the starting shortstop job, and manager Davey Johnson said
he'll give Vizcaino a shot. But for the second consecutive season
it appears Vizcaino will be the Dodgers' primary utility infielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's invaluable in the role I envision him in,'' Johnson said.
``Can he play every day? I'm sure he'd like to. But I like him in
the role of moving around.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino started 40 games at shortstop, 15 at second base and
five at third base last season. Instead, Alex Cora is the favorite
at shortstop with Juan Castro and Kevin Elster in position to
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   __ Addressing the troops: Before Wednesday's first full-squad
workout, Johnson addressed the team during a 30-minute session on
one of the practice fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I've been waiting for this a long time, to get
back here and get with it,'' Johnson said. ``I explained that I
probably had the worst year of anyone in the group and I want to
change that, and I need their help.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Never has a season outlook been clearer for Jeff
Bagwell.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he unpacked Wednesday afternoon at the Astros'
spring-training complex, Bagwell had a few items less to worry
about, i.e., glasses and contact lenses. For the first time in his
professional career, the All-Star first baseman will take the field
this season without needing any vision aids after undergoing laser
eye surgery in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a clearer look on life,'' Bagwell said on
the eve of full-squad workouts. ``It's the best thing I've ever
done. I'm hoping this will be the year I'm able to see all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who is entering his 10th season with the Astros, is the
latest in a growing list of pro athletes who have sought improved
vision through the surgical procedure known as Lasik, which stands
for laser in-situ keratomileusis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just as impressive as Bagwell's twice being a 30/30 man in
home runs and stolen bases is his 20/15 vision.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who has worn contacts throughout his career, only
recently began considering the laser surgery. His contacts were
constantly irritating his eyes, and he often would have to step out
of the batter's box to readjust them. Dirt would also get into his
eyes, causing more problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' he said. ``It was part of the game I
dreaded night in and night out. It's frustrating when you're up at
the plate and sometimes you can't see the pitcher's face. That's
scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of ups and downs you go through with your eyes
over the course of a major-league season. Each city brings
different problems: allergies, pollens, dryness, wind. That stuff
gets old.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert B. Gillett, team ophthalmologist for the Rockets,
Comets and Aeros, performed Bagwell's Lasik surgery Dec. 29 at the
Laser Center-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painless and quick,'' said Gillett, who has also
performed the procedure on pro golfer Steve Elkington. ``Hopefully,
it will improve Jeff's comfort level.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``flap and zap'' in the medical industry, Lasik treats
the middle layers of the cornea to correct nearsightedness,
farsightedness and astigmatism. The procedure involves a surgeon's
folding back tissue from the surface of the eyeball while a laser
reshapes the cornea to improve the patient's vision to 20/20 or
better. The actual application of the laser takes 10 to 90 seconds,
in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Total cost: about $2,400 per eye.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts predict more than 1.5 million Lasik procedures
will be done this year in the United States, an increase from an
estimated 1 million in 1999 and 500,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lasik has been widely considered a success, and its low risk _
complication rates are less than 1 percent, Gillett says _ has it
gaining popularity among professional athletes. Among those to have
undergone the procedure are major-league players Greg Maddux and
Bernie Williams, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, and pro
golfers Tiger Woods, Corey Pavin and Tom Kite.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, the ace of the Atlanta Braves' pitching staff, underwent
the procedure last July and made his scheduled start two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flat-out fixed them,'' Maddux said. ``I see good now. I
think I'm better than 20-20. Incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather go get my eyes done again than go to the dentist.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who is nearsighted with astigmatism, spoke with other
big-leaguers and learned of potential risks before making a
decision. He decided the rewards outweighed the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard all about it and really was going to do it, but my
wife (Ericka) was my guinea pig. She did it first,'' Bagwell said.
``I felt the worst thing that could happen was for me to wear
contacts. I already do that. I was very confident going into it
that everything would be all right. Fortunately for me, everything
has worked out perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 31 years old, Bagwell can throw away the contacts after
wearing them since seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   So how will this affect his on-field performance for the
upcoming season? Consider this: Even with vision problems, Bagwell
is a career .304 hitter with 263 home runs since breaking into the
majors in 1991. He was the National League Rookie of the Year that
season and added Most Valuable Player honors in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the difference will be,'' Bagwell said.
``Only time will tell. The only thing I was after was being able to
see well or 20/20, as everybody pushes as the benchmark, instead of
seeing 20/20 for a while and seeing 20/40 for a while. I just want
to be more consistent with my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   As of now, there is no certified correlation between Lasik
surgery and improved athletic performance. And in some cases, the
correction might not be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   But for those willing to take the risk and spend a few bucks,
the results can be astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question that eyesight is one of
the primary attributes of all good hitters,'' Astros general
manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``Ted Williams was arguably the best
hitter that has ever played the game, and he was the first one to
emphasize that. It's impossible to be a good hitter without having
superior eyesight. With that said, I don't think this is the
cure-all. I don't think we can look for something magical to
happen, but I think it's definitely an asset.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Dr. Gillett will monitor Bagwell's progress. In
his Houston office, an autographed picture of Bagwell hangs on the
wall with the following inscription:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for making my life more enjoyable. In the year 2000 I
might actually see what I hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Joked Gillett: ``We're expecting 85 homers this season.''

2 AIR TRAVELERS PLEAD GUILTY TO FLIGHT-ATTENDANT ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two men face up to a year in prison for verbally assaulting two
America West flight attendants on an October flight, an incident
that reveals the growing tensions in air travel.
</P>
<P>
   John Carlucci, 25, and Brian Scalcione, 26, both of Queens,
N.Y., entered guilty pleas Feb. 8 in U.S. District Court in Kansas,
according to U.S. Attorney Jackie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Their arrest stems from an incident Oct. 21 when they were
returning to New York from Las Vegas. After a brief layover in
Phoenix, Carlucci and Scalcione, who admitted that they had been
drinking, clashed with the flight crew, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   They both verbally assaulted the two flight attendants when
Scalcione was refused a drink, and Carlucci admitted that he
threatened the flight attendants, according to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was diverted to Wichita, Kan., and the two men were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Air rage has become an occupational hazard for flight attendants
and threatens the safety of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants is pushing for federal
legislation to increase penalties to $25,000 from $10,000 for
passengers who assault flight crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to tolerate it,'' said Phil Dixon, an America
West flight attendant and union representative.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 272 unruly-passenger incidents reported to
the Federal Aviation Administration and 140 last year, FAA
spokeswoman Kathryn Creedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is probably because of more publicity about how
airlines are pressing charges against unruly passengers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent case involved a US Airways passenger who became
belligerent and tried to open a door during a Feb. 9 flight before
he was wrestled to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident last year, a Las Vegas-based flight
attendant was punched by a passenger on a Cleveland-to-Las Vegas
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has added security inspectors at eight airports,
including Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, to investigate
incidents, Creedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Air-travel tensions have also increased the number of complaints
from passengers about airline employees, among other things.
Customer-service complaints more than doubled last year, to 4,175,
according to U.S. Department of Transportation records.
</P>
<P>
   In the America West assault case, the two unruly passengers,
Carlucci and Scalcione, face a maximum one-year sentence in federal
prison.
</P>
<P>
   However, a plea deal is likely to result in a lighter sentence,
Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The union approved of a plea bargain that would sentence
Carlucci to 45 days in jail, three years of probation, a $1,427
fine for diverting the flight, alcohol-abuse and anger-management
treatment, and a written or verbal apology to the flight crew,
Dixon said. Scalcione faces the same sentence except he would serve
no jail time, under the deal. No sentence date has been set. &QL;

WHO GETS PROMOTED, AND WHY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If we all made widgets, it would be easy to tell who deserved
the biggest raise or the next promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Chris makes eight perfect widgets a day. Lee makes six. Pat
makes 10, but three have quality-control problems. Chris wins.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our jobs aren't that easy to measure. In the real work
world, co-workers often wonder why one person is promoted and
another is not, or why one employee gets rave reviews and big
raises while another hard worker does not.
</P>
<P>
   Two court cases involving tenure decisions _ one at the
University of Missouri and one at the University of Kansas _ offer
a public glimpse into the squishy ground on which hiring and
promotion decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appellate court last week upheld MU's denial of tenure
to Carol M. Lawrence, a faculty member in the accountancy school.
This week, a different federal court trial is focusing on KU's
tenure denial to Cynthia Annett, a member of the ecology and
evolutionary biology faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases involve allegations of sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Employment laws being what they are, leveling charges of
discrimination _ because of sex, race, ethnicity, age, religion or
disability _ is the legal recourse for workers who think they are
unfairly passed over for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The tenure-track world of academia may be a tad different from
other workplaces. But when the plaintiffs' cases alleged mixed
signals and flexible criteria for evaluations in their departments,
their complaints mirrored those of many in the work force and are
worth a further look.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three appellate judges reviewing Lawrence's case
agreed that there was no evidence of sex discrimination in her
tenure denial. They used one paragraph to affirm the lower court's
decision. What's interesting is that the third appellate judge used
nine pages to dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence suggests that Lawrence met the expectations which
were presented to her, and she only fell short when the critical
decision-makers changed the standards as they applied to her,''
wrote Judge Theodore McMillian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the evidence ... indicating that Lawrence was misled
into believing that she was meeting the applicable tenure standards
and that male tenure candidates were not held to the same standards
_ a genuine factual dispute remains as to the truthfulness of the
Curators' proffered reasons for the adverse tenure decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again: Why does one person get promoted and another
doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Does he or she fail to make as many perfect widgets as the
worker at the next desk? Is there a stinky personality problem that
doesn't show up on evaluation checklists? Do standards shift
because of intentional or unintentional discrimination?
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Annett thought they worked as hard, as well and in
as good faith as others who were granted tenure. Even when
dissecting their cases in court, fine minds disagree as to whether
they were or were not wronged.
</P>
<P>
   Why is one person promoted and another not?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, after the widget counting is complete, not even a fly
on the wall knows for sure.

JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF PHYSICIAN PRACTICING CHELATION THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An administrative judge has rejected charges of fraud and
negligence leveled against Gladstone physician Edward McDonagh over
his use of a treatment known as chelation.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Board of Healing Arts wanted to discipline McDonagh
for the way he uses chelation _ a therapy long accepted to treat
metal poisoning _ to treat circulatory diseases.
</P>
<P>
   An Administrative Hearing Commission judge found that on each of
13 counts leveled by the board McDonagh ``is not subject to
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 70-page ruling, Willard Reine noted last month that the
board contemplated in 1989 making a specific rule against the uses
of chelation employed by McDonagh and decided against such a ban.
If the healing arts panel was opposed to the unconventional
approach, Reine wrote, it should have said so rather than penalize
McDonagh for a longstanding practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board should have informed the doctors...about its
position on chelation therapy rather than filing a discipline case
against a doctor who has practiced with the board's knowledge since
1962,'' Reine wrote in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the healing arts board appealed the ruling in
Circuit Court in Jefferson City. Its attorney said the case will
help to clarify when the state can stop a physician from using
methods it finds scientifically invalid even if those methods
maintain support from part of the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental goal is to stop (McDonagh) from practicing
this kind of medicine,'' Kansas City lawyer Glenn Bradford said.
``We also want to see if we can make some law on what Missouri law
accepts as a bona fide school of thought on medical issues.''
</P>
<P>
   By pursuing the McDonagh case, Bradford said, the board can
better establish those areas where it can prohibit some forms of
alternative medicine it believes are based on flawed science, even
when the methods might be popular among some doctors.
</P>
<P>
   One of McDonagh's attorneys, Jefferson City lawyer Max
Humphreys, said that appeal could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Board of Healing Arts is taking a chance if it wants to
make law,'' Humphreys said. ``The administrative hearing commission
isn't overturned very often. The law they make might not be the law
they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The board has tried to discipline McDonagh since 1991, when he
was subjected to a series of questions about basic medical
practices in an oral exam. When McDonagh failed to provide correct
answers about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, antibiotics,
hypertension and a handful of other topics, the board ordered him
to take a written exam. He failed twice and his license was revoked
in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That revocation, however, was put on hold while McDonagh pursued
an appeal. Then McDonagh was recertified by the American
Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians and the board reinstated his
license.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the healing arts board pursued McDonagh for a
handful of chelation cases they claim he mishandled. In a case
first filed in the summer of 1995 _ later dropped and refiled in
late 1996 _ the board made the allegations dismissed by Reine.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, now under appeal by the board, McDonagh was
accused of botching the care of a patient who came to him suffering
from gangrene, later fell into a coma and eventually lost his right
leg to amputation. Other patients discussed in the charges received
chelation after coming to McDonagh for memory loss, joint pain,
depression, lightheadedness and a series of other complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Most at issue in all the cases was McDonagh's use of chelation.
</P>
<P>
   Chelation first came into medical use in pre-World War II
Germany to cure shipyard workers exposed to lead-based paints.
Given by intravenous drip, chelation delivers ethylene diamine
tetra-acetic acid, or EDTA, to the bloodstream. That chemical mix
bonds with metals in the blood and then leaves the body harmlessly
in a patient's urine.
</P>
<P>
   A minority in the medical community believes chelation also can
clear plaque that forms on artery walls and reverse many
circulatory problems.
</P>
<P>
   The healing arts board contends that chelation, as used by
McDonagh and a growing number of physicians, is worthless for those
kinds of ailments.
</P>
<P>
   In taking that position, the board stands with the mainstream of
American medicine. Among those rejecting chelation as a treatment
for vascular disease are the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the
National Institutes of Health, the American Medical Association,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American
Heart Association. Those groups reject both the theory behind the
practice and case studies used to support its validity.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonagh, with support from sizable alternative medicine
advocates such as the American College for Advancement in Medicine,
counters that chelation is a medical breakthrough capable of
sparing millions from more dangerous stopgap treatments such as
heart bypass surgery and angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   Reine took no position on the effectiveness of McDonagh's
methods. Rather he noted that both the board and McDonagh offered
studies to bolster their evaluations of the treatment and that none
was definitive.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the osteopath's use of chelation was at least
not dangerous, that all his patients were well aware that it was
unusual treatment and that it came with no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who go through this treatment revise their diet,
give up smoking, exercise and undergo the chelation treatments,''
Humphreys said. ``And they're getting relief. Something is working
for them.''

BRINGING BULLETS TO A BARBECUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ There was something missing, some minor detail I'd
overlooked and couldn't quite put my finger on.
</P>
<P>
   I'd packed a basket and gone to Encanto Park in central Phoenix
for a picnic. There was a table available under an olive tree.
Nearby was a barbecue grill. The cooler was stocked with burgers
and coleslaw and the appropriate beverages. There were buns and
chips and a bag of charcoal briquettes.
</P>
<P>
   I'd remembered to bring the radio and the Frisbee, the baseball
gloves and a ball, extra napkins, a blanket, condiments,
silverware, a book to read, marshmallows, skewers on which to cook
the marshmallows. Still, there was something lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit me _ firearms.
</P>
<P>
   What I needed was a gun. A 9mm, maybe. Or a shotgun. Perhaps
even one of the ``pre-ban'' assault rifles I see advertised for
sale in the newspaper. And of course lots of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that would be illegal in a Phoenix city park, at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next week or so, however, the Arizona Legislature may
act to put the bullets back in our barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by the state House of Representatives would
prohibit any government entity except the state from restricting
firearms or ammunition in public places.
</P>
<P>
   A number of local government officials and police organizations
complained about the proposal, but it didn't stop the
necktie-wearing militia at the state House from putting the
Saturday Night Special back into the Sunday morning picnic.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Senate has yet to act on the measure, and the
governor may also have a say. In the meantime, lawmakers are being
bombarded with the most potent ammunition militant gun owners have
at their disposal _ e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this week I got hundreds,'' Sen. Chris Cummiskey said.
He'll get more before it's over. Cummiskey supports the right to
bear arms, but, like some others, says the proposed new law goes
too far.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he's unfamiliar with the words of the poet:
</P>
<P>
   `` A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and . . . a loaded Glock 17.''
Or was it a Ruger P97? Or a .45-caliber Colt Defender?
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the new gun law are the same politicians who
preach less big government and more local control; the same people
who, at the same time, decided it's the state's job to close every
strip club and adult entertainment establishment in Arizona, going
so far as to make it illegal to display what one bill describes as
``male genitals in a discernibly turgid state even if completely
and opaquely covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Should that law pass, along with the one allowing weapons in
public places, the following two assumptions could be made (a la
Mae West) about any man approaching you in a park.
</P>
<P>
   1. That IS a gun in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   2. He's NOT glad to see you.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McGibbon and other sponsors of the
guns-guns-everywhere bill didn't want to speak with me. If they
had, I'm sure they'd have said their intent is to protect our
constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's the criminals we need to worry about, they'd say. It's the
criminals we need protection from, not law-abiding citizens. As
such, these brave legislators believe their constituents should be
permitted to carry weapons wherever they want.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, at the state Capitol, where firearms are
strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, not one of Arizona's constitutionally
sensitive legislators has proposed a law that would allow armed
citizens to visit the offices of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Really, can you blame them? &QL;

KC MAN CHARGED IN DRAGGING DEATH OF 6-YEAR-OLD BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas City man accused of stealing a Chevy Blazer and
dragging a 6-year-old Independence boy to his death Tuesday had
been released from jail just hours earlier, despite an outstanding
warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Kim L. Davis, 34, was arraigned Wednesday in Jackson County
Circuit Court and charged with second-degree murder, second-degree
robbery, abuse of a child and kidnapping. He was denied bail.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty on all charges, he could be sentenced to at
least two life sentences. Davis is due back in court at 9 a.m.
March 8 for a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The incident started when Christy Robel of Independence parked
her 1991 Chevrolet Blazer in front of the Mr. Goodcents Subs &AMP;
Pastas at 3010 S. Missouri 291.
</P>
<P>
   Robel left the keys in the ignition and went inside the eatery,
leaving her son, Jake, strapped in his seat belt in the back seat,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Independence police initially said that a man, who restaurant
employees said had been loitering outside, tried to shove the boy
from the Blazer before fleeing. But court documents state Christy
Robel ran outside, opened the Blazer's rear door and tried to grab
her son.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police the man slowed down, looked at the rear of
the vehicle in both the rear-view mirror and over his shoulder,
then sped off.
</P>
<P>
   The door had closed. And Jake was trapped, dangling outside from
the seat belt wrapped around his waist.
</P>
<P>
   Robel screamed for the thief to stop, but he sped off south on
Missouri 291, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Ron and Kella Wells of Independence were driving along Missouri
291 when they saw the boy being dragged. Kella Wells called
Independence police.
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers also saw Jake and followed the Blazer onto
Interstate 70, then Noland Road, where the Wellses and brothers
Fred and Brad Byam cornered the Blazer. They tied the man's legs
until police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird called them heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wouldn't have done it, but they did,'' he
said. ``The citizens involved are heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Beaird learned that Davis should have been behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was released from Carroll County Jail in Carrollton, Mo.,
after serving time for municipal charges in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   His release appears to be the result of miscommunication by
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carroll County Sheriff Joe Arnold, his office
received a fax from Independence police about 11 a.m. Tuesday
saying Davis had paid his $170 fine and should be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get the word to turn him loose, we have to,'' Arnold
said. ``He's a free man.''
</P>
<P>
   But a state warrant had been issued Feb. 16 for Davis' arrest
for a probation violation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Independence nor Carroll County checked to see whether
any outstanding warrants existed _ normally a standard procedure
when prisoners are about to be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we didn't know there were outstanding warrants,''
Arnold said. ``If it's one of our prisoners, we check to see if
anyone else wants them before we let them go. The people (police
departments) we're housing them for, they tell us when to turn them
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence Police Chief Gary George said his department checks
for outstanding warrants when prisoners are booked and when they
are released.
</P>
<P>
   But, George said, the warrant was issued after Davis had been
booked. And Davis wasn't an Independence prisoner when he was
released, George said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't release him,'' George said. ``He is their
prisoner....If he's in their jail, he's their prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson County prosecutor was reluctant to assign blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we would have preferred if he would have been
held,'' Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' criminal record spans some nine years and includes a 1991
conviction for robbery and stealing charges, and a 1999 conviction
for second-degree attempted robbery and resisting arrest after he
tried to steal a car.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Beaird said, Wyandotte County also issued a warrant
for Davis' arrest on drug possession charges.
</P>
<P>
   Back at their home Wednesday, the family of Jake Robel tried to
come to terms with the sudden emptiness his death left.
</P>
<P>
   Jake experienced severe complications at his birth in 1993 and
spent his first two or three months at Children's Mercy Hospital,
said Carol Robel, his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year was a real close one,'' she said. ``But after
that, he just blossomed. We have a very dedicated extended family
that came together during that crisis, and we're coming together
now. We're praying together and we're praying individually.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake was a kindergartner at Glendale Elementary School in
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Three school counselors spent Wednesday visiting with students
and staff, helping them to cope with grief and anger, Principal
Galen Hoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having to work through a lot of emotion here,'' Hoff
said. ``The children, they only know that Jake won't be here
anymore. But adults are dealing with this on a level children don't
yet understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Counselors later told administrators they, too, were affected by
Jake's death. Assistant Superintendent Patty Schumacher said the
death also disturbed district administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one has just brought us to our knees,'' she wept.
</P>
<P>
   Jake's family also was ``struggling'' with their emotions toward
Davis, Carol Robel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to feel compassion in place of anger. It's just
very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The man accused in her grandson's death was escorted into court
Wednesday morning while wearing a bulletproof vest over his red
sweatshirt and baggy black sweatpants. Large bruises stretched
across his forehead from the struggle Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Jake's family eyed Davis and sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson County Circuit Judge Twila Rigby entered a
not-guilty plea and told Davis he would be held without bond,
family members said ``Yes!'' and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird met with Jake's family Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegations are hard for everyone to deal with,'' Beaird
said. ``It's pretty hard stuff to talk to the family and not be
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused to stifle tears and cleared his throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supposed to be the prosecutor and not be affected by this.
But obviously I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Robel is survived by his parents Christy and Greg Robel.
</P>
<P>
   Visitation will be today from 5 to 9 p.m. at Sheil Colonial
Chapel, 11924 47th St. in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be at noon on Friday at St. Mark's
Catholic Church, 3736 Lee's Summit Road in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Burial will follow at Mount Olivet Cemetery &AMP; Chapel Mausoleum,
where Jake's father is the groundskeeper.

RUSSEL STOVER TO CLOSE SOUTH CAROLINA PLANT 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russell Stover Candies will close one of its plants because of
lower-than-expected candy sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City company said Wednesday that it would shut down
its Marion, S.C., plant, which has been making Russell Stover candy
for 30 years. The plant will close April 28, and its 836 employees
will face an uncertain future in an area that already has 12
percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day in Marion,'' said the town's mayor, Bobby
Gerald.
</P>
<P>
   Robinn Weber, vice president of human resources for Russell
Stover, said the company's oldest plant was being closed because
the company can make more candy than it is selling. The sale of
boxed chocolates, its main product, has been less than hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Stover, the country's largest boxed-chocolate maker,
does not disclose sales figures, but Forbes magazine recently
estimated its annual revenue to be $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Stover Candies began in Denver in 1923 with Russell and
Clara Stover making candies and dipping them in chocolate. In 1960
the company was sold to Louis Ward, who is credited with making it
a national firm. Ward died in 1996, and the company is now headed
by his sons, Tom and Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of the company's sales are assumed to still come
from the sale of boxed chocolates, with the Whitman's Sampler its
most popular product. But the company also has sought to diversify
its offerings. For example, it has begun to sell candy bars.
</P>
<P>
   Its boxed-chocolate business is facing more competition,
including giant Hershey Chocolate USA.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Stover candy will continue to be made at its plants in
Corsicana, Texas; Clarksville, Va.; Cookeville, Tenn.; Iola and
Abilene, Kan.; and Montrose, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina plant was one of three Russell Stover plants
with union workers. Weber said that had nothing to do with the
decision to close the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina plant made only boxed chocolates. It also was
one of the company's most labor-intensive operations, with many
employees dipping pieces of fruit in chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges sought to
avert the closing by discussing financial incentives available to
companies doing business in the state. But Russell Stover said that
because the issue was one of producing too much candy, there were
no inducements that could keep it open.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald said Wednesday that the candy plant's fate was clear and
that it was time to market the plant to other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're history,'' he said of Russell Stover's presence in
Marion.
</P>
<P>
   Marion has a population of 7,000, and its county has 36,000
residents. Russell Stover workers are expected to boost the
unemployment rate to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Weber said Russell Stover was cooperating with government
agencies to help workers find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Taylor, business agent for the union that represents
about half the plant's workers, said they were paid an average of
$10 an hour _ good wages for the area.
</P>
<P>
   He said Russell Stover executives had agreed to discuss a
severance package for the workers. He said he hoped the
negotiations would be successful and a severance package would in
place when the plant closed in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough time, but I'm hoping we can get some
money in their pocket when it comes time for them to hit the
highway,'' Taylor said.

FORMER NICHOLS CHAIRMAN, OTHERS FACE FEDERAL FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former J.C. Nichols Co. Chairman Lynn L. McCarthy was charged
Wednesday in a 12-count federal indictment alleging he defrauded
the company of more than $150 million in cash and property. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also named in the indictment were Walter Janes, 65, Nichols'
former chief financial officer and treasurer, and Charles
Schleicher, 70, the company's one-time lawyer and a former director
of Nichols, developer of the Country Club Plaza. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, 67, Janes and Schleicher were variously charged with
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges, mail fraud, wire
fraud, interstate transport of stolen funds and money laundering in
a series of transactions running from 1987 to 1995. The indictment
asks that they be made to forfeit to the government at least $15
million, allegedly the minimum losses caused by the three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All three defendants, through their lawyers, denied the
allegations and vowed they would mount a vigorous defense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Kansas City,
came after a four-year investigation by the FBI and the criminal
division of the Internal Revenue Service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The probe was triggered by allegations of insider dealing that
surfaced after Allen &AMP; Co., a New York investment banking firm,
sued Nichols five years ago after Allen's unsuccessful attempt to
take over Nichols for $50 million. Many of the transactions in
question were reversed as part of a settlement of the civil
litigation in mid-1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's attorney, Curtis Woods of Sonnenschein Nath &AMP;
Rosenthal, said he was ``perplexed'' by the charges, ``which were
resolved to everyone's satisfaction in civil litigation that was
mediated by a federal judge and approved by another federal judge
five years ago.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind,'' Woods said, ``that the litigation involved the
reversal of all these transactions. ... So it's just very
perplexing to find ourselves five years later defending
transactions that, in some cases, date back 10 years. It doesn't
seem fair.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schleicher's attorney, Jim Wyrsch of Wyrsch Hobbs Mirakian &AMP;
Lee, denounced the indictment as an attack on the legal profession
and said his client had ``always maintained the highest moral and
ethical standards.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because business transactions are complex does not mean
that they are illegal,'' Wyrsch said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Janes' attorney, Gerald Handley, said prosecutors were trying
``to criminalize conduct that's been settled already.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lanza, a spokesman for the FBI, said the investigation was
not referred to the bureau, but was ``self-initiated'' after the
Allen civil litigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we saw, we believed there was probably criminal
wrongdoing,'' Lanza said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, a 37-year veteran of Nichols, was ousted as chairman,
president and chief executive officer of the company in May 1995.
As part of a shake-up triggered by the Allen litigation, Janes and
Schleicher also were relieved of their duties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil at Nichols, long regarded as one of the pillars of
Kansas City's corporate community, led to its eventual purchase in
1998 by Highwoods Properties Inc. of Raleigh, N.C. All of the
transactions mentioned in the indictment occurred before the
Highwoods acquisition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was charged in all 12 counts of the indictment, Janes
in 10 counts and Schleicher in seven counts. The 41-page indictment
alleges eight specific acts of racketeering, all involving deals
said to have defrauded Nichols Co. The indictment charges that the
transactions were not approved by Nichols' board of directors or
its executive committee, or were approved on the basis of false or
incomplete information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the transactions were uncovered during the Allen &AMP; Co.
litigation and later detailed in a May 1995 report produced on
behalf of Allen by Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering acts alleged in the indictment: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -In 1992, McCarthy acquired control of two-thirds of Nichols'
stock without paying a dime. In exchange for assuming the debt of
Nichols' employee stock ownership trust, he was given 125,242
shares of J.C. Nichols stock. He never repaid the debt while
collecting millions of dollars in dividends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -In September 1987, McCarthy, Janes and Schleicher deposited
nearly $1.6 million drawn on Nichols' account at Commerce Bank into
a personal account of McCarthy's at Country Club Bank. The funds
were then moved to another McCarthy account at First National Bank
of Shawnee Mission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -Beginning in May 1990, McCarthy and Janes used $4.74 million in
Nichols funds to pay for 6,474 shares of Nichols stock purchased by
McCarthy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -Between January 1992 and July 1992, McCarthy, assisted by Janes
and Schleicher, swapped the 6,474 shares, valued at $6 million, and
a $2.7 million note for $5.9 million in Nichols-owned real estate
and $2.8 million in securities. Nichols allegedly wasn't told that
the shares were pledged to the Miller Nichols Living Trust and that
J.C. Nichols Co. would incur income tax expenses as a result of the
swap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -From January 1994 to May 1994, Janes issued $65,500 in Nichols
checks to himself and used $46,904 to buy two Cadillacs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -Between April 1994 and May 1995, Janes, with McCarthy's
knowledge, issued $1.13 million in Nichols checks to build and
operate Westport Brewing Co., a brewpub. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -On March 31, 1995, McCarthy deposited $508,000 in Nichols funds
into a personal bank account at Boatmen's Bank of Kansas in
Overland Park. Two months later, he transferred $370,000 to
Schleicher's law firm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -On April 17, 1995, McCarthy, Janes and Schleicher wire
transferred $383,475 in Nichols funds to pay off a personal loan of
McCarthy's. The next day, the three wire transferred $1.12 million
to a McCarthy account. A check in that same amount, $1.12 million,
was presented to J.C. Nichols the same day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The indictment offers a stunning version of alleged
behind-the-scenes dealings by McCarthy, once one of Kansas City's
most influential business executives. As head of the company that
developed broad swathes of Kansas City, including the Plaza,
Mission Hills and the Brookside area, McCarthy enjoyed the
prestige, power and perks associated with one of Kansas City's
oldest and most-admired businesses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The one-time Army paratrooper and University of Kansas football
star joined Nichols as an accountant in 1958, became treasurer in
1964 and a vice president in 1972. After ascending to the position
of executive vice president, he was named president in 1980 and
added the title of chief executive officer in 1984. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the year he engineered a debt-heavy buyout of the
founding Nichols family, he succeeded Miller Nichols as chairman of
the company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under McCarthy's leadership, Nichols Co. survived the real
estate bust of the late-1980s by borrowing heavily against the
company's previously debt-free properties _ ultimately including
the Plaza. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the company began to stagger under the burden of its buyout
and bank debt, McCarthy engineered the transaction that gave him
control of 65 percent of Nichols' stock. In return, a partnership
owned by McCarthy assumed $124.5 million in bank debt owed by J.C.
Nichols' employee stock ownership trust, which had been set up to
buy out the Nichols family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, however, never repaid the debt. Meanwhile, McCarthy
collected $3.76 million in dividends on the stock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The deal went pretty much unnoticed _ though it was footnoted in
Nichols' 1993 annual report _ until late 1994, when Allen &AMP; Co.
sued Nichols after Nichols spurned its $50 million takeover
attempt. At the time, Allen, which had previously acted as a
financial adviser to Nichols, held a 6 percent stake in Nichols
through an affiliate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit set off a tangle of litigation during which many of
the deals between McCarthy and Nichols came to light. The
litigation ended in mid-1995, when the parties entered into a
so-called ``global settlement'' resolving most of the lawsuits in
one sweeping agreement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, McCarthy agreed to return the shares
he acquired from the trust and the land he acquired from Nichols. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the litigation simmering and Nichols' board
facing mounting pressure from shareholders, McCarthy and Janes were
ousted in a dramatic shakeup in May 1995. The board also dismissed
Schleicher's law firm, which had done work for McCarthy and
Nichols. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Arthur Andersen report commissioned by Allen &AMP; Co. estimated
Nichols' damages from nine separate insider deals at $71.8 million.
The report also alleged interest-free loans to top Nichols
officials, including $4.84 million advanced to McCarthy between
1992 and 1994. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office subpoenaed the Andersen report in
December 1995, marking the beginning of what turned out to be a
four-year probe involving testimony from numerous witnesses and a
tortuous paper trail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very paper-intensive case,'' said Chris Whitley, a
spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. ``Racketeering charges,
particularly ones that span the period of time we're talking about
here, aren't put together overnight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering charges were brought under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which enables prosecutors
to charge patterns of criminal activity spanning long periods of
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, Janes and Schleicher face up to 20 years in prison on
the RICO and RICO conspiracy counts, 10 years on the interstate
transport and money laundering counts and five years on the mail
and wire fraud counts. They also face $250,000 or more in fines on
each of the 12 counts in the indictment.

PULSIPHER HOSPITALIZED AFTER COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ The left-hander Bill Pulsipher, who is
vying to become the New York Mets' No.5 starter this season, was in
stable condition on Wednesday night at a Port St. Lucie hospital
after a respiratory distress incident at his home late on Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher's wife, Michelle, discovered him collapsed on the
floor of the bathroom at about 4 p.m. Pulsipher, 26, was
unconscious and was having difficulty breathing, and his wife
called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where a tube
was placed down his throat to assist with breathing because doctors
were not comfortable with his oxygen levels. As the evening went
on, Pulsipher's vital signs improved, and the tube was removed.
About 11 p.m., Pulsipher was breathing on his own and was expected
to leave the emergency room for a private room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sitting up,'' said Fred Hina, the Mets' head trainer.
``He had a Pepsi to drink; they'd taken all the tubes out of him.
The only thing left in him is an IV.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips said the cause of the collapse
was unknown. Phillips said Pulsipher will not resume workouts until
the club is ``comfortable with knowing what happened and why it
won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips added: ``They'll run the gamut of tests tomorrow.
They've done some tests already that have not shown anything. But
we have to be confident and at least get an understanding about
what happened before he takes the field again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher has spent all or part of seven of his eight
professional seasons with the Mets' organization, and Phillips said
the team was unaware of anything that might lead to an incident
like Wednesday's.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, he has not had any incidents like this in
the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher threw live batting practice at about 1 p.m. on
Wednesday. His right leg was wrapped tightly after the workout, the
result of a cramp in his hamstring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher chatted amiably afterward with reporters about his
chances of making the starting rotation, his efforts to develop a
changeup and his general preparedness for the season.
</P>
<P>
   He has been throwing since mid-December at the Port St. Lucie
Sports Complex. The Mets are auditioning four starters for the
fifth and final spot in the rotation, but club officials have
privately given Pulsipher the edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets reacquired him from the Milwaukee Brewers on Jan. 21
for infielder Luis Lopez, and when Pulsipher took the mound on
Wednesday, Phillips and manager Bobby Valentine moved from another
field to Pulsipher's, standing behind home plate and watching him
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher is trying to rejoin a Mets rotation he has been out of
since 1995, when he went 5-7 with a 3.98 earned run average in 17
starts. At the time, Pulsipher, Jason Isringhausen and Paul Wilson
were expected to anchor the Mets' staff for the next decade. But
all three developed serious injuries, and Pulsipher was the first
to go down. He experienced soreness in his elbow that September,
and underwent surgery to repair a torn medial collateral ligament
the next April, missing all of the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched at four levels in 1997 attempting to come back, and
in 1998 he was traded to the Brewers, for whom he went 5-6 with a
5.98 era last year. After the elbow surgery, Pulsipher's problems
were compounded by panic attacks he suffered on the mound. He began
taking the antidepressant Prozac to combat the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this spring, Pulsipher said he had matured in several
ways since his rookie season. ``I was a 21-year-old kid when I
first made it to the major leagues,'' he said. ``That's young, and
if you don't change in the next five years and get more mature and
understand some of the things you did when you were younger are
silly, then you're going backward, you're not getting anywhere.'' &QL;

BRINGING BULLETS TO A BARBECUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVED IN ``A'' CATEGORY) PHOENIX _ There was something
missing, some minor detail I'd overlooked and couldn't quite put my
finger on.
</P>
<P>
   I'd packed a basket and gone to Encanto Park in central Phoenix
for a picnic. There was a table available under an olive tree.
Nearby was a barbecue grill. The cooler was stocked with burgers
and coleslaw and the appropriate beverages. There were buns and
chips and a bag of charcoal briquettes.
</P>
<P>
   I'd remembered to bring the radio and the Frisbee, the baseball
gloves and a ball, extra napkins, a blanket, condiments,
silverware, a book to read, marshmallows, skewers on which to cook
the marshmallows. Still, there was something lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit me _ firearms.
</P>
<P>
   What I needed was a gun. A 9mm, maybe. Or a shotgun. Perhaps
even one of the ``pre-ban'' assault rifles I see advertised for
sale in the newspaper. And of course lots of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that would be illegal in a Phoenix city park, at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next week or so, however, the Arizona Legislature may
act to put the bullets back in our barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by the state House of Representatives would
prohibit any government entity except the state from restricting
firearms or ammunition in public places.
</P>
<P>
   A number of local government officials and police organizations
complained about the proposal, but it didn't stop the
necktie-wearing militia at the state House from putting the
Saturday Night Special back into the Sunday morning picnic.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Senate has yet to act on the measure, and the
governor may also have a say. In the meantime, lawmakers are being
bombarded with the most potent ammunition militant gun owners have
at their disposal _ e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this week I got hundreds,'' Sen. Chris Cummiskey said.
He'll get more before it's over. Cummiskey supports the right to
bear arms, but, like some others, says the proposed new law goes
too far.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he's unfamiliar with the words of the poet:
</P>
<P>
   `` A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and . . . a loaded Glock 17.''
Or was it a Ruger P97? Or a .45-caliber Colt Defender?
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the new gun law are the same politicians who
preach less big government and more local control; the same people
who, at the same time, decided it's the state's job to close every
strip club and adult entertainment establishment in Arizona, going
so far as to make it illegal to display what one bill describes as
``male genitals in a discernibly turgid state even if completely
and opaquely covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Should that law pass, along with the one allowing weapons in
public places, the following two assumptions could be made (a la
Mae West) about any man approaching you in a park.
</P>
<P>
   1. That IS a gun in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   2. He's NOT glad to see you.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McGibbon and other sponsors of the
guns-guns-everywhere bill didn't want to speak with me. If they
had, I'm sure they'd have said their intent is to protect our
constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's the criminals we need to worry about, they'd say. It's the
criminals we need protection from, not law-abiding citizens. As
such, these brave legislators believe their constituents should be
permitted to carry weapons wherever they want.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, at the state Capitol, where firearms are
strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, not one of Arizona's constitutionally
sensitive legislators has proposed a law that would allow armed
citizens to visit the offices of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Really, can you blame them? &QL;

THE THINGS WE DO FOR HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Today I start a new lifestyle; I hope it's not too
late.
<P>
   I'm going on a strict diet of chocolate, tobacco and red wine,
and I'm moving to a house next to the nearest nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy making these changes, but a person can't be too
careful about his or her health.
</P>
<P>
   Red wine, of course, has been determined to be good for your
heart. Now scientific studies show that chocolate can help prevent
coronary problems, and tobacco has great promise in the prevention
and treatment of Alzheimer's and other bad stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch today: bottle of chianti, a license-plate-size Mr. Goodbar
and a cigar. Why be moderate when it comes to safeguarding your
health?
</P>
<P>
   As for the relocation to the power plant neighborhood, you may
have seen a recent news story about a leak at a New York nuclear
plant that resulted in the release of radioactive steam over a
highly populated area.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the leak was small, barely radioactive and thus
posed no health threat.
</P>
<P>
   Reader Gar Smith has been checking out news stories on nuclear
leaks for 30 years and observes that  &UR; in every case, &LR;  officials
announce that the leak poses no risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' says Gar,  &UR; ``eau d'isotope  &LR; remains the only form of
pollution that poses no health problem.''
</P>
<P>
   RUBE GOLDBERG'S finest invention was our system of presidential
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain vaults into contention by winning his home state and
getting slaughtered by Republican voters in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   And of course it all started with McCain's great showing in New
Hampshire, wherever that is, and South Carolina, which is somewhere
below New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, independent votes count; in others, cross-party
votes count. In some states, they blindfold you at the polls and
you pin a donkey tail on a candidate, then they tabulate votes
according to the infield fly rule.
</P>
<P>
   I'VE GOT to admit, it's getting better, a little better all the
time. ...
</P>
<P>
   That's what they sing on that TV commercial for Philips
televisions, using the Beatles' song.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing we had great music in the '50s and '60s,
otherwise there would be thousands of TV ad writers begging for
spare change on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Tyler Hollingsworth points out that on those Phillips
commercials, they leave out the Beatles' next line, which is,
``Can't get no worse.''
</P>
<P>
   AND MICROSOFT, taking the high-brow road, has a TV commercial
for its Internet Explorer browser program. The music is the theme
of the ``Confutatis Maledictis'' from Mozart's Requiem, notes the
eagle-eared Tom Yarish.
</P>
<P>
   The on-screen caption is ``Where do you want to go today?'' And
in the background, the chorus sings, ``Confutatis maledictis,
flammis acribus addictis.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, Yarish points out, translates to, ``The damned and
accursed are convicted to the flames of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's a southbound search engine.
</P>
<P>
   CONDEMNED TO Limbaugh Limbo are people like me who don't pledge
allegiance to radio god Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Actually it was cool to see so many Dittoheads knee-jerk, I mean
spring, to the defense of their leader after less-than-kind things
were said about him here.
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder about the female Rush-backers, since Rushbo
considers any woman who's not busy revarnishing her husband's
snooker table to be a ``Femi-Nazi.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE MORE from Gar Smith, who read the headline, ``Report: Tahoe
will soon turn green.''
</P>
<P>
   Gar wonders: ``In time for Earth Day?''
</P>
<P>
   RICK ROCKWELL and Darva Conger, I'd like you to meet Dennis
Rodman and Carmen Electra.
</P>
<P>
   Rick and Darva, two nice kids, and who knows where it all fell
apart. Maybe it was the first morning, when they awoke in the same
stateroom, looked at one another and screamed in terror.
</P>
<P>
   One report is that Rick tried to kiss Darva and she said, ``I
don't do that on the first marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show was a ratings success, and next up for Fox is:
``Who Wants to Run for President on the GOP Ticket?''

NO WILD CARD LIKELY IN JACKSON'S HAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Coach Phil Jackson has openly pined for
reinforcements in the Lakers' frontcourt, but he knows a trade
before today's 3 p.m. deadline is highly unlikely. And he's at
least a little disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if `resolved' is the word I would use,'' he said
of his outlook. ``My constitution is prepared. My resolution is
that I won't say anything. . . . The reality is that at this time,
pretty much everything is backed off. Everybody's gone home an kind
of closed shop, basically. There will probably be one more deal
done (in the league) before it's over. But there's not a whole lot
of movement right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Lakers' 43-11 record, tied for best in the NBA,
suggests Jackson can't be too concerned with the roster he has,
even if it is lacking in bulk behind Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the kind of person that says give me the cards and lets
see what happens,'' Jackson said, ``and unfortunately, we got some
cards that have been dealt us. . . . The opponents that sit ahead
of us, or alongside us, in San Antonio and Portland's case, are big
and long, lanky and multisized in the front. We're going to have to
find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   When 3 p.m. passes, it will also no doubt lift a burden from
Glen Rice's shoulders, as he'll know he's here for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a decisive moment for him,'' Jackson said. ``It
will be a message that's been lingering for him for five months.
But I hope it's one . . . he's ecstatic about. He's expressed that
to me. But I hope in reality it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, perhaps wanting to avoid the issue, hasn't spoken with
reporters for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Grand opening: After months of delays, the Lakers' new
practice facility in El Segundo is ready. So, ditching convention,
Jackson will hold a practice there today, right after the Lakers
land at LAX to conclude a six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no stopping us right now,'' Jackson said, noting the
Lakers have another five games over the next eight days. ``So it's
pretty much the same old thing right now when we get back home.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, several areas of the training facility were not
ready, though the court is down and the rims are up. Jackson has
impatiently awaited this day but wouldn't say he's happy just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just see what goes on there. I may be happy when I get
there, I may not be,'' he said. ``They're telling me there's a lot
of touches left.''

GAY-MARRIAGE MEASURE PITS FATHER AGAINST SON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  David Knight, the gay son of the man behind the same-sex
marriage ban on California's ballot next month, broke a long
silence Wednesday to denounce the measure and talk about the pain
it has caused his family.
<P>
   ``I completely disagree with my father, and I don't think this
is right,'' he said about Proposition 22, sponsored by state Sen.
William ``Pete'' Knight. ``I think this story should get out to
help other people. It took me until I was 32 years old to stand up
and talk about who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Knight had declined press interviews since he wrote
an op-ed piece attacking his father's views, published in the Los
Angeles Times last fall. In that piece, he said his father was
pursuing a political agenda at the expense of gays, and their
relationship ended the day David came out to him. He described his
father's position as ``blind'' and ``uncaring.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Knight responded that what has become a very public matter
between father and son should have remained private. Proposition 22
was designed to pre-empt same-sex marriages should they ever become
legal in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never get the point across to him that he's exactly
right. It is a private matter,'' David Knight said in a
teleconference with reporters set up by the No on Knight campaign.
``What he is attempting to do is single out a group that have
private, personal relationships. ... I wish he understood that, but
he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Knight, the measure's sponsor, issued a press release
Wednesday accusing its opponents of ``exploiting a private family
matter for political gain.'' It said he knew David had been under
pressure to make statements against his father and the ballot
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative says marriage is valid only between a man and a
woman. Proponents say it simply protects the status quo. Opponents
say similar measures in other states have been used to undermine
domestic partner laws and other statutes that benefit gays and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every family has its problems, but I think my son knows in his
heart that Proposition 22 is about public policy and has nothing to
do with him and me,'' the elder Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   Describing his relationship with his father now as ``extremely
strained,'' the 38-year-old cabinetmaker said he supports same-sex
marriage. When he denounced his father's politics last year,
``there was anger there, and I wanted to put a face on it.'' But
that didn't alter his feelings for his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I angry that he was in the forefront of this issue? Yes,''
he said. ``It's just anger, and it's just disagreement. I still
love my father.''
</P>
<P>
   David Knight said he has been with his partner, Joe, for six
years. They share a home in Baltimore. The elder Knight met Joe a
few years ago at Thanksgiving at the home of one of David's two
brothers, and the evening was tense.
</P>
<P>
   But father and son got along fine when David was in the Air
Force, when he followed in his father's footsteps and became a
fighter pilot and when he returned after flying missions in the
Gulf War, David said. It was only after he learned of David's
homosexuality that the two became estranged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my father as being pro-family in a very narrow sense.
He's pro-family as long as it's the norm,'' the younger Knight
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Knight says he has stayed away from the media to keep the
issue focused on marriage, not on him. The television ads for
Proposition 22 show images such as a family anniversary celebration
and position the measure as championing traditional marriage and
the right of Californians to decide how to define it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The images) strike me as something I know my father would
approve of as a very positive and ethical campaign,'' the younger
Knight said. ``They're all wonderful images. But reality shows
images that are slightly altered from that, and they can be just as
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Knight debunked the widely held belief among
opponents that his father is working out his issues with his son _
and a gay brother who died of AIDS _ at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a view of what he thinks marriage and family are.
He's doing what he really honestly believes,'' his son said.

AT THE GRAMMY'S, IT'S A LATIN THING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't take long Wednesday to tell which way the Grammy wind
was blowing.
</P>
<P>
   And for any record academy nominee in a major category whose
name was not Carlos Santana, the refrain was undoubtedly ``oy vey
como va.'' Front-runner Santana's sweep of the awards for his lush
``Supernatural'' album and its savvy hit single, ``Smooth,'' was
one of the few sure bets at the 42nd annual ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   It had to happen. The 52-year-old Mexico-born guitarist was long
overdue for academy recognition, even if it was sandwiched between
performances by teen faves Backstreet Boys and Kid Rock.
</P>
<P>
   But Santana's big night also spearheaded one of last year's
biggest trends _ the explosive success of Latin music and Latino
musicians. Among the highlights of the telecast from Staples Center
were sizzling performances by Marc Anthony, Ricky Martin, Poncho
Sanchez, Chucho Valdes and Ibrahim Ferrer of Cuba's Buena Vista
Social Club. Not to mention actress-singer Jennifer Lopez and her
eye-popping sliver of a dress, which kicked off the three-hour show
and made a convincing argument for open borders.
</P>
<P>
   Santana's ``Supernatural,'' though, was clearly the right album
at the right time. With its stylish multicultural sound that fused
rock-blues riffs to Latin rhythms and cameos from Rob Thomas, Dave
Matthews, Everclear, Eric Clapton, Lauryn Hill and others, the
album caught the Latin-pop wave, giving the veteran guitarist a
broad new audience in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was conceived to his music,'' joked Grammy-winning
band leader Chris Perez, who is in his 20s. ``My parents were big
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santana record and certain others were clearly deserving of
their trophies.
</P>
<P>
   There were few arguments backstage among the music press when,
for example, Beck's ``Mutations'' won best alternative music
performance or George Jones' ``Choices'' took the best male country
vocal performance trophy.
</P>
<P>
   It was equally heartening to see Ruben Blades' ambitious
``Tiempos'' awarded the best Latin pop performance nod, while the
great Cuban dance band Los Van Van's ``Llego ... Van Van: Van Van
Is Here'' got the best salsa performance vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, as usual, the music industry's annual schmooze fest had
little to do with much of the most exciting music created last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Those miniature gold-plated gramophones the academy gleefully
hands out each February ultimately end up on a very select number
of mantles.
</P>
<P>
   But that's old news. The Grammys, although the academy strongly
denies it, rewards sales figures first and foremost, just like its
rival, the American Music Awards. That's why a Mouseketeers chorus
line of Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and Christina Aguilera
turned up this year in the top categories.
</P>
<P>
   It was an attempt by the normally out-of-touch voting members to
mirror the ebbs and flows of the teen-dominated pop marketplace.
But our gang assuredly missed the boat when it comes to pop's other
driving force _ hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   No examples of this highly influential genre were represented in
the night's key categories, a glaring omission that further tainted
Grammy's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. There's always next year. The academy recently
announced the formation of a Latin Grammy Awards to take place
Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised to learn of a separate rap academy at some
point in the future, probably years after hip-hop's relevance has
passed.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Grammy way. &QL;

BUSH COMMITS TO L.A. DEBATE WITH MCCAIN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ In his first trip to California since November,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush agreed Wednesday to debate his GOP rivals
next week in Los Angeles and pledged to spend much of the final
week before the March 7 primary campaigning in the state.
<P>
   ``I look forward to the Los Angeles Times debate (on March 2),
which I will accept today,'' Bush said while campaigning in
Southern California. ``I look forward to spending a lot of time
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloodied in Tuesday's Michigan primary, Bush is looking to
California for the knockout blow that will end Arizona Sen. John
McCain's surprisingly successful insurgent campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And the campaign for the state's 162 Republican delegates is
likely to be a nasty one, if Bush's visit Wednesday was any
harbinger.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasted no time in criticizing McCain's tactics in the
Michigan primary and suggested he was the real winner in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed last night to hear that my opponent was reaching
out to Republicans,'' Bush said. ``That's an amazing admission to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls in Michigan showed that much of McCain's support came
from Democrats and independents who were permitted to vote in the
Republican primary, a fact that Bush took pains to point out.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said he lost ``the liberal Democratic vote''
to McCain in Michigan's all-comers primary, but said he
``overwhelmingly won the Republican vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was angered at a telephone campaign in Michigan that
suggested he is anti-Catholic because of his appearance at Bob
Jones University in South Carolina, where leaders of the college
have called the Catholic church ``a satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters the McCain campaign denied having anything to
do with the calls until ``after the polls closed, you'd put up your
notebooks and the cameras had been turned off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain ``claims to be riding his high horse, but takes
the low road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept that type of campaigning,'' he said. ``I don't
appreciate it one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush may have put aside the ``compassionate conservative''
mantle for the down-and-dirty primaries in South Carolina and
Michigan, it was back for the California swing.
</P>
<P>
   His first stop Wednesday was at a downtown Los Angeles church
that has taken over an abandoned hospital to run a variety of
religious and social programs.
</P>
<P>
   While there, he visited with schoolchildren, listened to
concerns from people involved in nonprofit charitable organizations
and took a few questions before trying out his California-friendly,
kinder and gentler message.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reason for being here is I want Americans ... to understand
a vision where there are hundreds of soldiers in the army of
compassion, marching toward a goal,'' Bush said. The job of an
American president, he said, ``was to rally the armies of
compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stressed that America needs to support faith-based and
nonprofit groups that can do what government cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great false hope of the past is that government can save
people's lives,'' he said. ``It can hand out money, but it can't
fill the holes in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He also opposed a plan by McCain that would eliminate some of
the tax benefits of donating stock and property to charity, a move
that many charitable groups oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan that (McCain) let out that will discourage charitable
giving is a bad plan,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush moved to shore up his Latino support in California by doing
a half-hour of questions and answers on the Spanish-language
Univision network.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush backed away from suggestions that
former Gov. Pete Wilson had hurt Republicans' relations with the
state's Latino voters by backing a variety of politically divisive
issues such as tougher immigration standards.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Pete is a friend,'' Bush said, ``we obviously have work
to do with Latino voters in California, and we will start that this
afternoon.''

FBI TO AID IN L.A. POLICE PROBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sought for their independence from Los Angeles'
political culture, the FBI and U.S. Justice Department have joined
the LAPD corruption investigation team to examine possible civil
rights violations, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we transition into the next stage, it is important for us
to look at the most significant issues, which we believe are the
potential civil rights violations,'' Police Chief Bernard C. Parks
said at a Parker Center news conference with Mayor Richard Riordan,
District Attorney Gil Garcetti and federal law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (federal officials) carry a level of independence. We
believe independence is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to seek federal assistance in the probe comes amid
pressure from some City Council members, civil rights groups and
even the Los Angeles police union for setting up an independent
citizens commission to oversee the probe _ a move resisted by Parks
and Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Six FBI agents will work with the Los Angeles Police
Department's special task force, which is investigating allegations
by former officer-turned-informant Rafael Perez that he and other
cops in the Rampart Division's anti-gang CRASH unit assaulted gang
members, planted evidence and lied in court to achieve
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, while not criticizing
the FBI's involvement directly, said it supports reforms that would
prevent a similar scandal in the future, but has grown concerned
about protecting the rights of officers facing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The police union said in a statement, ``We express our concern
for due process in this investigation, protection against a witch
hunt, security against scapegoating and against looking for someone
to blame where blame is ubiquitous and systemwide.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least 11 officers have been relieved of duty and the
District Attorney's Office has moved to drop charges against nearly
40 people prosecutors believe were wrongly convicted based on
perjured testimony by officers. Lawsuits from the cases are
expected to cost more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said he will have federal
prosecutors work with the District Attorney's Office to determine
how officers should be charged with crimes and which office should
undertake the prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to assure that corruption and civil rights
violations are prosecuted fully and aggressively,'' Mayorkas said.
</P>
<P>
   James DeSarno Jr., assistant director of the FBI's office here,
said agents will work with the LAPD, but will remain independent in
the information they develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no greater trust than what we give to our police _
the right to take away a person's freedom,'' DeSarno said.
</P>
<P>
   Asking the federal agencies for help represents a sharp change
in the LAPD tradition of handling its own inquiries. Officials said
they are heeding public calls for independent examination of the
cases, but without resorting to a private citizens panel.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, who first disclosed the request for federal officials
during his monthly radio talk show on a Los Angeles radio station,
called the action ``a big step on the road to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do everything in our power and tap every resource to
ensure that the people who have been wrongfully imprisoned are
released as quickly as possible and that officers who committed
crimes are brought to justice as quickly as possible,'' Riordan
said. ``This must be our No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said
his office also is reviewing the progress of the LAPD
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expanding our review to assure the public that the
Rampart investigation is thorough and fair, and to provide an early
start in carrying out the attorney general's oversight and review
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the LAPD investigators have begun to look beyond the
testimony provided by Perez and are looking into whether any other
officers at the Rampart Division or other police stations also were
involved in wrongdoing. Parks has told the City Council there has
been indication of problems at other stations.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development Wednesday, the City Council's Budget
and Finance Committee asked for more details on Riordan's proposal
to sell bonds that would be repaid with $300 million expected
during the next 25 years from a national tobacco settlement to
obtain $100 million in upfront cash for future lawsuits stemming
from the Rampart scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the council asked the Police Commission to consider
a proposal by Councilwoman Laura Chick to separate its inquiries of
officers into areas dealing with administrative discipline from
those involving criminal charges. It is based on a model used by
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Parks and Garcetti refused to be
drawn into a behind-the-scenes dispute that has developed over the
pace in which cases are being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no turf war,'' Garcetti insisted. ``You cannot just
file a case or it would be thrown out of court. Our job is to
protect the innocent as well as prosecute the guilty. When we go to
court, we want to make sure we are working properly.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti estimated his office would be prepared to file its
first cases within three months.
</P>
<P>
   During his radio appearance, however, Riordan said he believes
steps have to be taken soon to begin prosecution of bad cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public and myself are very upset that nothing's happened
to these officers who committed these incredible crimes,'' Riordan
said, adding he believes action is needed to restore public
confidence. ``This is one step, but an important one for the city
and the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayorkas said his office has monitored the Rampart investigation
since September, but only now would take a more active role in the
case, as would the FBI, which specializes in civil rights
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important to the officials was heading off calls by
Councilman Joel Wachs and others for an independent citizens review
of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an independent civilian review in the Police
Commission,'' Commission President Gerald Chaleff said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski pointed to the City Council's
vote Tuesday to allow the commission to do its work reviewing a
separate Board of Inquiry report, which is due next week.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs, however, said he believes it necessary to conduct an
independent review of conditions that allowed the Rampart situation
to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the help, but as I see their investigation it is to
see who did wrong and prosecute them,'' Wachs said. ``But it
doesn't do away with the need to look at the broader issues of how
this happened and rebuild morale. That kind of inquiry raises
issues beyond the scope of this investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for this Perez getting caught stealing cocaine,
none of this would have come out. There is something wrong in the
system when this type of behavior was allowed to exist and no one
knew about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they would be so cynical to think that
bringing in the FBI will prevent the need for an independent
review. If anything, it shows the need even more.''
</P>

STARS SHOCK RED WINGS WITH FOUR-GOAL THIRD PERIOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Blank stares, rounded shoulders and a few dropped jaws
littered Detroit's bench.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes hadn't expired in period No. 3, somebody named Aaron
Gavey had just scored the Stars' second goal in 45 seconds, and
what had until then been a swaggering Red Wings bunch instead was
staggering in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they're not shocked that Aaron Gavey scored,'' Gavey
joked. ``Seriously, any time you score back-to-back goals, it
deflates a hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   Deflates? The Red Wings fell flat on their face as the one-goal
lead they took into the period turned into a 5-2 loss at Joe Louis
Arena last night. The Stars have an NHL-best seven victories this
season when trailing after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we collapsed,'' Red Wings defenseman Steve Duchesne
said. ``I'm not too sure exactly what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Stars, to be honest.
</P>
<P>
   Five goals is a couple of games worth of goals for them. They've
been hard-pressed to eclipse two for most games, much less four in
a period as they did in the third last night.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Thornton scored at 1:11, sweeping in a rebound on a
Richard Matvichuk shot.
</P>
<P>
   Gavey scored at 1:56, taking a pretty cross-ice feed from Mike
Modano and whipping a shot past Wings goalie Chris Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   Modano scored at 13:43, directing a no-look pass by Jamie
Langenbrunner, on a play begun by Brenden Morrow, past Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Keane scored at 14:23, turning a Jamie Wright pass into
goal No. 5. ``Us? Five goals?'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said
repeating that number. ``Pretty crazy, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   What's even crazier is who is involved on most of the goals, the
Morrows and Wrights and Gaveys.
</P>
<P>
   All of them began the season with the Stars' minor-league
affiliate, the Michigan K-Wings. Stars coach Ken Hitchcock noted
that it wasn't too long ago when a game like last night's would've
been too rich for the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are playing with a lot of confidence,'' Hitchcock said.
``They are playing like they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   They've had to. The injuries that have plagued the Stars since
the second game of the season haven't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were missing two of their most consistent players, Guy
Carbonneau and Blake Sloan, last night. That's in addition to Conn
Smythe winner Joe Nieuwendyk, Selke Trophy winner Jere Lehtinen,
defenseman Shawn Chambers and forward Brian Skrudland.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the injuries, the Stars' fourth line consisted of a
defenseman playing in his first NHL game at wing (Brad Lukowich), a
player who has spent most of this season injured (Grant Marshall)
and a center who spent most of this season being bounced from
Kalamazoo to Dallas (Gavey).
</P>
<P>
   ``How is that different than any other game this season?'' Stars
forward Kirk Muller asked.
</P>
<P>
   Not much. The Stars just keep finding a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the season, the way found was defense. Last night,
it was offense. The end result is the same. Their victory coupled
with Phoenix's loss to Toronto gave the Stars a four-point lead in
the Pacific Division, which is big considering the first-round
series for the second-place finisher would likely begin in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it would scare the Stars, who have sent a message to
the rest of the league that they're not giving back the Stanley Cup
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take it how they want to take it,'' Sydor said. ``We
have thought all along we'd keep on winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't look good after two periods. For the second
consecutive game, the Stars trailed 1-0 after one shot. Nashville
scored 26 seconds into Monday's game. Detroit's Slava Kozlov scored
1 minute, 15 seconds into last night's.
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Brett Hull tied the game at the 13-minute mark,
only his third goal in 2000. The Stars were trailing after two
periods, though, thanks to a goal by Brendan Shanahan at 9:44 of
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Thornton, followed shortly by Gavey, and it was
all but over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boom,'' Modano said. ``We score four, and it's pretty much
over.'' nn

NOT QUITE A GRAMMY TV NIGHT TO REMEMBER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: note ITALICS below) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of the Grammys as a Super Bowl halftime show, only without
a football game to justify it. It's spectacle for the sake of
spectacle, and it's gaudy bordering on obscene, but you just can't
take your eyes off it.
</P>
<P>
   The 42nd annual Grammy Awards ceremony, presented on CBS from
downtown's Staples Center, offered a nice, eclectic blend of
performances worth checking out. If only you didn't have to wade
through the tedium of the handing out of trophies and everyone
drearily thanking managers and groupies and catering services and
God to get to them.
</P>
<P>
   Will Smith opened the evening strutting around on a set that
looked like a carny midway from the movie ``Blade Runner.'' Smith
was a guy who clearly knew how to exploit the pageantry, but there
were also strong performances by artists who didn't need splashy
histrionics to make their point.
</P>
<P>
   One highlight was the Latin music medley, performed by Marc
Anthony, the ever-charismatic Ricky Martin and Cuban vocalist
Ibrahim Ferrer, who at 72 demonstrated gratifying energy as he
performed a brisk version of ``Candela.'' Another interesting
collaboration brought together Diana Krall, George Benson and
Erykah Badu.
</P>
<P>
   There were likewise some odd if not terribly inspired
juxtapositions among the presenters. Jamie Foxx, Busta Rhymes and
``Ally McBeal's'' Jane Krakowski, delivering the Best Female R&AMP;B
Vocal award. Andy Williams, Phil Collins and Macy Gray, announcing
Song of the Year. Michael Clarke Duncan, Moby and Shirley Manson
feting the Rap Duo or Group Performance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these intros were amateurish, with presenters chuckling
or muttering to themselves _ do they not understand this is going
out over national TV? _ and almost all of them were awkward. Macy
Gray even apologized for her scripted banter.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks offered up an ode to felonious female
self-empowerment. Kid Rock's segment offered a glimpse of a midget
grabbing his crotch. Faith Hill delivered a ballad perched atop
heels so precarious that she didn't dare take a step _ all she
could do was wobble her legs a bit. Grammy Legend winner Elton John
performed ``Philadelphia Freedom,'' but it would've been nice to
let him make an acceptance speech, too _ his probably would have
been the one colorful, memorable one of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Host Rosie O'Donnell opened with a monologue as flat as Bob
Dylan trying to hit a high C. She began with a bewildering joke
about having the ceremony either at the Staples Center or at a
Kinko's, then offered her witless admission, playing off Melissa
Etheridge's recent revelation that David Crosby was the father of
her child, that Rosie herself was one of Crosby's progeny _ and
that's funny (BEGIN ITALICS)why,(END ITALICS) exactly?
</P>
<P>
   She offered random but fatuous pokes at Whitney Houston, Sean
``Puffy'' Combs' and Diana Ross' recent run-ins with the law, or at
least folks wearing security uniforms at airports around the world.
Her comic batting average was lower than Michael Jordan's when he
played double-A ball.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the television portion of the ceremony didn't convey what
a triumphant night it was for Carlos Santana. Of the three awards
he won before the TV audience _ of the record-tying eight in total
that he grabbed _ one was Best Song, which didn't even bring him on
stage. Most of his trophies were handed out before the broadcast,
so the Staples Center audience, if not the home viewers, probably
had already figured out he was going to sweep the evening. His
``Supernatural,'' which won album of the year, had virtually
everyone in the audience contributing to it.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it was a night where the veterans beat the young
artists: Sting and Whitney Houston both won with the same old same
old in categories otherwise dominated by fresher, more vibrant
talent _ the people who a decade or two from now, presumably, will
be receiving Grammys for warmed-over versions of the more vital
music they created this year. Wouldn't it be nice if, instead of
constantly playing catch-up, the Grammy folks actually gave the
trophies to those who deserved them in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, nominees in major categories included the
likes of the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and Christina
Aguilera, performers whose fan base doesn't reach beyond puberty.
It takes an (BEGIN ITALICS)academy(END ITALICS) to honor this sort
of music? Why not just a fan club of teen-age girls? Choosing the
best among these folks is like choosing the smartest castaway among
Gilligan, the Skipper and Mrs. Howell.
</P>
<P>
   And hand the Grammy for best feigned expression of surprise to
Aguilera, who breathlessly declared, ``Oh my God, you guys. I
seriously don't have a speech prepared,'' before rattling off with
steely professional aplomb what may have been the longest laundry
list of thank yous of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Of the pre-ceremony show, the less said the better. Ellen
DeGenerous, also riffing on Melissa Etheridge's strange bedfellows
with David Crosby, paraded around with a cup asking for donors. It
got exponentially less funny the more she milked the joke. Ricky
Martin didn't even appear to get the gag when she asked him, so she
changed gears and offered up the penetrating observation: ``You're
so lucky! Your life is amazing!''
</P>
<P>
   He, and we, had to agree. &QL;

LAVIN NEEDS HELP, NOT A PINK SLIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA men's basketball team is on pace for its
worst regular season in 12 years and its worst conference season in
52 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' NCAA Tournament hopes are fading. They are not
competitive against the top teams in the conference. Their offense
is chaotic, their defense is flawed, their fundamentals are
atrocious and last week in Arizona they played without passion.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, coach Steve Lavin's future has replaced handicapped
parking as the hottest topic in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   This is Lavin's fourth season since replacing Jim Harrick in
November '96 and the Bruins have gotten progressively worse. In
1997, Lavin's rookie year, they won 24 games and the Pac-10 title.
In 1998, they won 24 games and finished third in the Pac-10. In
1999, they won 22 games and again finished third. This season,
they're on pace to win 17 games and finish sixth or seventh.
</P>
<P>
   By conventional standards, the program has deteriorated. By UCLA
standards, it has crumbled. In the resulting rubble, three
questions have emerged:
</P>
<P>
   __ Can the Bruins afford to fire Lavin?
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be cheap, but yes.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Lavin received a six-year, $578,000-per-year
contract. It includes a rollover clause: For each year of the
contract, Lavin has the option to add a year, making it, in
essence, a 12-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin receives $153,000 in base salary, $35,000 for running
UCLA's summer camps, $195,000 for media promotional appearances,
and $195,000 in Adidas compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout is front-loaded. According to records obtained by the
Daily News, UCLA would owe Lavin $1.190 million if he's fired after
this season. (That's the base salary for the remaining five years
of his contract, plus next year's summer camp, appearance and
apparel compensation.)
</P>
<P>
   If he's fired after next season, the Bruins would owe Lavin
$765,000, the base salary for his remaining five years.
</P>
<P>
   The difference ($425,000) is a paltry sum compared to the
school's $22 million deal with Adidas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to fire him, the money isn't a problem,'' said a
source with close ties to several prominent donors.
</P>
<P>
   __ Should they fire Lavin?
</P>
<P>
   This is Lavin's first bad year _ !ital!see accompanying chart _
and nobody deserves to be fired after one bad year. Not teachers,
not electricians, not UCLA basketball coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's critics point to lethargy, turnovers, bad shots and
sloppy defense as cause for termination. But the fundamentals
aren't any worse than they've been. UCLA's effort was inconsistent
in 1998 and it's inconsistent now. Its practices were inefficient
then and they're inefficient now. The offense was chaotic then and
it's chaotic now. The defense was unsound then and it's unsound
now. (If someone pump-fakes on a blacktop in the South Bronx, Dan
Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso leave their feet.)
</P>
<P>
   The difference is UCLA doesn't have Charles O'Bannon, Toby
Bailey, Kris Johnson, J.R. Henderson and Baron Davis to make plays
in the final minutes. Without them, close wins have become close
losses, close losses have become bad losses, and confidence has
eroded.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have been fundamentally unsound for years _ since
long before Lavin took command _ but they were always confident and
they had experienced playmakers. Now, they have none of the three.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: The status quo won't cut it. The Bruins
either must make staff changes, dramatically improve their teaching
and discipline in practice or hire an adviser. Lavin, Michael
Holton, Jim Saia and Steve Spencer need help, and they need it now.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's future should not be based on the final weeks. Even if
the Bruins regroup and make the NCAA Tournament _ they usually play
best when least expected _ the problems will remain.
</P>
<P>
   __ Will they fire Lavin?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't comment on coaching situations during the season,''
athletic director Peter Dalis said.
</P>
<P>
   If Lavin commits an off-court transgression _ if he breaks the
law, violates NCAA rules, fails to enforce academic standards or
embarrasses the school _ he's in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But Dalis and vice chancellor Peter Blackman don't believe one
bad season is cause for termination. If they didn't fire Harrick
after the Tulsa debacle in 1994, they probably aren't going to fire
Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   And they shouldn't. &QL;

CALIFORNIA PRIMARY BATTLE TO DETERMINE RACE FOR GOP CANDIDATES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEVILLE, Calif. _ Sketching vastly different images of the
Republican Party, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John
McCain arrived in California Wednesday to begin a two-week battle
that is likely to determine the GOP presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused his rival of using Democrats to ``hijack'' the
nomination process, while McCain said he is trying build a
``governing coalition'' that could win in November.
</P>
<P>
   Staring at a campaign calendar that includes 18 GOP primaries or
caucuses between now and March 7, Bush and McCain mapped out
schedules that include extensive time in California, where by far
the largest share of delegates will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain _ who held a town hall meeting in this community 30 miles
north of Sacramento _ has the momentum after victories in Michigan
and Arizona on Tuesday. Insisting that the best GOP candidate is
the one who can appeal to swing voters, he urged Republicans to
embrace the Democrats and independents who have followed his call
for reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on in,'' McCain said in a message to fellow Republicans.
``Join us. Join us in this effort to be an inclusive party. Join us
in this effort to reach out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the forthcoming electoral terrain is not so friendly for
McCain. The sheer number of contest will put a premium on money and
organization _ where Bush holds a clear advantage. And it includes
primaries in several key states _ California and New York, most
noteably _ where Democratic and independent votes will not count
toward the allocation of Republican delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has a difficult row to hoe as he tries to move his
campaign into the next phase,'' said GOP strategist Rich Galen. ``I
don't believe that anyone believes he can win the nomination
getting only 30 percent of the Republican vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 700 delegates who will be selected over the next two
weeks, more than half will be in states that do not allow Democrats
to vote in the primary. According to a count by the Bush camp, the
governor enjoys a 2-to-1 edge among the GOP voters in each of the
states so far.
</P>
<P>
   The math explains why McCain has added a new line to his stump
speech, telling audiences that ``I am a proud, conservative,
pro-life Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain's 17-year-voting record in Congress is staunchly
conservative, he has run an insurgent campaign that has been
critical of the Republican establishment, prompting taunts from the
Bush camp as he tried to flash his Republican credentials.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Reaching Out to Republicans
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it amazing that someone running for the president on
the Republican side is now all of sudden about to start out
reaching out to Republicans,'' Bush said Wednesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush began his campaign last year boasting of his ability
to attract moderates and swing voters, the Texas governor and his
aides have complained bitterly about the role of non-Republicans in
bolstering McCain's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you count up the Republican vote, I like my chances,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, Virginia and North Dakota all hold contests next
Tuesday, followed by 12 more states on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The California primary is by far the most important and
delegate-rich contest. As in other states, the race has been marked
by what was once an overwhelming advantage for Bush being steadily
eroded by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans to spend about half of the next two weeks in the
state, though late Wednesday he canceled two public appearances and
will have his wife Cindy appear on his behalf at a fund raiser
scheduled for Thursday in the Bay Area. A campaign aide said he
would return to his home in Arizona for the afternoon after a
morning visit to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after wavering for the past week, announced Wednesday he
would participate in a debate with McCain on March 2 in Los
Angeles, and his aides said he plans to spend about five days in
the state before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (California) Republican leadership is squirming, because
they anointed George W. Bush,'' said Michael Genovese, political
science professor at Loyola Marymount University. ``They put all
their eggs in one basket, and now those eggs are cracking.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``they don't have a lot of faith in McCain, nor do they
trust him. He has a bit of an independent streak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the delegate front, California provides a uniquely
complicated set of rules. Its mother lode of 162 delegates
represents 16 percent of the number needed to win the nomination.
Yet while the state's open primary rules allow registered voters to
cast ballots for any candidates, only the votes of registered
Republicans will count toward the distribution of the GOP
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   That opens the very real possibility that with the help of
Democrats and independents, McCain could win the popular vote,
while Bush captures all the delegates by winning the majority of
the Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a collision course if McCain wins the popular vote,''
said John Herrington, former chair of the California Republican
Party. Herrington suggested the possibility of a ``tremendous
uproar, and a floor fight at the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Fleischman, executive director of the state Republican
Party, said there would be only one legal way for McCain supporters
to challenge the winner-take-all cache of delegates, if Bush is
favored by a majority of Republicans on March 7. McCain's campaign
would have to raise the issue at the Republican National
Convention, which is to be held in Philadelphia the first week of
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor of the convention would have to vote on it, or the
credentials committee would have to recommend it ... to change
their rules to allow for the seating of the alternative
delegates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Dissent Called Unlikely
</P>
<P>
   Because the winner-take-all rules of the California primary are
``written in stone'' for 2000 _ and won't change until 2004 _
Fleischman said such a move is ``politically unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he noted that ``all three (GOP candidates) have filed
affidavits that they have pledged to abide by the results of the
(current primary) process in California ... and have agreed to
forgo supporting any challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If any one of these candidates did decide to engage in a floor
fight,'' he said, ``it raises a question of character, and they
will have to answer the question'' as to why they've gone back on
their word. Bush retains a financial advantage, though it is not
nearly as large as it once was. After raising a record $70 million,
the Bush camp reported having $20 million on hand as of February 1.
That number is estimated by several accounts to have dwindled to
$12 million to $15 million. McCain has about $8 million at his
disposal, according to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement generated by the race has led to record turnouts,
something that neutral Republicans are delighted by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm pro baseball and this is a home run fight
between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman
of the Republican National Committee. ``My attendance is up, my
turnstiles are ticking. I couldn't be happier.''

<HEADLINE>
BUSH ASKS FOR VOTES FROM L.A.'S LATINOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Finding himself locked in an unexpected dogfight,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush turned his attention Wednesday to the
nation's biggest electoral prize _ California _ with an appeal to
Los Angeles' growing Latino population.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is fluent in Spanish but chose to speak English,
appeared at a town-hall forum with Latino voters organized by
Univision, the Spanish- language television network, held at Loyola
Marymount University in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latino vote is very important,'' Bush said to reporters
after the forum. ``Nationwide, it's important. There are some big
electoral states with strong Latino populations _ California,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not just the Latino population in California. The
Asian community is important, the African-American vote. And I'm
going to campaign as hard as I can with the same message throughout
California: Give me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was still reeling from twin defeats dealt him by Arizona
Sen. John McCain in Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday that left the
once-anointed front-runner scrambling to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won Michigan's open primary with overwhelming support
from Democratic and independent voters while Bush won among
hard-core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said Wednesday's forum was Bush's attempt to
turn McCain's strategy against him in California, since a majority
of Latinos are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking for cross-over votes,'' said Los Angeles-based
consultant Alan Hoffenblum, who favors McCain but is not directly
involved in the campaign. ``I can see why the Latino community
would be the first place to go because he identifies with them and
he's comfortable with them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's camp noted that the senator has also done well with
Latinos in his home state, receiving 55 percent of their vote in
his last election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support of the Latino community is very important to us in
California,'' said Peter DeMarco, a spokesman for the McCain
campaign in Southern California. ``We will aggressively seek their
support between now and not just March 7, but beyond that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   During the taped forum, Bush answered a variety of questions on
education, free trade and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to his record on education as Texas governor, saying
he expanded opportunities for top high school students to attend
public college. In response to an audience member's question, he
said he does not support amnesty for illegal immigrants as
advocated by leaders of the AFL-CIO, which is increasingly
organizing Latino workers.
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized his support for the North American Free Trade
Agreement, saying free trade with Mexico helps both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong Mexico, a vibrant Mexico, a healthy Mexico is
important to America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance drew a mixed reaction from audience members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing,'' said Gloria Curiel, a Santa
Monica attorney. ``I was very disappointed with his quick response
to the question of whether he'd be in favor of an amnesty (for
illegal immigrants), especially when our society is taking note
that immigrants have been good for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiel is a registered Democrat, but said prior to the forum she
was thinking of voting for Bush because she believes the Clinton
administration is too harsh on immigrants. But hearing the governor
speak changed her mind and has her leaning toward McCain _ at least
until she hears for herself what the senator has to say on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him (Bush) to not be willing to support an amnesty _ I
found that really more than disappointing. I found it
un-American,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Loyola student Loy Rackley, 22, of Westlake Village, said
the forum reinforced his support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He related well to the Latino voters,'' Rackley said. ``He
stuck by his guns on issues regarding education, taxes and border
patrols.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was plagued by a major technical glitch that prevented
the assembled national and local news media from fully
understanding what the governor was saying during the forum.
</P>
<P>
   The media was in a separate tent where video feeds were set up
in English and Spanish. Bush was initially expected to speak in
Spanish, with English translators, but when he switched to English,
his words were not carried to the English-language feed _ leaving
non-Spanish-speaking reporters puzzled and frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The press tent was also briefly invaded by the McCain forces.
Several McCain supporters who appeared to be in their 20s somehow
got into the press tent and began passing out fliers headlined
``Californians Watching, Waiting for Bush Waffles.''
</P>
<P>
   The fliers, which said they were paid for by McCain 2000,
criticized the governor for alleged flip-flopping on several
issues. The McCain supporters were quickly hustled out by Bush
campaign staffers, but not before passing out the fliers to most of
the assembled reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The forum will be broadcast on 10 Univision stations throughout
California, plus one in Reno, at 11 a.m. Saturday to an estimated
audience of 250,000. In Los Angeles, it can be seen on KMEX-TV
(Channel 34).

 REAL-LIFE MCCAIN WOOS WITH UNVARNISHED CHARM, STRAIGHT TALK  &HT;     By C.W. NEVIUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain may be running the only presidential
campaign that needs a rim shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I running for president?'' he asks the crowd. ``Well,
my wife, Cindy, says it is because I sustained several severe blows
to the head in prison camp.''
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks ...
</P>
<P>
   When McCain pulls the microphone out of its stand and starts
roaming the stage, he resembles nothing more than vintage Johnny
Carson. It isn't just his sibilant delivery _ McCain's slushy S's
have already won him the political impressionists' vote _ but the
classic timing and easy rapport with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sold the screenplay to my book,'' he tells supporters
waving his best-seller at rallies. ``Sam Donaldson asked me who was
going to play me in the movie. I said I wanted Tom Cruise, but my
kids want Danny DeVito.''
</P>
<P>
   Badda-bing, badda-boom.
</P>
<P>
   McCain razzes his pals, zings reporters and often makes himself
the butt of the joke. And when he hits the punch line and flashes
that winning smile, a roomful of potential voters are beaming back.
He may be the first candidate ever to attempt to josh his way into
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he's the sound bite of choice. Everyone complains
about cardboard candidates and sound-bite politics, and it seems to
be getting worse instead of better.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran reporter on the McCain bus recalls that during
Elizabeth Dole's short campaign, one of her staff members motioned
him over during an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Dole would like to say hello to you,'' the reporter was
told. ``But you need to understand that it will be off the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, reporters can't get rid of McCain. Step aboard his
famous bus, the ``Straight Talk Express'' _ ``We used to call it
the `B.S. Express,' '' McCain cracks _ and you'd better be ready to
banter.
</P>
<P>
   No one is immune from the hijinks, including his fellow POWs,
who turn out at his rallies and chuckle as their Navy buddy says,
``If there's an old, broken-down guy in the crowd, I was probably
in prison with them.'' The former fighter pilot isn't just a breath
of fresh air in American politics, he is a Corvette with the top
down. The hottest ticket in politics is a seat near the table in
the back of the Straight Talk, where network TV hotshots sit on the
floor for the honor of lobbing straight lines to the wittiest man
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that, well, when is enough is enough?
</P>
<P>
   When American voters look at McCain, you have to ask, do they
see a stand-up guy or a stand-up comic?
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to enough of his stump speeches, you get the
unmistakable impression that he feels this campaign is about the
man, not the message. McCain is counting on the force of his
personality to make him, the wisecracking guy you'd love to invite
to your house for a backyard barbecue, the man you want to send to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has his tried and true big issue items _ campaign
finance reform, ``no food stamp army'' _ he admits it can look as
if he is rushing through the meat-and-potatoes policy, sometimes
plowing through his own applause lines, to get back to the funny
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys (staffers) complain all the time that I step on my
lines,'' McCain says. You can see how it happened. McCain likes to
talk about how he used to come out and deliver ``a 20-minute speech
and people were falling asleep.'' Then he hit on the town hall
meeting idea, using his quick wit and people skills. The result has
been a sensation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, anything can happen out there, especially when
your candidate is willing to push the envelope. He'll do almost
anything if the mood strikes him. When he is given something at a
rally, from a sweatshirt to a garish NASCAR jacket with
checkered-flag sleeves, he puts it on immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The joke is that his staff is terrified someone will hand him a
pair of pants.
</P>
<P>
   His handlers finally had to tell him to quit asking the guy who
haunted his rallies in a land shark costume to come up onstage.
McCain did but only with the greatest of regret.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in New Hampshire, he recalls delightedly, he had
five different crusaders in animal outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invited them all up onstage,'' he says. ``I said anybody in
a costume who came to my rally got to speak for 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   That's McCain. He makes the call, off the cuff, and he sticks
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is great stuff. And sometimes _ like when a Florida
supporter said something in Spanish, and he replied,  &UR; ``Muchas &LR; 
 &UR; gracias.  &LR; Taco Bell. My Spanish is wonderful.'' _ it walks the line
of propriety.
</P>
<P>
   His comments recently calling his Vietnamese prison guards
``gooks'' is vintage. He not only said it, he went on and on, until
even some reporters on the bus were ready to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Strategist Mike Murphy sits nearby during his press conferences
to try to head off problems, but when McCain is on a roll, no force
of man or nature can stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he ``gasped'' when he heard what his candidate said,
political director John Weaver smiled and said, ``I am so far
beyond gasping at this point. That's why I sit in the front of the
bus.''
</P>
<P>
   And when McCain thinks he is right, he isn't about to back down,
either. Told that radio talk shows in California were having a
field day with his remarks, McCain was unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine with me ... ,'' he said. ``If I was on one of those talk
shows, the first thing I would ask any of those people is if they
have ever been to Vietnam. If one of my POW friends said, `John
McCain is bad, it's wrong,' it might give it some credence.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's handlers finally settled for saying that he would not
use the offensive word again, but they have to wonder when the next
brushfire will flare up.
</P>
<P>
   You know what they say: You can always tell an old fighter
pilot, but you can't tell him much. McCain got this far by shooting
from the hip, and he isn't going to change now.
</P>
<P>
   And until he got to South Carolina, it all seemed to be working.
Everyone _ kids, veterans, even Democrats _ was laughing along.
Every time he played one of his rallies and had the audience
roaring, he seemed sure that he had won over the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Gov. George W. Bush finally realized that McCain was a
rival to be taken seriously and hit McCain with attack ads. In a
typical gut decision, McCain took the high road, pulling his
negative advertising off the air. But the strategy didn't work;
McCain was solidly defeated and got knocked for throwing away his
chance at victory because he failed to respond. But he rallied with
wins in Michigan and his home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he's heading for California, where he knows now the hands-on
campaigning he did in New Hampshire and South Carolina isn't likely
to work. The question is: Can he convert that grinning, thumbs-up
appeal from high school gyms in New Hampshire and South Carolina to
the wide-open spaces of the Golden State?
</P>
<P>
   Things are changing for McCain, maybe faster than anyone
realizes. And his free-wheeling campaign, running on doughnuts,
diesel fuel and a plunge into the crowd, is going to have to change
too.
</P>
<P>
   He has resisted the idea of bringing in the Secret Service _ ``I
hate the thought of it,'' he says _ but even political novices are
taken aback by the way he faces flailing crowds with nothing more
than a grin and a single guard.
</P>
<P>
   When the Secret Service comes onboard, it will almost certainly
curtail the stage diving, and it may mean the end of the reporters
roundtable on the bus, too.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign began in a crowded race with a van and a couple of
writers. Now he travels with three buses, it is a two-man race, and
what would have been considered a respectable showing in South
Carolina three months ago is a bitter disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern that McCain has run himself ragged getting
ready for the really tough work ahead. He said last week he was
trying to get by on ``three to four'' hours of sleep a night, and
that's incredibly draining, especially at age 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every big mistake made in politics is made when you are
tired,'' McCain said on the bus. ``I keep telling these guys
(staffers) that. I am up all the time. But this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I have to be up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, he will bear watching. He may catch fire,
implode or _ who knows? _ become the next president. With McCain,
anything can happen, and he's as eager to see what's next as anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep waiting,'' he says, ``for the pie in the face.''

was a fairly daunting task. When you read some of Dr. King's
speeches in their entirety, I realized what a beautiful wordsmith
he was. It was important for me to really focus on the essence of
the content.'' _ Levar Burton, Best Spoken Word Album, ``The
Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the talent I was up against was extraordinary. To be
nominated in any category is an achievement. I'm glad I wasn't in
any categories (Santana) was in.'' _ Sting, winner Best Male Pop
Vocal Performance for ``Brand New Day.''

PRO-IMMIGRANT GROUPS ANNOUNCE DRIVE FOR BENEFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Buoyed by a booming economy and backing from Big
Labor, pro-immigrant groups on Wednesday announced a drive to
increase access to federal welfare benefits for legal immigrants
and expressed support for amnesty for an estimated 5 million
undocumented aliens, 2.5 million of whom live in California.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sharry, director of the Washington-based National
Immigration forum, called anti-immigrant sentiment ``an echo of the
recession of the 1990s'' and said that an array of advocate groups,
business and labor are primed to press Congress for changes in
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Sharry cited a Feb. 16 announcement by the executive council of
the AFL-CIO that backed immediate legalization for 500,000
Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and Haitians, many of whom have
claimed status as political refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO also called for increased penalties for employers
who knowingly hire illegal aliens and more workplace protections
for legal immigrants, including the right to join or organize labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Sharry also referred to recent testimony to Congress by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who credited immigrant workers,
especially professionals in high-tech industries, with playing a
vital role in the nation's ongoing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-immigrant groups want Congress to repeal laws that
impose a five-year waiting period before new legal immigrants may
receive food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, Medicaid and
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.
</P>
<P>
   They are further seeking the repeal of regulations, also enacted
by Congress in 1996, that bar illegal immigrants from using the
courts in deportation appeal cases, allow undocumented people to be
deported for crimes committed as long as 25 years ago and give the
Immigration and Natralization Service full jurisdiction over their
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law also allows the INS to hold illegal aliens without
bail for an undetermined period while awaiting hearings on their
status.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of undocumented people are currently being held at
sites nationwide, including an INS detention center adjacent to
Terminal Island Federal Prison in Los Angeles Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Muzaffar Chishti, an official of the Union of Neeedletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees, called for a blanket amnesty for
all illegal aliens, saying such a move would ``reflect the reality
of today's labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   Chishti, citing INS estimates, put the number of illegal aliens
nationwide at 5 million, with half that total residing in
California. He also estimated that 75 percent of the new hires in
Southern California's low-wage labor market, including Los Angeles'
garment industry, are undocumented aliens.
</P>
<P>
   His views were echoed by John Gay, an official with the American
Hotel and Motel Association, and by Lowell Sachs, a spokesman for
Palo Alto- based Sun Microsystems, who said there was a critical
shortage of workers at both the low and high ends of the job
market.
</P>
<P>
   They both urged an increase in nation's annual 700,000-person
limit on legal immigration.That limit has been in place since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The high end of the labor market is already getting attention
from Congress. A bill introduced Feb. 9 by Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, and backed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., would raise
the number of special work visas for high-tech professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Munoz, vice president of policy for the National Council
of La Raza, a Latino civil rights group, expressed confidence that
growing electoral power will translate into meaningful reform of
immigration laws. She noted that, since 1992, the number of
registered Latino voters has increased 40 percent nationwide and 64
percent in California.
</P>
<P>
   That shift was news to state Sen. Richard Mountjoy, R-Monrovia,
author of Prop. 187. His ballot measure, which sought to block
illegal aliens from access to public education and social services,
was approved by California voters by a 60-40 margin in November,
1994. Prop. 187's major provisions were thrown out by the courts
and the measure was finally shelved in a 1999 arbitration arranged
by Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is doing much better, but it still isn't right for
people to ilegally come to this coutry,'' Mountjoy said Wednesday.
``And illegal immigration only hurts those who come through
legally.''

ONE INMATE SHOT DEAD, EIGHT OTHERS WOUNDED AS GUARDS BREAK
UP  CALIFORNIA PRISON RIOT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BILL WALLACE, PAMELA J. PODGER and JAXON VAN DERBEKEN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRESCENT CITY, Del Norte County _ Guards fatally shot one inmate
and wounded eight others to break up a riot Wednesday in which more
than 200 Pelican Bay State Prison inmates were brawling and
stabbing each other with homemade knives, the state Department of
Corrections reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting involved convicts serving time in one of the higher
security housing units at a prison designed to incarcerate some of
the state's most incorrigible inmates. Most of the brawling
prisoners were black or Latino, and the confrontation appeared to
be racially motivated, corrections officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was black and Hispanic inmates fighting,'' said
Correctional Lt. Ben Grundy, a prison spokesman. ``We've had racial
incidents in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance was the most serious shooting incident at a
state prison since a new firearms policy was adopted last year that
strictly limits the circumstances under which correctional staff
members are allowed to open fire.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities could not say what caused the confrontation that
began about 9:30 a.m. in Facility B, a prison exercise yard that
serves four of the inmate housing areas at the 3,384-bed prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how this riot began or what precipitated the
incident,'' said Margot Bach, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Corrections Wednesday afternoon. ``The most seriously
wounded inmates have been transported to a local hospital. ... We
can confirm that one of the inmates was pronounced dead at the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prison officials said that at least one of the inmates who
was wounded by gunfire was in critical condition. No prison staff
members were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Bach said gun-rail guards fired 24 rounds from their prison
issue Ruger Mini-14 rifles while attempting to quell the
disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   She said guards fired after inmates ignored repeated orders to
get down and after they did not respond to canisters of pepper
spray and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   She said direct physical contact with inmates was not attempted
because of the number of people involved in the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gunfire and the firing of multiple canisters of tear
gas, it still took roughly 120 guards a half hour to bring the
situation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the riot, the prison remained locked down, with
inmates confined to their cells and increased security throughout
the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Bach said a special ``deadly force'' investigative team from the
Department of Corrections has been dispatched to the prison, which
is situated 10 miles south of the Oregon border outside Crescent
City in remote Del Norte County.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fama with the Prison Law Office, a San Rafael organization
that represents inmates, said the overcrowded conditions at Pelican
Bay ``probably had a lot to do with the riot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems between prisoners, including race-based problems, are
unfortunately a part of prison life. When you have too many
prisoners in a facility that wasn't designed for that amount, I
think it heightens the tensions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelican Bay was supposed to house 2,280 inmates when it opened
in 1989. It currently is overcrowded by more than 1,000 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Fama said the Department of Corrections must find ways to reduce
the prison population and find other ways of reducing violence
besides merely increasing the punishment of inmates.
</P>
<P>
   He said this is the first fatal shooting at Pelican Bay since
the 1995 ruling in a landmark federal civil rights case, Madrid vs.
Gomez, in which U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson found the
prison's use of force and medical care unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the use of lethal force under the
circumstances was justified. The second question is how CDC's
relatively new shooting-review process works,'' Fama said. ``The
federal judge found in 1995 that the shooting-review process was a
farce and a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the union that represents California prison
guards did not respond to a phone request for comment on the latest
strife at Pelican Bay.
</P>
<P>
   California's prisons reported the most inmate deaths from
gunfire of any correctional system in the nation in the late 1980s
and early '90s. More than 39 inmates have been killed in prison
shootings since 1988, and the large number of shootings led to a
change in prison firearms policies that was adopted as a state
regulation late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, guards are allowed to fire at inmates only
to defend a prison employee from death or great bodily injury, to
prevent an escape or to stop a riot or arson.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated development, the U.S. attorney's office in San
Francisco announced Wednesday that two Pelican Bay correctional
officers, Edward Michael Powers and Jose Ramon Garcia, had been
indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiring to violate prison
inmates' civil rights by arranging for them to be attacked by other
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The four-page indictment says that Powers and Garcia told
Pelican Bay prisoners that other inmates were child molesters, thus
making them targets for retaliatory attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On seven occasions, the two guards spread rumors about inmates
to encourage attacks on them, then put them together with other
inmates so that attacks could take place. In one instance, the
inmate who was attacked, Watson White, died from stab wounds he
received during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says that on another occasion, Garcia and Powers
watched from a safe vantage point while an inmate assaulted one of
the prisoners they had set up.

THEY ALL STOOD IN THE WIDE SHADOW OF SANTANA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By HEATHER WOOD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Santana may have swept the Grammys on camera, but
backstage _ before the cameras were even turned on _ polka kings,
Sesame Street's Elmo, Disney's Tarzan and Erykah Badu's head-wrap
reigned.
</P>
<P>
   The little-known artists at the 42nd annual Grammy Awards, such
as Reggae's Burning Spear and Salsa's Los Van Van, turned on the
charm when they had their chance to shine in the dim lights of the
backstage press room.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious fame of winners such as Tito Puente and
Emmylou Harris, Grammy winners grappled with comparisons to Carlos
Santana at nearly every turn. ``I'm just happy to be here,'' was
the most common declaration. ``We're happy for Carlos,'' everyone
said. ``He's so inspirational,'' the superficial ones said. Other
artists stood backstage with blank faces, as no one from the press
asked questions. We were waiting for Santana, you see. But by the
time Santana had won his fourth Grammy, it was obvious he wouldn't
be gracing us with his presence until the end _ he did, after all,
have four more awards to win.
</P>
<P>
   Ageless Latino artists resurfaced with renewed strength and
influence. Poncho Sanchez picked up his first Grammy after four
previous nominations. The Buena Vista Social Club, whose lead
singer turned 73 this month, showed how a life's work is worth more
than just a Grammy. Tito Puente not only wowed the Recording
Academy, but gave the best Jennifer Lopez impression since Cheri
Oteri's rear-enhanced spoof on ``Saturday Night Live.'' When the
five-time Grammy Award winner accepted the Best Traditional
Tropical Latin Performance award for ``Mambo Birdland,'' he met
with expected questions about the unstoppable Latin pop explosion
of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not Ricky Martin,'' he said as he did a little
dance. ``I'm not Marc Anthony,'' (he swayed his hips a little more
fiercely). ``And I'm sure not Jennifer Lopez.'' With that, Puente
turned around, slid his hands down his hips and showed off his
not-so-famous hind asset. And yes, Lopez show hers off in all its
glory.
</P>
<P>
   Even winners in the little-known categories recognized the
dominance of Latin sounds this year. Producer of the Year
(non-classical) Walter Afanasieff, who has produced albums for Marc
Anthony, Savage Garden, Barbara Streisand and Babyface, talked
about helping his Latin artists (including Anthony, Ricky Martin
and Jennifer Lopez) return to their roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me there's a little bit more emphasis on pop rather than
their roots, which are Latin. I'm hoping it will come back to the
Latin side, I'm hoping. You shouldn't lose your roots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roots certainly know the meaning of, well, roots. The
hip-hop group took home a Grammy for Rap Duo Performance with
Erykah Badu. ``We're bringing musicianship back,'' said bassist
Leonard Hubbard. ``We're about the only signed instrumental hip-hop
band in the world and that needs to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Badu added her own appreciation of musicians past. ``This head
wrap is a symbol for people who have their own set of rules. I feel
I'm one of the midwives aiding in the rebirth of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Country music darlings the Dixie Chicks know the meaning of
roots, Nashville-style. The singers said they drew inspiration from
this year's country-song-like events of their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two divorces and one marriage. It was very
inspirational,'' said lead singer Natalie Maines. ``I think we all
feel really lucky. This is our second album on a major label and to
have both of them acknowledged by the Grammys is unbelievable.''
The Chicks will kick off their first headlining tour in June.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Santana whose name was repeated over and over. Phil
Collins called him a dinosaur of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he's still around is something, isn't it? It's
been what, 30 years?'' Sting was thankful to be spared competition
with the Grammy favorite. ``I'm just glad I wasn't in any
categories he was in.'' And B.B. King honored Santana's spirit.
``First of all, he is a great musician. And there isn't anybody in
show business who works harder than him. He's a fantastic man and a
friend, too.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presidential primary race between George W.
Bush and John McCain has reopened all of the Republican Party's old
wounds and created a few new ones as the two contenders fight hand
to hand for the party's soul.
</P>
<P>
   The party establishment believed that this election would be
about transcending their differences, uniting on a candidate and
finding a new way to present the party as a national force.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it risks turning into open civil war over the legacy of
Ronald Reagan, the most successful Republican in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   There are many differences within the Republicans, as in most
parties. But the main divide is between the moralizing,
authoritarian wing, represented by the Christian right, and the
libertarian, free-enterprise wing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had sought to reconcile the two with his call for
``compassionate conservativism.'' In the South Carolina race he
relied heavily on the religious right; McCain's campaign staff have
attacked the Christian Coalition, calling some of them bigots.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made much of his appeal beyond the Republican Party to
Democrats and independents, which was a key aspect of winning the
Governorship of Texas. But it is McCain who has garnered the
independent vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bush camp is attacking McCain for precisely the
advantage which originally it had hoped to make its own.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accounted for just 47 percent of voters in
Michigan's Republican primary, the lowest since Georgia in 1984.
Then, Ronald Reagan was pulling conservative Democrats into his
camp and the turnout was regarded as a triumph; now, it is dividing
the party.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tension between those in the party who want it to be
a ``big tent,'' covering a broad coalition; and the proponents of
ideological purity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been in the former camp; now he finds himself
belaboring McCain for bringing new voters into the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain increasingly uses the phrase ``Reagan Democrats,''
appealing to the memory of the constituency which the president
pulled together in 1980 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Then, predominantly right-wing Democrats were attracted by
Reagan's support of a strong defense and tax cuts, a union of
populism and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   This was precisely the formula that Bush wanted to revive. But
so does McCain, with an appeal that seems to rest on his calls for
political reform and renewal _ a reminder of Reagan's call for
``morning in America.''
</P>
<P>
   `These things are part of an inclusive party, the party of
Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. That's what
this is really about,'' said McCain. ``So I view this campaign as
sort of a seminal event for our party and this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Reagan, the Republicans have failed to find a credible
national leader and the party has squabbled over his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, the Congressional leader who won control of the
House of Representatives for the party, self-destructed after the
1998 elections; his leadership ended up by making the party look
partisan, ideological and bitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican hierarchy hoped that Bush was a figure behind
whom the whole party could line up; instead, the party is dividing,
angrily and publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rift clearly is not healable if McCain is the party's
candidate,'' Iowa Republican Party chairman Kayne Robinson told the
Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that a Reaganesque campaign intended to win control
of Congress and the White House could end up by losing both.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another irony: These elections are also turning out
to be about the political legacy of another president _ Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He took the Democrats to the right in an attempt to win back the
Reagan Democrats and resolidify the party's national base. John
McCain, at least, recognizes this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but admire the job President Clinton did in
assembling a coalition _ moving to attract the great center in
political life,'' he has said. &QL;

Reagan's support of a strong defense and tax cuts, a union of

</P>
<P>
   This was precisely the formula that Bush wanted to revive. But
so does McCain, with an appeal that seems to rest on his calls for

``morning in America.''

   `These things are part of an inclusive party, the party of
Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. That's what
this is really about,'' said McCain. ``So I view this campaign as

</P>
<P>

national leader and the party has squabbled over his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, the Congressional leader who won control of the
House of Representatives for the party, self-destructed after the
1998 elections; his leadership ended up by making the party look
partisan, ideological and bitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican hierarchy hoped that Bush was a figure behind
whom the whole party could line up; instead, the party is dividing,
angrily and publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rift clearly is not healable if McCain is the party's
candidate,'' Iowa Republican Party chairman Kayne Robinson told the
Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that a Reaganesque campaign intended to win control
of Congress and the White House could end up by losing both.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another irony: These elections are also turning out
to be about the political legacy of another president _ Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He took the Democrats to the right in an attempt to win back the
Reagan Democrats and resolidify the party's national base. John
McCain, at least, recognizes this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but admire the job President Clinton did in
assembling a coalition _ moving to attract the great center in
political life,'' he has said. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presidential primary race between George W.
Bush and John McCain has reopened all of the Republican Party's old
wounds and created a few new ones as the two contenders fight hand
to hand for the party's soul.
</P>
<P>
   The party establishment believed that this election would be
about transcending their differences, uniting on a candidate and
finding a new way to present the party as a national force.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it risks turning into open civil war over the legacy of
Ronald Reagan, the most successful Republican in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   There are many differences within the Republicans, as in most
parties. But the main divide is between the moralizing,
authoritarian wing, represented by the Christian right, and the
libertarian, free-enterprise wing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had sought to reconcile the two with his call for
``compassionate conservativism.'' In the South Carolina race he
relied heavily on the religious right; McCain's campaign staff have
attacked the Christian Coalition, calling some of them bigots.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made much of his appeal beyond the Republican Party to
Democrats and independents, which was a key aspect of winning the
Governorship of Texas. But it is McCain who has garnered the
independent vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bush camp is attacking McCain for precisely the
advantage which originally it had hoped to make its own.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accounted for just 47 percent of voters in
Michigan's Republican primary, the lowest since Georgia in 1984.
Then, Ronald Reagan was pulling conservative Democrats into his
camp and the turnout was regarded as a triumph; now, it is dividing
the party.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tension between those in the party who want it to be
a ``big tent,'' covering a broad coalition; and the proponents of
ideological purity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been in the former camp; now he finds himself
belaboring McCain for bringing new voters into the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain increasingly uses the phrase ``Reagan Democrats,''
appealing to the memory of the constituency which the president
pulled together in 1980 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Then, predominantly right-wing Democrats were attracted by
Reagan's support of a strong defense and tax cuts, a union of
populism and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   This was precisely the formula that Bush wanted to revive. But
so does McCain, with an appeal that seems to rest on his calls for
political reform and renewal _ a reminder of Reagan's call for
``morning in America.''
</P>
<P>
   `These things are part of an inclusive party, the party of
Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. That's what
this is really about,'' said McCain. ``So I view this campaign as
sort of a seminal event for our party and this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Reagan, the Republicans have failed to find a credible
national leader and the party has squabbled over his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, the Congressional leader who won control of the

MCCAIN CLAIMS FRONT-RUNNER STATUS 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite a double loss and trailing in delegates,
George W. Bush declared Wednesday he will still win the Republican
presidential nomination through victories in state primary contests
that forbid crossover voting.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain beat Bush on Tuesday in his home state of Arizona
and in Michigan. His victory in the Northern industrial state came
largely on the strength of Democrats and independents who
participated in the open Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a U.S. senator, has now collected more delegates to the
nominating conventions than Bush and can claim the front-runner's
mantle. After Tuesday's wins, McCain has 96 delegates to Bush's 67.
A candidate must win 1,034 of the 2,066 delegates to capture the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that he is still a ``proud, conservative Reagan
Republican,'' McCain nonetheless wooed young, independent and
Democratic voters in Seattle and in Spokane to entice them to
participate in the state's Republican primary next Tuesday.
Virginia and North Dakota also hold open primaries that day, and
the three contests will award a total of 112 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain urged voters to join his ``Straight Talk Express,''
saying it was time for all Americans who want to reform their
government to ``come aboard this train.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving the station, my friends. It's remarkable, and I
can't tell you how happy I am,'' McCain told an overflow audience
at Gonzaga University in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to emphasize his own conservative Republican
credentials, McCain said his party had failed to reach out to
disaffected voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole campaign is about bringing you back into the
political system. ...We want them all ... because the party of
Abraham Lincoln is a party of inclusiveness,'' McCain said. ``I
think we aroused something in Michigan, and I hope we're arousing
it all across this country.''
</P>
<P>
   To sustain his campaign, McCain aides acknowledged that he will
have to attract more Republicans in the March 7 primaries,
especially in California, where Bush is still more popular among
mainstream GOP voters. McCain planned to spend Thursday campaigning
in California, and was scheduled to return to the state next week
to mount a final, intensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are now focusing on Super Tuesday,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued to focus on Republican loyalist voters and
campaigned in LanU$.Y,]kKk$

KINGS REACT TO McSORLEY ASSAULT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Boston defenseman Marty McSorley played 7
seasons with the Kings, but his old teammates are just as outraged
as the rest of the hockey world about Monday's vicious stick attack
on Vancouver's Donald Brashear.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille and Rob Blake were teammates of McSorley when the
Kings went to the Stanley Cup finals in 1993. Since the incident in
Vancouver that led to McSorley's suspension for the rest of the
season and playoffs, the two have been overwhelmed with so many
interview requests that they went to coach Andy Murray asking what
to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good guy and helped this organization a lot, but what
can you say about what he did,'' said Robitaille, a teammate of
McSorley's for six years. ``It was so over the line there is no way
to condone it. I know he feels bad, but that is not enough. It was
awful and it is bad for hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley's 23-game suspension, which was handed down by the NHL
Wednesday afternoon, is the longest in league history. He also
would miss the postseason although the Bruins are 12th in the
Eastern Conference, six points from the eighth and final playoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Several Kings said the incident was not the most brutal they had
witnessed, but Canadian television ran around-the-clock coverage of
the story.
</P>
<P>
   The country's national sport has come under scrutiny the past
few years, experiencing financial problems due in part to a weak
dollar. There also is concern players are reared to be violent and
have been passed by the Europeans as skilled players.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray said he hopes the McSorley incident will
not leave a lasting impression. In his own family, Murray's
15-year-old son Brady is recovering from a concussion at the family
home near Minneapolis. He hit the back of his head on the boards
after getting struck by a cross check in the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tough, physical game that is played with a lot of
emotion,'' Murray said. ``Those were virtues Marty McSorley brought
to this team. But players also have to show reason and there was
none of that in his case. There is absolutely no room for that in
our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's game at the Saddledome, several Calgary
officials said they wished the league had mandated a specific
number of games for the suspension to set the precedent for future
infractions. There also is a chance McSorley could face criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the league can police the matter on its own,'' Murray
said. ``They've done a good job in the past and they know how
severe this incident is. This is not a part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick whistles:The Kings flew after the game to Vancouver,
where they play Friday night against the Canucks. . . . With two
assists, Rob Blake tied Mark Hardy for the all-time Kings record
for a defenseman with 250. . . . Flames forward Valerei Bure
returned Tuesday from Los Angeles, where his wife, Candace, gave
birth to the couple's second child on Sunday. . . . Calgary's All-
Star defenseman Phil Housley did not play because of the flu.

   JERUSALEM _ The Pope's Middle East tour, billed by the Vatican
as a personal spiritual journey to Christianity's roots, has
already been soured by religious rivalries and bare-knuckle
politicking, even before his arrival in Egypt Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The chief source of the 79-year-old pontiff's troubles lies
further along the Mediterranean coast in the Holy Land, and
especially Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is not due to go to Israel and the Palestinian
Authority for nearly a month, the visit _ the first by a Pope since
1964 _ is already spawning almost daily controversies.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's environmentalists are up in arms. The rabbis are
uneasy. Ultra-Orthodox Jews are scandalized. And Ehud Olmert, the
mayor of Jerusalem, has already declared the trip to be marred by
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday it was the turn of the Israeli government to weigh in.
Last week its officials _ and also Mayor Olmert _ were annoyed by a
joint declaration issued by the Vatican and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat stating that Jerusalem should have a special
international status, and calling on Israel not to make any
unilateral decisions about its fate.
</P>
<P>
   As both the Jews and the Palestinians have competing claims to
create a capital in the city, this touched on an intensely raw
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to news reports, the government is pressuring the
Palestinians to cancel a planned official welcoming ceremony for
John Paul II on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City, which was
seized by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials are worried that the Palestinians will seize
on the occasion to flourish symbols of their sovereignty in an
attempt to cause international embarrassment to the occupying
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli environmental lobby has also taken up the cudgels,
on a separate front.
</P>
<P>
   The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel has
complained that dozens of bulldozers are ripping up a mountain
overlooking the Sea of Galilee by constructing a large parking lot,
and an amphitheatre in which the Pope will conduct mass for up to
100,000 pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Israel's Environment Ministry said it was satisfied
that the site would be restored after the trip _ but the row is
unlikely to end there.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have Israel's large ultra-Orthodox community remained
silent. Notices have begun to appear on the walls of their
neighborhoods bewailing the ``sorrow that comes with the enemy at
the gate of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   To this should be added wrangles over exactly where the Pope
should meet the chief rabbis; petitions demanding that he drop
plans for a service on the Jewish Sabbath; a land battle between
Muslims and Catholics over holy sites in Nazareth, and concerns
that the papal visit will unleash political unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the pontiff's expedition will be historic.
But this may be for the wrong reasons. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ The coronation of Carlos Santana went off as
expected at the 42nd annual Grammy Awards on Wednesday night at
Staples Center with the guitar legend taking home eight trophies _
seven more than he has won in his 32-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Mexican-born Santana lost only once _ to himself
in the pop collaboration category where he was nominated twice. (In
that division, he won, incidentally, for ``Smooth,'' which was also
honored as song of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Among Santana's honors: record of the year, album of the year
and best rock album. The eight trophies tied the record for most
Grammys in a single year. Michael Jackson won eight in 1983 for the
album ``Thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If to live is to dream and to die is to awaken, please don't
wake me up,'' an appreciative Santana said after one of his awards.
</P>
<P>
   Itaal Shur and Rob Thomas won song-of-the-year Grammys for
writing ``Smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, embattled Arista Records President Clive Davis, who
co-produced Santana's album, called the record ``the `Hotel
California' or `Rumours' of its time.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana himself called the evening ``a real honor, an outpouring
of love and grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the amount of attention given in the past year to
teen-age performers (or maybe because of it), the night very much
belonged to the Old Guard. In addition to Santana's sweep, Sting
won two major awards and that grand old dame of R&AMP;B, Whitney
Houston, beat out Macy Gray and Brandy for female R&AMP;B vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Youth was served in the new artist category in which 19-year-old
Christina Aguilera beat fellow teen favorite Britney Spears and
30-year-old Los Angeles native Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have a speech prepared,'' said Aguilera, who then
supported that statement with a rambling, bubbly speech that gave
thanks to ``my mom, my dad and my God.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Aguilera revealed plans for a Spanish-language album and
a Christmas record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually I want to get more writing credit,'' Aguilera said.
``I want to take pop a little deeper than it is now ... because it
shouldn't be all about image.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids also received their fair share of screen time during
the evening with performances by Spears and Kid Rock and two from
the Backstreet Boys. Kid Rock's rap-metal production number
included gyrating, scantily clad go-go dancers and midget rapper
Joe C, who was fond of grabbing his crotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell was that?'' host Rosie O'Donnell asked, ``and
why am I so afraid of it?'' In less frightening developments, Elton
John received the Grammy Legend Award and sang a snappy version of
``Philadelphia Freedom'' with the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If being a writer, a piano player, a singer and touring
together isn't enough in common, we've also both been taken to the
cleaners by our managers.'' Billy Joel said when when introducing
John.
</P>
<P>
   John appeared backstage for about five seconds before storming
off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big night,'' presenter Joel said, attempting to
explain John's fit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks were the big country music winners, taking
three awards, including best country album. The group, composed of
sisters Martie Erwin Seidel and Emily Erwin Robinson plus singer
Natalie Maines, invited actor Dennis Franz to the show. The ``NYPD
Blue'' actor played the title character in the video to the group's
hit song, ``Goodbye Earl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm crashing a dinner party,'' Franz said, adding
that he thought of O.J. Simpson while playing the nasty Earl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any man who gets murdered with black-eyed peas is a real man
in my book,'' Maines said.
</P>
<P>
   Shania Twain, a winner for best female country vocal, was a
no-show. Presenter Clint Black explained her absence: ``She's
getting her belly waxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Country legend George Jones won for male vocal performance.
</P>
<P>
   Sting won his 13th and 14th Grammys for pop album and male pop
vocal for his album and song ``Brand New Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very large mantelpiece,'' Sting quipped backstage,
adding, ``I'm just lucky I wasn't up against Carlos in any of my
categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Others needing a little more trophy space are Sheryl Crow, who
won her seventh Grammy for her version of ``Sweet Child O' Mine''
and the members of TLC, winning Grammy No.3 for R&AMP;B group
performance. Their song ``No Scrubs'' also was honored as best R&AMP;B
song.
</P>
<P>
   Music's Latin contingent didn't receive any awards on the
television portion of the program (outside of Santana, of course).
But Latin legends Tito Puente, Ruben Blades and Poncho Sanchez all
received trophies during pre-telecast ceremonies. An all-Latin
Grammys ceremony will be held in September, to be televised by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening's televised rap category, The Roots and Erykah
Badu won for group performance for their song ``You Got Me.'' White
rapper Eminem took the rap solo category.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime Achievement awards went to the singer and actor Harry
Belafonte, folk artist Woody Guthrie, bluesman John Lee Hooker,
male choral arranger and record producer Mitch Miller and country
legend Willie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   There were no awards in the jazz categories during the evening
ceremony. Diana Krall, whose ``When I Look in Your Eyes'' had been
nominated for album of the year, won for best jazz vocal.
Eighty-eight of the 98 categories had been awarded in little more
than 90 minutes in an afternoon event, but Santana did pay tribute
to a jazz legend in one of his acceptance speeches. ``Long live
John Coltrane!'' he said emphatically.

MCCAIN CLAIMS FRONT-RUNNER STATUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite a double loss and trailing in delegates,
George W. Bush declared Wednesday he will still win the Republican
presidential nomination through victories in state primary contests
that forbid crossover voting.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain beat Bush on Tuesday in his home state of Arizona
and in Michigan. His victory in the Northern industrial state came
largely on the strength of Democrats and independents who
participated in the open Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a U.S. senator, has now collected more delegates to the
nominating conventions than Bush and can claim the front-runner's
mantle. After Tuesday's wins, McCain has 96 delegates to Bush's 67.
A candidate must win 1,034 of the 2,066 delegates to capture the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that he is still a ``proud, conservative Reagan
Republican,'' McCain nonetheless wooed young, independent and
Democratic voters in Seattle and in Spokane to entice them to
participate in the state's Republican primary next Tuesday.
Virginia and North Dakota also hold open primaries that day, and
the three contests will award a total of 112 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain urged voters to join his ``Straight Talk Express,''
saying it was time for all Americans who want to reform their
government to ``come aboard this train.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving the station, my friends. It's remarkable, and I
can't tell you how happy I am,'' McCain told an overflow audience
at Gonzaga University in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to emphasize his own conservative Republican
credentials, McCain said his party had failed to reach out to
disaffected voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole campaign is about bringing you back into the
political system. ...We want them all ... because the party of
Abraham Lincoln is a party of inclusiveness,'' McCain said. ``I
think we aroused something in Michigan, and I hope we're arousing
it all across this country.''
</P>
<P>
   To sustain his campaign, McCain aides acknowledged that he will
have to attract more Republicans in the March 7 primaries,
especially in California, where Bush is still more popular among
mainstream GOP voters. McCain planned to spend Thursday campaigning
in California, and was scheduled to return to the state next week
to mount a final, intensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are now focusing on Super Tuesday,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued to focus on Republican loyalist voters and
campaigned in Latino sections of Los Angeles. California's primary
is open to all voters, but its 162 delegates are only awarded based
on the registered Republicans who participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make sure I consolidate my Republican base,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still appears to have an advantage over McCain in terms of
organization, financing and standing in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he won almost 70 percent of the Republican base vote
in Michigan. But slightly more than half the primary voters were
not Republicans, and they could return to their party in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon we're going to start having these primaries where
those who want to come into our primary to hijack it are going to
have a difficult decision to make. Do they want to stay and support
Al Gore or Bill Bradley?'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Texas GOP officials lamented what they called the
``infiltration'' of Democratic candidates into their March 14
primary and the possibility that hordes of Democrats would vote
Republican to ``disrupt'' the GOP candidate selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this new willingness on the part of Senator McCain to
join hands with those kinds of subversive efforts, who knows what
he might join forces with ... in the governor's home state,'' said
Texas Republican Chairwoman Susan Weddington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be prepared for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is counting on victories in closed primaries _
ones that award delegates based on votes cast only by registered
Republicans _ in Florida, New York and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also will do well with superdelegates _ members of Congress
and other elected officials who have rallied behind Bush as the
establishment favorite and get a say at the nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be some powerful states with big
delegations start to show up,'' Bush said. ``When we look back, we
are going to find my message is the winning message, is the reason
I'm going to be the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican consultant Charlie Black, an informal adviser to
Bush, said the Texas governor has been widening his margin over
McCain among traditional Republicans even in the contests that he
has lost. Bush won two-thirds of self-identified Republicans in
Michigan, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the traditional kind of Republican race you run, he's been
increasingly successful,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain political director John Weaver said their polls indicate
that Bush's relationship with Christian conservative leaders such
as Pat Robertson is beginning to turn off voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, he added, ``has tacked so hard to the right he's becoming
unelectable in November. ... I think a lot of Republicans _ not
just the Democrats and independents _ are beginning to figure that
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson is conducting his own telephone bank, urging
conservatives to vote for Bush and reminding them that McCain's
national chairman, former Sen. Warren Rudman, once said that
members of the Christian Coalition were ``vicious bigots.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, ``I think it's disgraceful. I think it's conduct
Governor Bush should stop. ... He wants to win in the worst way and
I want to win in the best way.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said almost two-thirds of the delegates chosen in the next
two weeks will come from closed primaries where Bush should excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's going to run out of time, but we're going to be
running up a majority of the delegates,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also plans to portray any state McCain decides to
skip as a state where McCain has lost because of his heavy national
news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows who he is, and everybody knows who I am. So I
view all the primaries as being contested,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's problem may be that McCain is cutting him off from
new voters in states such as New Hampshire and Michigan. Even in
South Carolina, where McCain lost, the Arizona senator won a
majority of the votes cast by independents, Democrats and
first-time Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a vice, and there's very little he can do to get out
of it,'' said University of Virginia political scientist Larry
Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said if Bush pushes too hard to defeat McCain by
consolidating the base Republican vote he risks making himself
unacceptable to the independents in the general election. But
Sabato said if Bush does not consolidate conservatives, he risks
losses in the states with closed primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush can run the marathon and probably win the nomination, but
they'll have a very changed candidate,'' Sabato said. ``He's got a
foe who is giving him no quarter and may drain him of blood for the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said he believes Bush will right himself once he has the
nomination secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A winner is a winner. Once Bush emerges as the winner, he'll
regain the aura of inevitability,'' Black said.

   NEW YORK _ Bill Gates, the founder and chairman of Microsoft,
met in secret last month with the judge overseeing settlement talks
with the U.S. government as part of an effort to resolve antitrust
charges against his company out of court, it was claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   News of the encounter came as the first phase of the legal
battle between Microsoft and the government at a drawn-out trial in
Washington nears a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   A final day of hearings took place on Tuesday and the trial
judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, should make his decision by the end
of April.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments on Tuesday, which focused on whether copyright law
might offer Microsoft some protection from antitrust regulations,
did not seem to go well for the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jackson raised eyebrows by comparing the company to the
Standard Oil monopoly of John Rockefeller of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rockefeller had fee simple (absolute) control over his
oil,'' Judge Jackson told the lawyers of Microsoft. Referring to
the charges against Microsoft _ that it has similar control over
the software market and the browser sector and that it has abused
that position _ he added: ``I don't really see a distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   In a court action in 1910, Standard Oil was broken up into 30
companies.
</P>
<P>
   That Judge Jackson will uphold the government and the charges
against Microsoft is now considered inevitable. A subsequent ruling
on action against Microsoft would not be expected from the judge
until about November. &QL;

cleaners by our managers.'' Billy Joel said when when introducing
John.
</P>
<P>
   John appeared backstage for about five seconds before storming
off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big night,'' presenter Joel said, attempting to
explain John's fit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks were the big country music winners, taking
three awards, including best country album. The group, composed of
sisters Martie Erwin Seidel and Emily Erwin Robinson plus singer
Natalie Maines, invited actor Dennis Franz to the show. The ``NYPD
Blue'' actor played the title character in the video to the group's
hit song, ``Goodbye Earl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm crashing a dinner party,'' Franz said, adding
that he thought of O.J. Simpson while playing the nasty Earl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any man who gets murdered with black-eyed peas is a real man
in my book,'' Maines said.
</P>
<P>
   Shania Twain, a winner for best female country vocal, was a
no-show. Presenter Clint Black explained her absence: ``She's
getting her belly waxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Country legend George Jones won for male vocal performance.
</P>
<P>
   Sting won his 13th and 14th Grammys for pop album and male pop
vocal for his album and song ``Brand New Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very large mantelpiece,'' Sting quipped backstage,
adding, ``I'm just lucky I wasn't up against Carlos in any of my
categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Others needing a little more trophy space are Sheryl Crow, who
won her seventh Grammy for her version of ``Sweet Child O' Mine''
and the members of TLC, winning Grammy No.3 for R&AMP;B group
performance. Their song ``No Scrubs'' also was honored as best R&AMP;B
song.
</P>
<P>
   Music's Latin contingent didn't receive any awards on the
television portion of the program (outside of Santana, of course).
But Latin legends Tito Puente, Ruben Blades and Poncho Sanchez all
received trophies during pre-telecast ceremonies. An all-Latin
Grammys ceremony will be held in September, to be televised by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening's televised rap category, The Roots and Erykah
Badu won for group performance for their song ``You Got Me.'' White
rapper Eminem took the rap solo category.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime Achievement awards went to the singer and actor Harry
Belafonte, folk artist Woody Guthrie, bluesman John Lee Hooker,
male choral arranger and record producer Mitch Miller and country
legend Willie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   There were no awards in the jazz categories during the evening
ceremony. Diana Krall, whose ``When I Look in Your Eyes'' had been
nominated for album of the year, won for best jazz vocal.
Eighty-eight of the 98 categories had been awarded in little more
than 90 minutes in an afternoon event, but Santana did pay tribute
to a jazz legend in one of his acceptance speeches. ``Long live
John Coltrane!'' he said emphatically.

   LONDON _ E-mails have piled additional stress on Britain's
managers, who say that having to cope with their overloaded
``in-boxes'' is damaging their work performance and home lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of more than 800 managers, published Thursday by the
Institute of Management (IM), keeping up with e-mails has entered
the top 10 stresses of modern working life for the first time.
Nearly a quarter of the managers interviewed said it has caused
them stress in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research conducted by the IM showed that, in 1993,
``new technology'' was not a stressful subject for managers in
Britain, who were more concerned about office politics and
incompetent senior management.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Hastings, head of policy at the IM, suggested that high
levels of stress now result from ``people having new technology
foisted on them by IT professionals with little training.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New technology may not be the panacea it once appeared,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The research report, ``Taking the Strain,'' says the top 10
sources of pressure cited by managers include constant
interruptions, lack of support, poor senior management and time
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Most managers experienced a range of stress symptoms, including
excessive tiredness (81 percent) and loss of temper (71 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The most popular ways of coping with stress are physical
exercise, talking to friends, drinking alcohol and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the managers surveyed said they now handled
increased responsibilities as a result of the loss of key people
during company restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that over four out of 10 managers are unhappy
with their workplace culture, 42 percent feel unable to cope with
their workloads and 40 percent struggle to meet goals and targets.
</P>
<P>
   Bullying is a further source of stress, with one in 10 saying
they have experienced bullying and intimidation on a regular
basis. &QL;

   LIBRARY-INTERNET (Detroit) _ In what some voters in the

Proponents of the measure outspent opponents 11 to 1, but opponents

non-Republican voters and yet again, a state electoral system
designed to favor the candidates favored by the Republican
establishment. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-CALIF (Los Angeles) _ All eyes are now on California.
McCain's hope is that if there are Republicans anywhere who
remember what it was like to put together the Reagan coalition,
it's California Republicans. MCCain may now have enough money to be
relatively comeptitive here. There is a possibility that he could

</P>
<P>
   DISCRIM-SECRETSERVICE _ Last year, after 16 years as an agent in
the insular fraternity of the Secret Service, Reginald G. Moore had
made it to one of the most prestigious posts in the agency as a
lead agent on President Clinton's protective detail, entrusted with
Clinton's life. Moore seemed to be poised to advance to the
agency's managerial ranks. But even though his written evaluation
for 1999 shows that he was among the most outstanding agents of his
rank, Moore, who is black, said he was denied a promotion and given
the task of training the white agent promoted ahead of him. When
Moore was reassigned to a counterfeiting squad in Dallas, he
decided to defy the Secret Service's traditional code of silence.

taxes at a higher rate. That is what some foundations do. Now, a
little-noticed provision in the Clinton 2001 budget proposal aims
to simplify the tax, to allow foundations to focus on making grants
without regard to the tax impact of those decisions, according to a
Treasury official. But some charity advocates say the provision
will also eliminate the only incentive that now exists to encourage
more giving. By Reed Abelson.

   PILLET-DESIGN (Paris) _ Christophe Pillet has a dream that

and ease of the sea and the sky reside in the forms of the
furniture, like the sounds within shells. Mr. Pillet, a 40-year-old
French designer, studied at the National School of Decorative Arts
in Nice, so that he could surf after classes. At his atelier
apartment in the 11th arrondisement in Paris, he displayed a
drawing of his dream, a design for an ideal home commissioned by
Interni, a Milanese magazine. He would like to think that it is
also part prediction: that objects like chairs and sofas could have
an ambience more important than their individual design. By William
L. Hamilton.

<P>
   GENERATION-NEST (Chicago) _ Melanie Laucks had furniture issues.
Her roommate was moving out of their two bedroom/two bath loft
downtown, and taking all her Ikea sortaswedishstuffen with her.
That left Ms. Laucks, a 23-year-old student in the theater program
at Columbia here, with rooms to fill. On the El she had seen an
advertisement for Crate and Barrel's new younger, hipper sister
store, CB2. So she went. There are 44 million shoppers like Melanie
Laucks out there: consumers age 20 to 34 with an estimated $125
billion of their own to burn, not to mention Mom and Dad's money.
Some 50 percent of them are married with children of their own and
46 percent own their own homes, according to a 1998 Yankelovich
Monitor survey. Crate and Barrel, Target, Williams-Sonoma and
upstarts like Furniture.com are waking up to these tantalizing
statistics and targeting Generation Nest. By Rick Marin.

   HOUSE-MOVING (Undated) _ A web site, Old-houses.com, recently

Development Agency is offering free, to a qualified individual who

N.Y.'' At the Web site Buildingmovers.com is another enticing
offer: ``Small Hotel $1 Must Be Moved.'' And this message: ``Free
House, You move it, you own it.'' Then there are logistical queries
like ``How do you transport a 39-foot geodesic dome?'' or ``Can a
log cabin be airlifted?'' Once an oddity, house moving is gaining
appeal. By Lynn Ermann.

Institute of Management (IM), keeping up with e-mails has entered
the top 10 stresses of modern working life for the first time.
Nearly a quarter of the managers interviewed said it has caused
them stress in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research conducted by the IM showed that, in 1993,
``new technology'' was not a stressful subject for managers in
Britain, who were more concerned about office politics and
incompetent senior management.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Hastings, head of policy at the IM, suggested that high
levels of stress now result from ``people having new technology
foisted on them by IT professionals with little training.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New technology may not be the panacea it once appeared,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The research report, ``Taking the Strain,'' says the top 10
sources of pressure cited by managers include constant
interruptions, lack of support, poor senior management and time
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Most managers experienced a range of stress symptoms, including
excessive tiredness (81 percent) and loss of temper (71 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The most popular ways of coping with stress are physical
exercise, talking to friends, drinking alcohol and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the managers surveyed said they now handled
increased responsibilities as a result of the loss of key people
during company restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that over four out of 10 managers are unhappy
with their workplace culture, 42 percent feel unable to cope with
their workloads and 40 percent struggle to meet goals and targets.
</P>
<P>
   Bullying is a further source of stress, with one in 10 saying
they have experienced bullying and intimidation on a regular
basis. &QL;

   SYDNEY _ Qantas, the Australian airline which prides itself on
its squeaky-clean image, is under investigation after 68 deer were
found suffocated in cramped cages aboard ones of its planes.
</P>
<P>
   The deer were part of a herd of 114 animals that were being
transported from the eastern city of Brisbane to the Thai capital,
Bangkok. They were found dead during the Brisbane to Sydney leg of
the trip on Tuesday last week.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, which has never had a fatal accident, said
Wednesday that it had suspended all shipments of live deer pending
an inquiry into the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The deer were Rusas, a species introduced to Australia from Asia
more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   They were found squeezed into crowded cages and left
unmonitored. The surviving deer were seized and are being cared for
by the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Qantas is one of several parties that are being investigated
over the deaths. Raeleen Redford, the society's deputy chief
executive, said: ``They were subjected to high levels of stress
caused by overcrowding, and the results from the postmortem confirm
that the cause of death was trauma and suffocation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Society said it was appalled that anyone could consider
exporting such fragile animals in such a manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a very delicate, flimsy and flighty animal,'' Redford
said. ``Look at them and you basically see Bambi.''
</P>
<P>
   A Qantas spokesman said that the airline was assisting with the
inquiry. The airline regularly carries livestock in the pressurized
freight holds of Boeing 747 and 767 aircraft. It averages about
6,000 shipments a year, including domestic pets. &QL;

LAKERS ARE 9-0 ON THIS WIN STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ A bit of history was on the Los Angeles Lakers'
schedule Wednesday night. But for them to do what no past Lakers
team had ever done, they needed a low-scoring role player to reach
into his own past and retrieve an artifact from his early career.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Robert Horry's 3-point shot?
</P>
<P>
   Horry does and he relishes the rare opportunity to show he's
still got it. That chance came early Wednesday night and Horry
capitalized. He hit four 3-pointers in five tries and tallied a
season-high 20 points in the Lakers' 116-98 rout of the Cleveland
Cavaliers at Gund Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was a performance reminiscent of Horry's earlier days with
the Houston Rockets. And it helped the Lakers achieve what no team
in franchise history had _ a perfect 6-0 road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of Rob. Rob stepped up tonight,'' said Shaquille
O'Neal, whose early foul trouble opened the door for Horry. ``We
have a lot of weapons on this team. On any given night, any one of
those players that comes off the bench can do that. If we had
somebody come off the bench and do that every night, we'd be a real
dangerous team.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, they're a 43-11 team, once again tied with the
Portland Trail Blazers for the league's best record, and have a
nine-game winning streak to go with earlier streaks of 16 and
seven.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the fact they just swept a six-game trip
through the East, something even the Showtime Lakers never did. The
previous best for a six-game trip was a 5-1 mark by the 1967-68
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those mileage points,'' coach Phil Jackson said,
``little checkpoints in a long season in which the team can look
back and be proud of and say we had to put it down, we had to be
real concentrated about our energy and about our direction. We had
to play with purpose and we did something that was very special.
And I think that's important for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, who scored a team-high 21 points, said of the 6-0
mark: ``It meant a lot, considering all the great Laker teams that
have never done it. It's a good thing for us to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked easier than it was and took some extraordinary efforts
from the supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bryant also got seven rebounds and six assists, he looked
out of sorts on offense, hitting 9 of 22 shots. Glen Rice needed a
late charge in garbage time to get to 14 points (on 4-of-11
shooting). And O'Neal, who played just 10 minutes in a foul-marred
first half, finished with just 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the slack were Horry (7 for 8 from the field), Ron
Harper (12 points) and A.C. Green (eight points). The bench
accounted for 42 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds as the Lakers
shot 51.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a game,'' Jackson said. ``It was just a very interesting
game tonight, the way it turned out.... Robert Horry came out on
fire stayed on fire for both halves, gave us the opportunity the
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry, averaging 4.9 points, hadn't scored more than 12 in a
game this season. But he anchored the second unit early on and his
hot shooting led the Lakers to an 13-point lead in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, even though I haven't been taking a lot of shots, my
shots are feeling pretty good,'' Horry said. ``Sometimes you just
have to take the shots when you have them. The offense is really a
good offense for me when you find an opportunity to shoot the
ball.... A lot of times we'll be hesitant to take the shots, so now
I'm just trying to be not as hesitant.''
</P>
<P>
   And the last time he scored 20? ``Shoot, it's been a long
time,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Horry finished as strong as he started. He and O'Neal scored all
the points in a 10-2 run to start the fourth period and they
combined for 21 points in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers responded by imploding, as leading scorer Shawn
Kemp (23 points) and Mark Bryant both earned ejections down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers earned a trip home after 10 days on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long trip,'' O'Neal said. ``I think I forgot where I
live at in L.A., we've been on the road so long.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Mario's brow is bleeding again, since he keeps
knocking it against the cold cement wall.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro, whose arms are so atrophied that he cannot raise them to
swat away the flies clustering on his face, lies limp on a soiled
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto's hands are bound as he is pulled down the corridor on a
leash, stumbling through puddles of urine.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Juanita is lashed by her ankle to the window frame
until it is time to be untied, stripped, dragged across a tile
floor, then hosed down with cold water.
</P>
<P>
   These are not their real names, but the daily degradations of
life in a Mexican asylum are all too real for 7,000 long-stay
mental patients across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents are all documented. At the conclusion of a
three-year investigation into human-rights abuses in Mexico's
government mental institutions, Dr. Robert Okin, chief of
psychiatry at San Francisco General Hospital and co-author of a
newly released report, rated conditions ``among the worst we have
seen anyplace in the world. Absolutely shocking...subhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   An American team from Mental Disability Rights International, a
nongovernment organization working closely with Mexican rights
activists, inspected facilities with no forewarning.
</P>
<P>
   Although they witnessed some improvements since 1996, their
report charges that the Mexican government fails to enforce its own
mental health laws and that serious and pervasive violations of
international human-rights standards continue to be widespread,
particularly outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Patients can be placed inside a Mexican institution against
their will with little hope of ever leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Rosenthal, MDRI' s executive director, has toured a dozen
different countries since he founded this independent advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer says he was troubled by high-profile campaigns to
free a few political prisoners locked up in primitive asylums; he
wondered why no one else was outraged about the abysmal conditions
endured by the mental patients.
</P>
<P>
   Next month he will present the Mexico report in Washington to
the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, part of the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   By drawing international attention to such dehumanizing
conditions, his independent advocacy group hopes to hasten reform.
The Mexican Health Ministry declined to comment on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by recent press coverage, Health Secretary Antonio
Gonzalez has inspected three of the most notorious psychiatric
hospitals, and admitted that he saw a ``lot of aspects to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they are labelled ``loco,'' Mexican mental patients without
private funds are isolated in public institutions referred to as
granjas, or funny farms.
</P>
<P>
   Detention can be arbitrary. Over two-thirds of the patients
actually are suffering from epilepsy or mental retardation, yet are
locked up in wards alongside the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned by families who are unable to care for them, the
majority get institutionalized for life simply because they have
nowhere else to go. Without stimulation or physical exercise, most
rapidly deteriorate inside the bare walls of the asylums and come
to resemble the other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Understaffed institutions in remote areas can be dangerous, the
report concluded.

<P>
   At Ocaranza, in Hidalgo state, taking medication was judged a
health risk: to down pills with water out of a common bucket,
sharing the same cup between 50 patients, was bound to spread
infection.
</P>
<P>
   There is no access to soap before eating, despite the routine
filth of the hospital surroundings. Side-effects from psychotropic
medication often go untreated, and basic attention to open wounds
or bed sores is lacking.

<P>
   Physical restraint is frequently misused to prevent patients

   Even young children are trussed up in straight jackets or tied

</P>
<P>
   There are few activity programs or skills training to break the
monotony, no music, no artwork. At a facility near Guadalajara,
children are frequently left to rock or stroke themselves for
comfort.

   At Sayago Hospital, some 40 mental patients no longer can walk
because of prolonged inactivity, and now are confined to
wheelchairs. Bones are brittle and prone to fracture. There were
several deaths reported there after bronchitis broke out in the

<P>
   The MDRI team noted an acute shortage of blankets, towels, and
clothing, and even in cold weather, inmates walk around barely
clad. Many patients appear malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   The rights group urged that Mexico transform long-stay hospitals
into treatment centers. Launching a system of community residence
programs and halfway houses could enable many patients to lead
functional lives outside the granjas.
</P>
<P>
   The group warned that, unless the community provides support,
emptying institutions abruptly could create a mentally unstable
underclass among the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   To date, there are no government-funded group homes for mental
patients in all of Mexico. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Mario's brow is bleeding again, since he keeps
knocking it against the cold cement wall.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro, whose arms are so atrophied that he cannot raise them to
swat away the flies clustering on his face, lies limp on a soiled
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto's hands are bound as he is pulled down the corridor on a
leash, stumbling through puddles of urine.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Juanita is lashed by her ankle to the window frame
until it is time to be untied, stripped, dragged across a tile
floor, then hosed down with cold water.
</P>
<P>
   These are not their real names, but the daily degradations of
life in a Mexican asylum are all too real for 7,000 long-stay
mental patients across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents are all documented. At the conclusion of a
three-year investigation into human-rights abuses in Mexico's
government mental institutions, Dr. Robert Okin, chief of
psychiatry at San Francisco General Hospital and co-author of a
newly released report, rated conditions ``among the worst we have
seen anyplace in the world. Absolutely shocking...subhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   An American team from Mental Disability Rights International, a
nongovernment organization working closely with Mexican rights
activists, inspected facilities with no forewarning.
</P>
<P>
   Although they witnessed some improvements since 1996, their
report charges that the Mexican government fails to enforce its own
mental health laws and that serious and pervasive violations of
international human-rights standards continue to be widespread,
particularly outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Patients can be placed inside a Mexican institution against
their will with little hope of ever leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Rosenthal, MDRI' s executive director, has toured a dozen
different countries since he founded this independent advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer says he was troubled by high-profile campaigns to
free a few political prisoners locked up in primitive asylums; he
wondered why no one else was outraged about the abysmal conditions
endured by the mental patients.
</P>
<P>
   Next month he will present the Mexico report in Washington to
the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, part of the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   By drawing international attention to such dehumanizing
conditions, his independent advocacy group hopes to hasten reform.
The Mexican Health Ministry declined to comment on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by recent press coverage, Health Secretary Antonio
Gonzalez has inspected three of the most notorious psychiatric
hospitals, and admitted that he saw a ``lot of aspects to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they are labelled ``loco,'' Mexican mental patients without
private funds are isolated in public institutions referred to as
granjas, or funny farms.
</P>
<P>
   Detention can be arbitrary. Over two-thirds of the patients
actually are suffering from epilepsy or mental retardation, yet are
locked up in wards alongside the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned by families who are unable to care for them, the
majority get institutionalized for life simply because they have
nowhere else to go. Without stimulation or physical exercise, most
rapidly deteriorate inside the bare walls of the asylums and come
to resemble the other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Understaffed institutions in remote areas can be dangerous, the
report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   At Ocaranza, in Hidalgo state, taking medication was judged a
health risk: to down pills with water out of a common bucket,
sharing the same cup between 50 patients, was bound to spread
infection.
</P>
<P>
   There is no access to soap before eating, despite the routine
filth of the hospital surroundings. Side-effects from psychotropic
medication often go untreated, and basic attention to open wounds
or bed sores is lacking.
</P>

RANGERS JUST HISTORY NOW FOR GONZALEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Juan Gonzalez is busy.
</P>
<P>
   There are new teammates to meet, there's a mentor relationship
to start with young Juan Encarnacion, there are line drives to be
scattered to and beyond the fence of the practice field, there are
conditioning sprints to be run.
</P>
<P>
   He's much too busy for a stroll down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want to reminisce about the good times he had with
the Rangers, the Most Valuable Player awards, the three American
League West titles, the home run and runs-batted in- crowns, the
friends he made.
</P>
<P>
   He refuses to dwell on the bad times, when he was accused of
being a malingerer because he wouldn't play while hurt, the obscene
gesture at the official scorer who ruled an error on a wicked
liner, the charge that he cared more about his statistics than the
team.
</P>
<P>
   There's no time to lament his departure from Texas, it seems, or
to blast his former team for sending him packing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say thank you to the Rangers organization for giving
me the opportunity by signing me to play professional baseball,''
Gonzalez said here yesterday. ``Thank you to the fans there. I had
some great memories in Texas. Two MVPs, All-Star Game, division
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now it's history. Now it's a new team, a new family,
a new city. It's a new time.''
</P>
<P>
   This new time sees Gonzalez with the familiar No. 19 on his back
and the familiar, powerful stroke. But it also sees him in a
strange uniform and in a strange place.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling, relaxed Gonzalez pulled on a Detroit Tigers uniform
for the first time yesterday, and went through his first
spring-training workout in a city other than Port Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   If being in a new uniform, in a new town, with a new team, seems
strange to Gonzalez, he disguises it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers hope the baseball is the same. They packaged six
players, including some of their best young talent, to the Rangers
in exchange for Gonzalez, reliever Danny Patterson and backup
catcher Gregg Zaun because Gonzalez averaged .314 with 43 home runs
and 140 RBI the past four seasons, which included two American
League MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up some good young players, but that's what they are:
good young players,'' Tigers general manager Randy Smith said. ``We
got an established guy that, barring injuries, should be in
Cooperstown when he's done. I had zero hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers made the trade because they were 12th in the 14-team
league with 747 runs scored last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we were missing last year, that big-name guy, that
go-to guy in the middle of our lineup,'' said third baseman Dean
Palmer, Gonzalez's Rangers teammate for eight seasons. ``When the
game's tight and you need a run, that's the guy you want up at the
plate. It's good. I just hope we can keep him for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the $140 million challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin traded Gonzalez because the
right fielder can be a free agent at the end of the season and the
club didn't want to pay the $15 million a year or so he would
command as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock when the Rangers traded me, but I understand,''
Gonzalez said. ``They didn't have the budget to pay me for the next
seven or eight years, so I understand perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers are moving into a new, revenue-producing stadium this
season, so they can afford to keep him. They reportedly offered
$140 million over eight years, a figure that Smith refuses to
confirm or deny.
</P>
<P>
   But to Smith, the size of the contract isn't as important as the
necessity of getting Gonzalez signed to a long-term contract.
Otherwise, the Tigers paid a steep price to rent a player who can
make the team better but by himself isn't likely to carry it past
the Cleveland Indians in the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make the deal with more than 2000 in mind,'' Smith said.
``You don't make the deal unless you think you can figure out a way
to make him stay. We're prepared to pay what those type of players
get on the open market. We want to create an environment where he's
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez isn't ready to commit to the Tigers beyond this season,
not necessarily because he thinks there might be greater riches on
the free agent market but because he wants to see if he'll like
living and playing in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``It's a big adjustment. It's too
early. I need more time.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need more time, though, to get comfortable with his
new uniform and his new team. That's because despite what has
changed, his role remains the same: drive in the key runs that win
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows this is a better team this year,'' Gonzalez
said. ``I promise you this ballclub will win a lot more games this
year.''

McCAIN COULD WIN IN CALIFORNIA, BUT STILL LOSE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On March 7, both Sen. John McCain and Gov. George
Bush could claim victory in California _ one in the popular vote
``beauty contest,'' the other in the all-important delegate count.
</P>
<P>
   The way California's primary system is set up, a candidate can
be a winner and a loser at the same time. McCain could win
California the same way he won the Michigan primary _ with swing
votes from Democrats and independents _ and still lose the state.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the political parties in California, unlike those
in Michigan, only count votes cast by party members in awarding
delegates to the national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have a beauty contest in the overall vote,'' said
Marshall Riley, an active local Republican and member of the
executive committee of the California Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   On election night, election officials will announce two tallies
_ who won the party delegate selection vote and who won the popular
vote.
</P>
<P>
   So, McCain could win the overall vote, thanks to cross-over
votes from Democrats and independents, but still lose if most
California Republicans vote for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   California has a winner-take-all primary. The candidate who gets
the Republican votes gets all the state's bounty of 162 delegates _
15 percent of the total needed to secure the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Republicans) will have to explain how someone can get a
plurality of popular votes in an election and get zero delegates,
at least from a public relations point of view,'' Riley said. ``I'd
have a hard time explaining it to a seventh- and eighth-grade civic
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican and a recently
converted McCain supporter, said he believes the parties should use
the results of the overall open primary rather than just counting
votes by their own party members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties can certainly write their own rules, but not
counting the votes of everyone who votes for their candidates is
not positive for the political process,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pushing for a long time for them to use the results
of the blanket primary. I'm suggesting we're not sending the right
message if we're not welcoming the votes of Democrats and
independent voters. The parties have to go back to them for their
votes in November.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain strategy has been to court independents and Democrats
to vote for him. The senator is trying to show that he has
cross-party support and will be able to beat the Democratic nominee
in November.
</P>
<P>
   But to party leaders, the name of the game in this contest is
securing delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign sees nothing wrong with the system in place
now. ``We don't make the rules. We play by them,'' said Margita
Thompson, California communications coordinator for the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   California voters approved Proposition 198 in March 1996,
creating an open primary system. It allows Californians to vote for
any candidate they want in a primary, regardless of either the
voter or the candidate's party affiliation. Before the change,
independent voters were shut out of primary voting.
</P>
<P>
   But in June 1999, the state Legislature muted the effect of the
open primary, ordering Jones to prepare two separate tallies of the
primary election's votes.
</P>
<P>
   When voters cast their ballots, they will be coded so election
officials can pull non-Republican and non-Democratic voters out of
their respective primary tallies. If a Republican votes for Vice
President Al Gore, that vote will not be counted by Democratic
Party officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political science professor at Claremont
Graduate School, said if McCain wins in California, but loses to
Bush among Republicans, there will be discord about who should get
the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect there would be an awfully large fight within the
Republican Party,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic and Republican officials have been fighting
Proposition198 since it passed, joining to sue to get it
overturned. The U.S. Supreme Court is slated to make a decision on
the constitutionality of the initiative this summer, said Bob
Mulholland of the California Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   While proponents of an open primary say having a separate tally
excludes independent voters, Mulholland said the national party
should be able to decide how it wants its delegates chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes from independents will be counted. But clearly if
they were concerned about voting for delegates, they could be
registered as Democrats. National party rules are a lot like
marriage _ you have to be committed,'' Mulholland said. ``Delegates
are the only thing that matters in California.''

LOYOLA MARYMOUNT CEREMONY CLOSES CHAPTER OF TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday, Loyola Marymount retired the jerseys of the late Hank
Gathers (No. 44) and his good friend Bo Kimble (No. 30).
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Loyola Marymount coach Charles Bradley announced his
resignation, effective at the end of a regular season that seems
destined to end without a single victory against an NCAA Division I
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Two events, linked but yet distant. As distant and as eerie and
as goose-bump-inducing as the events of what happened a decade ago.
In March 1990, Gathers, Kimble and Loyola Marymount provided
college basketball with a storyline that was both tragic and
uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   On March 4, 1990, the 23-year-old Gathers collapsed and died of
a heart ailment during a West Coast Conference tournament game at
Loyola Marymount. The WCC canceled the rest of the tournament.
Loyola Marymount, with a 23-5 record, went into the NCAA Tournament
without a player who a year earlier had become just the second
player to lead Division I in scoring and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble, Gathers' best friend from their Philadelphia days, had
led the Lions in scoring during the 1989-90 season, succeeding his
teammate as the scoring champion. With coach Paul Westhead as
college basketball's resident Mad Scientist, Loyola Marymount's
frenetic style of play produced a Division I record 122.4 points
per game that season.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 NCAA Tournament, Loyola Marymount inspired the
nation. In a first-round victory against New Mexico State, Kimble
honored his fallen comrade by shooting his first free throw
left-handed in a tribute to the left-handed Gathers. Kimble made
the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, I really didn't care if the ball went over the
backboard, to be quite honest,'' Kimble said. ``I was paying
tribute to Hank.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, the Lions dismantled defending champion
Michigan, 149-115, setting a tournament record for points scored.
Loyola Marymount's run ended when eventual champion UNLV defeated
Marymount, 131-101.
</P>
<P>
   All of those memories came flooding back Saturday at Gersten
Pavilion. The feel-good NCAA run of 1990 was recalled, but so was
the pain of a mother (Lucille Gathers) losing her son and a son
(Aaron Crump, now 16) losing his father. And the acrimony of a $33
million wrongful death lawsuit (eventually dropped) brought by
Gathers' family against the school, Westhead and team doctors.
</P>
<P>
   More reality hit Monday when Bradley resigned after just three
seasons. The Lions are 2-23 this season, with games remaining at
St. Mary's tonight and San Diego on Saturday, plus the WCC
tournament starting March 4. In nine seasons since 1990, Loyola
Marymount has not returned to the NCAA Tournament, has had three
winning seasons and a combined record of 91-159.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time passes,'' WCC commissioner Michael Gilleran said. ``Back
in 1990, it was both tragic and inspiring. There were so many
conflicting feelings. It was a tough time for us in the conference
office, but the people at the school went through even more.''
\Nrevhed:SPOTLIGHT
Huskies seek answers to poor play, not jokes
Before Connecticut's success of recent years, including last
season's national championship, the statewide joke was that you
couldn't spell Connecticut without N-I-T. That line is making the
rounds again.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unlikely that the Huskies will be left out of the
64-team NCAA field (the last defending champion to face that
embarrassment was Kansas in 1989), UConn is looking more and more
like UCan't. Monday night at Madison Square Garden, Connecticut
looked like a very average team in a 79-64 loss to St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing like an NCAA Tournament team right now,''
junior point guard Khalid El-Amin said of the Huskies (18-8, 7-6 in
the Big East Conference).
</P>
<P>
   Of the past 10 national champions, none has been seeded lower
than No. 4. It's unlikely that the Huskies will maintain that
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's problems are multiple. The Huskies are missing
go-to scorer Richard Hamilton and defensive stopper Ricky Moore
from last season. El-Amin and backcourt mate Albert Mouring have
struggled to bear the outside scoring burden (they were outscored
42-2 by the St. John's backcourt).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our backcourt play has been deteriorating over the last three
or four weeks,'' Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said. ``But there
are a multitude of reasons. This team has some inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has nonconference losses to Iowa and Michigan State.
Also, the Huskies have been swept in Big East play by Notre Dame
and St. John's, in addition to losing at Syracuse and at home to
Miami (Fla.).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created this situation, nobody else has,'' Calhoun said.
``Right now, we are in a very difficult time. We want to get back
into the NCAA Tournament. Clearly, we have some work ahead of us.
\RSt. John's is\S trying to get a high seed in the tournament.
We're trying to make the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get things together, our season is going to have a
very premature ending.''
\Nrevhed:FAST BREAKS \Nsubheds:NCAA Tournament update Mountain West
Conference commissioner Craig Thompson, chairman of the NCAA men's
tournament committee, discussed some of this year's issues during a
media teleconference yesterday. Thompson said that games in the
Western Athletic and Mountain West conference tournaments could
carry a bit more weight with the committee. Neither conference has
an automatic bid to this year's tournament. However, Thompson
believes that conference tournament games could mean more than
regular-season games when calculating at-large bids.
</P>
<P>
   This year's committee membership has been increased from nine to
10 and four of those members are new _ North Carolina Charlotte
athletic director Judy Rose, Iowa State athletic director Gene
Smith, North Carolina State athletic director Les Robinson and
Arizona athletic director Jim Livengood.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the Ratings Percentage Index ``is probably the
most overrated tool that we use. People on the committee don't base
their selections solely on the RPI.''
\Nsubheds:Devilish in the desert Rob Evans, a former assistant
coach at Texas Tech and Oklahoma State, is stirring things up in
the Pacific-10 Conference. Evans is in his second season at Arizona
State after a successful six-year career at Mississippi. The Sun
Devils and their coach are making their presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   After Arizona State defeated Southern California on Saturday,
the players got into a postgame scuffle. And USC coach Henry Bibby
accused Arizona State of throwing elbows and ``undisciplined
play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every coach in the country who knows me knows that I
run a disciplined program,'' Evans said. ``If I worried about what
one guy said about me, I'd be loony.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Arizona State travels to play at No. 4 Arizona. If the
Sun Devils continue their recent surge (five victories in their
past six games), consider the Arizona State-Arizona rivalry to be
at full boil.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Evans has been outspoken about Pac-10 issues such
as officiating, travel arrangements and a postseason tournament.
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery and Arizona coach Lute Olson and
their schools have been the leading opponents of a postseason
tournament. Evans believes the Pac-10 needs a postseason tourney.
Without naming names, he called nontourney advocates ``selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a right to publicly disagree,'' said Olson, noting his
17 seasons at Arizona. Evans pointed out he has a right to an
opinion.
\Nsubheds:Layups Here is an exchange from this week's Atlantic 10
Conference coaches' teleconference. George Washington coach Tom
Penders was talking about the development of his young players.
``It's like a goat looking at a fence. If you make a big deal of
the fence, they're never going to jump over it,'' he said. St.
Joseph's coach Phil Martelli, who follows Penders on the call, had
this comment: ``When was the last time you saw a goat, Tom Penders?
Did you go down to Texas and become a cowboy?'' The ``New York
Daily News'' reported that the NCAA's investigation of St. John's
is focusing on the relationship between ``street agent'' Rob
Johnson and some of the school's players. That name should be
familiar to Texas A&AMP;M fans. Johnson's involvement with the Aggies
and former coach Kermit Davis put the school on probation in 1991.
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski wore a yellow tie for his team's game at
North Carolina State. The fashion gesture was in honor of Georgia
Tech coach Bobby Cremins, who announced his end-of-the-season
resignation last week. ``What Mike Krzyzewski did, I'll always
remember,'' said Cremins, whose yellow tie has become a trademark.
``It's one of the nicest gestures anybody's ever done for me.''
Miami (Fla.), with a 73-71 victory last season and a 63-57 victory
Saturday, has become the first Big East Conference opponent to win
consecutive games against Connecticut at Gampel Pavilion.
\Nsubheds:By the numbers 6: Number of Big Ten Conference schools
with three or more consecutive conference championships. Michigan
State is in position to win its third consecutive Big Ten title.
101-50: The score in Stanford's victory against rival California
Saturday. It was the worst loss in Cal history, and it was
Stanford's largest victory margin against a Pacific-10 Conference
school. 23-0: Illinois' game-opening run Saturday against
Northwestern. The Wildcats were scoreless for the game's first
15:13. The final score: Illinois 63, Northwestern 30. 1986: The
last season Arizona State swept the Los Angeles schools (UCLA and
Southern California). 86.9: Percent of the team's minutes played by
Duke's top six players _ Chris Carrawell, Shane Battier, Nate
James, Jason Williams, Carlos Boozer and Mike Dunleavy Jr. Dunleavy
is out indefinitely with mononucleosis.
\Nrevhed:Inside the numbers Top-ranked Stanford leads Division I in
victory margin at 20.8 points per game. Margin of victory not only
can indicate a team's dominance, it often translates into NCAA
Tournament success. A look at where the teams with the largest
victory margins have fared in the past 10 NCAA tournaments: Year
Team Margin NCAA result 1999 Duke 24.7 Lost title game 1998 Duke
21.5 Lost regional final 1997 Kentucky 20.3 Lost title game 1996
Kentucky 22.1 Won title 1995 Kentucky 18.4 Lost regional final 1994
Arkansas 17.9 Won title 1993 North Carolina 17.8 Won title 1992
Indiana 17.6 Lost Final Four semifinal 1991 UNLV 26.7 Lost title

Cowboys work on free agents 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCKX 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys continue to work quietly toward
trying to sign a free-agent cornerback and bring in a No. 2
quarterback to replace Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   They also are interested, if not growing anxious, in beginning
meaningful negotiations with their own top unrestricted free
agents, defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman and free safety George
Teague, since the team already has lost two defensive starters,
Randall Godfrey to Tennessee and Kavika Pittman to Denver. Garrett
defected to the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   When asked] about Spellman and Teague, Cowboys coach Dave Campo
said, ``I can promise you, we're on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley Ranch was a virtual ghost town late yesterday as Campo,
his assistants, along with members of the scouting department and
medical staff all made travel plans to Indianapolis for the NFL
Scouting Combine, which is today through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The combine is a who's who of college players who are expected
to go in the first several rounds of the April 15-16 NFL draft. All
31 teams are involved in physical and psychological testing, using
their own coaches, scouts and medical staff to carefully evaluate
each candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have five selections, including only one pick
through the first three rounds because of trades made with Seattle
for receivers Joey Galloway (first-round picks in 2000 and 2001)
and James McKnight (third round in 2000). Forty-two picks will be
made before the Cowboys get a pick; they don't pick again until the
fourth round. \Ntagtop:Ray Buck, (817) 390-7096

AUSTIN RACETRACK CLEARS HURDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horse racing at a new racetrack in Austin, Texas, could start
next year after the Texas Racing Commission unanimously approved
plans for the Austin Jockey Club yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The track, which will be located near the new Austin-Bergstrom
Airport in southwest Austin, is projected to cost $14 million and
will be managed by the same company that operates Retama Park near
San Antonio. Retama general manager Bob Pollock said construction
on the AJC could begin in six months.
</P>
<P>
   The project must gain zoning approval from the city of Austin.
It's likely that the facility will handle wagering on races
simulcast from other locations next year before live racing begins
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can get right after it as soon as the zoning is
final,'' Pollock said. ``This will be awfully good for Texas racing
as well as Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   The AJC received support from the Texas Thoroughbred Association
and the American Quarter Horse Association. The Texas Horsemen's
Partnership, which represents horse owners and trainers in Texas,
has pledged $2.5 million to help finance the track. Half of that
total will be repaid over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The commission ignored arguments from officials at Manor Downs,
which has been operating a quarter horse pari-mutuel racing season
outside of Austin since 1990. Howard Phillips, chief financial
officer at Manor, said Austin probably can't support two
racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   That has held true in other metropolitan areas. Bandera Downs
outside of San Antonio closed in 1995 after the opening of Retama.
And Trinity Meadows closed in '96 after Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie started taking simulcast bets at the Post Time Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at Manor Downs, located about 15 minutes outside of
Austin, has dropped from almost 40,000 in 1994 to 28,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   AJC officials pledged to the commission to operate a
quarter-horse season in addition to the 20-date thoroughbred season
they already have planned if Manor fails.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to existing tracks, AJC is small. Its $14 million
startup budget ranks below Lone Star ($105 million), Sam Houston
Race Park in Houston ($94 million) and Retama ($85 million). The
AJC is planning a 7-furlong dirt track with no turf course and will
be owned by Houston attorney Joe Archer, Humble real estate broker
Berry Madden and Retama Park chief executive officer Bryan Brown.

RANGERS HOPEFUL INFIELD HOLES FILLED

<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Mike Lamb played at Double A last year.
Luis Alicea is 34, hit .201 at the major-league level last year and
hasn't been a regular in three years.
</P>
<P>
   But losing Todd Zeile and Mark McLemore to free agency has
forced the Rangers to take a chance on two players who weren't in
their plans going into the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Both are being asked to play regularly _ Alicea at second base
and Lamb at third _ for a team that expects not only to repeat as
American League West Division champions but contend for the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident with what we've done,'' Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin said. ``You can say it's a risk, but there's a
risk with a lot of major-league players. Luis hasn't played
regularly in over two years, but I think he's up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mike Lamb, he's hit .300 everywhere he's went. Reid
Nichols \Rthe Rangers farm director\S kept saying, `I've seen a lot
of minor-league players, and this guy is going to be a player.' I
have enough confidence in our people to trust their judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training will be the first test, and it's not certain
that both will be in the Opening Day lineup. That is especially
true with Lamb, who is trying to take over for Zeile at third. The
Rangers have Tom Evans, their Triple-A third baseman, in camp as a
safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to do the job,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``We'll make an evaluation; is he ready to play in the big leagues?
If not, is Evans the guy? If I don't like what I see, I may tell
Doug, `Hey, we need help.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mike Lamb is going to be given every chance. We'll be
patient. We'll work with him. I've only read about him. The next
six weeks we'll watch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb does have an impressive minor-league rsum. He hit .324 at
Double-A Tulsa last year with 98 runs scored, 51 doubles, five
triples, 21 home runs and 100 runs batted in. He also hit .343 in
the highly competitive Arizona Fall League, which further suggested
to the Rangers he was ready to jump past Triple A to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it as I have to win a job here,'' Lamb said. ``No
matter what people are saying, I still feel I've got to prove it to
myself and everybody else. I'm confident that I can compete at this
level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were planning on Lamb playing at Triple A this year.
They were hoping Zeile could play third base for one more year,
then move to designated hitter. But when Zeile signed with the New
York Mets, the Rangers decided Lamb was a better risk than any of
the free agents available, including All-Stars Tony Fernandez and
Ed Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who were out there weren't of the caliber where we
wanted to invest that kind of money,'' Melvin said. ``We feel we
have a guy who can step in and handle the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicea does have a major-league track record. He had two good
years as a regular, hitting .270 for the Boston Red Sox in 1995 and
.253 with 22 stolen bases for the Anaheim Angels in 1997. But after
being a superb backup for the Rangers in 1998 and hitting .274, he
slumped to .201 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about that,'' Alicea said. ``I hurt my wrist
in spring training and waited until after the season to have
surgery. That was a big part of it. But the main thing is getting a
chance to play every day. It's difficult when you only get 100
at-bats to get into a good groove.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have safety nets at second base. Frank Catalanotto,
acquired from the Detroit Tigers in the Juan Gonzalez trade, is a
career .280 hitter with 34 doubles and 17 homers in 525 at-bats and
has played 69 games over the past three years at second base.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also want to look at Edwin Diaz, who was once one of
their top minor-league prospects. The Rangers lost him to the
Arizona Diamondbacks in the 1997 expansion draft, but he is back
with them on a minor-league contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he could play then, and I still think he can play,''
Oates said. ``He could be the best defensive second baseman in
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like Lamb at third, second base is Alicea's job to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an incumbent, it would have to be Luis,'' Oates
said. ``I don't expect him to play 140 games there, but I expect
Luis to get most of the playing time. How much will be determined
by how well he plays and how healthy he is.''

RANGERS, FOX CLOSE TO TELEVISION AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers are close to finalizing a
deal that would give Fox Network the TV rights for their games
televised locally.
</P>
<P>
   Club president Jim Lites said all 162 Rangers games will be
shown in the Fort Worth-Dallas area this season, with approximately
70 games on over-the-air stations and the rest on cable on Fox
Sports Net. The Rangers are awaiting final approval on the contract
from Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Lites declined to state the length of the deal but said it
involves a substantial increase in rights fees.
</P>
<P>
   The over-the-air games would be split between Fox stations
KDFW/Channel 4 and KDFI/Channel 27; KXTX/Channel 39, which is owned
by Rangers owner Tom Hicks; and KXAS/Channel 5, which has an
existing contract to broadcast up to five Rangers games. The
agreement gives Fox the right to decide which games it wants to
show on Channel 4 and Channel 27. Any games it doesn't want to show
will be telecast on Channel 39, Lites said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first year at least I would expect a bit of a bounce
around,'' Lites said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had 90 games shown over-the-air last year. Lites
said less games on the over-the-air stations make it easier for the
Rangers to attract advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball ratings are high right now, so the more games you
have, the harder it is for advertisers to keep up with the rating
points,'' Lites said. ``They only have so much money, and they have
to do business in Atlanta, Kansas City and other markets. We've
found that 70 games over-the-air and 90 games on cable works
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks sold the cable TV rights to his sports holdings, primarily
the Rangers and the Stars, to Fox Sports Net in the fall for what
sources said was a $300 million deal over 15 years, including $100
million upfront.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' contract with Channel 39 expires at the end of this
season. Lites said the Stars are also close to a deal that would
give Fox both their over-the-air and cable rights for at least 10
years. The NHL Board of Governors must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' over-the-air rights are currently with Channel 39.
That deal expires at the end of this season. Lites said the new
arrangement would have 30-35 games over-the-air and the rest on
cable, similar to their current agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Lites said Hicks began looking to sell over-the-air rights once
he sold cable rights to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   This deal is ``what makes the most sense for us with our
resources,'' Lites said. ``It's economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites said Bill Jones and Tom Grieve will continue to serve as
the television broadcasters for all Rangers games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we do, we'll pick the announcers and control the
broadcasters,'' Lites said. \Nsubheds:Dransfeldt starting over
Rangers management believes infielder Kelly Dransfeldt has the
defensive ability to be an everyday player in the major leagues.
But they're concerned about his hitting, which fell apart after he
was brought up to the major leagues May 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get his stroke back,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``We're going to spend a lot of time on his stroke. Rudy Jaramillo
\Rthe Rangers hitting coach\S is going to break it down and start
over again. He's got too many holes; his swing is too long.
Big-league pitchers were getting him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing keeping him from being a big-league
shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt was hitting .311 for Triple-A Oklahoma when he was
called up after Royce Clayton injured his shoulder. Dransfeldt hit
.189 in 16 games with the Rangers and, after being sent down May
21, he hit only .218 in his final 81 games with Oklahoma.
\Nsubheds:Briefly Rookie pitcher R.A. Dickey is sidelined with a
strained right hamstring. Juan Moreno, another minor-league
pitcher, also has stopped throwing because of soreness in his left
shoulder. The Rangers still have several key players unsigned,
including outfielders Gabe Kapler and Ruben Mateo, and reliever
Jeff Zimmerman. General manager Doug Melvin said he would like
everybody signed by the time exhibition games start March 3. First
baseman Rafael Palmeiro is expected today for the Rangers' first
full-squad workout. Catcher Ivan Rodriguez is expected tomorrow.

MARINERS REMAKING THEMSELVES INTO NEW BALLPARK'S IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Remodeling like this hasn't been done since
RuPaul.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the Mariners moved into the Guilty Pleasure last
year, the bosses knew a fundamental makeover was inevitable because
of the differences between the old park and the new park.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment in spring training, figurative pallets loaded with
2x4s and drywall are everywhere, ready to implement the new design.
</P>
<P>
   Out with American League thunderball, in with National League
bittyball.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Kingdome, I used to tell my base coaches, `Don't run us
out of innings,''' said manager Lou Piniella, which meant avoiding
outs by trying to steal bases or stretch hits. ``Now, I tell 'em,
`Be aggressive. If they get thrown out, what the hell.'''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The old style collapsed anyway. The Mariners, one-time
possessors of the game's most formidable offense, had in the second
half of 1999 the American League's worst team batting average,
.243. It wasn't all due to the bigger park.
</P>
<P>
   They traded hitters David Segui, Butch Huskey and Matt Mieske
for pitching, and saw Jay Buhner, Russ Davis, John Mabry and Carlos
Guillen go down with injuries while Ken Griffey Jr. was lamely
drifting out of town with a .255 second-half average.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but they still led all of baseball with 244 home runs. As
usual.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the home-run culture around the Mariners sucked in
just about everybody. From big guys to banjo hitters, all were
gorging on a diet of Kingdome grand salamis. Nobody in charge said
much of anything, because home runs put fans in the seats.
</P>
<P>
   But as Piniella said in reference to Griffey, Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa, baseball's most prolific home run hitters: ``Notice
where their teams finished? None were above. 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a guy like newcomer David Bell, a 175-pound second baseman
who hit 10 homers in 422 previous American League at-bats before
last season, went yard 21 times.
</P>
<P>
   But who needs dingers from a second baseman when the rest of the
lineup already is filled with Popeye arms? The Mariners needed base
runners.
</P>
<P>
   So he was often moved in the lineup from the last three spots,
where he hit .311, to the No. 2 spot. It didn't work. He hit .239.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with David in Chicago once last season, after he had
a streak of about 75 at-bats with two walks,'' Piniella said. ``I
told him that had to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who hit just two home runs in the second half, owned up to
the fact that the home-run virus was virulent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every part of the game can be contagious,'' he said. ``That's
why it's so important to develop chemistry, because negative things
can be contagious too. For whatever reason, good hitting, pitching
and fielding can all be contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   Good pitching must become epidemic, based on the half-season
consequences of hitting in the new park.
</P>
<P>
   In last season's 42 games, the park had the highest strikeout
factor and the lowest batting average factor in the American League
(Mariners and opponents), according to STATS, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It was also lowest in hits, doubles and triples, although
curiously it was second-highest in home runs.
</P>
<P>
   While a half-season is not enough for final conclusions,
particularly without performances in April, May and June, it's
apparent the new yard is seriously imbalanced in favor of pitching.
In other words, thanks for the memories, Griffey and Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the imbalance has been addressed by repainting and
reconfiguring the hitting background beyond center field.
Complaints were numerous from all teams that day-game pitches could
not be tracked because of glare.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now that San Francisco's Candlestick Park is gone from
baseball, the GP probably trails only Denver's Coors Field, where
the mile-high altitude warps the game, and the Ballpark at
Arlington (heat and wind), as the yard most vulnerable most of the
time to environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's spring of steady dampness and heavy, southwesterly air
usually gives way to the brightest, most humidity-free summers in
North America, along with a northerly breeze. Because it is
baseball's most northern outdoor park, the sun will appear at the
widest spread of angles throughout a season.
</P>
<P>
   The retractable roof means some conditions can be manipulated a
little to suit a game situation as well as fan comfort. But there's
no manipulating the fact that a cold, breezy, damp yard is hard on
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mariners have assembled a pitching-dominant roster that
includes more line-drive hitters, and supplied it with a fresh set
of instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to hit balls on the ground and down the lines,''
Piniella said. ``We're going to bunt more, raise our on-base
percentage, run the bases hard and hit behind the runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``And no more home run contests in batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first spring-training media chat Tuesday, Rodriguez
captured the Mariners conversion with a remark from his first
drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't bunted in seven years,'' he said. ``That should tell
you how that ballpark plays.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Mariners head north in a month, the salami
breath will be gone. Identification will be possible only through
fingerprints.

KINGS RESPOND TO MOTIVATIONAL TALK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY _ Hell, fire and Andy Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Add them up, and the Los Angeles Kings' 7-2 victory against the
Calgary Flames on Wednesday was a sermon that took off only after
the team's first-year coach got mad.
</P>
<P>
   All season, Murray has showered his players with positive
thoughts and little sayings attempting to keep the team upbeat. But
after two losses and a two-goal deficit in the first 10 minutes
against Calgary, Murray called timeout. He started naming names.
</P>
<P>
   Misbegotten Kings like Aki Berg and Donald Audette responded
with goals. Struggling Jere Karalahti and Jason Blake did, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then the big guys, Luc Robitaille, Ziggy Palffy and Rob Blake
moved in to finish off a string of seven consecutive goals,
including five in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, this was Murray's handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he called the timeout, we knew there were two ways we
could go,'' said Robitaille, whose power-play goal was his 10th in
1 32nd this season and 549th of his career. ``Andy put the season
on the line. He made us desperate. We played like there was no
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   For Berg, that was important. He came back Monday in Edmonton
after getting benched for two games and played worse. And with 6:01
gone in the first period Wednesday, Berg allowed Jarome Iginla to
skate by and score Calgary's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Murray had ripped Berg after the morning workout, saying, ``He
was so bad (vs. Edmonton) I couldn't bench him or I might have lost
him forever.''
</P>
<P>
   With 7:43 gone in the second period, the Kings finally got the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Audette, who also added two assists, scored his first goal since
Dec. 14 when he took a pass from Glen Murray in front and beat
Flames' goaltender Fred Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes later, Berg atoned for Calgary's first
goal by tying the game after passes by Dan Bylsma and Len Barrie,
two more forgotten Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant so much to me,'' Berg said. ``It just gave me so
much confidence. The last few days haven't been easy, but I knew if
head up good things would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could just see how up he looked after scoring the goal,''
defenseman Mattias Norstrom said. ``Everyone felt good for Aki.
Most of us have been there. He really played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in Berg's performance was Audette's effort. Even
before he missed six weeks with a badly sprained left ankle, he was
slumping. Audette had 10 goals in the team's first 25 games, but
since then had scored only once.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, Audette played on the third line instead of
his customary spot on the second unit. He went to Murray on Tuesday
and said he'd like to be a scorer again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I can do,'' Audette said. ``I asked for a chance,
and I did the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Audette's second line finished with five points. Overall, the
Kings rattled Brathwaite with 48 shots, including 36 in the final
two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many good signs, but I really thought the play
of the second line made a big difference tonight,'' Robitaille
said. ``They were forechecking like crazy the whole game. And
Donald just adds another dimension to them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Murray went to the whip in the first period, he also knew
the Flames were playing without defensemen Phil Housley (flu) and
Cale Hulse (ankle).
</P>
<P>
   ``That left them with just four defensemen,'' Murray said.
``That is a hard position to be in. We knew if we kept dumping the
puck in, good things would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray was especially happy for Berg, who is still just 22. But
he also was pleased for the team, which moves on to Vancouver for
Friday's game with the Canucks. So pleased, he canceled today's
practice. No speeches are planned either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them we had 50 minutes left and how we played
could determine our season,'' he said.

TROUBLE DOWN THE STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC is shorthanded because of injuries, but the
Trojans believe their recent five-game losing streak is due more to
sluggish second-half starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have led the past three games at halftime but
quickly lost the advantage in the opening minutes of the second
half against UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we're losing games in the first five minutes of
the second half,'' forward Brian Scalabrine said. ``I think the
Arizona and Arizona State games were decided in those first five
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   Forward David Bluthenthal believes the Trojans stop running
their offense and begin to force outside shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we talk about every time, that we need to continue
to move the ball around. Not just come down and have Brandon
(Granville) and Brian spot up and shoot,'' Bluthenthal said. ``When
we run our offense and move the ball around, we make more shots
than when it's just one pass and then take a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Perimeter breakdown: It's been almost a month since the
Trojans won a game, ironically against tonight's opponent, Oregon
State. USC made a Pacific-10 Conference record 20 of 29 3-point
attempts in its 82-69 victory over the Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   In the five games since that victory, the Trojans have made only
33 percent of their 3-point shots (32 for 96).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a false sense of security,'' Bluthenthal said of the
Oregon State game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to shoot 20 for 29 again (against Oregon
State),'' Scalabrine added. ``But as long as we do things right,
especially on defense, we should win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tournament hopes: The Trojans (13-11, 6-6) need to win five
of their remaining six games to earn an NCAA Tournament bid, but
Bluthenthal is hopeful that even if the Trojans win four games,
they will receive consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win four of six, I think it's possible to make the
tournament,'' Bluthenthal said. ``Especially if Sam (Clancy) comes
back from his injury and we can blow those last two teams out
(against the Washington schools). Then we're 10-8 in the conference
and we have some momentum. Hopefully, the committee will see
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, USC coach Henry Bibby refuses to discuss the number of
victories the Trojans need over the final three weeks of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has an answer for us and everyone has calculated
it,'' Bibby said. ``We're trying to play out the six games the best
we can. We just have to come focused knowing there is no
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stat leader: USC guard Jeff Trepagnier is the only player in
the Pac-10 who ranks in the top 10 in five different statistical
categories. Trepagnier is first in steals (3.4), fifth in scoring
(15.7), sixth in blocks (1.4), eighth in rebounding (7.0) and ninth
in field-goal percentage (.487).
</P>
<P>
   __ Record pace: Bluthenthal is close to setting a school record
for most rebounds in conference play (10.3), which would surpass
the mark held by Cliff Robinson (9.8) in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   __ Last word: USC players were split on whether next year's
first meeting with Arizona State would be highly anticipated
because of the postgame brawl that marred last week's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys are fired up for next year,'' Bluthenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   But Scalabrine disagreed, saying, ``I'm not circling Arizona
State on my calendar. That was just a physical game. Nothing
more.''

ANGELS TRY HATCHER FOR CAREW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Mickey Hatcher is the Angels' new hitting coach,
replacing seven-time batting champion and Hall of Famer Rod Carew,
who was let go after last season after serving as the club's
hitting coach since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatcher, a .280 career hitter in 12 major-league seasons,
won't try to rewrite the book on hitting. His job, he says, is to
help instill confidence and support the hitters any way he can.
</P>
<P>
   He has his work cut out for him, considering he is coming in not
knowing the hitters and taking on the task of improving an offense
that ranked last in the American League in batting average (.256)
and runs scored (711) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to this team last year had nothing to do with
Rod Carew,'' Hatcher said. ``It had to do with injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher won't tinker with anybody's swing. Reviewing videotape
as Carew did so much won't be such a big part of Hatcher's coaching
method.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a hitting coach, my personal philosophy is they know
themselves as hitters as much as anybody,'' he said. ``They got to
the big leagues for a reason. I'm coming in to work with them. I
want to know their program, what they like to do to prepare. As a
player, I didn't want anybody messing with my mechanics. I'll ask
them, `What did Rod do? Do you want to keep that program?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher believes it's possible to have paralysis by analysis.
Too much staring at the video machine can do as much harm as good.
Darin Erstad, for example, works and studies as hard as anybody.
And he struggled all last season, finishing with a .253 average and
13 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to simplify things,'' Hatcher said. ``If you have
mechanics on your mind when you're up there, you forget `See the
ball, hit the ball.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, however, wants his hitters to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for them,'' he said. ``If they want to put in extra
work every day, hitting soft toss or hitting off a tee, we'll do
it. (Manager) Mike Scioscia's philosophy is that the coaches are
the first ones here and the last ones to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Erstad absent: The Angels conducted their first full- squad
workout Wednesday, minus one.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad did not participate in batting practice or outfield
drills because of an inflammed bursa sac in his left shoulder. He
had an MRI on the shoulder Feb. 15, and the results were normal.
But during his physical on Tuesday, team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum
injected the bursa sac with cortisone.
</P>
<P>
   Angels spokesman Tim Mead said it's possible Erstad will work
out today, but he'll likely take another day off before getting
back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Greene update: There were times in the past two or three
years that it seemed certain Todd Greene's catching career was
over. Twice he had surgery on his right shoulder, but he says his
shoulder is fine now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first offseason in three years that I didn't have
surgery on my shoulder,'' Greene said. ``It's a lot better. It's
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene was supposed to work his way into the catching rotation
last season, but he was injured in a collision at the plate and
didn't catch again. Greene, though, says the injury was whiplash,
not his shoulder. And he said he was ready to catch late in the
season, but manager Terry Collins said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 20 games out,'' Greene said. ``He said there was no
reason to risk it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said Greene figures to work his way into the catching
rotation, but they will take things slowly with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major concern,'' Scioscia said. ``It's important we
make sure Todd's healthy.''

DUCKS TIE CANUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was American League baseball at its best on
Wednesday night at The Pond. The pitching wasn't very good and the
ball seemed to be juiced.
</P>
<P>
   Actually it was an NHL game, of sorts, between the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks and Vancouver Canucks. The goalies _ Dominic Roussel
for the Ducks and Felix Potvin _ looked as if they were trying to
stop hand grenades most of the night and as a result the game
turned into offensive shootout in a 4-4 tie before 12,682.
</P>
<P>
   Each shot had a sense of drama, especially in the first two
periods, when the Ducks and Canucks combined for eight goals in the
first 36 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks outscored the Canucks 3-1 on the power play _ getting
goals from Oleg Tverdovsky, Teemu Selanne and Steve Rucchin. But
Vancouver outscored Anaheim 3-1 at even strength.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 2-0 in the first half of the first period,
the Canucks came roaring back on a power play goal by Mark Messier
and even strength goals by Darby Hendrickson and Markus Naslund to
take a 3-2 lead early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin tied the game, 3-3, with the Ducks' season-high third
power play goal of the game at 3:04, but Anaheim would have rally
one more time just to get to the dressing room tied, 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Brad May knocked the puck away from Tverdovsky in the Anaheim
zone and Matt Cooke pounced on it and easily beat Roussel on the
short side at 9:34. The Ducks, who outshot the Canucks 16-7 in the
period, got the goal back with the help on bad rebound left by
Potvin.
</P>
<P>
   After taking shot from a steep angle, Ladislav Kohn chased down
the loose puck and tucked a backhander past the Vancouver goalie at
15:43.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin certainly wasn't brilliant, but he did come up with three
big saves in the the second period. He stopped Jeff Nielsen on a
shorthanded less than two minutes before Vancouver's fourth goal.
He also stopped Rucchin and Selanne from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Roussel was fighting each and ever shot. In addition
to the four goals he allowed, the Anaheim backup nearly allowed
Trent Klatt's 70-foot floater to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the third period that Roussel came up big for
the Ducks, stopping a breakway by Naslund.
</P>
<P>
   With Anaheim's recent history of blowing leads, power play goals
by Tverdovsky at 1:03 and Selanne at 8:36 had the Ducks feeling fat
and sassy _ and the Canucks jumped on them.
</P>
<P>
   And as usual it was poor penalty killing and goaltending that
turned the momentum in favor of Vancouver. Roussel, starting his
second consecutive game in place of Guy Hebert, couldn't handle a
rebound off a deflection and Mark Messier scored at 11:34 to cut
the lead to one.
</P>
<P>
   It was ninth straight game that the Ducks had allowed a power
play goal.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked 27th in the league in penalty killing, Anaheim did manage
to kill off a penalty to Marty McInnis, but rookie Vitaly
Vishnevski was rocked by May freeing the puck for Cooke. The
Vancouver center quickly got it to Darby Hendrickson in the slot
and he snapped a shot past Roussel at 14:58 to tie the game, 2-2.

<P>
   TEHRAN _ The overwhelming victory of President Mohamed Khatami's
democratic ``reformists'' in the new Iranian parliament is already
being portrayed by Washington as a ``hopeful sign for the West.''
But the new Iran emerging from last week's poll is likely to
diminish rather than increase American influence in the region...
In Tehran, they are recalling once again the era of Mohamed
Mossadeq, freely elected but swiftly overthrown in 1953 by a coup
d'etat funded by the CIA and British intelligence. &QL;

elliptical, full of heroes who might not all really be heroes after
all. And it may yet prove to have an unhappy, tragic ending.

   QOM, IRAN _ It was an eerie experience. To interview the man
whom Ayatollah Khomeini once anointed as his chosen successor is
one thing. To talk to him through a wall after he has spent more
than two years under house arrest in this gold-domed holy city of
Iran was positively surreal. ``Welcome to my home,'' the Ayatollah
growled at me in English. It was one of the few kind things he
said. Understandably, because the reasons for Montazeri's house
imprisonment _ and the contents of his extraordinary first
interview in captivity _ go to the very heart of the crisis behind
last week's parliamentary elections in Iran. &QL;

   CHIBUTO, MOZAMBIQUE _ Four days ago in Washington, U.S.
President Bill Clinton proclaimed Mozambique the world's
fastest-growing economy. At about the same time, Tiago Chauque, 35,
was up a tree, saving himself, but none of his hard-earned
belongings, from the country's worst floods in living memory. For
all of Clinton's fine words, an African economic dream _ which
enjoyed three successive years of GDP growth exceeding 10 percent
less than a decade after the end of a 16-year civil war _ has
tragically been swept away. &QL;

   LONDON _ Eight months later, opponents of NATO's war in Kosovo
could not have imagined more bitter vindication of their dire
warnings than events in the city of Mitrovica, where Serbs and
Albanians confront each other, kept apart only by the Ibar River
and the increasingly desperate efforts of the overwhelmed NATO-led
peacekeeping force. There is plenty of fault to go around but at
the heart of the matter, Mitrovica reflects the ambiguities and
confusions that still dog the entire Kosovo enterprise. &QL;

   &UR; IRAN'S NEW DAWN MAY END U.S. INFLUENCE IN PERSIAN GULF &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ The overwhelming victory of President Mohamed Khatami's
democratic ``reformists'' in the new Iranian parliament is already
being portrayed by Washington as a ``hopeful sign for the West.''
But the new Iran emerging from last week's poll is likely to
diminish rather than increase American influence in the region...
In Tehran, they are recalling once again the era of Mohamed
Mossadeq, freely elected but swiftly overthrown in 1953 by a coup
d'etat funded by the CIA and British intelligence. &QL;

   TEHRAN _ Last week's parliamentary election in Iran was like a
Persian tale of hope and love. It was also, like all Persian
stories, not as simple as it seems; a trifle opaque perhaps,
elliptical, full of heroes who might not all really be heroes after
all. And it may yet prove to have an unhappy, tragic ending.

   QOM, IRAN _ It was an eerie experience. To interview the man
whom Ayatollah Khomeini once anointed as his chosen successor is
one thing. To talk to him through a wall after he has spent more
than two years under house arrest in this gold-domed holy city of
Iran was positively surreal. ``Welcome to my home,'' the Ayatollah
growled at me in English. It was one of the few kind things he
said. Understandably, because the reasons for Montazeri's house
imprisonment _ and the contents of his extraordinary first
interview in captivity _ go to the very heart of the crisis behind
last week's parliamentary elections in Iran. &QL;

of his party program lay human rights for Iranian citizens. But the
West _ which has been applauding the stunning victory of Khatami's

elections _ should perhaps study his last words before assuming
that Iran is about to become just another client nation in the
Middle East. &QL;

is not due to go to Israel and the Palestinian Authority for nearly
a month, the visit _ the first by a Pope since 1964 _ is already

THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT MAY BE A GENUINE VOTING BLOC AGAIN

 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last autumn the evangelical magazine ``Christianity Today''
posed the cover-story question: ``Is the Religious Right
Finished?''
 &HT;    In the wake of the South Carolina Republican primary, the answer
should be: ``Not quite yet.''
 &HT;    In South Carolina, Christian conservatives backed Gov. George W.Bush by 3 to 1. Factoring them out of the vote, Bush would have
lost. Without the religious right, South Carolina would have gone
for Sen. John McCain.
 &HT;    Following the primary, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) contended
that McCain had been politically victimized by 19 days of hate
mail, intimating that such attacks had been orchestrated by
operatives at least loosely associated with religious right gurus
Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson.
 &HT;    As a result of the vicious campaign, former candidate Gary Bauer
backed McCain and Graham characterized the attacks as ``lies.''
 &HT;    Bush courted Christian conservatives by visiting _ and not
criticizing _ the racist and fundamentalist Bob Jones University
and moving far to the right on social issues. In a CNN debate, Bush
pointedly mentioned the support of the Log Cabin Republicans, the
gay Republican interest group, for McCain.
 &HT;    To those with theological ears to hear, Bush's remark was
code-language to Christian conservatives meaning: ``Vote for me
unless you want a bunch of immoral sodomites running the country.''
 &HT;    They heard. Nearly 100,000 of them stampeded to the polls and
voted against McCain.
 &HT;    This strategy seems to have caught the mainstream media
off-guard. Until South Carolina, religion had not seemed an issue
in the presidential race. Early on, all the candidates professed
Christian faith. All shaped their views to fit a conservative
Christian agenda. A couple_ notably Alan Keyes and Bauer _ had long
associations with the religious right.
 &HT;    With so much piety, the religious right vote was thought to be
evenly divided between candidates and unlikely to sway the race.
 &HT;    Not, of course, with Ralph Reed as master religion strategist.
 &HT;    Although it pains me to say it, Reed is a genius. The former
director of the Christian Coalition is an adviser to Bush. In the
September 1999 issue of ``Christianity Today,'' Reed claimed that
Christian conservatives ``are the largest single voting bloc in the
electorate _ 24 percent of all those who walked into a voting booth
in 1998. That is larger than the union vote, the feminist vote, the
gay vote, or any other single constituency organized around an
issues agenda.''
 &HT;    There has been, however, a problem with this voting bloc. With
the exception of the 1994 mid-term elections, they have not voted
as a bloc since the end of the Reagan presidency.
 &HT;    Since 1988, Republicans have tried to mobilize religious right
voters around a number of different candidates and issues. With few
attractive national candidates, political strategists attempted to
organize Christian conservatives around abortion. Hard-core
religious right types have insisted on a pro-life position, but
among more moderate Christian voters abortion proved a dead-end.
 &HT;    Despite dazzling media success in the last decade, the religious
right has been a rudderless ship_ more a potential voting bloc than
a solid one.
 &HT;    Enter Ralph Reed. Reed understands that the religious right will
never have real power until it is unified around a single candidate
and can propel that candidate _ in service to their agenda _ to the
White House. The nicely pious George W. Bush just does not match
Ronald Reagan's charismatic charm.
 &HT;    But there is an issue to mobilize the troops: the threat of gay
rights.
 &HT;    If Reed and Robertson can make Bush into the anti-homosexual
candidate, they could successfully capitalize on homophobic anxiety
in Christian circles. With most of the nation's major Protestant
denominations meeting this summer to deal with divisive problems
related to homosexuality, the issue will be at a fever pitch
leading into the fall elections. Religious right activists should
be able to enlist more moderate Christian voters around this cause.
With homosexuality the issue _ an issue that seems more ``clear
cut'' to most religious voters than abortion _ the religious right
may be a genuine voting bloc this year.
 &HT;    Gay rights may have been a throwaway debate line in South
Carolina. If it successfully mobilizes the nation's ``largest
voting bloc'' in upcoming primaries, it will become a centerpiece
issue by November.
 &HT;    No, the religious right is not finished. At least it is not
finished as a powerful political interest lobby. But _ if there was
ever any doubt _ it is finished as a ``religious'' entity. After
all, faithful Christians follow the Ten Commandments: ``You shall
not bear false witness against your neighbor.''
 &HT;    Yes, those are the same commandments the religious right is
lobbying for lawmakers to hang on schoolroom walls. Perhaps Reed
and Robertson should read them first.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last autumn the evangelical magazine ``Christianity Today''
posed the cover-story question: ``Is the Religious Right
Finished?''
 &HT;    In the wake of the South Carolina Republican primary, the answer
should be: ``Not quite yet.''
 &HT;    In South Carolina, Christian conservatives backed Gov. George W.
Bush by 3 to 1. Factoring them out of the vote, Bush would have
lost. Without the religious right, South Carolina would have gone
for Sen. John McCain.
 &HT;    Following the primary, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) contended
that McCain had been politically victimized by 19 days of hate
mail, intimating that such attacks had been orchestrated by
operatives at least loosely associated with religious right gurus
Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson.
 &HT;    As a result of the vicious campaign, former candidate Gary Bauer
backed McCain and Graham characterized the attacks as ``lies.''
 &HT;    Bush courted Christian conservatives by visiting _ and not
criticizing _ the racist and fundamentalist Bob Jones University
and moving far to the right on social issues. In a CNN debate, Bush
pointedly mentioned the support of the Log Cabin Republicans, the
gay Republican interest group, for McCain.
 &HT;    To those with theological ears to hear, Bush's remark was
code-language to Christian conservatives meaning: ``Vote for me
unless you want a bunch of immoral sodomites running the country.''
 &HT;    They heard. Nearly 100,000 of them stampeded to the polls and
voted against McCain.
 &HT;    This strategy seems to have caught the mainstream media
off-guard. Until South Carolina, religion had not seemed an issue
in the presidential race. Early on, all the candidates professed
Christian faith. All shaped their views to fit a conservative
Christian agenda. A couple_ notably Alan Keyes and Bauer _ had long
associations with the religious right.
 &HT;    With so much piety, the religious right vote was thought to be
evenly divided between candidates and unlikely to sway the race.
 &HT;    Not, of course, with Ralph Reed as master religion strategist.
 &HT;    Although it pains me to say it, Reed is a genius. The former
director of the Christian Coalition is an adviser to Bush. In the
September 1999 issue of ``Christianity Today,'' Reed claimed that
Christian conservatives ``are the largest single voting bloc in the
electorate _ 24 percent of all those who walked into a voting booth
in 1998. That is larger than the union vote, the feminist vote, the
gay vote, or any other single constituency organized around an
issues agenda.''
 &HT;    There has been, however, a problem with this voting bloc. With
the exception of the 1994 mid-term elections, they have not voted
as a bloc since the end of the Reagan presidency.
 &HT;    Since 1988, Republicans have tried to mobilize religious right
voters around a number of different candidates and issues. With few
attractive national candidates, political strategists attempted to
organize Christian conservatives around abortion. Hard-core
religious right types have insisted on a pro-life position, but
among more moderate Christian voters abortion proved a dead-end.
 &HT;    Despite dazzling media success in the last decade, the religious
right has been a rudderless ship_ more a potential voting bloc than
a solid one.
 &HT;    Enter Ralph Reed. Reed understands that the religious right will
never have real power until it is unified around a single candidate
and can propel that candidate _ in service to their agenda _ to the
White House. The nicely pious George W. Bush just does not match
Ronald Reagan's charismatic charm.
 &HT;    But there is an issue to mobilize the troops: the threat of gay
rights.
 &HT;    If Reed and Robertson can make Bush into the anti-homosexual
candidate, they could successfully capitalize on homophobic anxiety
in Christian circles. With most of the nation's major Protestant
denominations meeting this summer to deal with divisive problems

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE RESURRECTION OF POLITICAL PUNDITRY
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (p) political categories for
release Sunday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most folks who have followed the 2000 presidential
race must be getting pretty tired by now of seeing the contenders
roar back to life after being declared political dead ducks.
</P>
<P>
   But you can be rest assured that this born-again stuff on the
road to the White House is not really happening.
</P>
<P>
   It arises simply as a vision in the eyes of pundits who can see
no farther than the next round of primaries. And it is fueled by
news producers and editors in the mistaken belief that viewers,
listeners and readers would ditch them if they failed to come up
with fresh angles.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, you can be further assured that these fake
political funerals and resurrections will be buried for good well
before Easter Sunday, which in this election year will, for
certain, occur on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   Every four years, a unitary Republican and Democratic Party
springs to life, if only for a week or so, for the purpose of
nominating their presidential and vice presidential candidates.
Since the current system insures that most of the convention
delegates will be chosen by April 23, the phony guessing game will
be over by then.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, that will merely serve as a signal for the pundit
class to start up the next guessing game: Who will win in November?
Even before the inauguration, you can bet that speculation will
arise on whether the president-elect will be dumped in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, perhaps, a sophisticated computer program, brimming
with artificial intelligence, will sift through the data and tell
us conclusively what these intermittent zigs and zags mean. Until
then, here's a stab at it:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who will win in November?
</P>
<P>
   A: Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you arrive at that answer?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a contest that weighs personality more heavily than
issues, a nice guy beats a stiff klutz even if Mr. Nice comes
across as a bit of a lightweight and even if the klutz has most of
the issues nailed down cold.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who's the klutz, Al Gore or Bill Bradley?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gore. Bradley isn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why's that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bradley's in a vicious cycle: His poor polls beget nasty
coverage or outright neglect, which begets anemic fund-raising,
which begets fewer TV ads, which begets even worse polls. In the
end, a campaign just goes down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So that's why you need a virtuous circle to win, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You got it. Sen. John McCain is in one now, but it won't last
long.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why's that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because when we tote up the Bush delegate count in late
March, after the Republican voters in California, Texas, New York,
Ohio and Florida have had their say, McCain will be toast.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will those numbers reveal?
</P>
<P>
   A: They'll show that Bush has a majority of delegates he needs
to get nominated for the presidency by the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any way you could be wrong about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Real pundits are always right, even when their clips fail
them.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A world of trouble for candidate Gore
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most of the nation's political attention has been fixed on
the clang and clatter of the Republican knights jousting for their
party's presidential nomination, Vice President Al Gore has been
quietly working himself into a bit of a jam.
</P>
<P>
   Not over the Democratic nomination. That is now pretty much a
sure thing for Gore, barring fey Bill Bradley being taken over by
go-getter aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The sinkhole that is widening in Gore's path to the White House
is the issue of international trade, particularly the pending
proposal to admit China to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration bargained hard with China last year
to secure conditions that make Chinese membership markedly
favorable for American commercial interests, especially agriculture
and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   But as a consistent free-trader, Clinton is more at odds with
congressional Democrats, financially beholden to the AFL-CIO, a foe
of world trade, than with congressional Republicans. The bind is
particularly tight for Gore, who needs union money to field a
credible general-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore emerged from private meetings with AFL-CIO leaders recently
to say he seconds Clinton's policy, but others at the sessions got
the impression he would back moves to attach conditions that labor
wants _ titularly for overseas environmental and work-force
protections but actually meant to queer the deal and exempt U.S.
workers from international competition.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting confusion has left Gore looking rattled and
indistinct and, at least for the moment, has stranded congressional
Democrats who are unwilling to buck the AFL-CIO unless Gore
provides them with political cover.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House Republican leadership, for once actually
playing politics instead of finding novel ways to commit political
suicide, has adopted an agenda that backs Chinese WTO membership,
calls for opening U.S. markets to Africa and the Caribbean and
supports American leadership in international trade organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In that, the Republicans are harkening as much to their
big-business sugar daddies as the Democrats are to their labor big
spenders, but the GOP is right on the merits of the issue. The
United States overwhelming benefits more than it suffers from
expanding trade.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leadership has warned, however, that the legislation
needed to animate free-trade policies won't pass without a strong
Democratic muster. Translation: Republicans will hold back enough
GOP votes so that Democrats very visibly will have to anger the
AFL-CIO or will have to kowtow publicly to its protectionism,
either a political liability to the party.
</P>
<P>
   All the noise in the Republican primaries is a boon of sorts to
Gore, letting him flounder around little noticed as he tries to
figure out how to have the issue both ways. But push will come to
shove in Congress within weeks.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A rotten Strawberry
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Feb. 27, 2000. Moving in Sports and
Commentary categories.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   I don't know what possessed me to keep a file on baseball player
Darryl Strawberry; I rarely write about sports figures. Call it
intuition. The troubled (and troubling) athlete is back in the news
_ not for what he did on the field but what happened off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Strawberry failed still another drug test. It's his
fifth failure, now challenging the major-league record of pitcher
Steve Howe, another chronic druggie who was given seven chances by
major-league baseball to redeem himself. Those are six chances more
than alleged gambler Pete Rose was given.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Strawberry is a fortunate man. He beat cancer, didn't
he? He also survived a bunch of drug test failures, and arrests
ranging from soliciting a prostitute, to failure to pay child
support, to assault on his ex-wife. He lost a paternity suit, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry even tried to get away with cheating the U.S.
government of a half-million dollars in unreported earnings. While
the IRS caught up with him, and he paid a $300,000 fine, Strawberry
got off easy. Instead of the usual prison term, Strawberry was
placed on six months' home confinement. But, the judge added, it's
OK to go play baseball at home and away while serving his
home-confinement term.
</P>
<P>
   Is this man lucky or what?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe he's not so lucky. He's a sick man and I'm not just
referring to the colon cancer he overcame. Substance abuse is a
sickness. Only the strongest of minds can overcome it. And
Strawberry isn't one of those. He has had enough chances, and
failed, to be judged an incorrigible.
</P>
<P>
   A player of his immense talent _ and unfulfilled promise _ has
been given every opportunity. He not only has flubbed them but he
also can be considered a threat to the integrity of the sport.
That's the terminology Major League Baseball uses to justify
keeping the great Pete Rose from its liturgy. His return, baseball
claims, would harm the integrity of the game.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not certain what is left of baseball's ``integrity.'' Is
John Rocker a part of that integrity? Darryl Strawberry? The dozens
of substance-abuse cases among its players? The player strikes? The
dollar-based constant shuttling between teams? The mass firing of
the umpires?
</P>
<P>
   Are Cal Ripken Jr. and Darryl Strawberry really in the same
profession?
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is a brutal abuser of whatever positive image there
remains of baseball. If I was making millions of dollars a year for
playing a game, I'd be delighted to pay my taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after another bout with cocaine _ and a 60-day
suspension _ Strawberry visited a children's hospital in Tampa and
said one of his priorities was to work with kids and to warn them
about the traps of drugs and alcohol. ``This is something more
special than hitting a baseball or hitting a home run,'' he said,
obviously lying to himself _ and to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, Strawberry became a spokesman for the National
Council on Alcoholic and Drug Dependence. He said he was optimistic
about his future. He was right, if only for a short _ but glorious
_ period, when the New York Yankees brought him back onto the
major-league scene after a 120-day suspension. He batted .327 in
what remained of last year's regular season, then went on to play
in the 1999 World Series, batting .333 there.
</P>
<P>
   Life was sweet again. The cancer was gone, the fans loved him,
his talent was obvious, he was playing for likely the greatest
baseball team of all time. Why then a test of positive for cocaine
just prior to the start of spring training?
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to ask Strawberry. He is his own worst enemy. He is
his own sickness.

   These are just two of many satisfied editors who have published
``The Caldwell Journals,'' an account of major moments in the
civil-rights movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell, the nationally
acclaimed black journalist whose early career was shaped by that
dynamic era.
</P>
<P>
   The series is available exclusively from The New York Times
Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, a former New York Times reporter, writes about
Americans, black and white, during a time that transformed
attitudes about race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the National Association of Black Journalists presented
Caldwell with its President's Award, saying his record of
professional achievement made him ``one of the most important
journalists in the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell is currently a writer-in-residence at the Robert C.

<P>
   &UR; PART 1: HERE COMES BOLL WEEVIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 2: HARLEM _ THE COLONY CONVERGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell recounts the riots in Harlem that came
about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black
colleagues are at the center of it. The doors have opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 3: MALCOLM X &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Malcolm X accepts an invitation to address a
black church in Rochester. Despite speculation that the speech will
be canceled, he arrives on Feb. 16. Caldwell recounts Malcolm X's
moving speech. However, through most of the hour, the civil-rights
activist cites example after example of how the press is used
against black people. People stand up and shout their approval.
Caldwell realizes that he can't go to Malcolm X's hotel later with
the others. Caldwell fears the meeting will be a ``get the press''
session. Five days later, on Feb. 21, Caldwell is at work at his
newspaper when the shocking news hits the headlines: Malcolm X was
killed just as he started to deliver a speech at the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem. ``For me, the lesson driven home was that a
reporter's job required toughness and that journalism was not the
place for the easily embarrassed or intimidated,'' Caldwell writes.
``I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 4: WHITE REPORTERS OUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X is shot, two reporters
are right up in front in the Audubon Ballroom, so close to the
podium that when the shooting starts, they have to dive to the
floor for cover. The journalists: Stan Scott and Gene Simpson. How
they got into the ballroom that afternoon played large part in
ushering in a whole new era for reporters who are black. This is
their story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 5: BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell is now working for the Herald Tribune
and is witnessing what he calls ``the black consciousness
movement.'' Editors want reporters to literally camp out in Harlem
and the other black areas of the city to report and write about
what is taking place. Caldwell gets the assignment and is
overwhelmed by what he witnesses. ``A massive redefinition of self
was taking place in the ghettos,'' he writes. ``Very little went
unchallenged. And at the core was an unprecedented embracing of
blackness.''

   &UR; PART 1: HERE COMES BOLL WEEVIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 2: HARLEM _ THE COLONY CONVERGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell recounts the riots in Harlem that came
about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black
colleagues are at the center of it. The doors have opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 3: MALCOLM X &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Malcolm X accepts an invitation to address a
black church in Rochester. Despite speculation that the speech will
be canceled, he arrives on Feb. 16. Caldwell recounts Malcolm X's
moving speech. However, through most of the hour, the civil-rights
activist cites example after example of how the press is used
against black people. People stand up and shout their approval.
Caldwell realizes that he can't go to Malcolm X's hotel later with
the others. Caldwell fears the meeting will be a ``get the press''
session. Five days later, on Feb. 21, Caldwell is at work at his
newspaper when the shocking news hits the headlines: Malcolm X was
killed just as he started to deliver a speech at the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem. ``For me, the lesson driven home was that a
reporter's job required toughness and that journalism was not the
place for the easily embarrassed or intimidated,'' Caldwell writes.
``I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 4: WHITE REPORTERS OUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X is shot, two reporters
are right up in front in the Audubon Ballroom, so close to the
podium that when the shooting starts, they have to dive to the
floor for cover. The journalists: Stan Scott and Gene Simpson. How
they got into the ballroom that afternoon played large part in
ushering in a whole new era for reporters who are black. This is
their story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 5: BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell is now working for the Herald Tribune
and is witnessing what he calls ``the black consciousness
movement.'' Editors want reporters to literally camp out in Harlem
and the other black areas of the city to report and write about
what is taking place. Caldwell gets the assignment and is
overwhelmed by what he witnesses. ``A massive redefinition of self
was taking place in the ghettos,'' he writes. ``Very little went
unchallenged. And at the core was an unprecedented embracing of
blackness.''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester,
N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the fall of 1963,
he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his first assignment
for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks, housing was the
biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the Herald Tribune for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin.
Lewis had been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the
exploding story of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to
literally camp out in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York
to report and write about what was taking place. A white reporter
could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name that
African nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant hair groomed and worn
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

 &HT;    That's what I like about the South
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ After 135 years, you would think the North and
South would have been able to put aside the differences that split
a nation asunder and get back to the important issues of the day.
Like what's new on the Victoria Secrets Web page.
</P>
<P>
   And while we can all agree that there are some remarkable things
being done with lace and underwire, there still remains
philosophical and cultural distinctions between the northern and
southern regions of the country that may never be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of trying to make all conform to a
``one-size-fits-all'' mentality, we should instead be lifting and
separating the two.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to an e-mail I received that points out the
irreconcilable differences between the North and South:
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has sun-dried toe-mah-toes. The South has 'mater
samiches.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has coffee houses. The South has waffle houses.
</P>
<P>
   _The North has switchblade knives. The South has press-on nails.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has double last names. The South has double first
names.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has Ted Kennedy. The South has Jesse Helms.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has the mafia. The South has the klan.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has Indy car races. The South has stock car races.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has Cream of Wheat. The South has grits.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has green salads. The South has collard greens.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has lobsters. The South has crawdads.
</P>
<P>
   _ The North has the rust belt. The South has the Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   And here's some advice for Northerners planning to move to the
South:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same
store. Don't buy food at this store.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get used to hearing ``You ain't from round here, are ya?''
</P>
<P>
   _ You may hear a Southerner say ``Ought!'' to a dog or child.
This is short for ``Ya'll ought not do that!'' and is the
equivalent of saying ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   _ The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted
Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective ``big'ol,'' truck or
``big'ol'' boy. Most Northerners begin their Southern-influenced
dialect this way.
</P>
<P>
   _ If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the
smallest accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the
local grocery store. It doesn't matter whether you need anything or
not. You just have to go there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not be surprised to find that 10-year-olds own their own
shotguns, they are proficient marksmen, and their mammas taught
them how to aim.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the South, we have found that the best way to grow a lush
green lawn is to pour gravel on it and call it a driveway.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you do settle in the South and bear children, don't think
we will accept them as Southerners. After all, if the cat had
kittens in the oven, we wouldn't call 'em biscuits.

 &HT;    Bush works to mend ties with minority voters
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eight months after launching a campaign he hoped
would attract minority voters to the Republican Party in droves,
George W. Bush on Tuesday felt compelled to make it clear that he
is opposed to bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make it crystal clear to folks here and across America:
``I reject bigotry. I reject prejudice. I repudiate
anti-Catholicism. I reject the politics of those who try to pit one
group of Americans against another,'' Bush said as his defeat in
Tuesday's Michigan primary became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The self-styled ``compassionate conservative'' surely hoped that
by now his dedication to diversity _ an integral part of his Texas
image and one of the qualities that made him such an attractive
presidential candidate to the Republican establishment _ would be
unquestioned. Unfortunately for him, it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance two weeks ago at Bob Jones University, a
fundamentalist school that bans interracial dating and is
anti-Catholic, may have alienated a substantial number of minority
voters and moderates. Speaking at the school could have contributed
to Bush's Michigan defeat, observers there said, and the Bob Jones
issue likely will persist as a problem for him in upcoming
primaries and in the general election, if he wins the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions he took in South Carolina just remind
African-Americans that the Republican Party has been on this course
since Reagan's days,'' said Hanes Walton, a political scientist at
the University of Michigan who studies race in politics. ``You
can't make inroads when your rhetoric appears to be simply
rhetoric, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor often talks about bringing minorities, who
traditionally vote Democratic, into the GOP fold. Republican Party
leaders were impressed that Bush got 49 percent of the Hispanic
vote and 27 percent of the African-American vote in his 1998
re-election bid. In contrast, only 21 percent of Texas Hispanics
and 12 percent of blacks voted for GOP candidate Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   They were thrilled when he spoke Spanish on the stump and touted
the rising test scores of minority students in Texas during his
tenure. In contrast to recent GOP presidential candidates, Bush
frequently campaigns in minority areas, and surrounds himself with
African-Americans and Hispanics during media-friendly events. Such
gestures are designed to send a message of inclusiveness not only
to minorities, but to swing voters who have been repelled by what
they see as the intolerance of the Republican right.
</P>
<P>
   But after his lopsided defeat to Republican rival John McCain in
the New Hampshire primary, Bush came into South Carolina desperate
for a victory. Speaking at Bob Jones a day after that stunning
rebuke, Bush played up his pro-life credentials and made it clear
that reaching out to the religious right would be a critical part
of his South Carolina strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked. The national media and the Democrats
slammed Bush for appearing at Bob Jones, but he won South
Carolina's GOP primary in large part because he got two-thirds of
the religious conservative vote. Without it, he would have lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked about interracial dating, I didn't hesitate to say,
'Of course I don't accept their policy.' But I didn't go to accept
their policy. I wanted them to accept my policy. That's why I went
to give the speech,'' Bush said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also notes that the school has been a frequent stop for
politicians, including Ronald Reagan and South Carolina's
Democratic governor.
</P>
<P>
   But what is smart politics in a South Carolina GOP contest
doesn't necessarily play well in the rest of the country. In
Michigan, which has a large Catholic population, McCain made sure
to remind voters of Bush's Bob Jones appearance. McCain wasn't
invited to speak at the school, but he said if had been he would
have used the opportunity to criticize its policies.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear how many voters in the Michigan primary, more
than half of whom were independents and Democrats, were influenced
by the Bob Jones issue. More than 1.3 million people voted in
Michigan, up from 524,161 in 1996. Bill Ballenger, who publishes a
respected newsletter on Michigan politics, said he doubts it was a
major factor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's African-American and Hispanic supporters said
this week that while they were troubled by Bush's speech at Bob
Jones, they don't doubt the governor's dedication to racial and
religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have advised him not to go there, being
Catholic myself. However, I don't see that as an anti-Catholic
stand by a long shot,'' said Miguel Berrios, a probation and parole
manager for the Michigan Department of Corrections who organized
Bush's Hispanic supporters in the western part of that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were an endorsement, I would be livid. But it's not an
endorsement of that philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. LaMar Lemmons of Detroit, who urged Democrats to
vote for McCain to punish Bush ally Gov. John Engler for
eliminating Detroit's elected school board and its separate
criminal courts, said the Bob Jones issue boosted his efforts.
Lemmons said he got many phone calls from Catholics outside Detroit
who wanted to help his cause because of Bush's Bob Jones
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off as being an African-American-based group, but
as Bush did things in South Carolina we expanded throughout the
state,'' Lemmons said. ``It had a mobilizing effect.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bush campaign clearly was worried about being associated
with the anti-Catholic views of Bob Jones' leaders. On the day of
the primary, it sent out nine news releases with statements from
nine Republican governors, all of whom denounced the McCain
campaign for making phone calls to voters emphasizing the school's
anti-Catholic stance and noting that Bush had remained silent on
the issue while speaking there.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also may resonate in upcoming primaries in diverse,
moderate states such as New York and California. U.S. Rep. Peter
King (R-New York), who had endorsed Bush, switched to McCain as a
result of the Bob Jones speech. King is Catholic and represents a
heavily Catholic district.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, meanwhile, are salivating at the prospect of
bringing up Bob Jones in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is horrified by this kind of hatred. Why isn't George
Bush? A real leader challenges hatred and ignorance head on,
instead of tacitly endorsing it,'' Democratic National Committee
spokeswoman Jenny Backus said after Bush was grilled on the issue
on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives worry that Bush has handed the Democrats a
potent weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Arch-conservative talk radio host G. Gordon Liddy called Bush's
visit ``a very dumb move'' because many of the Reagan Democrats
that Bush hopes to attract are Catholic. And New York City Mayor
Rudy Giuliani, a Bush ally, said Bush should have boycotted the
university, or at least spoken out against its policies when he was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he made a mistake by doing it,'' Giuliani said. ``If
you're going to go there and they have this history, then if you
make that decision to do it then probably you should take on the
issue in some respect.''

 &HT;    Handshaking, baby-kissing season is in full swing
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ The political season has arrived in full
force, happily filling the newspaper with political ads (hey, I'm a
capitalist). Political signs have sprouted like fire ant mounds
after a rain, and candidates are making the rounds of pie suppers
and political forums. Suddenly politicians are showing up
everywhere more than two people are gathered, from ribbon cuttings
to Rotary Club meetings.
</P>
<P>
   This is as it should be. You get elected by talking to as many
people as you can and persuading them to vote for you. And in a
small town, it's easy enough to talk to someone running for office
and get some sense of whether this is someone who can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   For us in the newspaper business, election season is both
exhilarating and exhausting. It's akin to Christmas. There's a lot
of pre-holiday hoopla, but by the time the big day gets here,
you're ready for it to be over so you can take down the decorations
and get on with day-to-day life.
</P>
<P>
   We make endorsements at this newspaper, which means we have an
obligation to interview all the candidates in the contested races.
We conduct the interviews one-on-one sometimes, and other times we
ask all the candidates in a particular race to come in at the same
time for a mini-forum. Again, it's often fascinating but often
exhausting to talk to that many candidates and try to keep straight
who's running for what and why.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we make endorsements? It's simple. I believe a newspaper
has an obligation to take stands on local issues that affect our
readers. We do that all the time. What local issue has more effect
on our readers than who we elect to office? These are the folks,
after all, who make many of the major decisions that affect our
lives: how much we pay in taxes, what type of law enforcement we
have, how our schools are run and how justice is dispensed.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean we have any lock on wisdom. Far from it. I've
been involved in endorsing candidates in local races for 18 years
now, and there's a long list of folks who got the newspapers'
endorsement and ultimately turned out to be a poor fit for the job.
All we can do, and usually there are three to five people involved
in the decision-making process, is listen to the candidates, look
at the record, and decide who we think would be best at the job.
</P>
<P>
   Does getting the newspaper's endorsement help someone get
elected? I don't have a clue and don't care. We're not handicapping
a horse race. There have been several times where we've endorsed
someone who had no chance of winning and, sure enough, lost
handily. If I had a dollar for everyone who has told me they decide
who to vote for by picking the folks we don't endorse, I could
probably pay a semester's college tuition for one of my rug rats.
That's fine. We're not telling anyone how to vote, and despite what
the conspiracy theorists think, we don't have a political agenda.
All I care about is electing someone who's honest, competent and
willing to work with others. On the local level, I could give a fig
if that person is a Republican or Democrat. It simply doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of conspiracy theorists, I have to laugh when folks
think that because we devoted 2 inches more space to one candidate
than another, or someone's picture ran three columns wide, while
another was only two columns wide, that it's all part of grand plan
to elect someone we're backing. My stock answer: We're lucky to get
a newspaper out every day. We don't have the time or the
intelligence to run a conspiracy. What we do try to do is give
everyone an even shake, treat political events the same, and give
readers enough information to make an informed decision. All that
occurs separate and apart from how we decide who to endorse on the
editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   I do have one pet peeve that in interviews automatically serves
as a strike against someone running for office. Countless times,
I've heard a candidate for a position say that he hasn't looked at
the budget yet, but plans to study it just as soon as he gets in
office. To me, this is the equivalent of someone wanting to be an
airline pilot and saying he's planning on reading the flight manual
right after takeoff. Virtually everything done in government is
public record, from budgets to meeting minutes, correspondence and
everything else. Someone running for county commission, for
example, who hasn't even bothered to start attending commission
meetings is either supremely confident or arrogant. If you are
running for office, do your homework.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I feel better getting that off my chest. All complaining
aside, I still admire anyone who's willing to stick his or her neck
out and run for office. Thank goodness being an editor isn't an
elected position. Some days I'm not sure I could make the runoff.

 &HT;    Texas Independence Day celebrates state's mosaic
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From the outset, Jay Johnson's vision for a
March 2 celebration was more than just honoring a day. His idea was
to honor what Texas has become in the 164 years since it broke from
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall that Johnson, who owns an Austin construction
firm, took note last year that March 2, Texas Independence Day,
would often come and go with little notice. Enlisting the aid of a
small circle of friends that included Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos
(D-Austin), Johnson put together an organization called Celebrate
Texas. That group helped plan a parade down Congress Avenue and a
noon shindig on the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a white-knuckle flight because the idea had to take form
in a short period of time. February 1999 was a test of Johnson's
considerable energy.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the planning, however, Johnson stressed that the
holiday belonged to all Texans and worked hard to ensure that the
celebration was a true mosaic of the Lone Star State's many
different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   While that sounds good, pulling together a Texas celebration was
somewhat ticklish, given the darker side of the state's history.
Johnson, a native Austinite, was driven to the point of obsession
to reach out, to ensure that the celebration was one that reflected
the state today.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans are painfully aware of the state's
segregationist past and its impact on their lives today. To be
frank, there has always been some ambivalence in the Hispanic
community about March 2. Horror stories about past and present
discriminatory treatment of Texans of Mexican ancestry are
plentiful and vivid. There are some of us who know history well
enough to look askance at some of the characters of the 1836
revolution but also recognize that the government of Mexico at the
time was no treat either. Mexico then was run by a megalomaniacal
militarist who shredded the constitution of 1824 and who was not
highly regarded by Mexicans then or now.
</P>
<P>
   But the topper is this: It is our state, too. Tejanos are an
integral part of the state's past and future. Our muscle _
yesterday and today _ built the state, and our intellects help
shape its future.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this year as last, the parade and celebration at the
Capitol will once again be a picture of the state today. Johnson
picked ``Together we're Texas'' as both slogan and theme for the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's celebration reflected the slogan and the only
difference this year is one of scale. The event has grown. Music
for the Capitol celebration ranges from conjunto to gospel to jazz
to western swing.
</P>
<P>
   This year's parade has drawn 67 units so far and counting. It
will be one of the biggest parades in the city's history. Military
bands, high school bands, floats, riders on horseback including
Buffalo soldiers, charros and cowpokes of all shades have signed
on. Those on the ground will be joined by an airborne contingent of
50 aircraft _ everything from vintage airplanes operated by the
Confederate Air Force to helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a tired but happy camper last week as he surveyed
the interest and the enthusiasm of celebration participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a monster parade,'' Johnson said ``and the
ones in the parade are so excited (to be participating) that
they'll be dancing up Congress Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   The event aims to communicate ``present day values, about what's
good about being Texan.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, Johnson mused, there will be a day of permanent
reconciliation for Texans, but for now, he said, he'll settle for
March 2 ``as a day we can all be proud of, because together, we're
Texas.''

 &HT;    No shortage of holy figures to dictate truth to us, if allowed
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Though a bad week for holy men in the Middle East,
it was a promising one in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers took over Iran's parliament, intent on new liberties
and less unquestioned authority for people in beards.
</P>
<P>
   Should the effort succeed, it would further deplete the ranks of
the world's pure church-states, which include Afghanistan, Saudi
Arabia, the Vatican Republic and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   With Oklahoma in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to rush to the intellectually barren plain recently
claimed by the Kansas state school board, Oklahoma's state textbook
committee voted to reject five biology books.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Kansas board, which dropped evolution from its state
curriculum guidelines, the Oklahoma committee purged the textbooks
for promoting evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing some of the comments of the committee, it is
instructive to observe that though the influence of an ayatollah is
on the wane in Tehran, it is on the upswing in Oklahoma City in the
person of state school board member Laura Dobson. Granted, though
under the Islamic model a female ayatollah is akin to a Brahma bull
giving milk, Dobson appears hot for the title.
</P>
<P>
   When it was pointed out that assorted items she complained about
in textbooks pertained to national standards on which all students
are quizzed, she said, ``Our national science standards are
invalid. The national science standards are not scientific.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly what level of expertise Dobson has to make
such a statement. Maybe she's a Ph.D.'s Ph.D. More likely, she
doesn't believe what she doesn't want to believe, and that will be
that. It's her right. Is it her authority? An ayatollah's job is to
enforce faith as fact, and faith as orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, TV audience: Who wants to be an ayatollah?
</P>
<P>
   By now, those of us who understand the essential nature of the
state staying out of spiritual matters must acknowledge that some
people don't get it, won't get it, and won't give up.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the most learned Steve Forbes, running for president
until just recently. Not long ago in an Iowa classroom, Forbes
defended the notion of posting the Ten Commandments on school
walls, saying it's essentially an advertisement of who we are _ a
Christian nation, run by Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In schools, you should have an understanding of from whence we
came, and it starts with the Ten Commandments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went to a country that has the Muslim religion ... you
might expect to see the Koran there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Koran is not the basis of this civilization,'' said
Forbes, speaking of the American brand. ``The Ten Commandments
are.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a news flash.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment seems to pronounce the establishment of
religion off-limits. This guy running for president assumes the
First Amendment says, ``Congress shall adopt and enforce
Christianity. And those who resist shall burn in Hades.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, a bill to require the posting of the Ten
Commandments in public schools was pulled from the table after
passage by a state Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting concept, posting commands for students that
include ``honor the Sabbath'' (what, no pro football games?) and
``you shall have no Gods before me.''
</P>
<P>
   The question some students will ask is, ``Who is this `me' guy?
_ The principal? The football coach? The governor? Or some old lady
on the school board?''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, in a church-state, with laws which end all
uncertainty, which expel science when it conflicts with certainty,
and with torches and burning stakes to enforce the certainty, we
will be at no loss for holy people to light them.

 &HT;    Backstage `dressers' help models quick-change for runway shows
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time I'd finished talking with the backstage
dressers at the recent New York runway shows, I was thinking of
signing up myself. It looked like fun.
</P>
<P>
   These are folks who have normal day jobs but take time off for
Fashion Week because they love fashion and get a kick out of
working the shows. One dresser said she worked in the hair
department for the Broadway production of ``The Lion King.''
Another was a caterer.
</P>
<P>
   I was mistaken for a dresser one afternoon when I showed up at
the backstage check-in entrance wearing a black sweater and slacks
_ the dresser uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before a show begins, dressers are standing by racks of
clothing, making certain everything is in place. Each is assigned
to a specific model and must be familiar with the outfits and
accessories that model will wear. Often there's a Polaroid shot of
models in each outfit to consult. They get paid more, apparently,
if they also steam-press the clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Dressers often wear aprons filled with items they might need:
lint brush, shoe horn, safety pins, towelettes for removing marks
from a garment, sandpaper to scrape new-shoe soles so the models
don't slip.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Ashley, a nutrition consultant in New York, told me
working the shows is an exciting change of pace. ``I pick up
clients this way, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Out front, the models _ calm and collected _ saunter down the
runway. But the instant they're out of the audience's sight, they
fly to their dresser and scurry to get ready for their next
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, everything runs smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once for a Chanel show, one of my models lost her shoe on the
runway and was really upset about it,'' Ashley said. ``I told her
that she hadn't fallen and that she should just go back out there
as if nothing had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoes, she added, are always either too big or too small. ``We
pack them with tissue if they're big,'' she said.

 &HT;    Ohio woman takes on New York fashion world's bright lights, big
runways
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She shuffles the cards as proficiently as a Las Vegas
dealer, and the stakes can be just as high.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't see spades or clubs on the stiff white cards
Deborah Hughes holds as she races up and down the aisles of the
Bryant Park tent, stopping only long enough to place or switch
cards on chair seats as she goes.
</P>
<P>
   The deck she holds is a ``who's who'' of the fashion world, and
Hughes' expertise lies in knowing who goes where: editors from
Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, writers from The New York Times and The
Washington Post, executives from Bergdorf-Goodman and Saks Fifth
Avenue, celebrities who come to support their favorite designers. A
faux pas can be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like seating people for a dinner party,'' she explains.
``It's very time-consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 42, a former model and public-relations director for
designer Carolina Herrera, is a pro.
</P>
<P>
   The job is called ``front of house,'' and it's just one of the
demanding assignments the Dayton, Ohio, native regularly performs
as head of her own New York public relations firm. At the recent
``7th on Sixth'' Fashion Week of runway shows and parties, keeping
up with Hughes is like trying to catch a bird in flight. She and
her staff have major responsibilities for six events over one week,
including a New York City Opera Thrift Shop benefit, two magazine
launches and three runway shows.
</P>
<P>
   Most all-encompassing is the Douglas Hannant fashion show, for
which Hughes is producer. She oversees it all: models, hair and
makeup teams, control-room technicians, interviews, invitations and
seating.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before show time she's already on the run: racing between
last-minute conferences with lighting and sound specialists,
supervising the frenzy of photographers and television camera crews
flooding the small backstage area, where rows of models are being
made up and coiffed.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Hannant, calm under the circumstances, says he and
Hughes have been friends for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deborah is a three-dimensional person; she knows everything
about fashion, but there's nothing `surface' about her,'' says
Hannant. ``In fashion, there's not a lot of real people.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CONTROLLED CHAOS OF A
</P>
<P>
   RUNWAY SHOW
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in her uniform of snug black leather pants, jean jacket
and boots, Hughes kisses and hugs everyone who arrives backstage,
shepherding each to interviews with Hannant or with New York's most
renowned make-up artists or hair stylists, who are working on
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want a blackout before the finale?'' asks lighting
designer Gordon Link, who is playing with the red lights on the
runway when Hughes climbs into the control booth. ``What would you
like to see?''
</P>
<P>
   When Apollo 440's ``Stop the Rock'' comes through the sound
system full blast at rehearsal, Hughes throws her arm into the air
and begins to dance. ``I'm getting excited!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put Cosmo Girl next to Cosmopolitan, was that OK?'' asks a
staffer.
</P>
<P>
   As show time nears, she checks her watch. ``Four models aren't
here yet!'' she says. Because models rush from show to show during
Fashion Week, many arrive in the nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``First looks,'' Hughes shouts above the din when all are
accounted for, meaning it's time for models to don their first
outfits. If they dress too early, clothes will wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes signals her staff to let photographers take up positions
at the end of the runway. After rearranging and checking a giant
paper seating chart, the audience is let in.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone is seated, Hughes does a ``front row sweep'' to
see who's missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd wait for the editor of Women's Wear Daily, or The New
York Times, or a celebrity,'' she says. ``The magazine people can
always come to the showroom afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Lights dim and the show gets under way, with Hughes on a headset
in the control room, directing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go, go, go!'' she shrieks to Anton, her backstage staffer who
is sending each model onto the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy, energy, tell them to put a hole in the runway! Is
Jackie, ready? Octavia, go!,'' Hughes screams. ``Who's lining those
girls up? They're in the wrong order!''
</P>
<P>
   But out front, the industry's most professional models parade
down the runway in Hannant's elegant fashions, calm and
self-assured.
</P>
<P>
   `SORRY, YOU'RE NOT ON THE LIST'
</P>
<P>
   As the week progresses, Hughes also supervises ``front of
house'' arrangements for designers Marc Bauer and Jill Stuart and
juggles backstage interviews for another of her accounts, the
Internet site ibeauty.com. Among those who show up backstage are
rapper Lil' Kim, fashion commentator Elsa Klensch, singer Toni
Braxton and TV host Star Jones.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hughes' toughest assignments is saying ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage at the Jill Stuart show, she turns away a photographer
who won't stop hassling her. In the lobby of 30 Rockefeller Plaza
on Tuesday night, hordes attempt to get into the Visionaire
magazine party in the 65th floor Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four hundred are invited and 1,000 will try to come,'' Hughes
says. ``It's the hottest party in New York this week.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman says she's left her invitation in Paris. Another
claims she's related to the Renoir family. Someone else says he's
there to represent a boss who can't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes isn't swayed. ``Sorry, you're not on the list,'' she says
firmly, checking her big black notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, the party is swinging: There's a drag queen DJ and
four scantily clad, greased-up men dancing on giant boxes,
champagne is flowing and hundreds of fashion folks milling about _
all dressed to the hilt and hoping to attract the attention of
photographers and video crews.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, cigarette in hand, paces among them all, keeping a
watchful eye out for anyone who isn't wearing the denim armband
that guarantees admission to those who belong. This day won't end
for her until after 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the frenetic week, Hughes gets a chance to sit
down for a chat over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   She traces her interest in beauty and fashion back to the age of
3, when she stayed with her aunt, Pearl Fry, while her mother
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aunt had a beauty shop called Pearl's, and I always helped
her after my nap,'' she recalls. ``I'd sweep up the hair.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13, when Hughes was ``skinny and tall and all legs,'' she
signed up at Fashion 70, a local modeling school. She was also on
Rike's department store's Teen Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a model-of-the-year contest in New York at the
Waldorf Hotel and I entered it,'' she says. ``You were supposed to
be 16, and I won it the night before my 16th birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU CAN TAKE THE GIRL OUT OF DAYTON...
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a crown and fur coat, Hughes won $1,000 and a
slew of modeling offers. Accompanying her to the Waldorf was
classmate Gwen Scott. The two have remained best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives are totally different, but there isn't anything we
wouldn't do for one another,'' says Scott, a. realtor. She visits
Hughes regularly _ most often during Fashion Week or for Hughes'
birthday in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to live in her world when I'm there and she gets to live
in my world when she comes to Dayton,'' Scott says.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the modeling contest, Hughes moved to New York,
living with her agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home to Dayton every Friday and took my laundry,'' she
remembers. ``Everyone was nice in New York, but I was so naive and
trusting. A man on the street would tell me he lost his money and
I'd listen and believe him ... until I saw the same man telling
someone else the same story the next day!''
</P>
<P>
   At 18, Hughes moved to Europe, modeling and living in
Switzerland, Italy, Germany, France and England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most important part of my life,'' she says. ``I
learned so much and met such interesting people.''
</P>
<P>
   When she decided to stop modeling and move back to the United
States, she applied for a job with Carolina Herrera, a Venezuelan
designer who was launching her own line of fashions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, oh my God!'' exclaims Hughes when asked how Herrera
influenced her life. ``I learned so much from her, she is so
wonderful, and she was a huge influence on me and the nicest
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes began as a receptionist (''I made less in a week than I
had in an hour as a model''), then was promoted to director of
advertising and public relations, traveling throughout the world
with Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrities who ordered the designer's elegant
clothing was Jacquelyn Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to call me `Legs' because my legs are so long,''
Hughes says. ``She was very soft-spoken, always smiling, and we did
a lot of her clothes and Caroline's wedding dress.''
</P>
<P>
   When she felt it was time to move on, Hughes joined an old
friend, Kevin Krier, whose firm produces many New York fashion
events.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she started her own public-relations firm. Deborah
Hughes Inc. began in Hughes' apartment, has since moved to a
spacious New York loft and now employs five full-time staffers,
more during busy times such as Fashion Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never seems like a risk when I'm doing it,'' says Hughes,
who says she never sets goals, describes herself as very impatient,
and says she lives ``by the seat of her pants.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she knows instinctively when the time is right to make
a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have always supported my decisions,'' she says.
``I'm very lucky because my family gives me courage, strength and
support. My parents brought me up to believe I shouldn't be
dependent on someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   AWAY FROM THE FRENZY OF FASHION
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, she's dating another Daytonian but prefers not to
give his name. The two met at a party in New York. When the
gentleman said he was from Dayton, Hughes thought he was putting
her on.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, then what high school did you go to?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meadowdale,'' he responded, naming her alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, so what were the colors?'' she demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and gold!'' he said without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, sing the school song!'' said Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   He burst into: ``Meadowdale, oh Meadowdale, our hearts belong to
you...''
</P>
<P>
   They've been going together ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I like most about myself are things that came from
Dayton,'' she says. ``I'm fair and honest and compassionate towards
people. I try to help people who need help. And I'm always there
for my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she's intimately involved with the fashion and beauty
industries, Hughes is able to step back from it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are very addicted to fashion,'' she says, ``I
don't know exactly why ... but I'm glad they are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Deborah Hughes labels herself ``the worst shopper in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you the last time I bought something,'' she says.
``I'm happy in my jeans and T-shirt.''

 &HT;    Profiles of black couples at odds with media image
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On movie screens, black men often communicate with
violence. On television, black women rarely have anything good to
say about their men. With the occasional exception _ the recent
black ensemble comedy ``Best Man'' at theaters; the Huxtables on TV
_ the happily married black man and woman are seldom reflected in
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   First-time authors TaRessa and Calvin Stovall hope to change
that with their new book, ``A Love Supreme'' (Warner Books,
$23.95).
</P>
<P>
   Experienced in getting the word out _ Calvin, 46, is a longtime
journalist; TaRessa, 45, was media coordinator for the Children's
Defense Fund in Washington _ they networked and chatted up their
book idea all over the country. From the dozens of responses, they
selected 20 couples for candid snapshots. They are men and women
who love each other in many ways: in long-distance romances,
through prison walls or in spite of the walls they had built up
internally because of bad previous relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a proud papa,'' remarks Calvin. ``I feel like,
through these stories, we're offering the kind of inspiration and
information and hope people need to combat the overwhelmingly
negative portrayals in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may seem strange coming from the managing editor of the
Courier-Post newspaper in Cherry Hill, N.J., who worked at The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution in the early 1990s. But not in light
of the NAACP's recent battle with national television networks
about poor minority representation this past year. And just this
past month, Essence magazine dedicated a cover story to the lack of
black men in lead movie roles.
</P>
<P>
   Media images aside, declares Atlanta author and playwright Pearl
Cleage, the real lives that black Americans lead are enough to make
efforts such as ``A Love Supreme'' necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationships between black men and black women are almost
always terrible,'' says Cleage, who with husband Zaron W. Burnett
Jr. is one of three Atlanta couples profiled in the book. ``And I
qualify that by saying that a lot of our relationships are fraught
with lies. And disappointment. And a lot of abuse between people
who say they love each other. And oftentimes we're in such dire
circumstances as these that we forget what a vision of people in
love looks like. ... This (book) adds to the body of work that does
demonstrate the possibility of love.''
</P>
<P>
   And tot, ``A Love Supreme'' is a specific example of
something too few black men know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black men believe the more women you have, the greater lover
you are,'' says Burnett, director of the Just Us Theater Company in
southwest Atlanta. ``Page after page of this book prove that if you
can really make one person truly understand and love you, then you
have achieved great love.''
</P>
<P>
   And that comes across to any reader, notes Johnetta B. Cole,
former president of Spelman College. ``My only concern about this
book is that someone might misunderstand, and assume that this book
lifts above all other love stories the love story of black women
and men,'' says Cole, who is featured in ``A Love Supreme'' with
husband Arthur J. Robinson Jr., whom she's known since childhood.
``I deeply believe that all people have the capacity to truly love.
So I would like to see this book in the hands of every conceivable
combination _ racially, by class, by sexual orientation, by
physical ability and disability and by age. This is quite an
offering.''
</P>
<P>
   And clearly one that has affected its authors.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether writing ``the book'' about black love added
any pressure to their own relationship, TaRessa Stovall replies
playfully, ``We have no excuses now. No backing out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Calvin adds.
</P>
<P>
   A love indeed.

 &HT;    Book entitled `Name Dropping' not about what you think
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I mention the fact that John Kenneth Galbraith, the noted
Harvard-based economist and author, brought me a Coke one time
during my stay at Harvard some years back as Journalist in
Residence, it's what you call ``name dropping.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the name of Galbraith's new book, ``Name Dropping''
(Houghton Mifflin). Unlike most of his other books _ they number in
the 20s _ this new one isn't about economics or politics, not
specifically anyway. The subtitle om FDR On'' and it's a
chatty book about the famous people the Harvard economics professor
emeritus has been involved with professionally and personally
through the years. As the jacket blurb states, ``Drawing on a
lifetime of access to many of the greatest public figures,
Galbraith creates a rich and uniquely personal history of the
century _ a century he helped shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides President Franklin D. Roosevelt, before World War II and
during, Galbraith includes chapters on Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry
Truman, Adlai Stevenson, John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy and
other members of that remarkable family, India's Jawaharlal Nehru,
L.B.J., and others.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening chapter, ``On Name Dropping,'' Galbraith points
out that ``Books, like those who write them, have an unplanned life
of their own. The very act of writing has a controlling role. When
I started this book, I intended to describe the political
personality _ the personal and public traits that, as I saw them,
allowed the great leaders of our century influence or dominate the
political scene. There are still elements of this intention in the
pages that follow. But it faded as a central purpose. ``Instead, as
the work proceeded, there was more interest for the author, as I
trust there will be for the reader, in how great political figures
appeared to their contemporaries, of whom I was one. What did I
recall of personal encounters or public association with Franklin
Roosevelt, Eleanor, the Kennedys, Nehru and others? ...''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``Reminiscence and anecdote, as they tell of one's
meetings wit the great or the prominent, are an established form of
self-enhancement. They make known that one was there. This is not
my purpose; my aim is to inform and, perhaps, on occasion, to
entertain. The risk, nontheless, exists that critics who are less
than tolerant may sugest that I am indulging in name-dropping.
Hence the title of the book and that of this chapter. Nothing so
disarms a prosecutor as a prior confession of guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   The late columnist Murray Kempton once told me that he and
others regarded Adlai Stevenson as ``the government in exile.''
Galbraith seems to be one of those. He points out Stevenson's
weakness as a candidate as ``his most frequent and to many his most
endering political statement, often repeated, as 'I want to talk
sense to the American people.' Holding them to be intelligent, he
held that they were to be informed, not persuaded, and certainly
not by mindless rhetoric. Being intelligent and knowledgeable about
the issues, they would listen carefully, come to the right
conclusions and vote for him. Again, the reaction was different as
between Stevenson's immediate following and the public at large.
... All this shaped the form and content of the Stevenson
campaigns. With them I was closely inolved more so than in the case
of any other candidate, John F. Kennedy not excepted. The error of
our course I came only gradually (and reluctantly) to see.''
</P>
<P>
   And Galbraith expalins this error: ``After the 1952 campaign
Stevenson's speeches, much admired, were published in book form. He
sent me a copy. I was well represented therein, and I put it on a
shelf with my other writing. Looking at my contribution in later
years, I sensed the fatal flaw: I had written seeking the approval
of the candidate, his campaign acolytes and myself, not that of the
larger public, the electorate as a whole. So had the other
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer a mystery why Stevenson lost twice. But it would
be refreshing if some of that fatal flaw rubbed off on today's
candidates, of both parties.

 &HT;    Sex, lies and a quill pen
 &HT;    By Tom Blackburn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sex scandals involving politicians are
as old as the Republic. In the first big one, in 1797, Treasury
Secretary Alexander Hamilton confessed to adultery to squelch
rumors that he stole public money. The second, in 1803, was the
charge that President Thomas Jefferson had children with one of his
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The reputations of Jefferson and Hamilton survived. The
journalist who blew open both scandals was a Scotsman, James
Thomson Callender. His reputation didn't make it. History writes
him off as an acerbic scandalmonger who died drunk.
</P>
<P>
   History may write him off, but William Safire, the New York
Times columnist who delights in being contrarian, writes him back
into events in this novel with footnotes. Seeing as one columnist
is writing about another, Safire is sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The result may not be great fiction, but it's great fun. It
shows the Founding Fathers with their pants down: Jefferson schemes
like a Tammany boss with James Madison and James Monroe. Aaron
Burr, who really was a Tammany boss, looks out for himself.
Hamilton plots legal strategy for a libel case he is defending, and
the clerk of the House, John Beckley, is the original Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   The story encompasses the origins of the political party system
in America and the laying down of modern libel law. President John
Adams had signed the Alien and Sedition Laws, the former to deport
Callender and the latter to imprison him if the alien law didn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson objected to them both, until he became the target.
Then he unleashed state libel laws against the critics. In those
days, truth was no defense in a libel case.
</P>
<P>
   But worms turn. ``Even miserable miscreants like Callender,
(Hamilton) was forced to admit, served a public purpose in checking
a too-popular government's power.'' Safire himself couldn't have
admitted it better.
</P>
<P>
   Safire is smitten with one of Hamilton's favorite words:
contumelious. At one point, Hamilton uses it and a friend advises
him to pick a substitute more familiar to people. He picks
slanderous. It means something like ``deliberately humiliating.''
As a word maven, Safire wants it to make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   How much of history according to Safire is true? Not all, but
more than you might at first think.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dialogue is straight from the speakers' letters,
duly footnoted. In one of the best scenes, Burr intervenes to
prevent a duel between Monroe and Hamilton. There's a delicious
irony there, since later Burr would kill Hamilton in a duel. The
intervention didn't happen, but the footnote shows how it nearly
did.
</P>
<P>
   Safire's life of Maria Reynolds is more fully fleshed than
history allows. Mrs. Reynolds came on stage as alleged bait used by
her extortionist husband to catch Hamilton. In his pamphlet
defending himself, Hamilton blamed an affair with her for payments
he couldn't deny making to her husband. The suspicion was _
Callender had it, and Safire lets it hang _ that Hamilton and
Reynolds were dipping into the public till together.
</P>
<P>
   In history, Mrs. Reynolds disappears. But not in
``Scandalmonger.'' Safire posits an earlier affair between her and
Burr. Burr did, in fact, handle her divorce from Reynolds for no
fee. Safire brings her back to befriend Callender in his last years
and get direct evidence for him that Jefferson had once ``offered
love'' to the wife of Jefferson's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few things in ``Scandalmonger'' that didn't happen
(and the footnotes tell you what they are) but nothing that
couldn't have happened. The novel will be most fun to readers who
know a bit about the period because Safire, unconstrained by
documentary evidence in a work of fiction, is free to print the
contumelious rumors.
</P>
<P>
   But even if all one knows is what can be gleaned from the book,
the reader will be no more misled than visitors whose knowledge is
confined to the monuments and memorials.
</P>
<P>
   A great political novel? Not when compared to Robert Penn
Warren's ``All The King's Men.'' But ``Scandalmonger'' is much more
than just fun and games.

 &HT;    A distressing look inside American medicine
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Doctors tend to write alike: Beautifully
observed, descriptive, but absent emotion. They take it all in, but
they keep a clinical distance. The odd thing is that they do this
even when recollecting their experiences in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blood of Strangers'' is a seriously good book by an
emergency-room doctor named Frank Huyler. He works in Albuquerque,
but I'm sure his stories could derive from any metropolitan area of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The detachment works in Huyler's case because he's chosen to
narrate his book in brief, aphoristic, and for the most part
unrelated segments of five to seven pages apiece; he always cuts
away before he has to make some sort of emotional connection.
</P>
<P>
   Huyler is strongest when narrating the way things go subtly
awry. He respects the mystery of life just as much as he does the
mystery of death.
</P>
<P>
   There are no explanations here, just events and people, some of
them astonishing _ a superb female brain surgeon who would do a
couple of lines of coke every morning. When she'd had a really bad
day, she'd buy a live chicken, take it home and cut its throat with
a straight razor. (Relax. She washed out after a drug test lit up
like a fireworks display.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a short piece about suicides that's worthy of Lewis
Thomas, particularly a haunting suicide note Huyler came across:
``I'm driving,'' a woman wrote. ``Somewhere there will be a
train.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the woman who refuses to take her blood-thinner because
she believes in the Lord more than she does in medicine. She
quickly throws a clot and dies. At the autopsy, Huyler watches the
pathologist remove a clot the size of a thumb. The attending
physician bows his head and says the Lord's Prayer while the
pathologist shifts uncomfortably.
</P>
<P>
   I love his tale of a 26-year-old cowboy with pneumonia, renal
and respiratory failure, as well as other things indicating an
early demise. The comatose patient, Johnson by name, became a
teeter-totter over which two doctors exercised completely different
methodologies. One was rabidly proactive, demanding a full court
press to save Johnson's life, while the other was content to keep
the patient comfortable and out of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Huyler gets rotated out of the ICU. Six months later, he's
walking down the hallway when he passes a man reading a paper while
waiting for an appointment. It's Johnson, looking hale and hearty.
Did he live because of the proactive doctor's efforts, or in spite
of them? Huyler has no idea.
</P>
<P>
   There is three-in-the-morning desolation here, real-world
wisdom:
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, you come to rely, more than anything else, on
first sight. You walk into the room and you think, sick or not
sick. Not sick goes home as fast as possible. Sick you watch. You
draw blood, you order X-rays, you give them fluids. You are careful
because a little bell went off when you walked into the room and
saw them.''
</P>
<P>
   Huyler writes about a particularly pleasant patient who
specialized in killing convenience-store clerks. He was
unremittingly grateful every day of his hospitalization, even as
the cops kept watch outside the door so he couldn't get away and
kill somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad, even as weak as he was, that he meant me no harm,
that I was not ... alone in the store and unready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day I helped him get better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blood of Strangers'' takes you deep into the world of
medicine most patients can sense but would rather not confront _
fallible people, rotten odds, inferior protoplasm and exhausted
doctors trying to keep people alive when there's no reason they
should be.

 &HT;    A tour fit for a president
 &HT;    By Jan Tuckwood
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   ``He who fears no truth fears no lie.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Thomas Jefferson
</P>
<P>
   Well said, Mr. President, but how do we tell our kids the truth
about Sally Hemings?
</P>
<P>
   This is our quandary as we wait outside Monticello, home of our
third president, one of the smartest men who ever lived and, as it
turns out, one of the most fascinating, in that National Enquirer
sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson had at least one child and probably six with his slave
Sally,and now, even the people who run Monticello admit it.
</P>
<P>
   No shame, just facts. The rumor that's been bubbling for 200
years has been confirmed, and as every leader since Henry VIII
knows, nothing intrigues the masses like dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CBS aired its miniseries on Jefferson and Hemings'
38-year relationship, ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal.'' Last
month, the Monticello Foundation published its exhaustive report on
their affair, and since then, Monticello's publicity staff has been
deluged with demands from film crews worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Jefferson's one hot president.
</P>
<P>
   When my family visited Monticello last summer, there were
titters among folks waiting in line to see Jefferson's majestic
home: Hmmm, wonder how they'll handle the Hemings affair?
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take Jefferson's advice and go with the truth. The
DNA doesn't lie, I tell my three daughters, ages 17, 12 and 9.
Jefferson wrote ``all men are created equal,'' but he owned slaves,
and he had children with one of his slaves. That slave, Sally, was
the beautiful, pale-brown half-sister of Jefferson's dead wife,
Martha _ they had the same father.
</P>
<P>
   Sordid as it may sound, that's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, too young to grasp the hypocrisy, seemed impressed.
Wow, he did all that and invented the swivel chair, too!
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's human foibles made him more real to them.
</P>
<P>
   Before we were done, our Meet the Presidents Tour of
Charlottesville, Va., and Washington, D.C., hit the grandest,
grittiest and goriest spots to help bring Jefferson and his friends
alive for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that pieces of President Lincoln's skull are on
display in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   We discovered that, too.
</P>
<P>
   MEET THE PRESIDENTS TOUR
</P>
<P>
   Washington came first, but Jefferson makes a more lasting
impression.
</P>
<P>
   That's what my children decided after our Meet the Presidents
Tour of Washington, D.C., and Charlottesville, Va., last summer.
Our goal: Put some flesh and blood on the founding fathers by
seeing how they lived and how they died.
</P>
<P>
   Before this trip, my kids' knowledge of George and Thomas was as
flimsy as an old dollar bill. Jefferson was basically just that guy
on the nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Did they know that he was 6-feet-2 and bony with uncommonly long
limbs and hands?
</P>
<P>
   Or that his handwriting was so precise that he could record a
whole day's activities on a palm-size ivory tablet?
</P>
<P>
   Or that he soaked his big feet in cold water every morning for
60 years and believed this kept him healthy?
</P>
<P>
   Did they know that he had a long affair with one of his slaves?
</P>
<P>
   No, they had no idea until we visited Monticello, Jefferson's
home outside Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   Kids usually find homes of dead presidents boring. Sorry,
George, but mine found Mount Vernon underwhelming. They even
dismissed the White House as ``a bunch of colorful rooms with old
paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   But they liked Jefferson's gadgets, and they became fascinated
with his graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Tip for parents: Graveyards give kids the creeps and therefore
hold them in thrall.
</P>
<P>
   We visited Monticello in August, when it was very hot and very
crowded. After taking a shuttle bus from the welcome station up to
Jefferson's ``little mountain,'' we were told to return in an hour
for our guided tour of the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   We had plenty of time to wander the grounds, and we wisely chose
to walk along Mulberry Row, where the slaves lived, down a
half-mile path to the family graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   My children, ages 17, 12 and 9, studied every gravestone they
could read through the massive iron gates.
</P>
<P>
   There was Martha Jefferson Randolph's dead baby. And Dabney
Carr, Jefferson's boyhood friend, who had made Jefferson promise to
bury him under their favorite oak tree. And Jefferson's own
obelisk-shaped stone, inscribed according to his instructions:
``Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, Author of the Declaration of
American Independence, Of the Statute of Virginia for Religious
Freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   There were newer graves, too, one just six months old. This is
where Jeffersons still come to be buried, and now, this cemetery is
the focus of controversy: Shouldn't Sally Hemings' descendants be
buried here, too?
</P>
<P>
   Hemings, the slave whose long-time affair with Jefferson
produced at least one child and probably six, is portrayed in
modern movies as gorgeous and pale, and, based on what historians
know, that's probably correct.
</P>
<P>
   Monticello slave Isaac Jefferson once recalled Sally as ``mighty
near white ... very handsome, long straight hair down her back.''
Jefferson's grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph described her as
``light colored and decidedly good looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally's four children who survived to adulthood, three boys and
a girl, had an indisputable resemblance to Jefferson and passed
into white society. But what's more, the DNA of her youngest son,
Eston, matches the DNA of other Jefferson males. And a thorough
study of Jefferson's whereabouts during the conception of the
children adds to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was at Monticello when all six of Sally's children
were conceived. Given how much Jefferson traveled, the chance is
just 1 percent that his presence was a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was love or lust, rape or romance, no one knows,
and it's unlikely that anyone will ever know,'' said Daniel Jordan,
president of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which runs
Monticello, when the foundation's report concluding that Jefferson
fathered the Hemings children was released Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of glossing over the bumps in Jefferson's character,
Monticello's guardians took Jefferson's words to heart: ``Follow
truth wherever it may lead.''
</P>
<P>
   This frankness makes Monticello more than your typical rich
man's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Traditions of slave life are celebrated alongside the triumphs
of Jefferson's presidency, and by showing visitors the whole
picture, politically correct or not, the history lesson sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Reverence puts kids to sleep, but quirkiness delights them.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas Jefferson was one quirky fellow.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE MONTICELLO: HOME OF A GREAT MIND
</P>
<P>
   Tip for all who visit Monticello: Prepare to feel like a stupid,
lazy underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Mr. Jefferson, you are, you most certainly are.
</P>
<P>
   As one of my children commented, ``People sure got a lot done
before they had TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Jefferson got this much done, kids. That was a guy who used
both sides of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Monticello, which Jefferson began building in 1769 when he was
26, is full of his inventions, and all of his creative tinkering
served a useful purpose.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly fond of things that turned, such as swivel
chairs, revolving bookstands that could hold several books at once,
and closets with moving prongs to hold coats and shirts.
</P>
<P>
   These gizmos, plus Jefferson's space-saving devices _ his own
bed was tucked into an alcove to save space and all the staircases
in the house are narrow for the same reason _ gave us good reason
to poke our heads into every nook of Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson designed a Great Clock for the entrance hall that uses
a system of weights and chains to tell the time and day, from
Sunday near the ceiling on down through the week. Trouble was,
Jefferson ran out of room for the whole week, so he cut a hole in
the floor and put Saturday in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Time was of the essence to Jefferson, who rose with the sun
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Determine never to be idle,'' he wrote to his daughter Martha
in 1787. ``No person will have occasion to complain of the want of
time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if
we are always doing.''
</P>
<P>
   We spent several hours doing Monticello, inspecting the gardens,
the slaves' dwellings, the stables and the wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
   The kids pronounced it ``about a hundred times neater than Mount
Vernon,'' and let's face it: Washington was the father of our
country, but Jefferson, scandal and all, was a more interesting
man.
</P>
<P>
   MONTPELIER AND ASH LAWN-HIGHLAND: THE PRESIDENTS NEXT DOOR
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson loved the company of James Madison, our fourth
president, even though most people found ``the great little
Madison'' rather serious and colorless.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why somber Madison chose such a cheerful shade of
yellow for his lifelong home, Montpelier.
</P>
<P>
   Montpelier is off Route 20 in Orange, Va., about 30 minutes
north of Monticello. It attracts fewer tourists than the 2,000 that
flock to Monticello every summer day, but it's every bit as
beautiful, if not as quirky.
</P>
<P>
   With its stunning view of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Montpelier's
``a squirrel's jump from heaven,'' as Madison liked to say. Madison
was a little man (5-foot-2 according to his enemies and 5-foot-6
according to himself) with a big mind. He was 36 when he wrote the
U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   My kids were on mansion overload when we drove by Montpelier,
and a real tour of the place would have prompted a family mutiny.
Same with Ash Lawn-Highland, home of our fifth president and
Jefferson pal, James Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   No offense, James, but Ash Lawn-Highland looks more like
Monticello's country cousin than a mansion. It's a 535-acre estate
with the atmosphere of a working plantation, including cattle,
sheep and peacocks in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The real character among this circle of friends was Dolley
Madison, who was the first presidential partner to be called the
first lady. She also was first to serve ice cream at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   BARBOURSVILLE RUINS: THE GHOST HOUSE OF A GOVERNOR
</P>
<P>
   We did stop by the home of another Jefferson friend, James
Barbour, governor of Virginia from 1812 to 1814.

<P>
   Barbour's home is believed to be the only building designed by
Thomas Jefferson in Orange County, Va., but visitors today get just
a glimpse of the mansion's former grandeur: Since Christmas Day
1884, it's been a burnt-out shell of a home, a ghost house with
crumbling walls and mysterious memories.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Barboursville Ruins is a historic landmark set amid
830 acres of rolling hills that's now home to a premiere vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   We tasted some of the Barboursville wines, picked up a nice
bottle of Pinot Grigot and then toured the ruins. The kids spent an
hour wandering through the rooms of the destroyed house, which
reminded us of Twelve Oaks after the Civil War in ``Gone With the
Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   On summer nights, the genteel Southern accents of Barbour's time
are replaced by the British lilt of the bard. Shakespeare's
comedies are performed under the stars at the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Mr. Jefferson and the ``society of our taste'' that he
formed with Madison, Monroe and Barbour would approve.
</P>
<P>
   They shared a love of the arts, but they loved their Virginia
countryside and their new country even more.
</P>
<P>
   As Jefferson wrote in 1824: ``Our revolution ... presented us an
album on which we were free to write what we pleased. We had no
occasion ... to investigate the laws and institutions of the
semi-barbarous ancestry. We appealed to those of nature, and found
them engraved on our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU KNOW. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Mount Vernon, George Washington's home on the Potomac River
and a short drive outside Washington, D.C., is the nation's most
visited historic home, with more than 1 million guests a year.
(Elvis Presley's Graceland in Memphis, Tenn., attracts about
750,000.) To learn more about Mount Vernon, see
www.mountvernon.org. If you go in the summer, get there early.
Admission: $9 for adults, $4.50 for children 6 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   _ The neatest thing inside Mount Vernon is Washington's bed,
where he died of quinsy (a really bad infection of the tonsils) in
1799 after getting several bleedings from his doctors.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Derringer pistol that John Wilkes Booth used to kill
President Lincoln is on display at the Ford's Theatre Museum in
Washington, D.C. So are Lincoln's clothes from that night and the
ropes used to hang the conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lincoln's blood-stained pillow can be seen at the Peterson
House, across the street from Ford's Theatre. To learn more about
Ford's Theatre and Lincoln's death, see www.nps.gov/foth/.
</P>
<P>
   _ A fragment of Lincoln's skull and the bullet that killed him
are on display at the Walter Reed Army Medical Museum in
Washington, D.C. So are pieces of vertebrae from John Wilkes Booth.
The museum, at Elder and Georgia Avenue NW, is open 10 to 5 daily.
Phone: (202) 782-2200.
</P>
<P>
   _ President Lincoln's 1865 assassination was not the only
tragedy at Ford's Theatre. In 1893, all three floors of the theater
collapsed, killing 22 federal workers. The restored theater opened
in 1968. Admission is free, but call ahead because the working
theater is closed during show performances.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Before you visit Monticello, stop by the Monticello Visitor's
Center nearby. A video on Jefferson's life is shown throughout the
day, and a large free exhibit of Jefferson's belongings (clothes,
glasses, papers) provides a personal look at the man. The excellent
Monticello web site (www.monticello.org) features the new detailed
report on the Jefferson-Hemings affair and a complete Jefferson
history. Admission to Monticello is $11 for adults, $6 for children
6 to 11, and includes a 30-minute guided tour of the home.
</P>
<P>
   _ University of Virginia, designed by Jefferson, is in downtown
Charlottesville and worth a tour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take the scenic Route 20 south from Orange, Va., to
Charlottesville to see Montpelier and the Barboursville Ruins.
Check out their websites at www.montpelier.org and
barboursvillewine.com. A self-guided tour of the ruins is free.
Wine tastings are $3 per person including a souvenir glass.
Admission to Montpelier is $7.50 for adults and $3.50 for children
6 to 11.

certain everything is in place. (Moss, Dayton Daily News). MOVED

   NYFASHION-PRODUCER _ She shuffles the cards as proficiently as a
Las Vegas dealer and the stakes can be just as high. You won't see
spades or clubs on the stiff white cards Deborah Hughes holds as
she races up and down the aisles of a Bryant Park tent, stopping
only long enough to place or switch cards on chair seats as she
goes. The deck she holds is a ``who's who'' of the fashion world
and Hughes' expertise lies in knowing who should sit where: editors
from Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, writers from The New York Times and
The Washington Post, executives from Bergdorf-Goodman and Saks
Fifth Avenue, celebrities who come to support their favorite
designers. A faux pas can be disastrous. Hughes, 42, a former model
and public relations director for designer Carolina Herrera, is a
pro. (Moss, Dayton Daily News).50. MOVED

   MOVIES-DIGITAL _ PARK CITY, Utah _ On the surface, Chuck Collins
doesn't appear to be a movie industry mover and shaker. But
Collins, 44, is on a mission from Kennesaw to remake Hollywood.
It's one day before the start of the Sundance Film Festival, Robert
Redford's annual celebration of independent movies, which ended
Jan. 30, and Collins has traveled the nearly 2,000 miles here from
Atlanta to represent Cobb County's Digital Projection Inc. As DPI's
national market development manager, Collins is overseeing the
installation of roughly $1 million in cutting-edge projection
equipment that Sundance ultimately used to screen about 17 of its
112 films. The demonstration's ultimate impact portends to the
coming digital visual age in Hollywood. We report on Hollywood's
pending change to digital visuals, the controversy among filmmakers
and how the switch may alter what's shown at your local movieplex.

   REVIEW-WONDERBOYS _ Movie review of the ``Wonder Boys.'' The
Wonder Boys are actually Wunderkinds, which a German-English

for, in different ways, these guys are a couple of pipsqueaks. They
can't even dispose of a dead dog. Three stars. (Schwan, Palm Beach
Post). 15.

<P>
   MOVIES-MRDEATH _ A review of ``Mr. Death.'' 3 stars. Eccentric
documentarian Errol Morris (``The Thin Blue Line'') studies one

Holocaust-denial ``expert.'' (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman).

   BOOK-NOTES _ Until he was touched by an Oprah, North Carolina
native Robert Morgan was happy to sell 10,000 copies of his novels.
So far, ``Gap Creek'' has sold more than 600,000 since the author's
apperance on Winfrey's book club. Not bad for a high-school dropout
who grew up in a family who didn't own a car or a TV set and who
didn't see his first movie until he was 17. In other news,
Amazon.com has combined with PEN to launch another book award for
short-story writing with a $10,000 prize. (O'Briant, Atlanta

   BOOKS-LOVESUPREME _ Former Atlantans TaRessa and Calvin
Stovall's first book, ``A Love Supreme,'' is about a love barely
acknowledged in the media: that between married black men and
women. We talk to the authors, playwright Pearl Cleage and former
Spelman College president Johnnetta B. Cole - who are featured with
their husbands in the book _ as well as Atlanta couples at the
local signing about the need for such an effort. Not just for black
people's benefit, but the general public's consideration.
(SoMurray, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED.

<P>
   BOOKS-MILNER _ Jay Milner's review of Kenneth Galbraith's ``Name
Dropping'' (Houghton Mifflin). (Milner, Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MILNER-COLUMN _ When I mention that John Kenneth Galbraith, the
noted Harvard-based economist and author, brought me a Coke one
time during my stay at Harvard some years back as Journalist in
Residence, it's what you call ``name dropping.'' That's the name of
Galbraith's new book, ``Name Dropping'' (Houghton Mifflin). Unlike
most of his other books _ they number in the 20s _ this new
Galbraith book isn't about economics or politics, not specifically
anyway. The subtitle is ``From FDR On'' and it's a chatty book
about the famous people the Harvard economics professor emeritus
has been involved with professionally and personally through the
years. As the jacket blurb states, ``Drawing on a lifetime of
access to many of the greatest public figures, Galbraith creates a
rich and uniquely personal history of the century _ a century he
helped shape.'' (Milner, Cox News Service). 20.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-SCANDALMONGER _ The reputations of former Presidents
Jefferson and Hamilton survived. The journalist who blew open both
scandals was a Scotsman, James Thomson Callender. His reputation
didn't make it. History writes him off as an acerbic scandalmonger
who died drunk. History may write him off, but William Safire, the
New York Times columnist who delights in being contrarian, writes
him back into events in this novel with footnotes. Seeing as one
columnist is writing about another, Safire is sympathetic.
(Blackburn, Palm Beach Post) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   EYMAN-ON-BOOKS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Doctors tend to write
alike: Beautifully observed, descriptive, but absent emotion. They
take it all in, but they keep a clinical distance. The odd thing is
that they do this even when recollecting their experiences in
print. ``The Blood of Strangers'' is a seriously good book by an
emergency-room doctor named Frank Huyler. He works in Albuquerque,
but I'm sure his stories could derive from any metropolitan area of
America. (Eyman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED

   NYFASHION-PRODUCER _ She shuffles the cards as proficiently as a
Las Vegas dealer and the stakes can be just as high. You won't see
spades or clubs on the stiff white cards Deborah Hughes holds as
she races up and down the aisles of a Bryant Park tent, stopping
only long enough to place or switch cards on chair seats as she
goes. The deck she holds is a ``who's who'' of the fashion world
and Hughes' expertise lies in knowing who should sit where: editors
from Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, writers from The New York Times and
The Washington Post, executives from Bergdorf-Goodman and Saks
Fifth Avenue, celebrities who come to support their favorite
designers. A faux pas can be disastrous. Hughes, 42, a former model
and public relations director for designer Carolina Herrera, is a
pro. (Moss, Dayton Daily News).50. MOVED

   MOVIES-DIGITAL _ PARK CITY, Utah _ On the surface, Chuck Collins
doesn't appear to be a movie industry mover and shaker. But
Collins, 44, is on a mission from Kennesaw to remake Hollywood.
It's one day before the start of the Sundance Film Festival, Robert
Redford's annual celebration of independent movies, which ended
Jan. 30, and Collins has traveled the nearly 2,000 miles here from
Atlanta to represent Cobb County's Digital Projection Inc. As DPI's
national market development manager, Collins is overseeing the
installation of roughly $1 million in cutting-edge projection
equipment that Sundance ultimately used to screen about 17 of its
112 films. The demonstration's ultimate impact portends to the
coming digital visual age in Hollywood. We report on Hollywood's
pending change to digital visuals, the controversy among filmmakers
and how the switch may alter what's shown at your local movieplex.

   REVIEW-WONDERBOYS _ Movie review of the ``Wonder Boys.'' The
Wonder Boys are actually Wunderkinds, which a German-English
dictionary translates as ``infant prodigies.'' Infant is perfect,
for, in different ways, these guys are a couple of pipsqueaks. They
can't even dispose of a dead dog. Three stars. (Schwan, Palm Beach
Post). 15.

   MOVIES-MRDEATH _ A review of ``Mr. Death.'' 3 stars. Eccentric
documentarian Errol Morris (``The Thin Blue Line'') studies one

Holocaust-denial ``expert.'' (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman).

   REVIEW-REINDEER _ A review of ``Reindeer Games.'' 2 stars. A

   MOVIES-SIMPATICO _ A review of ``Simpatico.'' 3 stars. Racetrack

Bridges, Sharon Stone star in this adaptation of the Sam Shepard
play. (Macor, Austin American-Statesman). 13.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-REARWINDOW _ A look at the restored ``Rear Window,''
Hitchcock's supreme paean to the voyeuristic soul of the movie
experience. James Stewart and Grace Kelly were at their finest in
this masterful 1954 thriller. (Macor, Austin American-Statesman).

   BOOK-NOTES _ Until he was touched by an Oprah, North Carolina
native Robert Morgan was happy to sell 10,000 copies of his novels.
So far, ``Gap Creek'' has sold more than 600,000 since the author's
apperance on Winfrey's book club. Not bad for a high-school dropout
who grew up in a family who didn't own a car or a TV set and who
didn't see his first movie until he was 17. In other news,
Amazon.com has combined with PEN to launch another book award for
short-story writing with a $10,000 prize. (O'Briant, Atlanta

   BOOKS-LOVESUPREME _ Former Atlantans TaRessa and Calvin
Stovall's first book, ``A Love Supreme,'' is about a love barely
acknowledged in the media: that between married black men and
women. We talk to the authors, playwright Pearl Cleage and former
Spelman College president Johnnetta B. Cole - who are featured with
their husbands in the book _ as well as Atlanta couples at the
local signing about the need for such an effort. Not just for black
people's benefit, but the general public's consideration.

   BOOKS-MILNER _ Jay Milner's review of Kenneth Galbraith's ``Name
Dropping'' (Houghton Mifflin). (Milner, Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MILNER-COLUMN _ When I mention that John Kenneth Galbraith, the
noted Harvard-based economist and author, brought me a Coke one
time during my stay at Harvard some years back as Journalist in
Residence, it's what you call ``name dropping.'' That's the name of
Galbraith's new book, ``Name Dropping'' (Houghton Mifflin). Unlike
most of his other books _ they number in the 20s _ this new
Galbraith book isn't about economics or politics, not specifically
anyway. The subtitle is ``From FDR On'' and it's a chatty book
about the famous people the Harvard economics professor emeritus
has been involved with professionally and personally through the
years. As the jacket blurb states, ``Drawing on a lifetime of
access to many of the greatest public figures, Galbraith creates a
rich and uniquely personal history of the century _ a century he
helped shape.'' (Milner, Cox News Service). 20.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-SCANDALMONGER _ The reputations of former Presidents
Jefferson and Hamilton survived. The journalist who blew open both
scandals was a Scotsman, James Thomson Callender. His reputation
didn't make it. History writes him off as an acerbic scandalmonger
who died drunk. History may write him off, but William Safire, the
New York Times columnist who delights in being contrarian, writes
him back into events in this novel with footnotes. Seeing as one
columnist is writing about another, Safire is sympathetic.
(Blackburn, Palm Beach Post) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   EYMAN-ON-BOOKS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Doctors tend to write
alike: Beautifully observed, descriptive, but absent emotion. They
take it all in, but they keep a clinical distance. The odd thing is
that they do this even when recollecting their experiences in
print. ``The Blood of Strangers'' is a seriously good book by an
emergency-room doctor named Frank Huyler. He works in Albuquerque,
but I'm sure his stories could derive from any metropolitan area of
America. (Eyman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED

   PRISON-RIOT (Crescent City, Calif.) _ Inmates at Pelican Bay
State Prison, involved in the bloodiest riot in the prison's
10-year history, had been in a lock-down for most of the last six
months because of a similar incident in August. They had been
allowed back in the prison's exercise yard in large numbers for

others. By PETER HARTLAUB and ERIC BRAZIL.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Like Chicago Alderman Edward Burke, I have been
a long-time foe of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Decades before dozens of the tobacco industry's dirtiest secret
memos were leaked to the public, even years before the U.S. Surgeon
General began to warn the public about the health hazards of
smoking, I knew cigarettes were seriously nasty.
</P>
<P>
   As a child in a house of smokers, a teen-ager cruising around in
smoke-filled cars, an adult jazz fan peering through thick blue
haze to groove on Mose, McCoy or Monk, I'd have done darn-near
anything to make people stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I think I understand where Alderman Burke is coming
from.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he announced that he would introduce an ordinance in
the Windy City, requiring businesses that sell cigarettes to post
graphic photos of diseased lungs, hearts and mouths near check-out
counters or cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   Said Burke: ``The public has become jaded by written warnings
alone and needs to be further informed about the health risks
associated with the use of tobacco products. The use of photographs
may be the most powerful tool at our disposal to get the message
across.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I will grant the alderman that much of the public has indeed
become jaded by written warnings about cigarettes. All it takes is
a trip to the movies to see that much of the public is way past
jaded. Cigarette smoking is in the throes of a reverse chic
revival.
</P>
<P>
   After a fairly smoke-free 10 or 15 years, heroes and heroines,
not just bad-guy losers, again smoke on screen. And they act as
though they really, really enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that young people _ that segment of the
population most susceptible to media images _ are also smoking in
higher numbers than we've seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   While the smoking population of the U.S. has been stuck at about
25 percent for the last decade, almost one-third of teens took up
smoking in the '90s. This is about 3,000 new young victims every
day.
</P>
<P>
   I will wager that almost none of these kids is smoking because
she or he needs to be further informed about the health risks
associated with the use of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   One 14-year-old I know, who started sneaking cigarettes with her
adolescent pals about a year ago, used to come home from grade
school and harangue her cigarette-addicted mother with statistics
on lung cancer, heart disease and the negative health effects of
second-hand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   From what ``the experts'' can tell, kids begin smoking today for
many of the reasons kids always engage in stupid behavior:
rebellion against authority, boredom, peer pressure and the
pathetic belief that they are immune to the dangers of such things
as speeding cars, alcohol, drugs, unprotected sex and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   With nicotine, however, kids are soon in the same swamp of
addiction as their adult counterparts. Worse. Last year, a study at
the University of California at San Francisco revealed that the
earlier people begin to smoke, the more severe _ and irreversible _
is the damage to their lungs. Even if they manage to quit.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide survey, 70 percent of adult smokers said they
wanted to break their habit. Sounds like these folks don't need
additional information either; they already know that what they're
doing is killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Will publicly posted gross-out photos of cancerous lungs, mouths
and hearts that look like ``Alien II'' help them get the nicotine
monkey off their back? Maybe. But don't expect large numbers. Most
hard-core cigarette addicts have tried a variety of stop-smoking
programs and tricks. They seem to need the kind of intensive help
we give heroin and cocaine addicts, which may include temporary
drug mitigation therapy with medications like Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   As for kids: You hear their music, you see their grunge
clothing, you watch their smart-ass, cynical cartoon shows like
``South Park.''

   What do you think they'll do with diseased-organ photos that are

to escape the disgusting effects of cigarette smoking, won't be

visually assaulted by the very demon we thought we had on the run.

&HT;     EXPERT SAYS PARENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT CHILD CARE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Dr. T. Berry Brazelton raised his kids some 50 years ago, when
moms stayed at home, guns at school were unheard of and parents
didn't have to compete with 200 television stations for their
children's attention.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just nostalgia to say today's world for children and
parents is more complex, from the Columbine High School massacre to
the shortage of quality child care and family time.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder families are stressed, Brazelton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing parents need to hear are solutions,'' said
Brazelton, the well-known pediatrician and guru of parenting with a
syndicated column, radio show and more than 28 books to his name,
including ``Touchpoints'' and ``What Every Parent Knows.''
</P>
<P>
   What working parents don't need is to feel even more guilty
about leaving their children in the care of others, said Brazelton,
a child development specialist and professor emeritus of pediatrics
at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just stuck with it,'' he said of child care. ``We're
stuck with making it work.''
</P>
<P>
   An advocate of improving child care, Brazelton encourages
parents to ask a lot of questions and pay attention to the number
of children per provider. For infants, there should be no more than
four babies to one employee. With toddlers, he caps the ratio at
5-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look to see if it's safe, feels good and whether your
caregiver really likes children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazelton said one of the most common pitfalls for working
parents often comes at the end of the day, when they try to step
back into their role as moms and dads after a long, tiring day at
the office.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than rush into the evening chores, he encourages parents
to spend time reconnecting with their children. ``Sit down with all
of them in your lap, talk, rock, sing and get close to them
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also advises parents not to let their feelings of guilt about
being away from their children make them avoid asking them to pitch
in and help with the chores, from setting the table to helping
prepare dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely critical for families to depend on
each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On television, Brazelton believes parents have to set stricter
limits, or risk losing their child's attention to the barrage of
violence and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents just have to take control and say this is an area
where you don't have any choices. You can watch an hour of TV a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Since stress is inevitable, Brazelton is convinced that the best
thing parents can do is learn how to manage it and help their
children do the same by laying a good foundation in the first three
years of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an answer to any of the stresses in life, it's
that we want to give our kids self-esteem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An octogenarian, Brazelton still travels around the country
giving speeches while teaching at Children's Hospital in Boston,
where he founded the Touchpoints Project, an outreach program to
train professionals how to better serve families of infants and
toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some of his positions on certain developmental
milestones in children's lives, including the best age for toilet
training, have sparked controversy. He recently raised eyebrows
after asking the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., the makers of Pampers, to
manufacture a larger diaper to accommodate older children not yet
ready to use the potty.
</P>
<P>
   But most pediatricians agree with his child-directed approach,
whether it's toilet training or feeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a kid in diapers at kindergarten,'' said Dr.
James Saperstone, a pediatrician with Capital Care Pediatrics
Guilderland, N.Y. ``It's when they show readiness.''

&HT;     KIDS MAY GRIMACE, BUT SOY BURGERS MAY SOON BE ON THE SCHOOL
MENU 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Don't tell Scott Housmann about low-fat veggie
burgers, fruits or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need the fat,'' said Housmann, who is 14 years old and
weighs 110 pounds. He was munching on a thick slice of pizza,
accompanied by a carton of chocolate milk with 1 percent fat.
</P>
<P>
   Ask fellow Albany High School freshman John Duquette if he'd
like to wash down his chicken patty with a glass of soy milk and he
grows incredulous. ``Yeah right,'' chuckles Duquette, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Veggie burgers and soy milk, though, are edging closer to school
lunchrooms.
</P>
<P>
   It is not shifting student tastes but soy industry lobbying and
a sustained push by activists that are putting pressure on school
menus. Together, they are waging the equivalent of a culinary Holy
War against the use of dairy and meat products.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is having some effect. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture is preparing regulations that will make it easier for
schools to be reimbursed for soy burgers or similar foods.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA gives money to most schools at least partly for their
meals, and many school hamburgers have some soy or other filler.
But the change should make it easier to serve burgers made only of
soy or other vegetable products.
</P>
<P>
   The soybean industry has long sought this change, with an eye
toward the huge school-lunch market.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes are evolving through the courts. The
Washington-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine,
which promotes a vegan lifestyle excluding any animal products,
sued the USDA in December seeking to change the agency's nutrition
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the group claims the guidelines fail to recognize that
minorities, including Asians and African-Americans, have higher
incidences of lactose intolerance, which makes it hard to digest
milk. That makes the guidelines racially biased, the lawsuit
contends.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawsuit is still pending in federal court, it has
already had some impact, prompting an advisory panel on nutrition
guidelines to recommend that soy milk share the same real estate as
cow's milk on the USDA's food pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have decided that soy milk should be included in the
dairy group,'' said Mindy Kursban, a lawyer for the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the latest volley by the physicians group which
has pushed for almost a decade to supplant milk and other dairy
products with vegetable foods.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the organization has a political, rather than
nutritional goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this agenda that no one should eat animal products
and they are not even doctors,'' said Beth Meyer, spokeswoman for
the American Dairy Association and Dairy Council.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy interests, though, have their own strategies for keeping
milk in the forefront, countered Kursban. For instance, she said,
dairy producers are trying to ban the term ``soy milk,'' claiming
it should instead be given the less-appetizing name of ``soy-based
beverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle of these bureaucratic battles are the
students and those who plan and prepare school lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the epidemic levels of obesity among children,
school food-service directors have long tried to cut down on the
fat content of meals.
</P>
<P>
   They say they would like to offer more items like veggie burgers
and soy milk if students would eat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just put out food that they don't like,'' said Tom
Cook, food service director at Quality Food Management, a company
that provides meals for the Troy, N.Y., school district as well as
several parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a handful of students who are vegetarians
or vegans, most kids are wary of anything that's the least bit
unusual looking on their lunch trays, said Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Cook even has trouble getting students to consume food that
requires a knife and fork.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be able to grip it with their fingers,'' Cook
said, figuring that the craving for sliced pizza, burgers and
bite-sized chicken nuggets is a byproduct of a fast-food culture in
which children rarely sit down with their families for a
full-course meal.
</P>
<P>
   While soyburgers may soon be reimbursable, they won't be free.
By contrast, most schools get at least some free beef, courtesy of
government programs to purchase food surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that the meat lobby in this country is going to be a
little more muscular than the nonmeat lobby,'' said Barry Sackin,
government relations director for the American School Food Service
Association. ``It's just raw politics.''

WHAT GOOD CAN COME FROM THIS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday Feb. 24  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I met a loving couple the other day. The two women have been
together for many years and live in a nice house with a garden and
well-behaved dogs and cats. You would never suspect they were bent
on destroying the time-honored institution of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   They actually pass as nice neighbors and contributing members of
society. Of course, they live in sin, but that's what 50 percent of
Californians would have them do rather than support their right to
marry.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22, or the Knight Initiative, which Californians
will vote on March 7, is a baffling piece of wannabe law. It would
add language to the California Family Code that only marriage
between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.
Even though same-sex marriage is already not legal in the state,
supporters seek the measure as a down-the-road guarantee to keep it
from being imported.
</P>
<P>
   They insist that Prop. 22 is not intended to discriminate
against gay people.
</P>
<P>
   How can that not be? Such a law would take the state several
steps backward at the same time California has taken two giant
steps forward. We started out the new century being more
open-minded than the last century, with a new law establishing a
statewide domestic partnership registry so that gay state employees
can get insurance benefits for their partners. Another new law
outlaws discrimination against gay students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do you explain a retro law that would punish the same
group of people you've already decided to treat fairly? Do
Californians believe in equal rights or not?
</P>
<P>
   What good could come from Prop. 22? Basically it would prevent
two women or two men from getting married in another state where it
might someday be legal for gay people to marry and then coming to
California and expecting that marriage to be honored. Help me here.
Why would that bother anybody? I understand being stopped at the
California line to make sure you're not bringing gypsy moths in on
your melons from Arizona but how could honeymooning Jim and John
put the state in peril?
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Prop. 22 say their motives have nothing to do with
discrimination but with state sovereignty. They don't want gay
Californians sneaking off to Vermont, or any other state that might
eventually allow such unions, and then coming back to Petaluma and
_ doing what, flaunting their legality?
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure say, of course, it's about
discrimination. They say to pass this law would poison the air and
encourage uglier laws and create more separation between the gay
world and the straight world.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say we need Prop. 22 to underscore the belief that
children are best raised in an environment where they have a mother
and a father.
</P>
<P>
   How about two mothers and two fathers? I know several of this
family mix in which the surrogate father and his male partner are
helping to raise the child of the lesbian mother and her partner.
</P>
<P>
   How about we vote in language that children are best raised in
an environment that fosters love? Prop. 22 does not foster love.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say we need this law to protect marriage, but how
does keeping one kind of couple from marrying threaten another kind
of couple's marriage? Since when did my blissful state depend on
another's?
</P>
<P>
   If marriage-protectors are really serious about pushing measures
that would improve the health of married life, they could work on
shortening the work week, raising the minimum wage, creating good
child care centers where people work.
</P>
<P>
   They could demand affordable housing, longer vacations, better
birth control and work to eliminate stress, alcoholism and domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   They could urge couples to turn off the TV one night a week and
talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   I got that last idea from the two women I just met. We were all
talking about when couples work long hours it's almost necessary to
make a date with each other in order to have any romance. They said
they turn off the TV, make a nice dinner, rent a movie, and then,
they laughed, `We fall asleep.' '' Isn't that something? And we
heteros thought that gay people had sex all the time. The troubling
report about Prop. 22 is that, according to public opinion polls,
half of Californians believe it's a good idea. Forty one percent
are opposed to it, and the rest are still undecided. This means
Prop. 22, which has twice as much money behind it as the other
side, has a good chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
   I still don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush it sounded like a busybody law and a spiteful
move toward one group of people. At last blush, it still does.
</P>

&HT;     UPS CHIEF SEES AN `E' IN COMPANY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The head of United Parcel Service told two
business groups that he sees a pot of gold at the end of the
Internet rainbow. And it is painted brown.
</P>
<P>
   `` UPS believes that the biggest riches still to be found will
be in the physical world of fulfilling digital transactions,'' Jim
Kelly, the chairman and chief executive of the shipping company,
told the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco and the Oakland Chamber
of Commerce on Wednesday. ``In other words, where the rubber meets
the code _ digital code _ is where the money's at.''
</P>
<P>
   Most electronic commerce companies have found the last mile of
their business models the most daunting. Getting products from
click to brick has proved difficult.
</P>
<P>
   And many have turned to UPS, and its competitor Federal Express,
as their fulfillment divisions. UPS believes it is poised to take
full advantage of that opportunity, using the Internet as a
springboard into new territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commerce, in a nutshell, has always been about the transfer of
goods, information and funds,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said his 92-year-old company, which sold shares to the
public for the first time last year, can do more for electronic
commerce than deliver products. Through its UPS Capital division,
the executive told the business leaders that his company ``can lend
you money to grow. Finance your inventory. Even buy your accounts
receivable outright.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly sees this outshoot of UPS's core business as a critical
service for small companies trying to get a toehold in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   To help the process along, UPS recently formed another wholly
owned subsidiary, UPS e-Ventures. The company is designed to
identify and bring to market companies that will serve the needs of
businesses that operate on the Internet, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Another subsidiary will be UPS e-Logistics, which will offer a
package of services _ from warehousing to order fulfillment to
customer service _ for small and medium-size companies that sell
their products on the Internet. UPS already offers such services to
its larger customers through UPS Worldwide Logistics.
</P>
<P>
   UPS used money from its initial public stock sale to help
finance these ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company's stock enjoyed a healthy first-day pop in
November, it was treated to a cold dose of Internet economics in
late January. After reporting that its fourth-quarter profit grew
37 percent, the stock fell 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the decline to traders who were disappointed
that UPS did not get a bigger boost from holiday sales shipments by
Internet retailers.

&HT;     SIXTH-GRADER LOSES HER PONYTAIL FOR A CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Fla.)

 &HT;     By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY. N.Y. _ Bonnie Molitor's most striking feature used to be
her hair _ a two-foot long shining blond curtain she frequently
flicked back over her shoulders with a gesture as natural and
unconscious as breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie's hair was the longest in her sixth-grade class at Albany
School 19. She had been growing it since she was four-years-old,
submitting to only the tiniest of trims at the hairdressers.
``Please Mom, one inch, not two,'' she would plead.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Bonnie faced a stylist's scissors without fear.
The 11-year-old voluntarily had nearly a foot of her hair lopped
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like helping people,'' said Bonnie, who will send her
ponytail to a nonprofit organization called Locks of Love, which
donates custom-made wigs to children who suffer from alopecia
areata.
</P>
<P>
   This mysterious condition causes hair on the head, and sometimes
the entire body, to fall out. Doctors are unsure exactly what
causes the disease, for which there is no cure.
</P>
<P>
   Locks of Love, based in Palm Springs, Fla., was founded in 1997
by Peggy Knight, who suffered from alopecia areata as a child and
keenly remembered the shame and embarrassment of growing up without
hair. The organization has given away more than 185 custom-made
wigs that retail for about $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for children to find wigs that fit properly,
Locks of Love Executive Director Jennifer Cox said. The Locks of
Love wigs feature a silicone cap that creates a vacuum seal around
the head and prevents the wig from slipping.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about a dozen ponytails like Bonnie's to make a single
wig, each of which has more than 150,000 hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie got the idea to donate her hair while watching
television. She saw a show about a group of teens who gave their
hair away to cancer patients. But Bonnie kept quiet at first about
her motivation when she asked her mother, Debra Weinlein, 42, for
permission to get a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her to wait, because it was such a drastic thing, and I
wanted to make sure she really wanted to do it,'' Weinlein said.
``But then when she told me why. I thought it was wonderful and
immediately said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Weinlein took her daughter to the Scissors III &AMP; Co.
Salon where owner Christine Murray showed Bonnie to a chair. The
cut took all of half an hour _ the bulk of it done in several swift
clips as Murray cut off Bonnie's 12-inch ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie held the silky tail and stroked it as Murray shaped her
remaining shoulder-length locks. The sixth-grader did not cry for
her lost glory, but she admitted the new, more sophisticated style
would take some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   `'I've got a new child,'' Weinlein mused. ``I can't believe how
much older she looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra-long hair runs in Bonnie's family. Her great-grandmother,
Esther Bailey, had auburn hair that hung to the tops of her thighs.
She cut it when she gave birth to twins, one of which was
Weinlein's father.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's hair is likely packed away somewhere in the attic,
basement or drawer at one of her eight children's homes, Weinlein
said. She hopes to find it in time to send it to Locks of Love
along with Bonnie's ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame how many people get their hair cut and don't know
that someone else needs it,'' Weinlein said. ``Once it hits the
floor, though, it's useless.''

`SUPERNATURAL' PHENOMENON: THE RESURRECTION OF GRAMMY KINGPIN
CARLOS SANTANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of singer Carlos Santana.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's almost ... well, supernatural.
 &HT;    About the last thing anyone associated with the pop-music scene
looked for last year was a record-shattering comeback from Carlos
Santana.
 &HT;    But that's exactly what has happened in the wake of June's
release of ``Supernatural,'' a record that pairs Santana with such
contemporary luminaries as Dave Matthews, Lauryn Hill, Rob Thomas
of Matchbox 20, Everlast, Eagle-Eye Cherry and Wyclef Jean, as well
as fellow rock-guitar hero Eric Clapton.
 &HT;    Faster than you can say ``Oye Como Va,'' ``Supernatural'' became
a sensation, topping the Billboard album charts at the same time
``Smooth,'' co-written and sung by Thomas and Santana, hit the top
of the singles charts.
 &HT;    Besides reviving the star Santana kindled 30 years ago with his
defining performance at the original Woodstock festival, it also
earned the 52-year-old songwriter, musician and bandleader an
American Music Award for the year's favorite pop/rock album and a
whopping 10 Grammy Award nominations, the most of any artist this
year.
 &HT;    And, Santana says, this success isn't entirely accidental.
 &HT;    ``This CD is assigned and designed to reach junior-high school,
high school and universities,'' explains the Mexican-born musician,
whose previous two No. 1 albums, ``Abraxas'' and ``Santana III,''
were released in the early 1970s. ``With Lauryn Hill and Dave
Matthews, it was designed to assault the radio airwaves with the
Santana vibration.
 &HT;    ``If you play something from the heart,'' he adds, ``they'll
listen to it. Eubie Blake, the piano player, used to say `If you
listen, we get you.'
 &HT;    ``So it ain't about generations,'' Santana says. ``We're
connecting because, even though they're very young and some of them
may have never heard us, once we drop the music on them, they go
`Oh, what is this?'
 &HT;    ``It's going in, and it's making an impact.''
 &HT;    Santana's three-plus decades of recording include not only work
with his own band but also numerous collaborations and a leading
role in the blending of Latin and rock styles. He views music as
spiritual expression _ something that, when done correctly, can
``rearrange the molecular structure of the listener'' and inspire a
higher understanding of the self and the world around us.
 &HT;    At the turn of the century, Santana also feels compelled to
spread a ``positive vibration'' to counterbalance the aggressive,
violent images that saturate popular culture.
 &HT;    ``All you have to do is look at what's happening in schools,
with guns and stuff, and I felt that by creating this music we were
presenting the audience, the young listeners, a new menu,'' he
says. ``We don't want them to feel like us or think like us or
believe like us _ everybody's entitled to their own unique
viewpoint and to pursue their own destinies. But we did want to
present them with a new menu.
 &HT;    ``In other words,'' he explains, ``when the sound resonates and
the vibrations that come out of us through the songs rearrange the
molecules, then you and I are reminded that we are multidimensional
spirits, and we have enormous opportunities and possibilities to do
grand things for the highest good of life and people on the
planet.''
 &HT;    Of course, what's a message without an audience to hear it?
That's what brought Santana back to Arista Records chief Clive
Davis, the man who had signed him to Columbia Records in 1969, to
help put together ``Supernatural'' and its superstar
collaborations.
 &HT;    For his part, Santana says his main responsibility wasn't really
the music as such, but rather to make sure the project stayed true
to his mission.
 &HT;    ``This is not show business,'' he says. ``This is not
entertainment. None of the musicians I play with on this CD is an
entertainment guy or a show-business guy _ we're musicians, and we
believe that music has the power to bring unity and healing in a
new kind of dimension and thinking. And that's why we did it.
 &HT;    ``All of us came with our hearts forward, and it sounds like one
breath,'' Santana says. ``It doesn't sound like it was painted by
numbers or like I was dipped into somebody else's stuff. To me,
it's a masterpiece of joy.''
 &HT;    ``Smooth,'' the album's big hit, is also one of its most joyous
moments, a celebration of sensuality and romantic dynamics. Yet
beforehand many wondered if Thomas, best known for hooky-pop hits
with Matchbox 20, wasn't a bit too lightweight to be working with
someone like Santana.
 &HT;    ``He was just as deep as all the other people, no less,''
Santana insists. ``Don't let the word `popular' fool you _ there's
nothing more popular than Nat King Cole, still. (Thomas')
convictions are true for what he's doing _ he caught that spirit of
Spanish Harlem, `Mona Lisa.'
 &HT;    ``He has this beautiful lady, she looks Afro-Cuban or she might
be Puerto Rican, so he understands the concept of
multidimensional,'' the musician adds. ``He has a deep soul and
deep convictions. We sat down and talked about it before we started
recording the song. I'm just very, very grateful, man _ he's a
great writer.''
 &HT;    There are stories behind each of the album's pairings. Hill, for
instance, had Santana as a guest on her Grammy-winning ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' and was more than happy to return
the favor.
 &HT;    Santana had been introduced to Matthews' music by his 9-year-old
daughter. Intrigued, he presented Matthews with the beginnings of
``Love of My Life,'' a song inspired by Brahms' ``Concerto No. 2,''
and let the younger rocker finish it.
 &HT;    Clapton, meanwhile, had seen Santana perform with Hill at last
year's Grammys, and called after Davis approached him about the
project.
 &HT;    ``He said, `I definitely want to play on your album, but only if
you hear me and if there's room for me,''' Santana recalls. ``Can
you imagine Eric Clapton telling you such a thing?''
 &HT;    The two met one afternoon and came up with ``The Calling,'' a
lengthy opus which Santana likens to ``having two Apaches at the
Grand Canyon evoking the spirits, that kind of thing.''
 &HT;    Part of ``Supernatural's'' success is its opportune timing, many
observers believe. The success of Ricky Martin and others has
reawakened mass interest in Latin music, resulting in some
sales-inducing curiosity about Santana as one of its important
figures.
 &HT;    The guitarist himself dismisses the notion, however _ though
``Supernatural'' does include several songs with Spanish lyrics.
The way he sees it, he's been around far too long to be helped by
trends.
 &HT;    ``I take great delight in crystallizing the reality that Latin
or Spanish, whatever we call it, is really African music,'' Santana
says. ``Ricky Martin, yours truly, Gloria Estefan, Los Lobos _
everyone who calls themselves Latin or Spanish is really playing
African music, unless you mix it with polkas or waltzes.
 &HT;    ``But basically, everybody's playing rumba, cha cha cha, samba,
bolero, and all that stuff really comes from Africa,'' he says.
``Whatever we call ourselves these days, Latin or Spanish or
Chicano, it's OK _ but we have to remember that we really are
playing African music and so honor that.''

 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    I had a hard time watching Pat Robertson on CNN Saturday night,
gloating over George W. Bush's win in South Carolina.
 &HT;    The Christian Coalition was energized, he proclaimed. They had
worked their heads _ he would never say ``butts'' _ off to get out
the vote. They had made thousands of phone calls. They had sent out
tens of thousands of pieces of direct mail. They had made a
difference.
 &HT;    When a reporter suggested that the Christian Coalition had
delivered South Carolina for Bush, Robertson was happy to agree.
But he went even further _ it had actually elected the next
president of the United States, he said.
 &HT;    Hold on now. To quote that great American philosopher, Yogi
Berra, ``It ain't over 'til it's over.'' And Americans who believe
in religious tolerance _ especially those of the Catholic faith _
have a lot to think about after South Carolina.
 &HT;    No doubt about it, Bush's visit to Bob Jones University was a
smart political move _ in the short term. It may have involved
pandering to an institution built in the image of a founder who
reportedly believed that Catholicism is a satanic cult, that the
pope is the Antichrist and that the Catholic Eucharist is
comparable to cannibalism, but it's worth it if the university has
thousands of volunteers ready to help get out the vote.
 &HT;    And he didn't have much to lose _ Catholic-bashing doesn't upset
too many people in South Carolina. As for the wider world, if
Catholic-bashing doesn't seem to hurt museum curators or members of
Congress, why should it harm a presidential candidates?
 &HT;    Back in November, New York's Brooklyn Museum opened
``Sensation,'' an exhibition that featured a rendition of the
Madonna by an African artist which used elephant dung and
porn-magazine clippings among its elements.
 &HT;    It stirred up a controversy, of course, but the museum
administration had known it would _ the same thing had happened
when it was first shown in London. But the directors of an
outer-borough museum that had long struggled to attract visitors
knew that controversy would bring attention, and with the attention
would come long lines of paying customers. As indeed they did.
 &HT;    Canny marketing, to be sure, and if a few Catholics saw the
piece as an insult to them and to their religion, well, that was
the price of success.
 &HT;    I didn't see the exhibit, but as a Catholic I was nonetheless
offended by it. As a believer in civil liberties, I agree with the
show's defenders that its freedom of expression is protected by the
First Amendment _ but, as a Catholic, I will never go to the
Brooklyn Museum again.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, in January Catholic-bashing reared its ugly head in
Washington.
 &HT;    It's been more than a century since the office of chaplain of
the House of Representatives was created, and this year was the
first time a Roman Catholic priest was recommended for the post.
The House Republicans can't find a heartbeat when it comes to
enacting virtually any significant piece of legislation, but the
nomination of a Catholic chaplain woke them up in a hurry.
 &HT;    With the speed of lightning, the Republicans rejected the
nomination, installing a Protestant minister instead. Neither
Speaker Dennis Hastert (R.-Ill.) nor Majority Leader Dick Armey
(R.-Texas) offered any explanation for their actions. And, as you'd
expect, they were surprised at the angry reaction from House
Catholics of both parties.
 &HT;    Since 1960 Catholic politicians, fearful of upsetting the
church/state balance forged by John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic
elected president, have avoided speaking up for themselves. But the
rejection of a Catholic chaplain, apparently for no reason other
than his Catholicism, struck many as a return to the rampant
intolerance of the 19th century, and drew a vociferous response
from many Catholics in the House.
 &HT;    And now Catholic-bashing may actually have helped a candidate
win his party's presidential nomination.
 &HT;    Sen. John McCain may have lost the South Carolina primary
because he refused to pander to the anti-Catholic forces that
dominate that state's Republican Party. McCain declared that he
would have refused to appear at Bob Jones University because of its
teachings against racial intermarriage and Roman Catholicism.
 &HT;    And, as Robertson was so happy to point out, McCain lost by a
beefy 12 points.
 &HT;    But McCain knows something that neither Robertson nor Bush has
figured out: The Democrats who turned out in droves to support
Ronald Reagan in 1980 and again in 1984 were hard-working,
blue-collar Catholics.
 &HT;    McCain realizes that those Catholics are the most conservative
members of the Democratic Party, and that they have more loyalty to
their issues than to political labels. His whole campaign has been
built on reaching out to independents and Democrats.
 &HT;    In short, he wants the Reagan Democrats back. He believes that
the only way for the Republicans to win is as a party of inclusion,
not one of exclusion. And he's right.
 &HT;    After the Michigan polls closed on Tuesday night, Pat Robertson
was back on television, but this time he was a different man, still
defiant but more cautious. It seemed to be sinking in that the same
ploy that had helped win South Carolina had angered Michigan
Catholics who, three days later, went to the polls and helped
McCain to a razor-thin win.
 &HT;    After his humiliating defeat in New Hampshire, Bush had proven
himself willing to compromise principle to win. He would have known
better if he'd read a 1996 book by former Sen. Warren Rudman
(R.-N.H.). In it, Rudman wrote that the Republican Party will
discredit itself if it allies itself too closely with the Christian
Coalition.
 &HT;    It already has.

&HT;     GAY RIGHTS GROUP TARGETS RADIO PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A gay rights foundation on Thursday launched a
national campaign to get conservative talk-radio personality Laura
Schlessinger to tone down her attacks on homosexuals and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements published in several newspapers say
Schlessinger's use of such words as ``deviant'' and ``a biological
error'' is based on outdated, discredited theories and is doing
``real harm, to real people.''
</P>
<P>
   A public letter also went out Thursday appealing to Schlessinger
to follow the example set by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the
conservative Christian who renounced statements that might incite
hatred of gays.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging Schlessinger's right to express her views, the
letter said, ``We are simply saying this: Young people who are
otherwise happy and healthy are being taught to hate themselves
simply because they are gay.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads and letter, organized by the San Francisco-based
Horizons Foundation, the nation's first gay and lesbian foundation,
were signed by more than 180 child welfare organizations, health
and medical associations, civil rights and civil liberties groups,
rabbis and other religious leaders, as well as advocates for gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that Dr. Laura is reaching 20 million people a
day, day in, day out, with the message that gays and lesbians are
deviant, that we are biological errors, that we can and should be
cured,'' said Peter Teague, the executive director of Horizons.
Schlessinger is known as ``Dr. Laura'' among her audience of 20
million although she does not have a medical degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``She issues an invitation to think of gays and lesbians as
inferior, as less than human. As an adult I can decline that
invitation; kids can't,'' Teague said. ``Statistics speak for
themselves about the impact those words have. It's extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger, 53, alerted to the campaign by calls from
reporters, immediately went on the offensive at the top of her show
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I have hallucinated, I have never made an anti-gay
commentary,'' she said. ``I have made anti-gay-activist-agenda
commentaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the campaign the ``worst kind of intellectual
dishonesty,'' she said the coalition was trying to ``demonize me in
an effort to help their political campaign against'' the
anti-gay-marriage initiative that is to appear on California's
March 7 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   This month, she told the Advocate, a gay news magazine, that her
message about homosexuality had grown sterner since she went on the
air in 1996 as a result of her deepening Orthodox Jewish faith and
the ``rise of the radical gay and lesbian agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Her warnings against gay parenting and gay marriage and her
advocacy of efforts to ``cure'' gays fit into her sharp moral
commentary on life. She rails against unmarried couples living
together.
</P>
<P>
   Her radio show, broadcast from Premiere Radio Networks in Los
Angeles County, airs on 500 stations in the United States and
Canada and attracts more listeners than conservative commentator
Rush Limbaugh or shock jock Howard Stern. She also is the author of
best-selling advice books and a syndicated newspaper column. She is
scheduled to launch a daytime television talk show later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that your show, columns and television
appearances are contributing to the fear and hatred of gay and
lesbian people,'' said the public appeal made Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter refers to recent scientific data contradicting
Schlessinger's claims that homosexuality is deviant.
</P>
<P>
   The Horizons Foundation also points out that Schlessinger earned
a doctorate in physiology, and that she is not a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   The ads published Thursday appeared in a number of newspapers,
including the San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco Chronicle and
Los Angeles Times.

JAMES WONG'S `FINAL' ANSWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of director
James Wong on the set of ``Final Destination.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    James Wong scares the hell out of people.
 &HT;    Since the early 1990s, Wong and his partner, Glen Morgan, have
creeped out millions of television viewers by writing, producing
and/or directing episodes of ``The X-Files,'' ``Millennium'' and
``The Others.'' He also whisked viewers to the cosmos with the
short-lived sci-fi series ``Space: Above and Beyond.''
 &HT;    What's with Wong and his affinity for the genre?
 &HT;    ``I love the adrenaline,'' he says. ``I've also always looked at
the sci-fi fans as a smarter audience. You can never sneak stuff by
them, because they are so into the stories, so into the genre.
 &HT;    ``They are avid and careful watchers,'' he says, ``more so than
the general public, I think. Creating shows for people who really
care is cool.''
 &HT;    On March 17 Wong and Morgan will expand their horizons with the
arrival of their first feature, ``Final Destination.'' A
supernatural thriller, ``Final Destination'' was co-written by
Morgan and Wong, co-produced by Morgan and directed by Wong.
 &HT;    The film stars Devon Sawa as Alex, a student who experiences a
vision of the plane he has just boarded being blown to smithereens.
Sure enough, moments after he and several classmates hurriedly
disembark, the plane blows up.
 &HT;    Later, those who left the plane start dying gruesome deaths. Is
Alex causing the mayhem, or could it be something even more
mysterious?
 &HT;    ``This movie is very exciting and a lot of fun,'' Wong says by
telephone from his Los Angeles production office. ``But, to be
honest, an audience that's not into this adrenaline-rush kind of a
movie, or that doesn't like violence at all, might find it an
ordeal to go through.
 &HT;    ``It's not violence directed from one person to another,'' he
adds, ``but it's a supernatural force _ death, actually _ that is
hunting down our characters. So there is that very suspenseful,
scary, intense experience. If you're into that, then you're going
to like this movie. It's an in-your-face ride.''
 &HT;    The biggest difference between directing a movie and a
television-series episode, Wong says, is the time-crunch factor.
Filmmaking allow more time to prep, to perfect scenes on the set
and to fix mistakes during the editing and audience-testing
processes.
 &HT;    To make ``Final Destination'' genuinely cinematic and effective
on the big screen, Wong turned to production designer John Willet,
among others.
 &HT;    ``What we've done, after our main character has cheated death,
is skew all of our sets,'' Wong says. ``The perspectives change
subtly. Even sets we'd seen before change a little bit _ Alex's
bathroom, for example, looks different the second time you see it.
 &HT;    ``There's an uneasiness that is created by the set design, then
also by the angles, editing, music and everything else,'' he says.
``There's a layer of uneasiness that permeates the whole movie.''
 &HT;    Wong infused similar uneasiness into ``X-Files'' and
``Millennium,'' of course. He and Morgan spent several seasons with
Chris Carter on ``X-Files,'' writing several memorable episodes.
Wong earned an Emmy nomination for directing ``Musings of a
Cigarette-Smoking Man.''
 &HT;    Many ``X''-philes feel that the show has suffered since the
duo's departure, but Wong downplays any chance of their taking an
encore.
 &HT;    ``I think that show has passed me by,'' Wong says. ``It's in its
seventh season, and I've not worked on it since the fourth.''
 &HT;    However ...
 &HT;    ``If Chris called and said, `Hey, do you want to do something?'
and Glen and I were available,'' Wong says, ``I'd definitely do
something.''
 &HT;    Wong and Morgan also oversaw the controversial second year of
``Millennium,'' which centered more on the Millennium Group's
mythology than on the case assignments of Frank Black (Lance
Henriksen). Some fans _ as well as Henriksen himself _ felt that
Wong and Morgan had broken something that needed no fixing.
 &HT;    Wong says that he ``stands by'' the Morgan/Wong era of
``Millennium,'' but otherwise declines comment.
 &HT;    Then there's ``Space: Above and Beyond,'' a sci-fi adventure
that seemingly refuses to die. Fans of the series, which ran from
1995 to 1996, gather with the show's stars and creators at an
annual ``Space'' convention, publish a ``Space'' newsletter and
lobby Fox and the Sci-Fi Channel to fund fresh episodes or at least
a two-hour television-movie finale.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what it is about `Space,''' Wong says. ``I guess
it just touched a chord. A lot of people loved those ideals about
the military, those ideals about what real courage is and what
you'd do for the person next to you.
 &HT;    ``People want to think we'd all have those qualities if we were
put under the crucible of war,'' he adds. ``I'm surprised people
still talk about it, and gratified they appreciated the work.
 &HT;    ``Actually, I'd love to do a `Space' movie,'' Wong concludes.
``I would do it in a heartbeat.''

   It's cold, it's windy, and indoors at Rockingham Park in Salem,
N.H., the milling masses are dreaming of spring and being outside
in a warm wind. Snow covers the racetrack, and horseflesh has given
way to the iron horse.
</P>
<P>
   I wander the exhibits at the New England Motorcycle Expo and ask
myself, ``Can't anybody come up with something original?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm a denizen of motorcycle shows. I know that at least half of
what I see will be booths selling helmets, cotton skullcaps, flamed
clothing, leather hats, chaps, gloves, jackets, and hundreds of
varieties of T-shirts. It makes me wonder if they really own a bike
or just the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   I know that no belly is too big, no pair of leather pants too
tight. I watch the line at Heidi Jo's Beef Jerky stand and note
that passing tough-guy bikers are too shy to make eye contact with
Jennifer Lavoie, Playboy Playmate, who lounges in a leopard-skin
bikini.
</P>
<P>
   But today, for that first time, I blaspheme: Who will have an
original thought?
</P>
<P>
   I've only ridden Harleys (and one 1958 Triumph), but I've never
been a Harley snob who looks down on those who ride other (read
Japanese) motorcycles. Ride what you can afford, has been my motto.
Even in the Harley community there is a disgusting prejudice
against those who ride new Harleys (they almost always start, they
don't drip oil) on the part of those who ride old Harleys
(sometimes they start, they do drip oil). Never mind that if Harley
hadn't manufactured, and new riders hadn't stepped forward to buy,
the new Harley, there would be no Harley-Davidson today.
</P>
<P>
   So I see Harley, even as it evolves, sticking to its original
thought, improving on it, doing what a good company should.
</P>
<P>
   Then I wander through the Honda exhibit and note they've got the
motorcycle market covered: their own traditional high-r.p.m.
rockets; a nice lineup of four-wheelers; and, what's this? a
Valkyre _ pure rip-off of the classic Indian, and the Shadow _ pure
rip-off of the Harley.
</P>
<P>
   Beside them, Triumphs sit looking for identity: dirt bike?
cruiser? throwback to the old days? They're trying it all.
</P>
<P>
   And here are the Vulcans _ Nomad and Drifter _ fat-fendered and
looking all-Indian.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps as upsetting as any of them is the Kawasaki W650 (W
standing for We stole the idea): It's a Triumph clone, right down
to the rubber knee grips on the gas tank, the long, flat seat, the
winged flanges where exhaust meets cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   Can't somebody have an original thought?
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, I wasn't appalled by the insurgence of
knockoff motorcycles. Back then, I wrote, ``There's a new thunder
on the roads of motorcycling and it's being spit from the exhausts
of thousands of bikes manufactured every year that look just like
customized Harleys, may even have Harley engines and other
components in them, and are fueling an industry that is growing
rapidly in the Harley's shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   They called them clones, hybrids, and ``special construction''
motorcycles, and they arose because ``The Motor Company,'' as
Harley is known, created a demand that it could not supply. It was
fueled by the image of Harley riders as tough hombres on the road
to freedom who love being In The Wind, as a popular motorcycle
magazine is named, escaping the strictures of reaching middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Harley was moving from around 30,000 bikes sold each year in the
early 1980s, to reaching for 200,000 annual sales. Clones did not
seem like such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   So we got clones from companies named Big Dog, California
Motorcycle Co., Castle Motorcycles, Confederate Motorcycles,
Illusion, American Eagle, American Image, Surgical Steeds, Titan,
Victory, and Iron Horse.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know the trend would spread to established
manufacturers and original design would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   So as I wandered the Expo, I wondered how this happened even as
the market has become more diverse than ever. It used to be almost
strictly a guy thing _ women rode on the back of motorcycles. Now,
nearly 20 percent of new bike purchasers are women. At the Expo,
the guy wearing the T-shirt that read, ``When In Doubt . . . Knock
'Em Out'' stood in glaring contrast to the women bikers promoting
Alli's Rally 2000, for the Allison Burke Fund for The Floating
Hospital/New England Medical Center. Or Women on Wheels pushing
their 7th Annual Rally for Breast Cancer on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have an emerging, diverse (aging boomers looking
to hang onto their youth, women, young riders looking for high-tech
thrills) market, yet they're going retro, ripping off ideas from
others. Keep doing it, they'll ride the wave into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Some are fine: Indian is trying to make a legitimate comeback.
So is Excelsior-Henderson with its Super X, though its V-Twin,
85-cubic-inch engine and its look smell like a Harley.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see somebody show up at one of these shows sticking
to their guns (BMW wasn't represented, and I suspect they would fit
this latter notion).
</P>
<P>
   Stick to their guns the way it looks like Ducati is doing. At
Eastern Cycles' exhibit, the Ducati sat looking low, explosive, and
distinctive. From the new models right back to the 250-cubic-inch
vintage Ducati of Johnny ``Holeshot'' Strehpfer.
</P>
<P>
   So I wandered on, pausing to admire Tony Deluca's 1962 Harley
XLCH Sportster, admire its classic tank and tiny solo seat.
</P>
<P>
   But then I ran smack into the Suzuki Intruder (Harley) and
Yamaha Road Star (Harley Dresser) and I was overwhelmed by the
thought once again: Won't somebody please have an original thought?

SINDEN, TEAM AGREE WITH SUSPENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Bruins president and general manager Harry
Sinden said the team supports the NHL's decision to suspend
defenseman Marty McSorley for the remainder of the regular season
and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden was in New York for the league's decision on the
supplementary discipline of the Monday night incident in Vancouver
involving McSorley and Donald Brashear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever suspension the league handed out, the Bruins and
myself were prepared to accept as the fair one and the right one,''
said Sinden. ``The disciplinary procedure of the NHL is something a
person like myself and (Edmonton GM) Glen Sather have had a hand in
putting into place. We think it's a very good one, and we think
it's administered by very competent people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team in no way finds this excusable and does not condone
these kinds of actions from any player and never has. We've
witnessed over the years a number of them both as victims and as
the guilty party in some instances and never have condoned any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley's future in Boston remains a question mark. He is
signed through the year and will become an unrestricted free agent
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty and I are going to talk,'' said Sinden. ``Any answer I
make to that right now is something that would be construed, if I
said yes or no, one way or another, and it shouldn't be because
Marty and I are going to sit down and talk. I will say this: he's a
Bruin, he's part of our family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't find this type of action excusable. On the other
hand, we will lend our support now that he's been punished and
supplementary discipline has been handed down. We will lend our
support to Marty as a Bruin and as a member of our team and do what
we can to help him from this day forward. I'm not quite sure what
that will entail.''
</P>
<P>
   What it might entail, Sinden said, is an effort to show that
this was an act that was out of character for McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, he's very remorseful at this point,'' said Sinden,
who spoke with McSorley Wednesday. ``He feels ashamed. He's full of
shame. He's under a great deal of stress right now. He's shaken by
the whole thing. If we can help show that this wasn't him, this act
was not Marty. I know we only had him on the team for a short
period of time, but I talked to a number of people about Marty
McSorley before I signed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some wonderful opinions about him. I've talked to some
people in the last couple of days who know him much better than I
do, and they all confirmed to me that this was out of character for
him. He's been 17 years in the league; he's been a policeman for
every team he's been with. It's a role that's acceptable to the
fans, by the league, by each team. He's found himself in trouble
from time to time, but I think over 17 years, he's done very, very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden has been answering questions all year about the
controversies surrounding his club. There were the holdouts, the
injuries, the coaching controversy, the Joe Murphy debacle, and now
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the worst year, I'll tell you that,'' said Sinden.
``It hasn't been pleasant. This is just another thing on top of it
all. It's something we're trying to get straightened out now.
Frankly, that's a bigger concern, the way this team plays, than
anything for me at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   All of McSorley's teammates, for the most part, believed that
McSorley was going to be banished for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people assumed that's what it was going to
be,'' said goalie Byron Dafoe, who is in Boston awaiting word on
the extent of his knee injury. ``Obviously it's a pretty hefty
suspension, the most ever. I feel bad for Marty because I think
genuinely deep down he really didn't mean to do what he did. Hockey
is a reaction, spontanaeity type of sport, and I think he showed
true remorse in his statements right after. I think the suspension
is severe and probably fair. I feel bad for Marty because he's
really not that type of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said the incident was painful for everybody, and he said
he thought there was some bad luck involved as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything went wrong in the way that it unfolded for
Marty,'' said Dafoe. ``He could've maybe caught his cheek and not
his temple, if Brashear had fallen on his side or forward and
hadn't landed on his head. Everything went the wrong way for Marty
there. It made it look that much worse and thus the punishment has
to be that much worse. Thank God it caught his helmet and not
directly on his temple because there could've been some severe
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe and Anson Carter, who were injured in Monday night's game,
both underwent MRIs Wednesday. Dafoe's right knee is injured, while
Carter has a shoulder problem.

A FUNGUS IS AMONG US: RIGHT IN THE LIVING ROOM! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's show and tell time.
</P>
<P>
   Show and tell is usually reserved for the early grades of school
(the handyman never did have any), but this time two readers showed
some humdingers to the handyman. What's more, they wanted to know
what they could do about them.
</P>
<P>
   A mushroom in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   That is the bombshell that Andrea Martin of North Easton, Mass.
dropped in the handyman's lap. It was literally in the living room,
growing between the slider and the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The 'shroom began growing one day in September and continued
that day and a night, wrote Martin. She finally broke it off and
nothing more grew, until another came up this month.
</P>
<P>
   So, what to do about it?
</P>
<P>
   That's easily said, not done. You have to eliminate all
moisture; because mold _ and mushrooms _ will grow on almost any
moist surface, indoors or out.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate solution is to treat the area with a solution of
one part household bleach and three parts water. This will kill the
mold and might keep it from coming back, but if the moisture is not
eliminated, the problem will continue.
</P>
<P>
   To eliminate the dampness, aim a heat lamp or floor heater at
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The original water was probably caused by a leak; one source is
the slider itself. Make sure you keep open the little drain holes
that keep water flowing out of the grooves in the slider.
</P>
<P>
   Another leak source is the space under the slider, outside,
especially if there is not a full step down from threshold to
patio. If there is not a full step (7 1/2 inches) down from the
slider, it will always be a problem. Sometimes caulking joints in
the seams of the facia board will help.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Martin said the water is overflowing the gutter,
running behind the gutter, down the wall and the face of the
sliders, until it gets under the inside floor.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the gutter or the drip edge (the edge of the roof)
should be adjusted so that water dripping over the edge will drip
into the center of the gutter. Little else will correct this
problem.
</P>
<P>
   So, good luck, Andrea Martin. With some of that luck, and
perseverance, you can solve the problem.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Cracking and breaking bricks
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another show and tell for the handyman was from Charles Merhib
of Wellesley, Mass., who submitted pictures of his brick steps and
wondered why cracks appeared in the mortar joints and in the
bricks, and why some bricks actually broke off at their ends.
</P>
<P>
   As Merhib wrote, some years back a mason skimcoated the sides of
his 1949 concrete steps, and mortared brick on the treads and
flagstone on the landing.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, the mason was gone and the bricks began cracking
along the top through both brick and mortar, said Merhib. Cracks
also developed where the bricks overlap the risers, and there were
cracks in places where there was no apparent stress. The ends of
some bricks broke off where they overlap the riser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another mason said we need waterstruck brick, but those were
too misshapen to use. I even made concrete bricks to duplicate
bricks, but they did not hold up well either,'' Merhib said.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the cracks and what can be done about them? We thought
about simply laying bluestone slabs on the brick, or better yet,
taking off the brick and putting on a bluestone tread, Merhib said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the mason did everything right; except maybe putting
the bricks on their wide side on the treads instead of on their
narrow sides.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened, simply is this: Ordinary stress (movement of
the entire cast concrete steps) will cause cracks in the mortar. If
these cracks are allowed to remain, water gets into them, and in
winter it freezes, expanding the cracks and breaking bricks.
</P>
<P>
   The cracks across the front of the bricks and the breaks where
they overhang the riser are caused by stress; people step on the
end of the brick, pressing down where the brick overhangs the
riser; repeated stepping will crack and break the brick.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother with an overhang? It's good because it looks good and
allows toe room for people climbing the steps. It makes climbing
steps more comfortable. The fact that the bricks were laid on their
wide side aggravates the problem; bricks laid on their narrow sides
will resist cracking and breaking longer.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened to the handyman's steps, which had hard
brick
</P>
<P>
   properly mortared, but no brick is immune to stresses.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman's answer was to replace some of the bricks and keep
repointing (chipping out of old mortar and putting in new) where
and when needed. It is a matter of maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   But Merhib's idea of putting a bluestone slab on each step is
excellent. Take off the brick and use it in a patio or somewhere,
and mortar in a bluestone slab. Actually, they make bluestone
treads that will work very well and should fit those cast concrete
steps perfectly, allowing a slight overhang.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, Andrea Martin and Charles Merhib. There is plenty of
work, but I see nothing but success if you persevere. Then show and
tell again, triumphantly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NORTH CONWAY, N.H. _ Ina Steinhilber arrives at International
Mountain Climbing School on a recent Friday evening looking every
bit the Newbury Street gallery manager she is.
</P>
<P>
   Under her full-length faux fur coat, she wears a black
turtleneck, long black skirt, and black boots. Her dark hair is
pulled back tightly, and she carries a black leather bag over her
shoulder. Her smiles seem nervous, and she looks relieved to learn
_ as do the other three women here for a weekend ice climbing
course _ that none has tried the sport before.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday morning, Steinhilber, 28, the same woman who eyed the
climbing wall in her gym for 18 months before giving it a try, is
clinging to a 30-foot-tall slab of ice, a footlong ice tool in each
hand, the sharp picks carefully slung above her head into the
frozen wall, attired this time in layers of polypropylene,
Gore-Tex, and fleece. She has a helmet on her head and chemical
foot-warming packs in her plastic boots. The front teeth of the
crampons attached to the bottoms of those boots stick into the ice
like industrial-strength darts to support her weight, and from down
below classmate Diane Murphy is yelling, ``Way to go, Ina.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Herskovitz, 33, who owns a public relations firm, is
watching too, saying ``Look how graceful she is'' and then joking
``Why did we let her go first?'' Murphy, 36, who left a job as a
computer consultant to teach snowboarding in Maine, laughs with
her. When Steinhilber guides her pick into a pock in the ice, the
women on the ground murmur, ``Oh yeah, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   The instructors, Peg Immel, 56, of Lincoln, Mass., and Michelle
Jenkins, 37, of Jackson, N.H., are also tracking Steinhilber's
progress from the ground. ``You won't be able to see your feet over
that bulge,'' Immel shouts. ``Take small steps, get your crampons
straight in, and then stand up straight.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a long way from the climbing wall in Steinhilber's gym
and the one-day rock climbing workshop she did last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Steinhilber reaches the top and, ice picks in hand,
smiles to her classmates below. This time the smile is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never in a million years thought I'd like it as much as I
did,'' she says. ``I never even thought I could do it. There's a
great combination of fear, excitement, and then the thrill when you
actually reach the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Immel remembers that feeling, and reliving it is one reason she
teaches new rock and ice climbers. Immel, who owns Zuma Tex-Mex
Cafe in Boston's Fanueil Hall with her husband, Stephen, has been
offering these Women's Weekend Ice Climbing Retreats since last
winter. The retreat part comes in the two-night stay at Cranmore
Mt. Lodge, meals, a hot tub _ and a massage.
</P>
<P>
   Both days' climbs this weekend take place at a partly sunny spot
called Walk in the Woods, which is more like a very steep climb in
the woods, in the Frankenstein Cliffs area of the White Mountains,
a half-hour drive from North Conway.
</P>
<P>
   The women head into the backcountry early to stake out their
piece of ice in this popular climbing region. They trudge single
file, backpacks laden with clothing, food, hot drinks, water,
ropes, carabiners, harnesses, and other equipment. The crunch of
sparkling snow underfoot muffles their voices as they pass
surrounding cliffs dotted with the bright red or yellow specks of
other climbers moving slowly up the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Like rock climbing, ice climbing is gaining followers, though
more slowly. About 90 percent of the 50,000-plus, overwhelmingly
male readership of Climbing magazine participates in rock climbing,
while only 27 percent climbs ice, says editor and publisher Duane
Raleigh. ``The anecdotal evidence is that more women are out ice
climbing, and certainly over the past five years the sport has
grown,'' says Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice climbing,'' he adds, ``is more brutish, more like
construction work.''
</P>
<P>
   What women may lack in brute strength, says Immel, they
compensate for with flexibility, balance, and technique. ``I used
to say that the difference between the two is that rock climbing is
like ballet and ice climbing is like building a garage,'' she says.
``But the better you get, the more delicate it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Immel, a small, nimble woman, certainly moves delicately as she
scales a cliff to secure some ropes, her blond curls barely visible
under her helmet, her movements a quieter point and place than the
noisy hacks and kicks of her novice charges.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing, of course, is only part of the sport. There are the
added obstacles of staying warm, enduring a strenuous hike to the
climb location while toting heavy gear, and maintaining and
organizing an array of equipment. Potential dangers include
frostbite, sticking oneself with pick or crampons, falling chunks
and collapsing walls of ice, and avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   One climber in the group, 31-year-old Julie Walko of Arlington,
Va., left after a single day on the ice, saying, ``It's too cold.''
Sunday's afternoon temperature climbs 20 degrees higher than
Saturday's 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulties are part of the fun,'' says instructor
Jenkins, who always brings a thermos of spicy hot tea to share with
the climbers. ``Yes, about 75 percent of it is just hard work, but
the other 25 percent makes it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginners learn to climb by top rope, meaning a rope is secured
at the top of the cliff. A belay, a friction-based pulley system
that can hold thousands of pounds, connects the rope from the
climbers' harnesses to the belayer, the person on the ground
controlling the give. If a climber slips, she either won't fall at
all or will fall only a few inches as the rope stretches. More
advanced climbs involve climbers' working together, fixing the
ropes bit by bit, which means more room for error.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, after finishing the weekend course, says she's ready for
more. ``It's a really cool sport,'' she says. ``I think it's the
being really intensely focused on it. You're just so in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The route down the mountain is a quick and easy glissade (an
intentional slide on their backsides), using the ice tool for
rudder and brake, followed by the slow drive out of North Conway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so frustrated that I was stuck in traffic because I was
so excited to tell someone about the weekend,'' says Steinhilber.
``So I took out the (school's) brochure. I think I might take a
three-day mountaineering course.''

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I read of the death of Tom Landry, 75, the legendary coach
of the Dallas Cowboys, my mind went back to 1983 when I had the
privilege to interview him just before a championship game.
 &HT;    To the millions of Americans who watched him on TV, Landry
always seemed in control of the situation. Dressed impeccably, with
a tie and fedora hat, he was always extraordinarily calm. His face
seemed absolutely emotionless.
 &HT;    Why? ''My players had to believe I was in control,'' Landry was
quoted as saying. ''It would hurt them to see me losing it.''
 &HT;    But often he was not invincible. For the three years that
preceded my interview with him, the Cowboys lost the championship
game needed to get into the Super Bowl. For these reasons, his
attitudes on winning and losing were particularly interesting.
 &HT;    He gave God credit for victories, but never gave Him credit for
losses!
 &HT;    ''I believe my talent comes from the Lord, and whatever success
I've had is because of my belief in God,'' he told me. ''I believe
He has a plan for my life, and uses my influence to further His
kingdom. But God doesn't take sides in football games.''
 &HT;    How then, does God work?
 &HT;    ''I rely on Him to give me concentration and to be prepared to
do as well as I can,'' Landry said. For example, he said, in the
middle of a game, ''something will come to mind and I'll make a
decision to call a play. I don't know where the idea comes from _
whether God placed it in my mind or not. But I know He prepares us
to meet the trials of life.''
 &HT;    According to Rev. Leighton Farrell, his pastor at the time, when
people asked Landry if he prayed for victory, he replied, ''My
prayer is not to win, but that every person might play to the best
of his ability and that there be no major injuries.''
 &HT;    The day before I spoke with Landry, Philadelphia's head coach,
Dick Vermeil, who had led the Eagles from mediocrity to the Super
Bowl a couple of years earlier, resigned although he had years left
on his contract. ''I am emotionally burned out,'' Vermeil said
after a losing season.
 &HT;    Asked about that, Landry said, ''If you put your whole priority
on winning football games, you can be burned out when you lose.''
 &HT;    Before he committed his life to Christ in 1958, winning football
games WAS Landry's highest priority. During a Bible study in the
off-season at his home, he decided to transform his nominal
church-going Christianity, ''where God got lost in the shuffle,''
to a point where Christ would be the No. 1 priority in his life.
 &HT;    He said, ''I did not have a flash on the road to Damascus'' (a
dramatic conversion, like St. Paul). And the impact was gradual.
But in reading the Bible daily for 15 to 20 minutes, he developed a
new way of looking at people, his family and at winning and losing.
 &HT;    He was no longer as excited by either victory or defeat, and
began exuding a calm confidence that inspired others.
 &HT;    And he created an atmosphere in which players could grow
spiritually as well as physically. First, he invited players and
their wives to join a tea/Bible study. And a chapel service was
organized before every game.
 &HT;    The approach worked. Former star quarterback Roger Staubach
testified at his funeral, ''He was our rock, our hope, our
inspiration. He was our coach. Probably there were some players
that didn't love him, but all respected him. He was committed to us
and you don't find that type of commitment in life very often.''
 &HT;    His son, Tom Landry, Jr., told the congregation filled with Pro
Football Hall of Famers and Super Bowl champions, ''Tom Landry was
everything the world believed him to be. He was a man of virtue, of
high moral character, a man whose talents and hard work propelled
him to the top of his profession. Tom Landry never strayed from his
ideals. He remains a consistent shining example to all of us.''
 &HT;    Shortly after I interviewed Landry, the team lost the
championship to the Washington Redskins, led at the time by Coach
Joe Gibbs, another committed Christian. After the victory, every
Redskin fell on his knees on national TV and recited the Lord's
Prayer, led by Gibbs.
 &HT;    A day later, I called Landry and asked him if he had prayed for
victory. He laughed and replied, ''There's nothing wrong with
praying for victory, but God might get divided if there are
Christians on both sides.''

END MORE LIKELY TO BE A BANG, NOT A WHIMPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember economic slowdowns and major market corrections?
</P>
<P>
   They were regular features of economic life before we reached
Nirvana sometime in the mid-1990s. But with Alan Greenspan's new
harder-edge policy at the Federal Reserve, the chances of seeing
them again have increased. Greenspan has put the Fed on a collision
course with the economy and the stock market, heightening the odds
that the current period of perfection will end not with a whimper,
but with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ante is higher and the risks going forward are greater,''
said Mark Zandi, chief economist at RFA Dismal Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was back on Capitol Hill Wednesday, repeating
testimony he gave last week. That testimony is worth reading.
Greenspan has been saying for some time that the economy is too
strong and that it needs to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates four times now in response to that
strength, but so far there is precious little evidence the economy
is slowing down. Greenspan isn't happy about that. In his remarks,
he sounds the way your father might when he has reminded you four
times to clean up your room, but you still haven't done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I mean business, young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan didn't say that. He did say, however, that we have
developed a set of imbalances that ``unless contained threaten our
continuing prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those imbalances is the labor market, which is running
out of workers to fill open jobs. No one knows how low the jobless
rate can go without triggering inflation, but Greenspan and company
clearly have decided the current rate, 4 percent, is too low.
</P>
<P>
   The other imbalance is the stock market. Greenspan didn't say
stocks have to come down. Wednesday, he said the Fed wasn't
specifically targeting stock prices. But he did say the stock
market was contributing to the too-strong economy and that asset
values (stock prices) should ``increase no faster than household
incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at FleetBoston Financial
Corp., ``The only way he can slow the economy is to take some steam
out of the equity market.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayers's metaphor _ taking some steam out of the economy _
implies a certain level of precision. So does ``tapping on the
brakes.'' So does ``soft landing,'' a phrase Greenspan used
Wednesday before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that the Fed has the power to fine-tune the economy
and the stock market to bring about the desired results. But does
it, really? Or is monetary policy actually a crude instrument that
could bludgeon the market and the economy, rather than just poke
it?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer at FleetBoston, isn't
optimistic. O`Neill believes the technology stock market is a
speculative bubble that is bound to burst. ``You just don't let a
little air out of a bubble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that euphoria could give way to extreme pessimism,
sending the stock market into a steep dive. Is that likely? Who
knows? Is it possible? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Toppling the economy probably would require a harder push. The
US economy expanded at nearly a 6 percent pace in the second half
of 1999. The Fed would be more comfortable with a growth rate
between 3 and 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But could the Fed overshoot and get a more severe slowdown than
it wants? Some investors must think so. The stocks that represent
the old economy _ banks, home builders, retailers, manufacturers _
have been in a steep decline for months.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ned Riley, chief investment officer at State Street
Global Advisors, the Standard and Poor's index of regional bank
stocks is down 36 percent from its 1999 high; the index of
home-building stocks is down 43 percent; department store stocks
are down 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these stocks act as if they are discounting a
recession-like scenario,'' Riley said. He doesn't foresee that
recession. Nor does any other forecaster. But parts of the stock
market are nervous, and it is not hard to see why.
</P>
<P>
   The more resistant the stock market and the economy prove to be
to Greenspan's efforts to restrain them, the more he is going to
have to raise rates to get what he wants. The Fed chairman couldn't
have been too happy Wednesday when the Nasdaq index soared after he
finished speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The higher rates go, the greater the chance that the desired
soft landing turns into a hard one instead. ``We are in uncharted
territory,'' said FleetBoston's O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope Greenspan has a map to get us through it.

 MIT SPORTS LAB SEEKS INNOVATION THROUGH R&AMP;D  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The pitchers and catchers have reported to
Major League Baseball's spring training, and it is almost time for
one of longest-running issues in professional sports to be argued
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   When is a strike really a strike? When is a ball a ball?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a problem for someone at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to make too big a deal out of it, because I
know the phone's going to start ringing off of the hook _
especially with calls from the umpires' union,'' said Kim B. Blair,
director of MIT's new Laboratory for Sports Innovation. ``But the
technology for automatic strike zone detection, we think, is there.
We think we can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a market for it? Are the players going to like it?
Would the owners like it? That's what we need to find out,'' Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Laboratory for Sports Innovation strives to be for the
sports industry what MIT's Lincoln Laboratory has been to the
energy and defense industries, what the Laboratory for Computer
Science is to high technology and the Media Lab is to television
and newspapers _ a center for the research and development of new
designs and concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The sports lab's goal is to cater to the $4.7 billion sporting
goods industry, to media companies that spend billions of dollars
annually to broadcast sports, and to fans who simply want to attend
some games.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new designs and concepts developed by the lab recently
are a new softball that can be hit just as far as an old one, but
that hurts less when it strikes a player, and a cyclist's training
system that provides a rider with real-time data to correct
aerodynamic positioning.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for research and design seems limitless. A gel
that's rubbed on the hands could obviate the need for rock and
mountain climbers to build up calluses. New designs could improve
shoes, rackets, bats, and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of R&AMP;D that goes on in the business,
generally,'' said Bob McGee, editor of Sporting Goods Intelligence,
an industry newsletter. ``Amid all of the concern about logistics
and meeting price points and that kind of stuff, it's one of the
areas that's being cut first, especially if you are not one of the
big players in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And, observers say, even the big players often buy up smaller,
innovative companies or pay outsiders for their new product
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rawlings is the manufacturer of the radar ball, a baseball
that cannot be hit, but says how fast it is going when it strikes
the catcher's mitt,'' said Michael May, spokesman for the Sporting
Goods Manufacturers Association. ``It is based on computer chip
technology, and the design won the Product of the Year award at a
show in 1989. Rawlings manufacturers it, but it bought the design
from an an inventor somewhere in the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like this program at MIT would fit right into what
is a normal pattern in the industry,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has long
participated in research on sports and in the development of sports
products. Testing the impact of the new press box and 600 Club on
the production of home runs at Fenway Park several years ago and
developing sweet spots and power zones for more than 2,000
commercial tennis rackets are just two of many examples.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair and others at MIT saw a need to bring all of the work
under one roof, especially in light of the consolidation of the
aeronautics industry after the Cold War. ``With peace breaking out
everywhere, in aerospace there was some concern about, gee, what
else is this department going to do?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of engineers and designers, Blair, who specialized
in aeronautics at Purdue University, turned to sports.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Laboratory for Sports Innovation, which was
established in August, is to build up a budget of $2 million to $3
million over the next three years to finance the research and
development, with much of the money coming from companies that will
turn to MIT for its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first such sports development project at any US
university, Blair said. It competes internationally with only the
University of Sheffield and Cambridge University in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, students who have begun to sign up for courses at the
lab are presented with an intriguing educational experience, Blair
said. Part of the attraction is that in the aeronautics and
aerospace industries, for example, product and concept development
often take two decades and the labor of hundreds if not thousands
of engineers, he said. In the sports industry, designs can be
completed in a year or two by someone working alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports involves relatively familiar products and easily
grasped concepts,'' Blair said. ``Students are familiar with a
shoe, a climbing harness, a tennis racket. It's something they can
get their hands on. They understand how it works and how it feels,
and that is a big leg up in learning.''

IT'S A WONDERFUL INFLATIONARY SPIRAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: In ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' Sam Wainwright cabled Bedford
Falls from London authorizing his local office to advance George
Bailey up to $25,000 to help him. How much would this money be
worth in today's dollars?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.B.M., Burleson, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Assuming that the scene took place on Christmas Eve 1945,
Wainwright's offer was equivalent to $230,263 in current dollars,
according to an inflation calculator published by S. Morgan
Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   More inflation-adjusted figures from the 1946 film:
</P>
<P>
   The $8,000 Bailey Building and Loan deposit stolen by Henry
Potter is equal to $73,684 in current dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The $5,000 loan that William Bailey owed Potter in 1919 is like
$53,919 today.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1919, George Bailey clicked a drugstore lighter and
wished for a million dollars. Children today must wish for
$9,210,532 to be equally enriched.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's calculator uses Consumer Price Index statistics from
the Historical Statistics of the United States and the Statistical
Abstract of the United States. It's published on the Web at
www.westegg.com/inflation.

<P>
   Q: For many years, I had an American National Insurance policy.
Can you tell me if the company was purchased by someone else?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.W.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: American National Insurance continues to do business under
that name today and has 3.5 million policyholders. The company was
founded in 1905 and has its headquarters in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   If your policy was life insurance, call American National at
(800) 899-6806 to inquire about it. Health insurance queries should
be directed to (800) 899-6503. You also can contact the company
through its Web site, www.anico.com.

<P>
   Q: Which Colorado town holds a Sweet Pea Festival every summer?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: A weeklong Sweet Pea Festival is held every August in
Bozeman, Mont., to celebrate the arts. The festival includes 5K and
10K runs, Shakespeare in the Park, bluegrass music and country
dancing, attracting crowds of up to 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   This year's event is scheduled for Aug. 4-6 in the city's
Lindley Park.

WHY IS FOX SPOILING ALL OUR FUN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is Fox TV canceling ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' Surely not for reasons of taste. Certainly not
because of poor ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The decision must have something to do with the specter of a
monster lawsuit by the bride, and possibly one by the bridegroom,
too. (Although what could Rick Rockwell sue the network for?
Defamation of character? With a character like his?) The other 49
contestants might have a case too, a class action suit. Given
everything that's come to light about Rockwell, weren't they lured
onto the program under false pretenses? (I see a new Fox show
shaping up: ``Who Wants to Sue for Millions?'')
</P>
<P>
   The promise of more ``WWTMAM?'' was high on my list of Reasons
to Go On Living, a list that seems shorter every day. So I'm
disappointed. And yes, I know I should be ashamed of myself, but it
was so wonderfully tawdry. I want more, and I'm sure I'm not alone.
Never underestimate the appeal of really, really terrible TV.
(Could that be another new Fox show? ``Really, Really Terrible
TV''? Or have they done that one already?)
</P>
<P>
   `WWTMAM?'' made my week, although I suppose it's only fair to
admit it was a bad week. The big night found me all but immobilized
with back pain, switching back and forth between the finals of the
Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and ``WWTMAM?'' It goes without
saying that the dog show was infinitely more civilized than the
human show. Dazed as I was by pain, there were moments when the two
seemed to blend into one. I kept waiting for ``WWTMAM?'' host Jay
Thomas to pull back the contestants' lips to examine their teeth.
Was it my imagination, or did the chosen bride, Darva (``I did it
for a lark'') Conger, resemble a whippet? The bridegroom? A pit
bull, definitely. And not a well-trained, well-groomed example of
the breed. Down, boy. Heel! Some dogs will do anything for
attention.
</P>
<P>
   I loved it, every cheap, degrading minute of it. So what is
there to love about 50 young women offering to commit instant
televised matrimony with a rich man they've never met? It's a
perfect comment on our national obsession with money, an obsession
that's reached the point of total lunacy. ``WWTMAM?'' could have
been satire. Too bad it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``reality'' programming, a genre Fox TV pioneered. Given
revelations about Rockwell's past _ the restraining order, the
financial fudging _ I wouldn't be surprised to see him someday on
another Fox ``reality'' show, ``America's Most Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   What does ``WWTMAM?'' have to do with reality? What's real about
marrying somebody you've known for 30 seconds? That's pretty
un-real, even in Las Vegas, where you can get married faster than
you can get good seats for Siegfried &AMP; Roy. Not that I have
anything against getting married in Vegas. I've done it myself.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not climbing up on a high horse with all those people
condemning ``WWTMAM?'' and intoning about the sanctity of marriage.
Marriage is sacred for some; for others it's a financial
opportunity. That's always been true, and it always will be. On
``WWTMAM?'' we saw how far some women were willing to go for the
promise of money. It was sick. It was appalling. It was also
enthralling, hilarious, and even instructive.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they could save the show by changing the title to include
certain warnings: ``Who Wants to Marry an Alleged Multimillionaire
Who May be a Maniac?'' or ``Who Wants to Marry and Quickly Divorce
a Self-Described Multimillionaire and Win Cash and a Host of
Valuable Prizes?'' Or maybe just ``Love For Sale, Anyone?''

<P>
   My townsmen are up in arms. The letters to our local paper read:
``Liberties are being taken away.'' ``What freedom will they go
after next?'' ``I find it frightening . . . that this freedom can
be denied so easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue? The Marblehead Board of Health has banned smoking in
public places. This is the way a healthy democracy works. If enough
people object, they have redress through the voting booth. What
disturbs me far more, what in fact chills me to the bone, is that
powerful international corporations play by different rules. Their
conscious intent is to undermine the people's ability to act on
their own behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the telecommunications industry recently
appeared before the Board of Selectmen, bringing Marblehead face to
face with what happens when corporations collide with grass-roots
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   According to B. Blake Levitt, author of ``Electromagnetic
Fields: A Consumer's Guide to the Issues and How to Protect
Ourselves,'' before 1996 protesters were able to cite numerous
studies as well as data collected from foreign military bases that
indicated various health effects from nonionizing microwave
radiation _ generated by cell phones _ among them increased
permeability of the blood-brain barrier; damage to the immune
system; numerous cancers; and DNA damage. Unlike the output of a
100-watt light bulb, 100 watts of ultrahigh frequencies in the
microwave band are maximally absorbed by human tissue, with the
result that long-term low-level exposure has been implicated in
increases in breast cancer, leukemia, cataracts, immune
suppression, and brain tumors. When citizens pointed out these
findings to town officials, they frequently responded by refusing
to accept cell phone towers.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Bill of 1996 removed this pesky obstacle
to expanding cell phone use by taking away a community's right to
refuse to site antennae. Discussion of health or environmental
effects has been prohibited at public hearings, since such
considerations are irrelevant to tower siting. Although this raises
issues of free speech, as well as public policy questions about
government's role in protecting the health of citizens, it takes
time and money to move these issues through the courts. Every year
that passes, more and more antennae go up.
</P>
<P>
   After 1996, some elected officials continued to resist the lure
of the lavish licensing fees cell phone companies were offering.
Some towns set up moratoriums while they pondered the issues.
Others developed siting ordinances that confined towers to areas
with large setbacks (1,500 feet is optimal) from residences,
schools, hospitals, and nursing homes. This put towns like
Marblehead, with its troublesome 500-feet setback requirement,
directly in the path of the grid of wireless communications planned
to extend seamlessly across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   How does a corporation get what it wants when the will of the
people opposes it? The National Rifle Association makes campaign
contributions to candidates willing to ignore the wishes of the
majority. W.R. Grace withheld information from consumers that would
warn them that its insulation contained asbestos. Monsanto uses its
clout with the FDA to make sure that genetically altered foods are
not labeled so that in the future it will be impossible to trace
any harm they may cause. The tobacco industry upped the amount of
an addictive substance in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications industry has taken another tack. It is
presently proposing that our state Legislature create a category it
calls a minor facility, which includes any antennae placed on or in
an existing structure, even within historic districts. Such
``minor'' facilities, no matter how high their power output, would
be subject to a statewide ``streamlined permitting process'' that
would override local bylaws.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, home rule. Farewell, local control.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, ``The Working Life,'' Joanne Ciulla laments that we
have sacrificed the freedom of the workplace for the freedom of the
marketplace, enslaving ourselves to our employers in order to
maximize our options as consumers. As corporations have grown large
enough to dominate and undermine the political life of a once free
people, they have promoted the convenience of their products while
using every means at their disposal to downplay any damage they may
do the user. (It is no coincidence that Congress has ended its
funding of independent research into the effects of microwave
radiation.) It seems to me that, as cell phone owners, Americans
are all too willing to sacrifice the freedom of the polling place
for the freedom of the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Are we still citizens, or merely consumers? Are we willing to
let corporations silence all protest? Have we actually reached the
point where the only vote that counts is a purchase?

   Patrick Thornberg and Max Brandl, who are both 4, and Ross
Barlow, 3, are huddled over big building blocks, stacking and
moving them around until they occupy a third or so of the block
room's floor space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a bread factory. It's hard work,'' says Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bread goes here,'' says Ross, pointing to a block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh,'' they warn in unison as the factory collapses. ``Let's
make it again,'' Patrick suggests cheerfully. &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another room, Sarena Borer, 3, sits alone on the floor,
oblivious to the hubbub around her. She is bent over unit blocks
that she has fit tightly against one another in a large square.
Most of them lie flat, a few are set vertically, and she's
arranging Fisher Price people to lie on the flat ones. She's too
engrossed to want to chat much.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a house,'' she says finally. ``Everyone is asleep.''

   Watching 3- and 4-year-olds at the Preschool Experience in
Newton, Mass., you might not guess they were doing anything more
than having fun. Guess again. There's serious learning going on
here, from building pre-math skills to gaining social competence.
</P>
<P>
   Blocks are the single most important toy a young child can have,
and block play is the single most productive activity, say early
childhood educators. ``If I could give my child only one toy, it
would be blocks,'' says Micki Corley, Preschool Experience
codirector.
</P>
<P>
   But educators are noticing a disturbing trend: As the
technological era reaches down to even our youngest children and as
there is more emphasis on standardized testing and rote learning,
blocks too often are forgotten in the toy chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know preschools where the block room has been dismantled,
where blocks are either a treat or a punishment, or where they are
available only for 20 minutes on Fridays,'' says Karyn Wellhousen,
an early childhood educator from Spanish Fort, Ala., who
specializes in block play. At a conference last fall for the
National Association for the Education of Young Children, she urged
teachers to bring blocks back to prominence in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelock College professor Ed Klugman worries that blocks also
have diminished stature in parents' eyes, too. That toys today are
more electronic and less open-ended reflects a societal trend that
more is better. ``(Parents) can't believe something worthwhile
comes from plain, ordinary blocks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but does it ever. So much so that blocks are part of the
curriculum even in third grade at the Pacific Oaks Children's
School in Pasadena, Calif., a cutting-edge lab school of Pacific
Oaks College. ``When they study families, they might replicate
their house in blocks with two or three floors, or their
neighborhood in vast, complex structures,'' says director Jane
Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   That block play is in decline saddens Harriet K. Cuffaro, the
nation's leading authority on the subject. ``Blocks are fundamental
materials,'' she says. ``They respond to every aspect of
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   --They're open-ended. As children grow, blocks grow with them.
``They're an unstructured material,'' says Klugman. ``There's no
right or wrong way to play with them and they encourage imagination
and creativity: Children can be the scriptwriters instead of having
a script fed to them,'' as they do when they play with toys that
are spinoffs from a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   --They lay the foundation for cognitive learning. Unit blocks, a
basic wooden block that is preferred most by educators (it's also
among the most expensive but Cuffaro says they are worth saving for
or asking relatives to pitch in to buy), have an established
proportional system that helps with pre-math skills. There's the
basic block and then a double, which is twice as long, or a half
block, which is half as long, etc. Cuffaro says that as children
discover these equivalents for themselves, their understanding of
relationships among or between objects grows. Cuffaro is professor
emeritus of Bank Street College in Manhattan and curriculum
director of the City and Country School, also in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   --They teach about spatial relationships. A child learns to
manipulate her body within an area without knocking over the
blocks. She also learns what makes them balance, what makes them
tip, and what the attributes are of different shapes and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   --They promote social growth. ``If one of the skills we hope to
develop in children is a sense of cooperation and working as a
team, nothing teaches better than blocks,'' says Rosenberg. As
children build together, they negotiate and help one another, much
as Patrick, Ross, and Max did with the bread factory. Corley says
she's seen over and over again how a preschooler who's not socially
adept can make a best friend in the block room and feel emboldened
enough to extend the skill into other areas of play with other
children. ``Block play is a very nonthreatening way to encourage
social interaction because the task is spontaneous and
child-driven,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Children typically go through seven stages in block play, a sign
that they are growing and developing. As they build on previous
experiences, construction becomes more complex, but even a
5-year-old, playing with blocks for the first time, will go through
the same stages in the same sequence (minus the infant stage and
albeit at a faster pace):
</P>
<P>
   --Carrying and dumping. Beginning at about 5 months, infants
tend to carry individual blocks around, mouth them, carry them from
one container to another, dump them out, and start over. They might
also bang blocks together or against other objects. This is all
about exploring the senses, says Wellhousen, who is coauthor of
``Revisiting Tradition: Block Play in Early Childhood'' (Delmar).
</P>
<P>
   --Stacking. Toddlers can spend lots of time piling blocks up and
knocking them down, or laying them flat on the floor from end to
end (a ``road'') or side to side to make a solid square. Cardboard
``brick'' blocks are good for this age: They help with large motor
skills and spatial relationships. Colored blocks and blocks of
different shapes can be introduced now.
</P>
<P>
   --Bridging. When a child lays one block horizontally across two
verticals, he's learning about balance. This stage, usually reached
about age 3, involves lots of repetition and no particular goal but
a fair amount of problem solving. ``He has to move the base blocks
in order to accommodate the top block,'' says Wellhousen.
</P>
<P>
   --Enclosures. Reaching this stage shows a significant cognitive
leap, says Wellhousen: A child has to figure out when to turn the
blocks to form an oval or square. The trial and error takes lots of
patience and can be thoroughly engrossing. This can be a good time
to introduce Duplos and Bristle blocks; even though they are
``manipulatives,'' not blocks, they expand on stacking and bridging
skills and help with small-motor muscle tone.
</P>
<P>
   --Patterns. In this stage, children are satisfied only when
their structure is perfectly even, with sides symmetrically in
balance. There can be architectural flourishes at this stage, with
triangle shapes on top of towers, for instance, and a lot of
attention to aesthetic detail. Corley likes the specialty blocks
(skyscraper, castle) that feed into this stage, but purists would
avoid them, preferring blocks that don't influence the play.
</P>
<P>
   --Early representational. At about 4 or 5, a child begins to
give a name to her construction, but only after she has built it.
In other words, says Cuffaro, there's no intentionality; she is
creating forms as a kind of architectural experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   --Later representational. Now there is intentionality: He
decides beforehand what to build and has a plan. In addition, says
Cuffaro, he becomes part of the play, using his structure as a prop
to re-create familiar scenes: garage, school, house, hospital. This
stage can last for years; the older children are, the more
intricate the structure and props, and the richer the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children re-create their experience to express it,'' says
Cuffaro. ``Giving it form helps them make sense out of it. For
children who don't have the vocabulary we do to talk about their
lives, it serves the same purpose as talking does for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents and teachers play a big role in keeping play safe. At
the Preschool Experience, for instance, no big block structure can
be taller than a child's shoulders lest blocks topple on them.
</P>
<P>
   But we walk a fine line between facilitating play and getting
overly involved in it, which can undermine play. Rosenberg tells
parents to encourage problem solving if two children disagree _
``Where else can you put that block so it doesn't disturb what Joey
built?'' _ and to ask questions that will expand the play. Watching
three children build a garage recently after a field trip, she
asked, ``I'm remembering the garage we saw. How did cars get in and
out?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramps!'' they said, looking at one another excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   Wellhausen, however, cautions, ``Don't try to push them ahead to
the next stage by modeling play.'' While a child may be able to
duplicate what you show him, he won't have learned it. ``Kids need
to have that `Aha!' moment, when they discover it on their own,''
says Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of moments like that at the Preschool Experience.
``We have block play in some form every day,'' says Corley. The
block room is ideal for big construction but there are also 10
different kinds of blocks in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different blocks serve different purposes,'' says Corley,
grasping one of her favorites, the hexagon block. Made in graduated
sizes of soft wood, the shape of this block invites you to wrap
your hands around it. ``It's great for kids who need help with
small muscle tone,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, Sky Striar, 3, and Shira Lehmann, 3, are using
Skyscraper blocks on a table in the 4-year-olds' room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a person on top because I wanted to,'' Sky tells a
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you put her on top of here instead?'' says Shira,
pointing to a lower spot. ``It's gonna fall soon,'' she warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' says Sky. Later, as the two join some boys in the block
room, where they all decide to build a duck, Sky tells Shira,
``You're a good person to build with.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Although cigarette smoking is down nationwide
among teenagers, 1 in 6 eighth-graders are active smokers,
according to a study by the University of Michigan.

PERHAPS THE INTERNET ISN'T AS LONELY AS FEARED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two days ago, a shocking study out of Stanford University
concluded that the Internet is creating a nation of lonely people,
wired Eleanor Rigbys who spend less time at such socially
productive activities as watching television (gasp!) and shopping
in stores. According to the breathless report, a staggering
minority _ yes, minority _ of Internet users attend fewer social
events and spend less time with family and friends. And even e-mail
threatens to destroy the social fabric and pull people apart. The
scientific evidence? ``You can't share a coffee or a beer with
somebody on e-mail or give them a hug,'' said Norman Nie, co-author
of the report and director of Stanford's Institute for the
Quantitative Study of Society.
</P>
<P>
   The geniuses at Stanford contend that technology is turning us
into hug-deprived misanthropes. Their research, however, conflicts
with a recent study of our own. Instead of looking at Internet
loners, we interviewed Internet lovers, would-be Romeos who go
online looking for a lifelong squeeze. And the results are
astounding: Of all the men who conduct online advertising campaigns
for a wife, some 50 percent end up in the arms of a lovely lady
named Amy. Sigh. E-mail brings them together.
</P>
<P>
   Money, it turns out, can buy you love online _ as long as you
make the right offer.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Rod Barnett, a.k.a. Mr. www.10K4aWife.com. Last year,
this St. Louis businessman launched a Web site offering a $10,000
reward to the person who introduces him to his future wife. ``No,
there is nothing wrong with me,'' he writes on the site, ``and I
can assure you that I am not desperate.'' Not lacking in
confidence, he goes on to describe his ideal mate: a Barbie-esque
brunette with humanitarian interests, compassion, and other
qualities that come in handy in the Miss America pageant. His
motto: ``Fate is what happens when you fail to take charge.'' Theme
song: That syrupy thing from ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B: Ed Ryder, a.k.a. Mr. www.searchingforher.com. Last
month, this Pennsylvania native put up a Web site offering a reward
of at least $25,000 for a spouse. The catch: He linked the prize to
the stock of of Sedona Corp., an Internet start-up in Limerick, Pa.
``I want to make it known that I am not desperate, I am not lonely,
I am merely unfulfilled,'' he says. A three-time graduate of Dale
Carnegie confidence-building courses who is currently in between
opportunities in ``the lawn care business,'' he describes himself
as ``the type of person who stops traffic to save a turtle.'' He
also outlines his entire life story: He was the last kid picked for
kickball, got bullied in junior high, and once had a harrowing
incident involving a G.I. Joe action figure and a bathroom. (Trust
me, that's more than you need to know.)
</P>
<P>
   So, is the Internet an alienating medium that turns would-be
lovers into loners? It's quite the opposite, Barnett, 36, says.
``It's ideal for niche marketing,'' he explains. ``You have to say,
`I like to snowboard in my underwear' if that's who you are.' ''
Precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Barnett announced on the site that he is ``seeing
a very wonderful lady named Amy exclusively.'' She's a stewardess
from Dallas who is said to resemble the actress Denise Richards.
``I want people to realize that they were wrong if they said this
was crazy,'' Barnett said from his St. Louis office. ``They were
wrong. Look what I got.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ryder, 34, has another story. Since launching his site, he
has been inundated with requests from the media but hasn't exactly
been flooded with potential dates. The site is attracting a fair
amount of traffic. But Ryder confesses that most of the visitors
are coming from a pornography site that is listing his Web address
in its joke section. ``I feel like a schmuck,'' he says. ``People
are laughing at me. I'm taking my embarrassment threshold to new
levels.'' If it doesn't work out, he figures he'll try an
introduction service in Russia. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder put all his stock in the Internet appeal _ both literally
and figuratively. ``The campaign is a failure,'' he says.
``Something must be wrong.'' Maybe it's the reward. He bought a
chunk of stock in Sedona, which hasn't exactly made him a killing.
It was trading on the NASDAQ at $3 3/4 a share last week; if the
stock stays flat, the reward remains $25,000. But if it goes up to
$25 a share, the award becomes $50,000; if it hits $50, the reward
jumps to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   What do the folks at the Securities and Exchange Commission
think of this offer? ``We don't do family law,'' says spokesman
John Heine. ``But a good wife is priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer could be subject to federal and state security
regulations, says Northeastern University law professor Hope Lewis,
since it links another interest to the performance of a stock. But
it's unlikely anyone would ever investigate this bizarre offer,
Lewis adds.
</P>
<P>
   As for the folks at Sedona, they would like to keep a cool
distance from Ryder. ``He just happens to be a shareholder, and we
don't want to meddle in this guy's personal dreams,'' says Mike
Mulshine, Sedona's director of investor relations. ``But God,
what's a guy to do to meet a nice girl? It's so hard for young
people to meet these days.''
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the Stanford report, maybe that's because they're
spending too much time online. But according to our exhaustive
study, some half of the aspiring grooms who offer rewards online
end up happily ever after. Why is the other half so unsuccessful?
Our theory: He's only accepting handwritten letters delivered via
snail mail. Barnett was perfectly happy to accept e-mail
solicitations (and as he says, ``Look what I got.'') So ignore the
hysteria over hug-free e-mail. The Stanford researchers don't have
a clue: They went looking for loners in all the wrong places.

   LONDON _ To many, Cary Grant was the embodiment of the British
male. Even with that accent, he always betrayed a roughness beneath
his suavity. It's hard to imagine him _ or the likes of Agent 007 _
living at home with mum.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that's what Britain has become: a nation of
Mummy's Boys.
</P>
<P>
   A new Social Trends report, compiled by Britain's Office of
National Statistics, reveals that one in three British men between
the ages of 20 and 35 still live at home with their parents. And
more than half of those between the ages of 20 and 24 do so.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, not even one-fourth of all British males aged
20 to 35 still enjoyed the cushy life at their parent's place.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 15 percent
of American men aged 25 to 34 still live at home, while 59 percent
of men aged 18 to 24 do so.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers here blame the British phenomenon on a number of
factors.
</P>
<P>
   For one, British adults are waiting longer to tie the knot: Over
the last 10 years, the average age at which men get married has
climbed from 26 to nearly 30; for women it has gone from 24 to
nearly 27.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, a growing number of British adults are forced
to remain at home, having been made economic refugees by low-paying
entry-level jobs and the skyrocketing costs of housing.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a house in London, for example, now tops
$244,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though, the trend doesn't seem to extend to females here.
According to the study, twice as many men as women stayed at home.
Only one in six women are still with their parents by the time they
reach 35.
</P>
<P>
   This begs the question: Is something beyond financial
constraints tying men to the parental hearth?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it appears to be mummy herself.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Heffernan, for example, admits he's a mummy's boy, but
he's far from ashamed. What's more, the 27-year-old part-time
telemarketer has no immediate plans to leave his parent's spacious
home in suburban London.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mummy) gets me up in the morning, she makes all my dinners,
she runs the bath, makes my bed usually, irons all my clothes,
washes my clothes,'' he said. ``She loves it. It wouldn't be the
same if I wasn't here. She wouldn't know what to do with herself.''
</P>
<P>
   The only downside? Keeping girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be difficult if you go out to a club and meet girls.
I've brought a couple of girls back before and had to kick them out
early in the morning, and usually it doesn't go over too well,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Heffernan does hope to save money while at home so that _
eventually _ he can buy his own house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I move out at 35, I've hopefully got 40 years left to
live on my own,'' he reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   In general, researchers say that girls usually enjoy less
freedom than boys while living at home, and so are more anxious to
fly the coop, even if they aren't ready to marry. Two-thirds of
women rent before buying, but only one-third of men do.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these researchers say women mature at a faster
pace than young men. Many women in their twenties are at their best
and already can be startlingly self-confident. Men, though, may not
really begin to grow up until they reach about 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young women in Britain are becoming more financially
independent, and just more independent in general,'' said Carol
Summerfield, a co-editor of the Social Trends report. ``And young
women are the ones who are more likely to move out of their old
homes and in with an older partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists are also keen to point out that there's less
pressure on British males these days to be macho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, the heroes of the day were Clint Eastwood
and (Sean Connery's) James Bond, who would never have been seen
running home to mum for a cup of tea,'' said Dr. Mick Cooper, a
psychologist at Brighton University. ``Now there is no shame
attached to being at home.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the prospect of a child living their adult years in
the comfort of their old home makes some parents shudder with fear.
But many are overjoyed at the thought of keeping their offspring at
Chez Mum and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kenny, a columnist for The Daily Telegraph, said this
return to the nest should be viewed as a positive signal of the end
of the generation wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in their twenties and thirties now get along a lot
better with people in their forties, fifties and sixties,'' said
Kenny, whose own sons, in their twenties, still live at home.
</P>
<P>
   She said it's wonderfully useful to have her sons around to do
things like deconstruct ``The Simpsons'' or help research something
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Sue Arnold, mother of three young boys, said
she can't imagine her sons living with her at 30.
</P>
<P>
   She said there should be a distinct winding down of comforts in
all homes _ no more ironing, no more sticky toffee pudding and,
above all else, regular rent payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should flush the little darlings out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, of course, isn't the only country to have witnessed a
rise in the number of adults remaining in their parent's homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the number of adults still living with parents has
grown considerably over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   And, in some countries, it has always been considered normal for
men to stay at home. In Italy, nearly half of all men live at home
until they marry. But this is a place in which men who do not live
at home generally call their mothers, on average, three times a
week, married or not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be some time before such an arrangement becomes
socially acceptable in the United States, where living at home is
often synonymous with wimpishness.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider last year's hit by the Atlanta-based female
singing trio TLC, which even coined a new term for unsuitable
suitors who still live at home with their mothers _ scrubs.

SINDEN, TEAM AGREE WITH SUSPENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects Sinden's whereabouts when the decision to suspend waas
made by the NHL.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Bruins president and general manager Harry
Sinden said the team supports the NHL's decision to suspend
defenseman Marty McSorley for the remainder of the regular season
and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden was on his way to New York when the leage decided on the
supplementary discipline of the Monday night incident in Vancouver
involving McSorley and Donald Brashear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever suspension the league handed out, the Bruins and
myself were prepared to accept as the fair one and the right one,''
said Sinden. ``The disciplinary procedure of the NHL is something a
person like myself and (Edmonton GM) Glen Sather have had a hand in
putting into place. We think it's a very good one, and we think
it's administered by very competent people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team in no way finds this excusable and does not condone
these kinds of actions from any player and never has. We've
witnessed over the years a number of them both as victims and as
the guilty party in some instances and never have condoned any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley's future in Boston remains a question mark. He is
signed through the year and will become an unrestricted free agent
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty and I are going to talk,'' said Sinden. ``Any answer I
make to that right now is something that would be construed, if I
said yes or no, one way or another, and it shouldn't be because
Marty and I are going to sit down and talk. I will say this: he's a
Bruin, he's part of our family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't find this type of action excusable. On the other
hand, we will lend our support now that he's been punished and
supplementary discipline has been handed down. We will lend our
support to Marty as a Bruin and as a member of our team and do what
we can to help him from this day forward. I'm not quite sure what
that will entail.''
</P>
<P>
   What it might entail, Sinden said, is an effort to show that
this was an act that was out of character for McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, he's very remorseful at this point,'' said Sinden,
who spoke with McSorley Wednesday. ``He feels ashamed. He's full of
shame. He's under a great deal of stress right now. He's shaken by
the whole thing. If we can help show that this wasn't him, this act
was not Marty. I know we only had him on the team for a short
period of time, but I talked to a number of people about Marty
McSorley before I signed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some wonderful opinions about him. I've talked to some
people in the last couple of days who know him much better than I
do, and they all confirmed to me that this was out of character for
him. He's been 17 years in the league; he's been a policeman for
every team he's been with. It's a role that's acceptable to the
fans, by the league, by each team. He's found himself in trouble
from time to time, but I think over 17 years, he's done very, very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden has been answering questions all year about the
controversies surrounding his club. There were the holdouts, the
injuries, the coaching controversy, the Joe Murphy debacle, and now
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the worst year, I'll tell you that,'' said Sinden.
``It hasn't been pleasant. This is just another thing on top of it
all. It's something we're trying to get straightened out now.
Frankly, that's a bigger concern, the way this team plays, than
anything for me at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   All of McSorley's teammates, for the most part, believed that
McSorley was going to be banished for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people assumed that's what it was going to
be,'' said goalie Byron Dafoe, who is in Boston awaiting word on
the extent of his knee injury. ``Obviously it's a pretty hefty
suspension, the most ever. I feel bad for Marty because I think
genuinely deep down he really didn't mean to do what he did. Hockey
is a reaction, spontanaeity type of sport, and I think he showed
true remorse in his statements right after. I think the suspension
is severe and probably fair. I feel bad for Marty because he's
really not that type of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said the incident was painful for everybody, and he said
he thought there was some bad luck involved as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything went wrong in the way that it unfolded for
Marty,'' said Dafoe. ``He could've maybe caught his cheek and not
his temple, if Brashear had fallen on his side or forward and
hadn't landed on his head. Everything went the wrong way for Marty
there. It made it look that much worse and thus the punishment has
to be that much worse. Thank God it caught his helmet and not
directly on his temple because there could've been some severe
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe and Anson Carter, who were injured in Monday night's game,
both underwent MRIs Wednesday. Dafoe's right knee is injured, while
Carter has a shoulder problem.

 &HT;    DESPITE GAINS IN DRUG WAR, MEXICO UNDER PRESSURE TO CATCH THE
COUNTRY'S MOST NOTORIOUS DRUG KINGPINS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Feb. 26 And Thereafter.

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ One rumor puts the Arellano Felix brothers in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly they dress as handsomely as Versace models and blend
in among stars thanks to the millions they make as Mexico's most
successful drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   But other reports, especially from U.S. law enforcement agents,
say several of the six brothers are probably in this industrial
border city, where they are believed to enjoy the protection of
police that are too afraid, too bought off or too incompetent to
capture them.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington prepares for its annual anti-drug
``certification'' ritual next month, Mexico's continuing failure to
catch the Arellano brothers or other top fugitive drug kingpins is
likely to surface as a sore point.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday(March 1), the White House will release a list of
countries the Clinton administration believes should be
``certified'' as reliable drug-fighting partners of the United
States. Those rejected by the White House or by Congress, which
reviews the list, face trade sanctions or the loss of U.S. economic
aid.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Mexico _ whose booming exports have made it
the second largest U.S. trading partner _ is cooperating better
than ever in the past with U.S. officials and has upped its
seizures of drugs in the last year. It will probably be certified.
But Mexico's ``unwillingness or its inability'' to capture major
traffickers remains a serious shortcoming and a poor reflection on
its police forces, said one U.S. official familiar with Mexican law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican police are one of the worst if not the worst
police force in Latin America,'' said the frustrated U.S. official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   White House anti-drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who generally
believes Mexico is committed to the drug war, also said ``the
single most overwhelming threat coming out of the drug
organizations is corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a central demonstration of the problem,'' he said
in a recent interview in Mexico City, ``it's in Tijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To what extent are state police and local police in Tijuana
able to confront those huge criminal organizations? The answer is
pretty pathetic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Constantine, who last year retired as director of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, has often publicly hammered
Mexico, claiming that authorities here have continually blown
opportunities to arrest the Arellanos and other kingpins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really disagree with these criticisms,'' said Eduardo
Ibarrola, the Mexican Deputy Attorney General for International
Affairs. As for corruption, he said, ``we are working really hard
at cleaning house.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Arellanos appear to have vanished, Ibarrola
argued, shows that the traffickers fear the heat has been turned up
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years ago the Arellanos were openly living and traveling
everywhere, and they were not really hiding,'' Ibarrola said. ``As
a result of (our) investigations, they are running ... Now they are
really scared that we are going to arrest them, one way or another,
sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arellano family, which inherited its smuggling ring from a
second cousin who was arrested in 1989, has been linked to scores
of killings of police, prosecutors and others in this area. One of
the brothers, Francisco, has been imprisoned in connection with the
1993 killing of the Roman Catholic cardinal of Guadalajara. The
cardinal died in a hail of bullets at an airport in an attack
reportedly intended for rival traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Arellano, the brother who allegedly runs the gang's
execution squads, has been on the FBI's 10-Most-Wanted list since
1997. A U.S. federal indictment awaits him and other members of the
gang in Southern California _ if only Mexican police could catch
them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an increase in drug seizures by Mexican authorities last
year and a program to train a new federal anti-drug force, between
55 and 60 percent of the cocaine that enters the United States is
still shipped through Tijuana and other border cities in Mexico.
Much of the marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine smuggled into the
United States are of Mexican origin.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico allocated more than $500 million of its own money last
year for eradication of poppy and marijuana fields, and
interdiction of drugs. Yet, U.S. officials generally say they've
seen no significant drop in the quantities of narcotics smuggled
via the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called overwhelming the border,'' said San Diego U.S.
Customs Service chief investigator Ed Logan, describing
traffickers' strategy. For every seizure customs agents make,
perhaps a dozen make it across.
</P>
<P>
   Last week(Feb. 18), agents detained a well-dressed Mexican
couple who were driving a new sport-utility vehicle into San Diego
from Tijuana that was packed with an estimated $1 million worth of
cocaine hidden in a false compartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the group with the greatest success at interdiction
last year was the Mexican Navy, which seized more than 25 tons of
cocaine from ships sailing from South America up to the Mexican
Pacific coast. The Navy's seizures accounted for more than 67
percent of all the cocaine intercepted last year in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has ``an adolescent pre-occupation with nationalism''
that makes its law enforcement authorities sensitive about the
appearance that Americans are telling them what to do, a U.S.
official also said. But over the last year, Mexico's willingness to
share information has ``markedly improved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, however, Mexico suffered an embarrassing setback in
image when it failed to arrest a state governor after implicating
him in drug trafficking. Mario Villanueva, the former governor of
Quintana Roo state, vanished just days before he was going to be
arrested. He allegedly used his office and state police to assist a
cocaine cartel based in Cancun and the northern border city of
Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical Mexicans viewed Villanueva's escape as a sign
government agents were bribed or told to let him go. McCaffrey and
some other U.S. officials are more charitable. They say they either
don't know what happened or believe Mexican authorities honestly
couldn't keep tabs on Villanueva's private airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico's Baja California state, where Tijuana is located,
numerous state and federal police have long been suspected of
consorting with the Arellanos. In 1997, a former state attorney
general was suspected of assisting in the execution of a
Tijuana-based federal police commander. At least a dozen
prosecutors have died in assassinations since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy State Attorney General Guadalupe Olga Jimenez said
Tijuana is currently in the throes of a major turf war over drug
trafficking that's resulted in at least 64 violent gangland-style
killings since January.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't know if the war is directly linked to the Arellano
family; investigating organized crime and smuggling is the
responsibility of Mexico's federal police, she said. But the
federal police, she said, haven't asked her to turn over any of the
64 drug-related homicides she's investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez admitted corruption still haunts the state police. Last
year, 70 out of about 400 officers were fired for corruption or
other offenses. She said training has improved, however, along with
safeguards to prevent her officers from committing crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my officers are armed with guns that are inventoried,''
she said. ``If one of those arms is used in a homicide we will know
it was committed by someone in this office.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is pinning much of its strategy against traffickers in
Tijuana and other border cities on a new 1,500-strong anti-drug
squad under the auspices of the federal Attorney General's office.
About 11,000 newly constituted Federal Preventive Police officers
are also assigned to fight organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey praised Mexico for adopting a system of vetting for
the special squads, but he said the groups are still ``anemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruits are very young and receive only about a month's
special training. When you're starting a police force, he said, it
takes 5 to 15 years before people are skilled enough to even
qualify as sergeants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need to do is mentor them,'' said U.S. Customs
Commissioner Ed Kelly, a former New York police commissioner who
directed police reform in Haiti. ``You're not going to change
people with a one-month training course.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was in San Diego recently observing his agents make
seizures of drugs coming across the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, U.S. DEA agents are training members of Mexico's
special squads stationed in Baja California. And both sides are
engaging in daily bilateral discussions about how to catch
traffickers, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the
situation here.
</P>
<P>
   But an atmosphere of distrust still prevails. As one U.S.
official on the border put it, ``We have the experience to know
whom we can work with and whom we should stay away from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do our job without (the Mexican police),'' the
official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, added. ``It is
frustrating at times. The work is not always good. But what's our
other option?''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Blancornelas, a Tijuana newspaper editor who the Arellanos
nearly killed in an alleged assassination attempt two years ago,
doesn't think much of the new federal police yet. Blancornelas,
editor of Zeta, is known for his coverage of trafficking and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no investigations going on,'' Blancornelas alleged.
``The only thing going on is they stop cars and check for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two choices for the police,'' he added. ``You take
good money from the traffickers, much more than you get as a cop.
Or you simply leave the traffickers alone so you stay out of
trouble.''

 &HT;    MUMMY MAKES THEM DO IT: MORE BRITISH MEN STAYING, ENJOYING
COMFORTS OF HOME

   LONDON _ To many, Cary Grant was the embodiment of the British
male. Even with that accent, he always betrayed a roughness beneath
his suavity. It's hard to imagine him _ or the likes of Agent 007 _
living at home with mum.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that's what Britain has become: a nation of
Mummy's Boys.
</P>
<P>
   A new Social Trends report, compiled by Britain's Office of
National Statistics, reveals that one in three British men between
the ages of 20 and 35 still live at home with their parents. And
more than half of those between the ages of 20 and 24 do so.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, not even one-fourth of all British males aged
20 to 35 still enjoyed the cushy life at their parent's place.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 15 percent
of American men aged 25 to 34 still live at home, while 59 percent
of men aged 18 to 24 do so.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers here blame the British phenomenon on a number of
factors.
</P>
<P>
   For one, British adults are waiting longer to tie the knot: Over
the last 10 years, the average age at which men get married has
climbed from 26 to nearly 30; for women it has gone from 24 to
nearly 27.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, a growing number of British adults are forced
to remain at home, having been made economic refugees by low-paying
entry-level jobs and the skyrocketing costs of housing.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a house in London, for example, now tops
$244,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though, the trend doesn't seem to extend to females here.
According to the study, twice as many men as women stayed at home.
Only one in six women are still with their parents by the time they
reach 35.
</P>
<P>
   This begs the question: Is something beyond financial
constraints tying men to the parental hearth?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it appears to be mummy herself.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Heffernan, for example, admits he's a mummy's boy, but
he's far from ashamed. What's more, the 27-year-old part-time
telemarketer has no immediate plans to leave his parent's spacious
home in suburban London.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mummy) gets me up in the morning, she makes all my dinners,
she runs the bath, makes my bed usually, irons all my clothes,
washes my clothes,'' he said. ``She loves it. It wouldn't be the
same if I wasn't here. She wouldn't know what to do with herself.''
</P>
<P>
   The only downside? Keeping girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be difficult if you go out to a club and meet girls.
I've brought a couple of girls back before and had to kick them out
early in the morning, and usually it doesn't go over too well,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Heffernan does hope to save money while at home so that _
eventually _ he can buy his own house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I move out at 35, I've hopefully got 40 years left to
live on my own,'' he reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   In general, researchers say that girls usually enjoy less
freedom than boys while living at home, and so are more anxious to
fly the coop, even if they aren't ready to marry. Two-thirds of
women rent before buying, but only one-third of men do.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these researchers say women mature at a faster
pace than young men. Many women in their twenties are at their best
and already can be startlingly self-confident. Men, though, may not
really begin to grow up until they reach about 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young women in Britain are becoming more financially
independent, and just more independent in general,'' said Carol
Summerfield, a co-editor of the Social Trends report. ``And young
women are the ones who are more likely to move out of their old
homes and in with an older partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists are also keen to point out that there's less
pressure on British males these days to be macho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, the heroes of the day were Clint Eastwood
and (Sean Connery's) James Bond, who would never have been seen
running home to mum for a cup of tea,'' said Dr. Mick Cooper, a
psychologist at Brighton University. ``Now there is no shame
attached to being at home.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the prospect of a child living their adult years in
the comfort of their old home makes some parents shudder with fear.
But many are overjoyed at the thought of keeping their offspring at
Chez Mum and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kenny, a columnist for The Daily Telegraph, said this
return to the nest should be viewed as a positive signal of the end
of the generation wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in their twenties and thirties now get along a lot
better with people in their forties, fifties and sixties,'' said
Kenny, whose own sons, in their twenties, still live at home.
</P>
<P>
   She said it's wonderfully useful to have her sons around to do
things like deconstruct ``The Simpsons'' or help research something
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Sue Arnold, mother of three young boys, said
she can't imagine her sons living with her at 30.
</P>
<P>
   She said there should be a distinct winding down of comforts in
all homes _ no more ironing, no more sticky toffee pudding and,
above all else, regular rent payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should flush the little darlings out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, of course, isn't the only country to have witnessed a
rise in the number of adults remaining in their parent's homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the number of adults still living with parents has
grown considerably over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   And, in some countries, it has always been considered normal for
men to stay at home. In Italy, nearly half of all men live at home
until they marry. But this is a place in which men who do not live
at home generally call their mothers, on average, three times a
week, married or not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be some time before such an arrangement becomes
socially acceptable in the United States, where living at home is
often synonymous with wimpishness.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider last year's hit by the Atlanta-based female
singing trio TLC, which even coined a new term for unsuitable
suitors who still live at home with their mothers _ scrubs.
</P>

ALL SHINY SURFACES, LITTLE SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite all the flash, the ``42nd Annual Grammy Awards'' was an
undistinguished, unemotional three-hour telecast, with a small
handful of highlights. It ended up looking too much like all the
other televised music awards shows _ and there are very many of
them these days. Regardless of the Santana sweep, wins by Sting,
and a tribute to Elton John, the CBS show was crammed with
predictable new-guard glitz and numbingly oversized production
numbers. Santana may have been the biggest winner since Michael
Jackson in 1984, but his presence on the telecast was strangely
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, host for the second year in a row, didn't help
matters. Her opening monologue was flat, second-rate standup, and
she appeared to be going through the motions all evening. About the
53-year-old Cher, she quipped, ``I don't want to say she's old, but
she's calling everybody Sonny.'' Thud. About Sean ``Puffy'' Combs,
recently arrested for weapon possession, she joked that he plans to
star on Broadway in ``Puffy Get Your Gun.'' Thud. And her faux
medley of Diana Ross songs included ``Touch Me in the Airport.''
Splat. At one point, she said, ``I could go on all night. Don't
make me.'' As if we had a choice.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, the song performances were big and
electrified with an excess of blinking lights and geometric
choreography. Ricky Martin _ or, as O'Donnell dubbed him, ``Ricky
shake-your-bon-bon Martin'' _ shook his bon-bon with special
fervor, proving once and for all that he does have bionic hips.
Martin was out to raise the bar on himself, after he captured
America's eye at last year's Grammy ceremony with a blazing version
of ``Livin' La Vida Loca.'' His performance of ``Maria'' was fiery,
literally, beginning with a giant shadow of the singer and ending,
amid a Cirque de Soleil-like stage ensemble inside a ring of real
fire. What will he do next year? Hard to believe it has been only
12 months since Martin, now music media wallpaper, hit the big
time.
</P>
<P>
   Britney Spears, another performer who needs to take a publicity
break, sang a medley that took her from some kind of massive
butterfly-like plumage to a stage filled with funkified robots.
Don't ask. It was as elaborate as it was forgettable. Kid Rock
burst into ``Bawitdaba'' and then took the energy higher with Grand
Funk Railroad's ``An American Band.'' The lights twirled
ferociously, but not as ferociously as they had during Will Smith's
fog-swamped show-opening number. Home viewers may have been
reaching for their sunglasses. While the Dixie Chicks avoided
pumped-up stage tricks to sing about domestic abuse in ``Goodbye
Earl,'' they showed bad taste by pumping the video for the song to
the TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   The better moments of the night included Chucho Valdez and
Ibrahim Ferrer, who came before Martin in a Latin ``jukebox'' set,
and the pairing of Elton John and the Backstreet Boys for a
high-energy ``Philadelphia Freedom.'' Alas, John, who was
introduced by Billy Joel, never got the chance to share his
feelings about the honor, robbing the night of one of its few
possible emotional moments.
</P>
<P>
   The telecast's costuming highlight came very early on. You could
hear the collective jaw hit the floor when Jennifer Lopez came out
to present an award with David Duchovny. As if to show she is
unrepentant about her involvement in the gun incident with Puff
Daddy, Lopez wore a sheer aqua dress with cleavage that plunged at
least six inches south of her belly button. What O'Donnell wryly
called ``a classy little understated number'' looked like a
politely wrapped gift ripped very wide open.
</P>
<P>
   The night's giant kid award went not to Kid Rock, but to Macy
Gray, the newly hot R&AMP;B singer. Gray, wearing a bright blue
longcoat with fur shoulders and wrists, towered above everyone she
stood beside, including Phil Collins and Andy Williams, with whom
she presented the Song of the Year prize. In her little-girl voice,
Gray stumbled over her script, and you have to wonder what she
might have said if she'd won for one of her two nominations. Gray
lost the best new artist slot to Christina Aguilera, she of the
most excellent posture, who was a bright vision of silver and blond
in a tight Versace dress that conjured thoughts of a human disco
ball. ``Oh my God, you guys,'' she gushed. ``I seriously do not
have a speech prepared whatsoever. I'm shaking right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The preshow festivities were unnervingly uneventful. On a garish
red carpet, which was greenhoused in plastic against rain, Ellen
DeGeneres worked hard to create a sense of buzz, hamming it up like
Carol Burnett, girl reporter.
</P>
<P>
   She mopped the carpet clean when the coverage started. She
putted a golfball into the waiting open mouth of Moby, who laid his
golf-ball-shaped head on the ground. She brought out a life-size
poster of Ricky Martin, then asked the unerringly modest sensation
to stand beside himself. And she eagerly approached handsome pop
stars like Sting, Martin, Clint Black, and Marc Anthony with an
empty cup, noting, ``Melissa scored with David Crosby. You never
know who I'm gonna meet here.'' And _ Joan Rivers take note _
DeGeneres, who hosted the Grammys twice in recent years, was
knowledgeable enough to ask questions without any inadvertent
insults.
</P>
<P>
   She was appropriately deadpan in the face of Aguilera and,
later, Spears, who arrived in a poufy white wrap that was perfectly
Zsa Zsa-esque.

HOW MUCH POWER DO WE NEED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say it's impossible to have too much computing power, but
sometimes I wonder.
</P>
<P>
   At the office, I use an Apple iMac and a Pentium II; at home, an
AMD K6-III and a couple of old Intel Pentiums running Linux. I
can't recall the last time I needed more horsepower than these
machines provide. That's partly because I spend so much time on the
Internet, where the sheer speed of the computer makes little
difference.
</P>
<P>
   So despite a healthy gadget-freak lust for more potent hardware,
I can't help wondering what on earth I'd do with a one-gigahertz
computer. They'll be hitting store shelves by autumn for as little
as $2,000. Their muscular Intel and AMD chips will put my
400-megahertz home machine to shame. Yet this won't mean much to
the average consumer running workaday software.
</P>
<P>
   You can already buy a one-gig machine today for $2,500, complete
with a handy built-in refrigerator to keep the processor chip from
melting. KryoTech Inc.'s Super-G machine links its small
refrigeration unit to a cooling interface bolted onto an AMD Athlon
processor. By dropping the chip temperature to minus-40 degrees,
Super-G dramatically boosts the chip's speed without roasting it.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to achieve such speed at room temperature. Intel
and AMD are doing it partly by making the ultra-tiny transistors on
each chip out of copper, instead of the traditional chipmaker's
friend, aluminum. Copper is harder to work with, but makes a much
better electrical conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Another gimmick involves making everything on the chip smaller.
The previous generation of processors contained circuits no bigger
than a quarter of a micron. That's already 400 times thinner than
the average hair. By making the circuits a wee bit smaller _ .18
micron _ you get more circuits on board, so the chip can do more
work. At the same time, the chip becomes physically smaller, and
that reduced size also makes it run faster _ the electrons pulsing
through the chip don't have to travel as far.
</P>
<P>
   So you switch to copper and shrink the circuits and get your
chip up to one-gigahertz speed. And then you go and spoil it all by
plugging in the same old memory chips. The processor can only work
as fast as it can scoop up information from the memory. As
processors get faster, memory hasn't been keeping pace.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bus'' that carries data between the processor and the
memory runs at 100 million cycles a second on most recent
computers, with some going up to 133 megahertz. Memory makers are
working on designs that'll boost that considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Late this year, Intel is rolling out a chip codenamed
Willamette, which will start at one gigahertz with a later bump to
1.5 gigahertz. This chip will be designed to work with a new kind
of memory chip called Rambus, which can serve up data to the chip
at 400 million cycles per second. The result, in theory, should be
dramatically faster performance.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's slower Pentium III chips can also use Rambus, and it's
starting to appear in a few systems. But the stuff costs several
times more than traditional memory chips and requires a new type of
motherboard to boot. So you'll mainly find it on network server
computers rather than home desktops.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't even mentioned the forthcoming Intel Itanium
processor, but you'll never try this one at home. It's got a
fundamentally different design from the Pentium series and is
mainly intended to compete against Sun Microsystems Inc.'s
UltraSPARC line of high-end corporate systems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the forthcoming Pentiums and Athlons will offer power far
beyond what's needed to run today's most common computer tasks. But
that's only because we've come to expect so little of our
computers.
</P>
<P>
   We still have to train them to do accurate speech recognition,
and even then, computers often don't get it right. They still don't
let us do broadcast-grade video over the Internet, or 3-D graphics
that are truly lifelike. We've grown tolerant of such limitations,
because our hardware runs fast enough to make our mediocre software
look good.
</P>
<P>
   The still-faster hardware due out this year will no doubt
inspire the creation of better, more innovative software,
eventually. Until then, what good is a gigahertz?

WHEN IT COMES TO HOGS, IT'S ALMOST ALL HARLEY CLONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's cold, it's windy, and indoors at Rockingham Park in Salem,
N.H., the milling masses are dreaming of spring and being outside
in a warm wind. Snow covers the racetrack, and horseflesh has given
way to the iron horse.
</P>
<P>
   I wander the exhibits at the New England Motorcycle Expo and ask
myself, ``Can't anybody come up with something original?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm a denizen of motorcycle shows. I know that at least half of
what I see will be booths selling helmets, cotton skullcaps, flamed
clothing, leather hats, chaps, gloves, jackets, and hundreds of
varieties of T-shirts. It makes me wonder if they really own a bike
or just the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   I know that no belly is too big, no pair of leather pants too
tight. I watch the line at Heidi Jo's Beef Jerky stand and note
that passing tough-guy bikers are too shy to make eye contact with
Jennifer Lavoie, Playboy Playmate, who lounges in a leopard-skin
bikini.
</P>
<P>
   But today, for that first time, I blaspheme: Who will have an
original thought?
</P>
<P>
   I've only ridden Harleys (and one 1958 Triumph), but I've never
been a Harley snob who looks down on those who ride other (read
Japanese) motorcycles. Ride what you can afford, has been my motto.
Even in the Harley community there is a disgusting prejudice
against those who ride new Harleys (they almost always start, they
don't drip oil) on the part of those who ride old Harleys
(sometimes they start, they do drip oil). Never mind that if Harley
hadn't manufactured, and new riders hadn't stepped forward to buy,
the new Harley, there would be no Harley-Davidson today.
</P>
<P>
   So I see Harley, even as it evolves, sticking to its original
thought, improving on it, doing what a good company should.
</P>
<P>
   Then I wander through the Honda exhibit and note they've got the
motorcycle market covered: their own traditional high-r.p.m.
rockets; a nice lineup of four-wheelers; and, what's this? a
Valkyre _ pure rip-off of the classic Indian, and the Shadow _ pure
rip-off of the Harley.
</P>
<P>
   Beside them, Triumphs sit looking for identity: dirt bike?
cruiser? throwback to the old days? They're trying it all.
</P>
<P>
   And here are the Vulcans _ Nomad and Drifter _ fat-fendered and
looking all-Indian.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps as upsetting as any of them is the Kawasaki W650 (W
standing for We stole the idea): It's a Triumph clone, right down
to the rubber knee grips on the gas tank, the long, flat seat, the
winged flanges where exhaust meets cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   Can't somebody have an original thought?
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, I wasn't appalled by the insurgence of
knockoff motorcycles. Back then, I wrote, ``There's a new thunder
on the roads of motorcycling and it's being spit from the exhausts
of thousands of bikes manufactured every year that look just like
customized Harleys, may even have Harley engines and other
components in them, and are fueling an industry that is growing
rapidly in the Harley's shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   They called them clones, hybrids, and ``special construction''
motorcycles, and they arose because ``The Motor Company,'' as
Harley is known, created a demand that it could not supply. It was
fueled by the image of Harley riders as tough hombres on the road
to freedom who love being In The Wind, as a popular motorcycle
magazine is named, escaping the strictures of reaching middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Harley was moving from around 30,000 bikes sold each year in the
early 1980s, to reaching for 200,000 annual sales. Clones did not
seem like such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   So we got clones from companies named Big Dog, California
Motorcycle Co., Castle Motorcycles, Confederate Motorcycles,
Illusion, American Eagle, American Image, Surgical Steeds, Titan,
Victory, and Iron Horse.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know the trend would spread to established
manufacturers and original design would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   So as I wandered the Expo, I wondered how this happened even as
the market has become more diverse than ever. It used to be almost
strictly a guy thing _ women rode on the back of motorcycles. Now,
nearly 20 percent of new bike purchasers are women. At the Expo,
the guy wearing the T-shirt that read, ``When In Doubt . . . Knock
'Em Out'' stood in glaring contrast to the women bikers promoting
Alli's Rally 2000, for the Allison Burke Fund for The Floating
Hospital/New England Medical Center. Or Women on Wheels pushing
their 7th Annual Rally for Breast Cancer on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have an emerging, diverse (aging boomers looking
to hang onto their youth, women, young riders looking for high-tech
thrills) market, yet they're going retro, ripping off ideas from
others. Keep doing it, they'll ride the wave into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Some are fine: Indian is trying to make a legitimate comeback.
So is Excelsior-Henderson with its Super X, though its V-Twin,
85-cubic-inch engine and its look smell like a Harley.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see somebody show up at one of these shows sticking
to their guns (BMW wasn't represented, and I suspect they would fit
this latter notion).
</P>
<P>
   Stick to their guns the way it looks like Ducati is doing. At
Eastern Cycles' exhibit, the Ducati sat looking low, explosive, and
distinctive. From the new models right back to the 250-cubic-inch
vintage Ducati of Johnny ``Holeshot'' Strehpfer.
</P>
<P>
   So I wandered on, pausing to admire Tony Deluca's 1962 Harley
XLCH Sportster, admire its classic tank and tiny solo seat.
</P>
<P>
   But then I ran smack into the Suzuki Intruder (Harley) and
Yamaha Road Star (Harley Dresser) and I was overwhelmed by the
thought once again: Won't somebody please have an original thought?

 MIT SPORTS LAB SEEKS INNOVATION THROUGH R&AMP;D  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The pitchers and catchers have reported to
Major League Baseball's spring training, and it is almost time for
one of longest-running issues in professional sports to be argued
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   When is a strike really a strike? When is a ball a ball?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a problem for someone at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to make too big a deal out of it, because I
know the phone's going to start ringing off of the hook _
especially with calls from the umpires' union,'' said Kim B. Blair,
director of MIT's new Laboratory for Sports Innovation. ``But the
technology for automatic strike zone detection, we think, is there.
We think we can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a market for it? Are the players going to like it?
Would the owners like it? That's what we need to find out,'' Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Laboratory for Sports Innovation strives to be for the
sports industry what MIT's Lincoln Laboratory has been to the
energy and defense industries, what the Laboratory for Computer
Science is to high technology and the Media Lab is to television
and newspapers _ a center for the research and development of new
designs and concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The sports lab's goal is to cater to the $4.7 billion sporting
goods industry, to media companies that spend billions of dollars
annually to broadcast sports, and to fans who simply want to attend
some games.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new designs and concepts developed by the lab recently
are a new softball that can be hit just as far as an old one, but
that hurts less when it strikes a player, and a cyclist's training
system that provides a rider with real-time data to correct
aerodynamic positioning.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for research and design seems limitless. A gel
that's rubbed on the hands could obviate the need for rock and
mountain climbers to build up calluses. New designs could improve
shoes, rackets, bats, and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of R&AMP;D that goes on in the business,
generally,'' said Bob McGee, editor of Sporting Goods Intelligence,
an industry newsletter. ``Amid all of the concern about logistics
and meeting price points and that kind of stuff, it's one of the
areas that's being cut first, especially if you are not one of the
big players in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And, observers say, even the big players often buy up smaller,
innovative companies or pay outsiders for their new product
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rawlings is the manufacturer of the radar ball, a baseball
that cannot be hit, but says how fast it is going when it strikes
the catcher's mitt,'' said Michael May, spokesman for the Sporting
Goods Manufacturers Association. ``It is based on computer chip
technology, and the design won the Product of the Year award at a
show in 1989. Rawlings manufacturers it, but it bought the design
from an an inventor somewhere in the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like this program at MIT would fit right into what
is a normal pattern in the industry,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has long
participated in research on sports and in the development of sports
products. Testing the impact of the new press box and 600 Club on
the production of home runs at Fenway Park several years ago and
developing sweet spots and power zones for more than 2,000
commercial tennis rackets are just two of many examples.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair and others at MIT saw a need to bring all of the work
under one roof, especially in light of the consolidation of the
aeronautics industry after the Cold War. ``With peace breaking out
everywhere, in aerospace there was some concern about, gee, what
else is this department going to do?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of engineers and designers, Blair, who specialized
in aeronautics at Purdue University, turned to sports.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Laboratory for Sports Innovation, which was
established in August, is to build up a budget of $2 million to $3
million over the next three years to finance the research and
development, with much of the money coming from companies that will
turn to MIT for its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first such sports development project at any US
university, Blair said. It competes internationally with only the
University of Sheffield and Cambridge University in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, students who have begun to sign up for courses at the
lab are presented with an intriguing educational experience, Blair
said. Part of the attraction is that in the aeronautics and
aerospace industries, for example, product and concept development
often take two decades and the labor of hundreds if not thousands
of engineers, he said. In the sports industry, designs can be
completed in a year or two by someone working alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports involves relatively familiar products and easily
grasped concepts,'' Blair said. ``Students are familiar with a
shoe, a climbing harness, a tennis racket. It's something they can
get their hands on. They understand how it works and how it feels,
and that is a big leg up in learning.''

A CULT ICON IS DRIVEN TO PROVIDE MAINSTREAM COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of my favorite Bill Mauldin cartoons from World War II, a
Jeep is sprawled in the mud, a front wheel snapped flat like a
broken leg. A GI, head turned away and hand over his eyes, reaches
back and puts a pistol to the Jeep's hood, his heart aching as he
puts a trusted companion out of misery. I expect to see a tear
trickle from a headlight.
</P>
<P>
   Born of war's necessity, evolved into a symbol of rugged fun,
the classic Jeep is a true American icon. It was developed after
the Army asked American companies to come up with a simple rig:
front- and rear-drive axles, a two-speed tranny, narrow track,
short wheelbase, and folding windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Bantam delivered first, with the BRC, called the Blitz Buggy.
Ford followed with the Pygmy and Willys-Overland with the Quad.
From these came the Jeep we know today: tough motor, rectangular
and angular body, flat profile, stamped grille.
</P>
<P>
   It is a look that endures right down into the 2000 Wrangler
Sahara. It's still got the exterior hood latches, the up-and-over
lip at the rocker panels, the jailbars grille. Jeep has even
returned to round headlights after dabbling with rectangular.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it's far more comfortable _ wide, firm seats with high
backs _ than in the past. But it also retains a rugged feel with
padded rollbars, seats covered to shed water like good rain gear, a
vertical dash that appears a bulwark of security (and houses
standard dual airbags), and that familiar view through a flat
windshield over the classic rectangular hood.
</P>
<P>
   The controls are simple and convenient, mostly set in a
rectangular box at center dash. There's a hefty use of plastic on
dash and controls but it's used well and doesn't feel cheap or
lightweight. Storage is minimal in the doors, but ample in a big,
deep center console and secure in Velcro-flap pockets on the backs
of the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'90s, Jeep knew it had to update in the wake of a
slew of competitors who were taking enthusiasts off road in greater
comfort. It is one thing to be a cult icon, another to be outdated.
Perhaps the best change was eliminating leaf springs and replacing
them with coils to supplement shocks.
</P>
<P>
   ABS is an option and my advice there is: Opt.
</P>
<P>
   The Sahara I drove came with an 4.0-liter, inline-6 engine with
cast iron block and cast iron head. It had plenty of power for
highway cruising at 70 and higher and off road in snow seemed to
draw from a bottomless pit of torque. Pushed hard off road and
driven at commuter speeds, however, it got only about 15 miles per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway the engine was a bit loud and there was a steady
wind noise from just above the windshield. Its agility moving in
and out of traffic was OK, but it's not meant for weaving like that
anyway. On rough roads, its short wheelbase let it hop, skip, and
jump a bit (still classic Jeep). Off road, it doesn't so much bull
its way through challenging terrain so much as scratch and claw.
</P>
<P>
   The three-speed automatic was prone to abrupt shifts that I did
not like and made me wish I had a test model with the five-speed
manual.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, idiosyncracies are what make the Jeep the Jeep, and if
you love it, you live with them.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches
</P>
<P>
   --The toggle switch control that distributes sound to four
speakers, front to rear, side to side.
</P>
<P>
   --The heater. Heats up fast. Heats up hot. Great on those
sunrise fetch-the-newspaper runs.

<P>
   What appears to be a major victory for President Mohamed
Khatami's supporters in the new Iranian parliamentary elections
confirms that the Islamic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, strict theocratic form.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, after the shah was deposed, the coterie around the
newly powerful Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini purged its more
egalitarian members and crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights were virtually ignored in Iran for a decade, until
Khomeini's death in 1989. With typical revolutionary excess, the
regime's zealots were obsessed with winning converts to their
cause, both at home and in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, today in Iran, the most innovative movement is the
Islamic reformation. Iranian thinkers have injected energy and
ideas into a disparate effort, from Egypt to India, to somehow
reconcile a 7th-century religion with modern life.
</P>
<P>
   By using Islam as a popular political idiom, by weaving Islamic
tenets into a modern, Western-style constitution, and by putting
clerics in charge of the state, Iran has actually become a live
test and a venue for debate on the proper relationship between
Islam and the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Any aim to empower Iran's people was hijacked in the early days
of the Ayatollah's regime. Yet, ironically, the failure of the
world's only theocracy to empower its people has provided the
biggest boost for new, progressive ideas about the modern Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the most profound discourse within Islam today is taking
place in the newspapers, courtrooms and classrooms of Iran. Even
clerics who once held high office and intellectuals who were
proteges of the late Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the trial of Abdollah Nouri,
a cleric, former Khomeini aide and editor of the newspaper Khordad
who had served as vice president, interior minister and Tehran city
councilor.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy, which operates as an
independent agency, charged Nouri with multiple counts of
``insulting'' Islam, the prophet Mohammad and Khomeini. Nouri's
specific offense was running articles in Khordad that questioned
everything from the Islamic concept of eye-for-eye justice to the
clergy's automatic right to hold power.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial Nouri, dressed in a white turban and clerical
robes, astonished Iranians by taking the stand and denying the
court's right to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its
membership and its competence to conduct this trial, and any
verdict you reach will have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction he refused to appeal, on the same grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison
and was also barred from political activity for five years, a
punishment tacitly designed to prevent Iranian President Khatami's
closest ally from running for speaker of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And Nouri's newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly
pledged to launch another publication _ the people's new way of
getting around forced shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Six months earlier, Tehran had been absorbed in a similar trial
_ that of Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and seminary
professor whose sister was an adviser to Khatami and another Tehran
city councilor; his brother-in-law served as Khatami's minister of
culture and Islamic guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy charged Kadivar with
``disseminating lies and disturbing public opinion'' for writing
articles that advocated the separation of political and religious
institutions. Kadivar also dared to compare practices in the
Islamic republic with the former shah's repressive controls on
freedom of expression and questioned the powers and righteousness
of the theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From both a legal and religious point of view, it's quite
permissible to criticize the Supreme Leader or the ruling
establishment,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Kadivar rejected the clergy's right to judge:
``Investigation into political and press offenses must be carried
out in the presence of a jury and by a qualified court of the
judiciary,'' he told the court. He was convicted and received an
18-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kadivar's case gained him celebrity status. Posters of the young
cleric, who came from a noted religious family in the city of
Shiraz, were plastered all over Tehran. Students held a candlelight
vigil in the hills near Evin prison, where he was being held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released
doves as a symbol of liberty. More than 200 journalists also signed
a petition that condemned Kadivar's arrest as unconstitutional and
called it an ``offense'' against Iran's writers and intellectuals.
These responses to Kadivar's imprisonment reflected a newly
emboldened population.
</P>
<P>
   Both trials involved an issue even more fundamental than the
freedom of expression: the separation of religion from government.
In an Islamic society, who has the ultimate power _ the elected
officials or the clergy?
</P>
<P>
   Since Islam is a monotheistic religion that offers not only
spiritual values but also a set of rules by which to govern
society, sorting out the distribution of power is critical to any
genuine, lasting reform. So political change and religious reform
are often tightly intertwined in Muslim societies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, Iran's leading philosopher, Abdul
Karim Soroush, has fueled public debate by offering a framework _
on the basis of faith _ to blend Islam and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that to be a true believer, one must come to the faith
without coercion or pressure _ in other words, freely. That
principle is the origin of all other freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Soroush has not abandoned the tenets of his faith; he believes
that ``sharia'' _ pure Islamic law _ can be a basis for modern
legislation. But he breaks from Iran's theocrats in his declaration
that Islamic law is not static, but instead is flexible and
adaptable because it has only begun to be understood by imperfect
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Soroush was a long-time follower of Khomeini, who appointed him
to the Committee of the Cultural Revolution to set about being
certain that all Iranian university curricula were in conformity
with Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade after the revolution, even Soroush, who initially
was so close to Khomeini, began to see the Ayatollah as an
instrument of transition, not as the goal. In books, magazine
columns and lectures at the three universities where he taught,
Soroush warned that Islam, like any other religion, should never be
relied upon to rule a state.
</P>
<P>
   To use religion as state law, he argued, opens the door to
totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Often called the Martin Luther of Islam by students, Soroush is
also widely popular among today's young intellectuals, reformers
and the clergy. Many of his former students and followers launched
new, reform-oriented newspapers _ most notably Jameh, Tous, Neshat
and Asr-e Azadegan, or ``Era of the Emancipators'' _ all of which
were closed down, one after another, by the current Islamic-based
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the goal of Soroush, Kadivar, Nouri and other Iranian
reformers is to be religious _ to be Muslim _ without being
fundamentalist, to be reverent but free, and to find a world-view
that is both Islamic and modern.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes Iran quite unique in the Muslim world. And the
work of Iran's reformers is spreading rapidly throughout the
53-nation Islamic bloc. Indeed, this is the last group of countries
to hold out against the wave of democracy that in recent years has
swept the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is still undergoing a transformation. After the elections,
more internal turmoil lies ahead, as the revolution's early
passions are replaced by hard-earned pragmatism, and as arrogance
gives way to realism among many believers in Iranian society.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the government of God is being forced to cede to
secular statecraft _ and to empower Iranians. In the process, Iran
has begun contributing to the spread of public empowerment around
the world.

<P>
   What appears to be a major victory for President Mohamed
Khatami's supporters in the new Iranian parliamentary elections
confirms that the Islamic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, strict theocratic form.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, after the shah was deposed, the coterie around the
newly powerful Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini purged its more
egalitarian members and crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights were virtually ignored in Iran for a decade, until
Khomeini's death in 1989. With typical revolutionary excess, the
regime's zealots were obsessed with winning converts to their
cause, both at home and in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, today in Iran, the most innovative movement is the
Islamic reformation. Iranian thinkers have injected energy and
ideas into a disparate effort, from Egypt to India, to somehow
reconcile a 7th-century religion with modern life.
</P>
<P>
   By using Islam as a popular political idiom, by weaving Islamic
tenets into a modern, Western-style constitution, and by putting
clerics in charge of the state, Iran has actually become a live
test and a venue for debate on the proper relationship between
Islam and the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Any aim to empower Iran's people was hijacked in the early days
of the Ayatollah's regime. Yet, ironically, the failure of the
world's only theocracy to empower its people has provided the
biggest boost for new, progressive ideas about the modern Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the most profound discourse within Islam today is taking
place in the newspapers, courtrooms and classrooms of Iran. Even
clerics who once held high office and intellectuals who were
proteges of the late Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the trial of Abdollah Nouri,
a cleric, former Khomeini aide and editor of the newspaper Khordad
who had served as vice president, interior minister and Tehran city
councilor.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy, which operates as an
independent agency, charged Nouri with multiple counts of
``insulting'' Islam, the prophet Mohammad and Khomeini. Nouri's
specific offense was running articles in Khordad that questioned
everything from the Islamic concept of eye-for-eye justice to the
clergy's automatic right to hold power.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial Nouri, dressed in a white turban and clerical
robes, astonished Iranians by taking the stand and denying the
court's right to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its
membership and its competence to conduct this trial, and any
verdict you reach will have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction he refused to appeal, on the same grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison
and was also barred from political activity for five years, a
punishment tacitly designed to prevent Iranian President Khatami's
closest ally from running for speaker of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And Nouri's newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly
pledged to launch another publication _ the people's new way of
getting around forced shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Six months earlier, Tehran had been absorbed in a similar trial
_ that of Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and seminary
professor whose sister was an adviser to Khatami and another Tehran
city councilor; his brother-in-law served as Khatami's minister of
culture and Islamic guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy charged Kadivar with
``disseminating lies and disturbing public opinion'' for writing
articles that advocated the separation of political and religious
institutions. Kadivar also dared to compare practices in the
Islamic republic with the former shah's repressive controls on
freedom of expression and questioned the powers and righteousness
of the theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From both a legal and religious point of view, it's quite
permissible to criticize the Supreme Leader or the ruling
establishment,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Kadivar rejected the clergy's right to judge:
``Investigation into political and press offenses must be carried
out in the presence of a jury and by a qualified court of the
judiciary,'' he told the court. He was convicted and received an
18-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kadivar's case gained him celebrity status. Posters of the young
cleric, who came from a noted religious family in the city of
Shiraz, were plastered all over Tehran. Students held a candlelight
vigil in the hills near Evin prison, where he was being held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released
doves as a symbol of liberty. More than 200 journalists also signed
a petition that condemned Kadivar's arrest as unconstitutional and
called it an ``offense'' against Iran's writers and intellectuals.

&HT;     HOMOSEXUAL SON TAKES ON FATHER'S ANTI-GAY INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Calif., Md.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ David Knight thinks his father, state Sen. Pete
Knight, is wrong about gay marriage, wrong about gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   But he agrees with his dad about one thing: ``The big issue is,
he feels (my homosexuality is) a private matter. I could never get
the point across that he's exactly right,'' David Knight said in
his second public statement in opposition to Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which will appear on the March 7 ballot, was
sponsored by Knight, a Republican from Palmdale, and seeks to
affirm that California will not recognize marriages between
same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a private matter, and what he's attempting to do is
single out a group that has private, personal relationships. I wish
he understood that, but he doesn't,'' David Knight said Wednesday
in a telephone interview from Baltimore, where he lives with his
partner of six years, Joe Lazarro.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, 38, is a reluctant campaigner for gay rights. But he is
angry at his father for shutting him out since David told him he
was gay four years ago, and for pushing to reinforce California
laws against same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Knight, 70, tried three times to get the state Legislature
to pass an anti-gay-marriage bill before going directly to the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   David Knight's tone was softer than in the column he wrote last
year for the Los Angeles Times. In the column, he called his
father's initiative a ``blind, uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk
reaction to a subject about which he knows nothing but which serves
his political career.''
</P>
<P>
   David Knight had followed in his father's footsteps in the
military, flew F-16s like his dad and basked in his father's pride
until the day in 1996 when he came out as gay. Then, everything
changed.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen his father only once since then, he said. Their
relationship is ``extremely strained and it hasn't been the same
since.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his father has no concept of his life as a Baltimore
furniture maker and domestic partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We renovated a house, we both work every day. It's pretty
boring, actually,'' he said. ``We have a very good life with a lot
of very good dear friends and it's very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Knight said he has resisted past efforts to get him
involved in lobbying his father over gay rights issues. He decided
to speak out against Proposition 22 because ``I feel very strongly
about it. I am for same-sex marriage. ... I wanted to put a face on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he disagreed with the premise of one of the No on Knight
campaign's two new television ads, which says Pete Knight sponsored
Proposition 22 because he ``may not like the idea that his son is
gay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the basis is, he's got a view of what he thinks
marriage and family and what's being taught in school should be,''
David Knight said. ``He's doing what he really honestly believes,
and I believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   David Knight strongly disagrees with those beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I angry with it? Yes. Was I angry he decided to be in the
forefront of this issue? Yes. But that's my father's belief. ... I
still love my father.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Knight responded with a fiery statement to the No on
Knight ad. ``They should be ashamed for exploiting a private family
matter for political gain,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   While Pete Knight accused the opposition of pressuring his son
to speak up, David Knight said he wanted to. Like his father, he
said it is because the issue is so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely awkward'' to have his family name at the center
of the battle, David Knight said. And it has deepened strains in
the family, he said, asking reporters not to contact his two
brothers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet it's comforting to know I'm helping in something I
believe in very strongly,'' he said. ``I think it's extraordinarily
pivotal. California is the most populous state in the country.''

SHOOTING VICTIM TRIES TO REPAIR A SHATTERED LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Seven months after her longtime boyfriend allegedly
shot her in the face and executed her two best friends while they
dressed for their second day of college, Shunae Allen says she
still loves him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't still have love for him now, that would mean I
never loved him,'' she explained. ``But I hate what he did to me,
to himself and to two of my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her aunt's home, Allen, 19, talked for the first time
of trying to refashion a shattered life even as she struggles with
the emotions she has for a man who still calls her from his jail
cell _ and the guilt she feels about her two lost friends, Monique
Brown and Patrice Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask myself all the time _ why me?'' said Allen. ``I wish we
were all here together or we left here together. Why am I left here
to go through all this alone?''
</P>
<P>
   In August, 21-year-old Jason Pierce allegedly shot the childhood
friends in their suburban Atlanta townhouse not far from Morris
Brown University, a black college where Pierce was a junior.
Pierce, who until then seemed to have left the street life behind,
disappeared, prompting a manhunt up and down the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Police finally caught up with him a week later, bringing him
into custody after a wild chase through nearby Brookline and a
shootout near the Mall at Chestnut Hill. Another man in the car
with him, Sean Taylor, has eluded police and is still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Allen, her life has turned eerily quiet. The families
of her two dead friends refuse to talk to her. She spends most days
at home. When she wants to be by herself, she hops a bus. But even
riding the bus, she said, she gets curious stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be the first to say hello,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, the still-beautiful teenager with long braids,
visits the doctor, so he can check her progress. The bullet holes
on her high cheekbones have healed to look like two small
blemishes. Her jaw has healed so well that there is no outward sign
that the bullet shattered it.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said she has not given up her dream of going to college to
study computer programming. She hopes to enroll at the University
of Massachusetts sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still want to go to school outside of the state, but not
Atlanta _ that gives me the creeps.''
</P>
<P>
   Late at night, when the house settles around her, she sits in
front of a computer, writing about her life, trying to find some
reason for the tragic turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   She has also spent ``a lot'' of time on the phone to Pierce, who
she plans to testify against in Atlanta. Pierce must first face a
trial here, to answer for the chase and shootout. Then in Atlanta
he faces murder charges and possibly the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   During the first phone calls, Allen recalls sobbing and begging
Pierce to tell her why he would do something so violent to the
people he cared so much about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remained silent,'' she said. ``He has never admitted that
he actually did it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has continued to press him for answers, but Pierce always
evades her, asking her about her aunts, her parents, and her many
cousins, she said. At the end of each conversation, Pierce tells
her to be strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to know where was his mind when he did this,''
she said. ``How could you be so stupid when you had so much going
for you?''
</P>
<P>
   Allen recalls first meeting Pierce, her boyfriend of six years,
at the Boys and Girls Club in in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. She
was in sixth grade and hanging out with her best friend, Monique
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Pierce began showing up at her basketball
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would call my name and hide, silly stuff like that,''
recalled Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, she was wary of Pierce because she knew he hung out
in the streets and had been in trouble with the law. They dated
through English High School, where the three girls and Pierce all
went to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he began changing. He became a role model to me and to the
children in my family. Everybody wanted to go to college like
Jason,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her last fond memory of him was the night before the shooting,
when the four friends went to see ``In Too Deep,'' a movie based on
a Boston undercover officer and a drug kingpin.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Allen's other friends visited her, but
seemed uncomfortable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be normal again, but I know things will never
be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she still has nightmares and recurring dreams about her
friend Brown. She still remembers watching the police chase after
Pierce on the television, her mouth open, ``wanting to talk to
him.'' She has every intention of going to his trials _ here, and
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the house, she keeps pictures of her friends, and a
picture of Pierce is tucked under the rim of her bedroom mirror.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen says she won't allow the tragedy to stop her from
enjoying life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to move on,'' she said. ``I still try to party and go
to clubs. I try to appreciate life a lot more. In the past I didn't
take it too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said what hurts her most is that the parents of Lassiter
and Brown won't speak to her.
</P>
<P>
   She called the parents, who she has known most of her life, and
one of them confronted her about false rumors that she was going to
marry Pierce. She said one of the mothers asked her why she lived
and the other girls died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if I had a choice to live or die I would be gone,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen recalled one of the most peaceful moments after the
tragedy. Her worried family members kept a close eye on her but she
was able to slip away from the house and take a bus to the Boston
Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   With her legs folded, Allen sat on the concrete steps watching
the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the young woman, wearing black shades that covered a
bruised eye and hid her from the public, said she walked into a
nearby church and stood in the back, watching the wedding of a
stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so beautiful,'' she said. ``All I wanted was a little
peace.''

<P>
   Oil prices have been flirting recently with $25 to $30 per
barrel, the highest in a decade _ levels almost reminiscent of the
oil shocks of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And the yo-yo prices have been accompanied by hysteria about
dwindling supplies and potentially dangerous transfers of wealth,
from nation to nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the energy problem looming in the early 21st century is
neither skyrocketing prices nor shortages. Instead, the danger is
precisely the opposite. Long-term trends point to a prolonged oil
surplus and low oil prices over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, this scenario of plenty could destabilize
oil-producing states, especially those in the ellipse stretching
from the Persian Gulf to Russia. And although the U.S. economy
would by and large benefit, the backfire of low oil prices could
imperil U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   Both the popular and the elite media _ from Parade magazine
asking ``Could It Happen Again?'' to Scientific American, no less,
proclaiming ``The End of Cheap Oil'' _ are peppered with forecasts
of gloom and doom about energy security.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``sky-is-falling'' school of oil forecasting has been
systematically wrong for more than a generation. In its dramatic
1972 ``Limits to Growth'' report, the group of prominent experts
known as the Club of Rome wrote that only 550 billion barrels of
oil were left and these would run out by 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the world consumed 600 billion barrels of oil between
1970 and 1990, and there are today more than a trillion barrels of
proven reserves. This figure is likely to continue rising even as
global consumption exceeds the current 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity forecasters _ in some cases, the same people who
predicted in the 1970s that oil would cost $100 per barrel by 2000
_ are not only still wrong, they also have it exactly backward. The
world's problem is not scarcity but glut.
</P>
<P>
   This is true despite the recent Saudi-engineered production
cutbacks by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which boosted oil prices off their $8-per-barrel lows.
Seasoned oil-market watchers knew this fragile deal among oil
producers could dissipate quickly. Indeed by late February the
Saudis were signaling to the markets their support for a production
rise, which would trigger a price fall.
</P>
<P>
   As OPEC knows, other oil producers around the globe are enjoying
new finds and announcing new plans to expand capacity. The oil
supply potential in Iraq, Russia, Africa and elsewhere belies the
Cassandra-like predictions that the world will soon deplete its oil
assets.
</P>
<P>
   So too, the prophecies of dried-up wells obscure the far more
likely prospect: a sustained oil glut and long-term low oil prices,
which will have very different _ and largely unconsidered _
political and strategic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 dalliance with $8 barrels hinted at the possibilities,
with the economic meltdown in Russia and a forced succession in
wealthy Brunei.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab states of the oil-rich Persian Gulf, non-OPEC producers
and consumers are simply not prepared for a new geopolitics of
energy. Neither, frankly, is Washington. The political
reverberations of a sustained oil glut should not be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Several important regimes _ in the Persian Gulf states, Russia,
the former Soviet republics and such key Latin American countries
as Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia _ count on healthy oil revenues
for calming restless populations, assuaging social tensions and, in
some cases, significant nation building.
</P>
<P>
   Without the salve of rising oil revenues, many of these lands
can expect to see heightened political instability, social unrest
or even civil wars, which could be grimly reminiscent of the recent
Balkan slaughters.
</P>
<P>
   Without healthy oil revenues to buy off restive populations, the
leaders of various repressive gulf regimes will be left with only
repression to silence foes and quell public discontent, which could
fuel even more violent opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Radicalized local populations could also threaten the Middle
East peace process. Disgruntled gulf states might be tempted to
placate Islamist movements by funding the terrorists of Hamas, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 Persian Gulf war demonstrated the West's capacity to
defend important oil regions from traditional external threats like
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. But America's painful experiences
with revolutionary Iran in the late 1970s and the Balkans in the
1990s are grim reminders of how hard it can be to cope with
internal instability.
</P>
<P>
   The new dynamics of the global oil market have profound
implications for U.S. national security policy. Washington had
better gird itself.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong-headed predictions of scarcity are as old as the oil trade
itself. In 1885 the U.S. Geological Survey predicted ``little or no
chance of oil in California.'' In 1914 the U.S. Bureau of Mines
forecast only a 10-year supply of oil in the United States, and the
list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scarcity theorists are exemplified by one of the
world's most prominent petroleum geologists, Colin Campbell. He has
argued in many industry, policy and scientific journals that
growing global consumption of oil, driven by the emergence of a
modern, industrialized Asia-Pacific, is dramatically raising
demand.
</P>
<P>
   This rise, he warns, will collide with a slowdown in new oil
discoveries, leading to another energy crisis. By 2003, global
production will peak and the oil age will start to end.
</P>
<P>
   Why then have average oil prices NOT risen much in nearly a
generation?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is profound changes in the oil and gas markets.
Another is a profound high-tech revolution. Many analysts expected
that non-OPEC oil production would be short-lived. But they missed
the technological advances _ including computer-assisted,
three-dimensional imaging that lets geologists ``see'' underground
oil pockets _ that slashed the costs of developing hard-to-tap
reserves and improved the chances for new discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, better platform designs and drilling methods have also
let companies recover more of the oil they find. These
technological gains have dramatically lowered the cost of finding
and producing oil and natural gas and given energy consumers ample,
inexpensive supplies just at the time that earlier forecasts had
predicted a shortage.
</P>
<P>
   They have extended the life of existing wells and allowed the
oil industry to double the amount of oil recovered _ in many cases
from about 20 percent to 30 percent to between 50 percent and 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The average U.S. costs for finding oil fell from about $15 per
barrel in the 1980s to just $5 per barrel in 1998. Drillers are
four times as successful at finding natural gas and six times as
successful at finding oil as they were before the 1973 oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Now that finding and producing oil is cheaper and easier, more
and more countries are getting into the act.
</P>
<P>
   Ample, accessible new reserves will soon come on-line in the
waters off the Gulf of Mexico, eastern Canada and western Africa,
as well as onshore in central Africa, South America and frontier
areas in the former Soviet Union and the far reaches of the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Increased oil production in Venezuela, Colombia, Canada, Brazil
and the U.S. South has begun crowding more-distant Persian Gulf oil
out of the U.S. market. When growing oil imports from the Atlantic
basin (the North Sea and West Africa) are added in, the divide
widens.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming decade, the United States will increasingly rely
on oil from within the Western hemisphere and the Atlantic basin.
In the new, more efficient global oil market, most sellers strive
to sell their oil to the closest buyer to maximize revenues. It is
East Asia's dependence on Middle Eastern oil that is rising
substantially, not America's.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons to expect that the oil glut will NOT dry
up. All the major auto manufacturers have made large investments in
post-internal-combustion cars and have new prototypes of ``hybrid''
cars (that is, cars that run on both gas and electricity) and
fuel-cell cars to be mass-marketed by 2005-15, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota and Honda are already marketing hybrid models in the
United States that get 80 miles per gallon, and experts say that by
2015 these post-combustion cars will make up at least 20 percent of
new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Trends in the Middle East also bode well for lower oil prices,
particularly as U.S.-led sanctions against Iran, Iraq and Libya
begin to erode. Iraq, with 110 billion barrels in proven reserves,
has been held back from tapping them by U.N. sanctions since it
invaded Kuwait a decade ago. If sanctions are eased _ after, say,
Saddam Hussein is toppled, or the Desert Storm coalition collapses
completely _ one can expect to see Iraq's production rates double
within five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil-rich gulf, Iran and Kuwait are also working to reopen
their oil sectors to foreign investors, hoping to boost their
capacity to pump out oil, their political clout and their national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia is following suit, both to protect its regional
prominence and to stimulate its economy. The Royal Dutch/Shell
Group recently announced an $800 million investment in offshore
Iranian oil fields, which could further add to the glut.
</P>
<P>
   If Kuwait, Iran and Iraq get their way, and if non-OPEC
production grows at only two-thirds the rate it did between 1985
and 1995, oil markets could be even more oversupplied than in 1998
_ the year prices collapsed to $8 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   To consume all the oil that will probably be pumped out over the
next 10 years, world oil demand would need to grow by more than 3
percent per year, instead of the 1.8 percent annual growth rate
between 1980 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   If the days when the gulf was America's lifeline are fading,
then similarly, no Caspian oil will feed U.S. markets; rather, it
will flow to Europe and possibly to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of defending America's global oil supply will
probably complicate as the world's oil habits change. As U.S.
imports from the Persian Gulf diminish, the expensive U.S. military
role of ``guardian of the gulf'' will become increasingly
vulnerable to citizens at home calling for more burden-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Will Congress and the U.S. public continue to agree to spend
blood and treasure to protect the Persian Gulf region while such
allies _ and recipients of the region's fossil fuels _ as the
European Union and Japan play virtually no military role there?
Such questions have colored the debate about expanding NATO's
post-Cold War role beyond Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Then too, China's rising hunger for oil imports means that it
will depend more on the same energy resources and sea
transportation lanes shared by the United States, Japan and other
industrialized countries. China, which conceives of itself as an
emerging great power, however, probably will not be comfortable
relying on the U.S. Navy to defend the sea lanes through which its
own Persian Gulf oil lifeline will have to be strung.
</P>
<P>
   If China thinks it is more vulnerable in energy, it could become
more assertive, particularly if U.S.-Chinese relations turn
adversarial. But if generous supplies of oil at moderate prices
persist, energy issues might actually provide a good opportunity
for cooperation between China, its neighbors and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of the past century should have taught us that
politics, not geology, has ruled our oil-supply fate. Politics and
diplomacy brought the price of oil from $8 per barrel to $23 last
year. The internal politics of the Persian Gulf have repeatedly
disrupted U.S. oil supplies in the past and could do so again in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. dependence on Middle East oil wanes and Asian reliance
on it grows, a new set of issues will arise: rivalries between
Asian countries for oil supplies and complex problems about sharing
the burden for keeping the gulf's oil flowing freely.
</P>
<P>
   Properly assessing America's strategic situation in a world of
cheap oil _ in hopes of ensuring a more reliable oil supply _
should not be limited exclusively to military assistance but should
be linked to political and social institution-building and
diversified economic development.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, such reforms will better insulate the shakier countries
from the internal turbulence caused by volatile oil revenues.
Supply would be more secure, and the citizens of oil-producing
nations would gain more from the natural wealth their countries
control.
</P>
<P>
   Both producers and consumers thereby win _ regardless of how
high or low oil prices eventually wind up.

ENCOUNTERING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL'S BUMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   DETROIT _ Sometimes he sleeps in a motel next to the railroad
tracks. Sometimes he eats turkey and mayonnaise sandwiches from a
styrofoam box. He spends parts of his days riding a bus, and
sometimes, when he calls home late at night, his girls aren't
there.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush isn't exactly living the lyrics of a
Texas country song.
</P>
<P>
   But there are moments, shared by the more than 50 aides and
reporters by his side, when it certainly feels that way.
</P>
<P>
   Two months into the heart of Republican primary season, both
Bush and his chief rival, Senator John McCain, are beginning to
understand the odd grind that is the campaign trail, weathering not
just tedious days and bitter disappointments but also the personal
indignities of the road. And in the process, they are learning what
other candidates learned before them: that running for president is
a bizarre, haphazard experience for everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   Some compare it to being a college freshman, except the
chartered bus part.
</P>
<P>
   Others liken the experience to the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' with
traveling companions witnessing the same speech so often they can
recite every word.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders have a name for the ever-moving mass: ``The Bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Because amid the blur of daily political battles, as each
candidate's entourage is whisked across unfamiliar lands to crowded
gymnasiums and town halls, rarely is there a moment to break out
into the wide world. Or buy a newspaper. Or do laundry. Or take a
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Weekends are indistinguishable from weekdays. Hotel stays rarely
last more than 12 hours. Each morning begins with the same dreaded
ritual: ``Bag call,'' in which the luggage of the entourage is
surrendered to the candidate's staff before dawn, to be returned
just before midnight in another strange hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a vast culture of nomadic people swarming
across the country,'' Bush said in an interview last week over a
giant bag of Fritos purchased somewhere along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing about this experience is, this is not the
candidate. It's the entire . . . everybody. It's the DPS agents.
It's the press corps,'' he said. ``This is like a giant group of
folks, all of whom, in one way or another, have got a job to do,
but are sharing an experience.'' He was referring to the Texas
Department of Public Safety, which provides his security.
</P>
<P>
   It is an experience that has changed over time, as the press
corps has grown more diverse, and equipped with better technology.
The candidates, under increasing pressure to accommodate the
24-hour news demands of cable TV and the Internet, have made
punishing schedules par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   The manic daily routine seems itself central to the political
process, putting a candidate's fortitude on display for weeks on
end. As they spend long days with the traveling press corps _
sharing not only adversarial press conferences but also bumpy plane
rides and rotting meals _ the candidate undergoes a constant test
of temperament. While rarely written about, the odd backstage
moments with the press are often what shapes the depiction of the
candidate's character in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the backstage moments aren't always pretty.
</P>
<P>
   When a bout of stomach illness hit the McCain campaign last
week, it felled nearly one-quarter of veling group. Two of
the senator's press aides never made it out of their hotel. Even
the bus driver was sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw up on your own time,'' Representative Lindsey Graham
instructed the ailing Representative Mark Sanford, as both stumped
South Carolina for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush aides distributed a schedule to the traveling
entourage Sunday night trumpeting a two-night stay in Detroit, the
pleading headline summarized the group's plight: ``First double
overnight in weeks! Do your laundry! Please!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Bush communications director, Karen Hughes, hopped
off the campaign bus last week to stop at an automated teller
machine to withdraw cash, a rarely seen commodity on the campaign
trail, she caused an uproar among reporters who had spotted her
from the next bus. What, they demanded to know, was she doing
walking alone down the road?
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was playing hooky,'' Hughes said. ``It was
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, to be sure, are shielded from some of the more
serious deprivations of life and liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made no secret of his longing for home. He misses his
high-pressure shower with a nonsteaming shaving mirror, the
homemade granola of the governor's mansion kitchen staff in Austin,
the ranch outside Waco he began fixing up last July.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he says, he misses waking up beside Laura, his wife
of 22 years. These days, Bush is greeted each morning by a
25-year-old communications aide, Gordon Johndroe, who is carrying a
cell phone for an early radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush was able to fly his wife in for a visit on South
Carolina primary night.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain, so despondent about the time he has spent away from
his four children that he swears he would never run for president
again, has his wife, Cindy, on the campaign bus each day.
</P>
<P>
   But as the candidates are allowed just enough contact with
family and familiar routine to appear at ease in the public eye,
their top aides are likely to be suffering quietly in the
background, if not from homesickness, then from the logistical
nuisance of living out of suitcases for 45 days straight. McCain's
political director, Mike Murphy, has sent dirty laundry home by
Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   A senior McCain aide, John Weaver, who has been home twice since
Thanksgiving, has been known to disappear from the campaign bus to
buy a fresh shirt. Weaver's 7-year-old daughter told her teacher
that Dad is off ``trying to get rid of a president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot more clothes than I used to,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone is looking at clothes.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, after weeks traveling together, the participants
have grown accustomed to seeing one another at their worst,
learning whom not to approach before morning coffee, and
anticipating which staff member will fall asleep on a late plane
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Before the New Hampshire primary, one Bush aide dared to emerge
from her hotel room in light blue pajamas, an off-the-record event
that offered early evidence the Bush campaign was human, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less a study in politics and more of one in human
interactions,'' said a Bush pollster, Mark Allen. ``I think it
tends to start out with a wariness on both sides. But the process
of planes, trains, and automobiles tends to wear down a degree of
that defensiveness. Here are all these folks thrown together who
form bonds they probably would not otherwise form. . . . And some
interesting friendships develop as a result of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are clear even after seven weeks, as reporters on the
McCain campaign commiserate with staff members about the weight
they've gained, as reporters on the Bush campaign lament their
candidate's favorite lunch meat (bologna), and as everyone, on all
sides, competes to see who has gone the longest without paying
personal bills. Even Bush admitted: ``Your whole perspective on
life changes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what the heck,'' he said. ``It's part of running for
president.''
</P>

<P>
   It happened almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Before people in the United States even began to realize it,
they were living via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic culture now has an impact _ and even greater
depth and speed _ comparable to that of the railroad and the
electric light in the 19th century and plastics and antibiotics
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The decade of the '90s was the most prosperous in U.S. history,
and the Internet is both a product and a beneficiary of that. It's
a gigantic virtual marketplace where people can find whatever they
dream of, from medical diagnoses to movie tickets to plane
reservations to at-home visitors supplied by erotic escort
services.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a day goes by when someone in the average American
middle-class family doesn't do an Internet transaction. Most of the
flowers and boxes of chocolates sent by people in love on
Valentine's Day were ordered from Yahoo.com and Altavista.com, two
favorite virtual ``sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Many bills that used to be paid by mail, from mortgages to
monthly cable-TV fees to private club dues, are now electronic,
click-of-a-mouse transactions. Perhaps the Internet is a good
explanation for the growing number of fat people in the United
States: If everything can be done within easy reach of the
keyboard, why move at all?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand, then, the chaos that exploded during
the second week of February, when electronic pirates _ known as
``hackers'' _ attacked the Yahoo Internet site and created an
incredible bottleneck. The invasion, anonymous and impossible to
contain, was so well coordinated that separate parts of the plan
were able to evolve like clockwork. One by one, other major Web
sites were disrupted: Amazon, eBay, and buy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has pinpointed a credible motive. Perhaps it was all
merely to show the world that the great Internet commercial sites
are actually very vulnerable to invasion and that, furthermore,
their weaknesses can be protected probably only by ``good'' hackers
whose skills are greater than those of the ``bad'' attackers.
</P>
<P>
   In the most authoritative newspaper columns,
information-technology analysts have likened what happened in
cyberspace to this scenario: a sale at a major department store for
which hundreds of thousands of customers arrive at the same time,
but only 10,000 were expected over the course of a week.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, the February attack also bears the sinister feel
of the actions of a serial killer who strikes simply and solely
because he wants to, and nobody can guess who the next victim will
be.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time now I have wondered what makes a hacker, what
his moral code and his lifestyle might be. In the movies they've
been portrayed as gaunt young men who conspire in dark and dirty
basement rooms and grasp their computers as though they were
bloodthirsty knives.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, their image is different. At the university where
I work, the hackers describe themselves as ``white hats.'' They've
told me that their virtual universe has its own culture and
language, its own music and its own clear moral boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   I met some of these young men in mid-February, soon after the
attack on Yahoo. Far from gaunt and dirty, they were athletic, well
mannered and professionally employed in part-time mainstream jobs,
earning no less than $2,000 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them had positions in the information-security areas of
major high-tech corporations in the area of New Jersey between
Princeton and Edison: the home of medical laboratories, cell-phone
manufacturers and international hotel chains.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven I met, three were Indian, two were Korean, one was
Russian and the other was born in Kansas of Chinese parents.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that on Thursday and Saturday nights they meet at
Clyde's, a bar in New Brunswick that features 53 kinds of Martinis.
There they talk about their cybernetic adventures in a language no
ordinary non-''tekkie'' can put into normal written language: bits,
bytes and so on.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rajeev, one of the Indian computer experts, the
Yahoo invasion had all the earmarks of a program sent through the
Internet in November _ one that was signed by ``Mixter.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later I read in The New York Times that Mixter had
been found. He is, it seems, a 20-year-old German hacker who lives
near Hanover, N.J., and is believed to have created one of the most
damaging viruses of the '90s: the Magnolia Web.
</P>
<P>
   By the hackers' moral code, Rajeev told me, Mixter is a gray,
which means he's someone who hasn't yet crossed the boundary into
the territory of the white hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are something like a brotherhood and we have learned to
identify each other,'' Rajeev said. ``I'll bet you that Mixter is a
Prodigy fanatic and his favorite song is `Voodoo People.'
Everything he does has that techno trademark. As far as I'm
concerned he's too heavy. Those kids think they are gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoom, one of the Koreans, tried to sketch for me the evil ones,
the ``black hats.'' ``Even though nothing is hard and fast with
us,'' he told me, ``and any of us white hats might turn gray
tomorrow, for no particular reason, I can tell you that none of us
would become a black hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're despicable. You know what they're after? A power rush.
Adrenaline. ... I met a black hat in Nebraska. He lived alone. ...
His house smelled like a cave. This guy would pick some innocent
person who lived 1,000 miles away and access his e-mail _ it's so
easy _ and then destroy this person's life: read his mail and
sometimes answer it for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd use the victim's credit card. ... Once he even changed a
poor guy's blood analysis report _ the man was about to have
emergency surgery. Finally he got bored and found another human
target, but not before dispatching a virus that destroyed the other
computer memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this, and what for? Just to show that he was better, that
he knew more, that he had someone else's life in his hands. For a
black hat, there is no law besides vanity, no religion other than
ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the attack on Yahoo and other electronic business
centers has created an almost metaphysical panic in the American
economy _ panic in the face of an evil that nobody is able to
define or analyze or predict. What will happen, one wonders, if the
amoral black hats do infiltrate the crusading white hats, creating
inexplicable chaos?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has created a new lifestyle and a new language, but
it is also creating new forms of evil and destruction. This century
is just beginning, and reality is already different.

UPCOMING CONTESTS PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Fresh from wins in Michigan and Arizona,
Senator John McCain still faces a daunting road in his quest for
the Republican nomination, but it is paved with possibilities
across the country, from New England to Ohio to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are many difficulties. Some key upcoming
contests, including New York and California, do not allow
independents and Democrats to participate in Republican primaries
for delegate selection. Two other key states, Texas and Florida,
have governors named Bush. And McCain's popularity has been
dropping among the GOP, while Texas Governor George W. Bush is
still favored by most Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of McCain's difficulties are overstated. Some of
the closed primaries, such as the ones in Connecticut and Maine,
occur where McCain is highly popular. A just-released New York poll
shows the GOP race has become a dead heat. California, the biggest
primary with the largest slate of delegates, has a history of
electing moderate Republicans, and Bush's father, former President
Bush, was not especially popular there.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush's three biggest perceived advantages _ money,
endorsements and inevitability _ have faded in importance. Thanks
to Bush's extraordinary spending pace and McCain's surging
contributions, the Arizona senator is financially competitive. Some
Bush endorsements, such as the one by Michigan Governor John
Engler, have been ineffective or may have backfired. And the last
pillar, inevitability, clearly is teetering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it is Bush for the nomination, but momentum is a
huge factor and it is not much of a stretch to see how McCain could
get it,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg. For that to
happen, Rothenberg said, Republicans would need to perceive McCain
as having the best chance of winning the general election and to
become more comfortable with the idea that he really is a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   During his victory speech Tuesday night, McCain pointed out that
Republicans should not fear him, but join him. The implicit message
was they should abandon the Texas governor if they want to
recapture the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more
Republicans,'' McCain said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after all, soared in popularity last year partly on the
wings of three words: He can win. At the time, polls showed Bush
clobbering Vice President Al Gore or Bill Bradley in hypothetical
matchups. McCain and the other GOP candidates didn't run nearly as
strong.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the situation is reversed. According to the latest
Gallup poll, Bush would beat Gore 50 percent to 45 percent, still
within the survey's 3-point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrast, would beat Gore 59 percent to 35 percent,
the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told supporters after his Michigan defeat that he would
start winning because Republicans would dominate upcoming contests.
But that is not entirely the case. During the next two weeks, 553
delegates will be selected in closed primaries, while 601 will be
chosen in primaries that also allow independents or Democrats to
vote, according to the Hotline political newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Polls still show Bush well ahead nationally, but most surveys
were taken before McCain's victory in Michigan. And McCain has
shown that a strong showing in one state can reduce his gap with
Bush by 20 points overnight.
</P>
<P>
   More revealing are national polls that have begun to expose
Bush's weaknesses. For example, the Gallup poll, conducted Sunday
and Monday, showed that only 39 percent of Republicans agreed with
the statement that Bush is ``not a typical politician.'' By
contrast, 53 percent of Republicans viewed McCain that way. The
same poll showed that Bush has a favorable/unfavorable rating of 58
percent to 35 percent, while McCain's rating is 65 percent to 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strength has also been his weakness. He has succeeded
by winning support among independents and Democrats. But in the
process, McCain has angered many Republicans who will vote in the
upcoming primaries. As Bush's win in South Carolina demonstrated,
McCain is not popular among those allied with the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain has one of the most conservative records of any
senator, with a few notable exceptions on campaign finance and
tobacco regulation, the political perception among many voters is
that he is more moderate. His chief message _ that he is a reformer
_ puts him in an anti-establishment camp that appeals to many
independents.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming primary schedule is a combination of good news and
bad news for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCain is hoping for at least a split, with a win in
Washington, which resembles New Hampshire's political makeup, and a
tougher battle in Virginia, which is similar in many ways to South
Carolina. Both Virginia and Washington have open primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The big day is March 7, with 16 primaries and caucuses. McCain
hopes to complement his New Hampshire victory with a sweep of the
five other New England states. For example, while Connecticut has a
closed Republican primary, a recent Connecticut poll shows McCain
ahead 13 points among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Wednesday that he was on ``very, very good footing,
particularly among the northeastern states.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also hopes, with some justification, that he can win in
the moderate states of Maryland and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a contest in a number of major states: New York,
California, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, this looks good for McCain. The March 7 schedule
is focused disproportionately on California and the Northeast _
traditionally solid ground for moderate Republicans. New York is a
Republican-only primary where Bush is much better organized, but a
Marist Institute poll released Wednesday found that the race has
suddenly become a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   California, with 162 delegates, has a complicated and vital
contest. It has a ``beauty contest'' GOP vote in which any
registered voter can participate, but only the votes of Republicans
count toward the winner-takes-all selection of delegates. In other
words, McCain could win the beauty contest without getting a single
delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidate that wins the California primary will be the
nominee,'' McCain spokesman Dan Schnur said. ``March 7 will
determine the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other key states have open primaries that day, which
means McCain could draw votes from independents and Democrats. But
with Democratic contests also being held that day, independents
could choose Al Gore or Bill Bradley, taking away possible support
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain doesn't do well on March 7, it probably would be
impossible for him to catch up. One week later on March 14, the
battleground is largely on Bush territory _ Texas and Florida,
where brother Jeb Bush is governor. The two states provide 204
delegates, a sizable chunk of the 1,034 needed to win. Bush also
has an edge in the other Southern states voting on March 14 _
Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana.

<P>
   As the primaries go wholesale across the country, it will become
even more painfully obvious how much money talks. Money talked on
buttons, billboards, bands and bumper stickers in Iowa and New
Hampshire, but it now drowns out every other medium as it shouts
with television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if money is speech, then political money is political
speech. And political speech is protected by the First Amendment:
``Congress shall make no law. ...'' _ right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly, the Supreme Court keeps saying. To help curb
the corrupt influence of political money, the court has too
cleverly maintained for a generation that money doesn't actually
speak; it only enables speech.
</P>
<P>
   So when candidates use money to promote themselves, it reasons,
their dollars are as instrumental as their vocal cords and may
never be constrained. But it's OK to put some limits on money
contributed to a candidate, the court thinks, because a donor's
views are no less clearly expressed with a gift of a thousand
dollars than of a million.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of this splitting of First Amendment hairs have
been horrendous.
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited spending has resulted in unlimited television combat.
The candidates with the most money _ their own or their patrons' _
get to speak the loudest. And the biggest donors gain the greatest
influence over public affairs. The system mocks the Supreme Court's
once proud assertion of the rule of ``one person, one vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians have to spend their days soliciting
contributions and redeeming promises made to contributors.
Millionaires can be spared this corruption but, like Steve Forbes
or Ross Perot, get to meddle in contests for which they would never
otherwise qualify.
</P>
<P>
   More perniciously still, well-heeled contributors and interest
groups that seek political power routinely collude with needy
office-seekers to find new paths around the hollow contribution
limits.
</P>
<P>
   They ``bundle'' hundreds of checks from corporate employees or
union members to turn small gifts into conspicuous six-figure
offerings. Or they make in-kind contributions of incalculable
worth, providing planes, cars, computers and troops to wage the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest of all to police is so-called soft money. In cynical
disregard of legal limits, big donors have learned to channel vast
sums to national and state political parties, which then buy
television ads that falsely claim to be uncoordinated with the
candidates who benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of reform, congressional majorities have tried to
outlaw soft money. But that is a futile effort; whatever Congress
or the Supreme Court may decide, political money will always flow,
like water, into the thirsty soil of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Close the party pipeline and the ads will be bought instead by a
gaggle of new ``committees'' and ``associations,'' all aimed at
supporting or attacking specific candidates. And as long as
candidates need enormous sums, they will give excessive weight to
the interests of their big contributors. (In New York this year,
two already well-known contenders for the Senate, who command the
full resources of the White House and New York's City Hall, will
nonetheless spend about $50 million, much of it from donors who
want access and extensive favors.)
</P>
<P>
   In again addressing the issue a few weeks ago, the nine justices
of the Supreme Court wrote five separate opinions, all revealing an
obvious guilt about the confusion and corruption to which they have
contributed. Ruling on a relatively minor case from Missouri, a
majority of six justices reaffirmed the hair-split that permits
limits on contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the six thought the court's past rulings may still
leave room for constitutional spending limits as well. Two other
justices said all limits were intolerable. And Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy, acknowledging an evil mess, wanted to flee from past
rulings and give Congress one more shot at finding a way to limit
both contributions and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, he thinks (like many Republicans in Congress) that
instant disclosure of contributions would avert most corruption.
This naively assumes that the public could quickly find the true
sponsors and motives of the charmingly named Do-Good and
All-American associations that flourish every electoral season.
</P>
<P>
   There simply is no effective way to stop the flow of money from
donors intent on buying influence over public servants and policy.
It's the office-seekers' need to buy costly television ads that
needs to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of all political TV ads this year will approach $2
billion. It would be cheaper by far for taxpayers to pay for
commercials directly than to suffer the payoffs the winners must
make with huge tax breaks and subsidies. Congress could even demand
free air time to match every purchased minute, as it has done in
its antidrug propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   But an even happier remedy would be to chase all those noisy,
mendacious ads off the air. Political commercials should be
burdened with the fairness doctrine that used to be imposed on TV
editorials and commercial ads. A simple rule that every political
ad must pay for equal time for an opposing view would either level
the playing field or eliminate most 30-second spots.
</P>
<P>
   In their place, society has a right to demand that national
networks and local stations redeem their debt for the use of the
public spectrum by giving candidates ample free time to introduce
themselves and their views.
</P>
<P>
   A government-sponsored commission that studied the problem of
fair campaigning recommended last year that TV stations voluntarily
provide a mere five minutes each night for ``candidate discourse''
on the 30 nights preceding elections _ if only to compensate for
television's shameful abandonment of serious political news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly any broadcasters heeded the plea. Even if they did,
that proposal alone would do nothing to reduce the candidates' need
for money to buy commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Whether defined as direct or indirect speech, money is property.
By requiring our politicians to command huge sums for TV
campaigning, we have in effect erected a property requirement _ a
means test _ for public service.
</P>
<P>
   We have created a system of pay and payoff that forces
officeholders to sell their favor to moneyed elites, raising the
taxes and diminishing the voice of most Americans.

 &HT;    
 By JACK HITT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was only two years ago that Bob Dole went on ``The Larry King
Show'' to discuss his prostate-cancer operation.
 &HT;    During a commercial break, so the story goes, King leaned over
to ask his old friend, confidentially, how he was dealing with the
operation's grimmest side effect, impotence.
 &HT;    Dole cheerfully informed the talk-show host that there was a new
drug, Viagra, and miraculously, it had cured the problem. King
asked Dole if he would discuss it on the air, and Dole said sure,
why not?
 &HT;    The world was about to become a very different place. Viagra
would cycle through the expected paces of pop-culture acceptance
with stunning speed.
 &HT;    Leno and Letterman got an entire summer's worth of monologues
off the subject. And the newspapers regularly pumped out clowning
(and possibly true) stories about the drug. For example, there was
Frank Bernardo, 70, who left his wife, declaring, ``It's time for
me to be a stud again.'' There was also Gen. Sani Abacha of
Nigeria, who died in the midst of a Viagra-fueled encounter with
two women in his magisterial bed.
 &HT;    But the jokes are over. Viagra's sales topped $1 billion in the
first year and Pfizer is now the second-largest drug company in the
world. The drug's use has leveled off, but consider the level:
Nearly 200,000 prescriptions are filled each week, and 17 million
Americans have used the drug.
 &HT;    Viagra has been embraced by the well off (4 percent of the total
population of Palm Beach County has a prescription), but not only
by the well off. Not long ago, Wal-Mart and Kmart had a Viagra war
that drove the per-pill price down from $10 to $7.80.
 &HT;    At this moment, there are at least a dozen new Viagra-like
medicines and devices currently in clinical trials.
 &HT;    Many of these drugs are for men, but this time around, there are
just as many for women _ specifically, for a new phylum of illness,
female sexual dysfunction, which will soon cycle through the same
paces as ``erectile dysfunction,'' setting the word ``frigidity''
alongside ``impotence'' in our dictionary of merry old archaisms.
 &HT;    ``Our knowledge of sexual health is in revolutionary mode,''
says Dr. Irwin Goldstein, a Boston University urologist and pioneer
in the field.
 &HT;    With $1 billion in sales for Viagra, the research pressure is
intense, yielding paper titles like ``The Ejaculatory Behavior in
Sexually Sluggish Male Rats. ...'' Scientists, doctors and
pharmaceutical companies are racing to discover newer and better
drugs.
 &HT;    Who doubts they will improve the lives of those who suffer from
the newly discovered sexual disorders now showing up in the medical
journals? But these drugs will also have, some say, an
''enhancing'' effect on normally functioning people.
 &HT;    More important, the temptation for anyone to obtain these drugs
will be more easily satisfied than ever before because the family
of pharmaceuticals inspired by Viagra is entering the market at a
time when medicine is decentralizing, slipping the reins long held
by doctors.
 &HT;    For most of the 20th century, any sexual complaint was treated
on the psychiatric couch, not in the lab. Only comparatively
recently has impotence been understood to be an organic disease _
potentially identifiable and treatable with medicine.
 &HT;    The change is part of a cultural shift that dates back to the
birth-control pill, when mostly young people were liberated to
experiment with sex fearlessly outside of marriage. Many moral
conservatives continue to condemn the era for unleashing the
Pandoran epidemics of teen-age pregnancy, sexually transmitted
disease and moral decline.
 &HT;    But this telling of the story ignores a more subtle and
significant shift.
 &HT;    Average folks _ young and old, liberal and conservative _ began
to accept that sex was not a biblical imperative whose sole aim is
procreation, but a lively part of good health _ something to be
enjoyed, like great food and laughter, well into old age. This is
the revolution that Dole has joined at the barricades.
 &HT;    The distinction is not just medical; it's metaphysical.
Psychological problems carry with them the full freight of personal
responsibility. But a physical problem seems more like a cosmic
error, something unrelated to a person's actions.
 &HT;    It's no flaw in your manhood or womanhood if your sexual organs
don't work. It's a ``disorder'' _ and by being labeled as one, it
becomes something detached from your own true self and easier for a
patient to emotionally confront and for a doctor to treat.
 &HT;    Indeed, now that Dole has made the world safe for sexual-health
research, new hypotheses and fresh ideas seem commonplace in this
growing new field.
 &HT;    And many of the cutting-edge discoveries are occurring for
women. Last year, the Journal of the American Medical Association
published a study reporting that 43 percent of women experience
some kind of sexual dysfunction.
 &HT;    Recently, the Network for Excellence in Women's Sexual Health
was organized to help doctors and health care professionals who
want to enter this area of practice. Tests and experiments are
being conducted in university labs and corporate R-and-D facilities
all over the country.
 &HT;    The cumulative lesson of much of this research is leading to two
categories of treatments _ hormone therapy, which restores desire,
and various drugs, which amplify the sensation of arousal.
 &HT;    Many companies are researching hormone medicines. Solvay already
markets one called Estratest. Organon is in trials with a treatment
called tibolone, which is believed to increase desire. Dr. Glenn
Braunstein, an endocrinologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles, is working on a ``testosterone patch'' under grants
from the marketing giant Procter &AMP; Gamble.
 &HT;    But the real gold rush is occurring in the other field of
research _ creating a drug to increase blood flow to the genitals.
The researchers want something simple _ a tablet or perhaps even
better, a quick-acting cream that is stabilized at room temperature
so that women can carry it in a purse like lipstick or men can just
toss it into a shaving kit.
 &HT;    The competition is furious among small firms, each with a
blood-flow drug _ some for men, some for women _ that's anywhere
from one to five years from getting to market. Herewith a sampling,
complete with active ingredients:
 &HT;    -- Vivus: prostaglandin E-1 cream.
 &HT;    -- MacroChem: a gel, using a version of prostaglandin E-1 called
Topiglan.
 &HT;    -- NexMed: alprostadil, a variant of prostaglandin E-1 cream.
 &HT;    -- Tap Pharmaceuticals: an apomorphine treatment formulated into
a small tablet placed under the tongue.
 &HT;    -- Pentech Pharmaceutical: ditto.
 &HT;    -- Zonagen: phentolamine, in tablets and suppositories.
 &HT;    -- Pfizer: Viagra for women (sildenafil).
 &HT;    -- Palatin Technologies: a peptide molecule derivative called
PT-14; in the earliest test stages.
 &HT;    -- ICOS Corp.: a tablet code-named IC351. (That's all they would
reveal.) Bill Gates, who may be telling us something, owns almost
13 percent of the company.
 &HT;    I wanted to compile a complete list of every sex drug currently
in trials. But it became an endless pursuit, the research being so
frenetic and the line between legitimate and illegitimate being so
confusing.
 &HT;    Obviously, once hard science ratified the actual existence of a
drug like Viagra, the very reality of it was a wake-up call to
America's snake-oil salesmen. Infomercials have shifted from
vegetable slicers and wrinkle tonics to ``natural'' aphrodisiacs.
There is scarcely a tree left standing in the rain forest whose
bark hasn't been stripped and tested for the alternative-health
industry.
 &HT;    The Internet is teeming with unsolicited ads for products with
vaguely homonymic names, though none of them come close to Pfizer's
allegedly unintended melding of ``vital'' and ``Niagara'' to
generate the best product name since Coke.
 &HT;    Some long-touted aphrodisiacs are now being tested too. A
derivative of chili peppers is in legitimate trials. Does this
count as a drug?
 &HT;    NitroMed, a company based in Massachusetts, is working on a
mixture of an old passion powder called yohimbe (stripped from the
inner bark of the Corynanthe yohimbe tree in tropical West Africa)
combined with an amino acid called L-Arginine to see if the two can
work effectively as a vasodilator _ that is, a chemical that
increases blood flow.
 &HT;    Then there are the nondrug inventions. A company called
UroMetrics is working on a vacuum device, fitted with a small cup
the size of a thimble, and intended to draw blood directly to the
clitoris. It might be easy to dismiss this as a sex toy, except
that it's also in trials for FDA approval, and UroMetrics intends
to distribute it only as a medical device via prescription.
 &HT;    The pace of change inside this small research world also means
that almost no one is stopping to reflect on the implications of
the drugs that are marching _ and there really is no stopping them
now _ toward the marketplace.
 &HT;    It would be nice if all medical breakthroughs were just to treat
the kind of complaints outlined by doctors. But welcome to the
world of 21st-century consumer needs; there's ``medicine'' for the
most curious things. With couples holding down two jobs and the
enraged pace of modern life, who doubts that a drug-enhanced
four-minute sexual encounter among harried day traders could become
the norm?
 &HT;    The whole idea of a long slow evening won't necessarily
disappear. It'll just go the way of sitting on the porch, the 3
o'clock dinner and the literary novel _ something experienced over
the holidays or on vacation.
 &HT;    ``I find it simply incredible this whole thing is happening,''
said Leonore Tiefer, a psychologist at the New York University
School of Medicine and pretty much the only critic of all this
research I could find. ``There is no such thing as 'female sexual
dysfunction,''' she added. ``It's a social construction invented to
benefit the drug companies.''
 &HT;    Tiefer believes that a kind of ``magical thinking'' infects the
way most of us imagine our sexuality. That it can always be better,
and that we resist the natural changes that define the arc of a
well-lived life: ``That's where this disorder comes in and says,
'If there is a change' _ and invariably there is a change in life _
'then change is bad.' Ah, a problem! So we invent a universal
model, a normative view of sex. If you don't get wet for X period
of seconds from Y pressure of stimulation, then you have a
problem.''
 &HT;    Tiefer was evasive when I asked her about the existence of real
medical conditions being cured by these new drugs. She believes the
medicalization of sex gives people an out _ a way to avoid the root
cause of their sexual problems.
 &HT;    ``I don't see many women depressed about the blood flow to the
genitalia. They are depressed about many other things about sex,
but not that. This research should be done, of course, but with a
few dollars, by a few people, in a few places. But it should not be
this Boeing of sex research.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, many researchers dismiss Tiefer's ideas as
rear-guard propaganda to protect the sex concession that therapists
have held for so long. Fears that the medical establishment will
big-foot the psychologists' business is not an imaginary concern
these days.
 &HT;    The central theme of Peter Kramer's now-classic book,
``Listening to Prozac,'' is the observation that, in the treatment
of depression, drug therapy has driven talk therapy right out of
business.
 &HT;    Beyond the idea of making sex into a very goal-oriented act,
where Viagra and its progeny are truly revolutionary is in putting
something mysterious and uncontrollable under our control. These
drugs suddenly enable us to ``control'' our own sexual health,
pushing the idea of sexuality far beyond the lab or the couch.
Tiefer's ideas seem to presume that these medical inventions will
stay under the strict control of doctors, that the old rules of the
medical-industrial complex still apply.
 &HT;    But the Golden Age of the AMA is over. The appearance of Viagra
has taken place at a time when medicine itself is in the process of
decentralizing and allowing market forces to guide many decisions.
 &HT;    Increasingly, patients are told to take charge of their own
health care; politicians debate a ``patient's bill of rights.''
HMOs themselves are built on the idea that individuals will decide
the general direction of their own care. Doctors are increasingly
called health-care ``providers'' as drugs are now marketed directly
to patients.
 &HT;    Viagra was one of the first new drugs introduced to the world
alongside the slogan: ``Ask your doctor about. ...''
 &HT;    In this loosey-goosey environment, Viagra has already slipped
into the recreational underground _ far beyond the reach of both
psychologists and doctors. Of course, the authorities have tried to
crack down on the practice of selling pharmaceuticals online. And
in December, President Clinton called on the FDA to take measures
to stop the practice.
 &HT;    But controlling the Web is futile, as I discovered one day last
winter when I typed ``Viagra and aphrodisiac'' into a search engine
and was offered hundreds of choices. The Web sites sound like
jokes: ``drugman.com'' and ``mywebdr.com'' and ``viagraguys.com.''
 &HT;    I opted to get my fix from a Web site called ``kwikmed.com.''
 &HT;    After I signed on _ I waited while this message scrolled by:
``Brought to you by Tide Detergent'' _ I was instructed to fill out
an on-line medical interview.
 &HT;    I was asked obvious questions, like ``Are you taking any heart
medication?'' I told the truth and said no. I was asked only a
couple of private questions, but I admitted to no dysfunction
whatsoever.
 &HT;    Only one question was devoted to ascertaining my ``problem.'' So
I wrote: ``Life is not as good as it should be'' _ a philosophical
statement I have pretty much always lived by. When I clicked the
box marked Send, I instantaneously received a message back saying
my doctor had ``approved me for Viagra,'' unless of course my
credit card didn't clear.
 &HT;    The next morning, at the crack of the workday, barely 12 hours
after I had clicked the send button, the FedEx guy appeared with an
envelope that rattled when he handed it to me. In a brown bottle
were 10 of the famous blue diamond-shaped pills. The crooked label
looked as if it had been produced on an Officemax printer. My
doctor was someone named ``A. Guzman.''
 &HT;    As we permit more and more market forces to take command of the
health-care industry, it shouldn't surprise anyone that the new
drug dealer will not be found in the shadows, offering sinsemilla
under his breath. He's already sitting right on our desks, his
cursor winking at us.

 By JACK HITT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was only two years ago that Bob Dole went on ``The Larry King
Show'' to discuss his prostate-cancer operation.
 &HT;    During a commercial break, so the story goes, King leaned over
to ask his old friend, confidentially, how he was dealing with the
operation's grimmest side effect, impotence.
 &HT;    Dole cheerfully informed the talk-show host that there was a new
drug, Viagra, and miraculously, it had cured the problem. King
asked Dole if he would discuss it on the air, and Dole said sure,
why not?
 &HT;    The world was about to become a very different place. Viagra
would cycle through the expected paces of pop-culture acceptance
with stunning speed.
 &HT;    Leno and Letterman got an entire summer's worth of monologues
off the subject. And the newspapers regularly pumped out clowning
(and possibly true) stories about the drug. For example, there was
Frank Bernardo, 70, who left his wife, declaring, ``It's time for
me to be a stud again.'' There was also Gen. Sani Abacha of
Nigeria, who died in the midst of a Viagra-fueled encounter with
two women in his magisterial bed.
 &HT;    But the jokes are over. Viagra's sales topped $1 billion in the
first year and Pfizer is now the second-largest drug company in the
world. The drug's use has leveled off, but consider the level:
Nearly 200,000 prescriptions are filled each week, and 17 million
Americans have used the drug.
 &HT;    Viagra has been embraced by the well off (4 percent of the total
population of Palm Beach County has a prescription), but not only
by the well off. Not long ago, Wal-Mart and Kmart had a Viagra war
that drove the per-pill price down from $10 to $7.80.
 &HT;    At this moment, there are at least a dozen new Viagra-like
medicines and devices currently in clinical trials.
 &HT;    Many of these drugs are for men, but this time around, there are
just as many for women _ specifically, for a new phylum of illness,
female sexual dysfunction, which will soon cycle through the same
paces as ``erectile dysfunction,'' setting the word ``frigidity''
alongside ``impotence'' in our dictionary of merry old archaisms.
 &HT;    ``Our knowledge of sexual health is in revolutionary mode,''
says Dr. Irwin Goldstein, a Boston University urologist and pioneer
in the field.
 &HT;    With $1 billion in sales for Viagra, the research pressure is
intense, yielding paper titles like ``The Ejaculatory Behavior in
Sexually Sluggish Male Rats. ...'' Scientists, doctors and
pharmaceutical companies are racing to discover newer and better
drugs.
 &HT;    Who doubts they will improve the lives of those who suffer from
the newly discovered sexual disorders now showing up in the medical
journals? But these drugs will also have, some say, an
''enhancing'' effect on normally functioning people.
 &HT;    More important, the temptation for anyone to obtain these drugs
will be more easily satisfied than ever before because the family
of pharmaceuticals inspired by Viagra is entering the market at a
time when medicine is decentralizing, slipping the reins long held
by doctors.
 &HT;    For most of the 20th century, any sexual complaint was treated
on the psychiatric couch, not in the lab. Only comparatively
recently has impotence been understood to be an organic disease _
potentially identifiable and treatable with medicine.
 &HT;    The change is part of a cultural shift that dates back to the
birth-control pill, when mostly young people were liberated to
experiment with sex fearlessly outside of marriage. Many moral
conservatives continue to condemn the era for unleashing the
Pandoran epidemics of teen-age pregnancy, sexually transmitted
disease and moral decline.
 &HT;    But this telling of the story ignores a more subtle and
significant shift.
 &HT;    Average folks _ young and old, liberal and conservative _ began
to accept tha sex was not a biblical imperative whose sole aim is
procreation, but a lively part of good health _ something to be
enjoyed, like great food and laughter, well into old age. This is
the revolution that Dole has joined at the barricades.
 &HT;    The distinction is not just medical; it's metaphysical.
Psychological problems carry with them the full freight of personal
responsibility. But a physical problem seems more like a cosmic
error, something unrelated to a person's actions.
 &HT;    It's no flaw in your manhood or womanhood if your sexual organs
don't work. It's a ``disorder'' _ and by being labeled as one, it
becomes something detached from your own true self and easier for a
patient to emotionally confront and for a doctor to treat.
 &HT;    Indeed, now that Dole has made the world safe for sexual-health
research, new hypotheses and fresh ideas seem commonplace in this
growing new field.
 &HT;    And many of the cutting-edge discoveries are occurring for
women. Last year, the Journal of the American Medical Association
published a study reporting that 43 percent of women experience
some kind of sexual dysfunction.
 &HT;    Recently, the Network for Excellence in Women's Sexual Health
was organized to help doctors and health care professionals who
want to enter this area of practice. Tests and experiments are
being conducted in university labs and corporate R-and-D facilities
all over the country.
 &HT;    The cumulative lesson of much of this research is leading to two
categories of treatments _ hormone therapy, which restores desire,
and various drugs, which amplify the sensation of arousal.
 &HT;    Many companies are researching hormone medicines. Solvay already
markets one called Estratest. Organon is in trials with a treatment
called tibolone, which is believed to increase desire. Dr. Glenn
Braunstein, an endocrinologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles, is working on a ``testosterone patch'' under grants
from the marketing giant Procter &AMP; Gamble.
 &HT;    But the real gold rush is occurring in the other field of

The researchers want something simple _ a tablet or perhaps even

derivative of chili peppers is in legitimate trials. Does this
count as a drug?
 &HT;    NitroMed, a company based in Massachusetts, is working on a

inner bark of the Corynanthe yohimbe tree in tropical West Africa)
combined with an amino acid called L-Arginine to see if the two can

 A WASTELAND of PSEUDO-WOMEN'S CULTURE  
 &HT;     (This article has already moved to Centerpiece clients. To
publish as a ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased _ the

Syndicate sales representatives:

 &HT;    (--Latin America: ANA PENA in New York, 310-996-0075; fax, By FRANCINE PROSE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The TV ads for iVillage.com, one of the rising stars in the
ever-expanding galaxy of women's Web sites, suggests that, for the
modern woman, logging on to the Internet provides all the comfort
Mom found in the long hot bath combined with the fun and fellowship
of an evening out with the girls.
 &HT;    The animation of the actresses playing ordinary women intensely
engaged with their computers implies that the after-hours
``cybervisit'' is the perfect antidote to an exhausting day of work
or child care, or both. It promises relaxation and distraction,
solitude and community, the I and the Village, all during a few
precious moments stolen _ just for us! _ from our families and
jobs.
 &HT;    How dispiriting, then, to discover that what we've stolen is the
chance to read an on-line women's magazine, far below whatever
standard still prevails in the most dumbed-down print magazines,
and with far less attractive graphics than Martha Stewart Living.
The articles are short, vapid, carelessly written. The tone is
Valley Girl friendly, relentlessly chipper and upbeat. Did you know
that chocolate may be good for your heart?
 &HT;    ``Take some time to make yourself look good!'' suggests an
advice column on Making the Transition From Housewife to Employee.
``Not interested in football?'' asks a winter-weekend feature.
``Cook up a 'Souper' Bowl and other tasty snacks for your favorite
football fans!''
 &HT;    The challenge is to absorb all this useful information while
ignoring the flashing full-color advertisements tempting us to go
shopping, the real cure for women's problems. Buy yourself a sexy
new dress and shoes to match!
 &HT;    IVillage is only a symptom of the virulent cultural separatism
currently generating a profusion of products and services created
specifically for women. This new ``women's culture'' embraces not
only Web sites and on-line magazines but also books, films,
television series and entertainment networks that circumscribe, and
then pander to, so-called women's interests _ an admittedly narrow
range that runs the entire gamut from cosmetics to child care, from
personal grooming to personal relationships.
 &HT;    Underneath this otherwise inexplicable new eagerness to give
women what they want are surveys proving that an exponentially
growing number of traditional and e-commerce consumers are female.
Indeed, a Jupiter Communications study predicts that by 2003, women
will be spending a cool $53 billion per year on Internet purchases.
 &HT;    Were it not for the promise of money to be made, women's culture
would be arousing about as much attention as, say, Uzbek culture.
This may explain why marketers tend to adopt an anthropological
tone, implying that women are an alien species, mystifying yet
tractable if approached correctly.
 &HT;    What's truly mystifying, however, is that it's so often women _
and not clueless male executives _ staging these expensive inquests
into the natures and buying patterns of their newly affluent
sisters. Much of the theorizing and sloganeering is being done by
women such as Candice Carpenter, a co-founder of iVillage.com;
Geraldine Laybourne, chairman of Oxygen Media; and a newly visible
group of female CEOs and marketing consultants.
 &HT;    What everyone appears to agree on is that women's off- and
on-line needs are determined by the ``fact'' that females value
human relationships more than do their male counterparts.
 &HT;    Faith Popcorn, the trend spotter and corporate consultant whose
book on marketing to women, ``EVEolution,'' will appear this June,
counsels: ``Marketing to women requires not just learning, but
unlearning. Marketers will need to create a rich series of
connections and bonds rather than episodic consumer collisions.''
 &HT;    This re-education will, it seems, come naturally to women,
thanks to what MLM Talk Online calls ``their advanced social and
people skills. The current rage of 'Relationship Marketing' just
puts a new label on the tools that women have always used to build
their business.''
 &HT;    If the notion of female entrepreneurs forging mutually
gratifying bonds with suppliers and clients is new, the basic idea
has been floating through the culture for some time.
 &HT;    For isn't this what certain psychologists _ Carol Gilligan, et
al. _ have been claiming for years: that women are by nature more
feeling, more nurturing, more relationship-oriented? Gilligan's
landmark book, ``In a Different Voice,'' argues that women make
moral decisions based on issues of human relationship. Her
influential studies of adolescent girls suggest that females see
themselves as existing in relationship with others.
 &HT;    The prodigiously popular work of the linguist Deborah Tannen
(``You Just Don't Understand'') has helped persuade us that men and
women speak differently, hear differently, respond differently _
that the area of the brain governing communication comes in His and
Hers models.
 &HT;    ``Difference feminism'' helped make the concept of the emotive,
relationship-oriented woman seem like a biological fact;
``relationship marketing'' and ``women's culture'' are its
intellectual progeny.
 &HT;    In theory, ``women's culture'' sounds like a good idea: women
doing and buying what they want, no longer having to get dressed up
and go out and pretend to be enthralled by some guy's
pontifications. Surely that's the sentiment behind the current ads
for Women.com.
 &HT;    In the TV spot, a computer cursor types ``Women can't resist
powerful men,'' then deletes ``powerful'' and in its place types
``gingerbread.'' The apparently subversive subtext running beneath
this _ and beneath so much of the new women's culture _ suggests
that women, tired of being denied power in a man's world, have
decided to take their toys and play elsewhere.
 &HT;    On the surface, it's a feminist's dream: women earning more and
using the clout that only hard cash can command. Women designing
products and services to meet the needs of women. Why shouldn't we
be gladdened by this evidence of what some feminists have long
suspected: that our voices would be heard when we had enough money
to guarantee that someone would listen?
 &HT;    Why? Because the culture being sold to women not only reinforces
retro cliches and stereotypical notions of male and female behavior
but also is the cultural equivalent of the slightly out-of-date
baby formula that, through some regrettable corporate error, gets
shipped to Third World countries.
 &HT;    Because only the most starry-eyed difference feminist could
seriously have imagined that ``women's culture'' would be any more
noble, intelligent, high-minded or less blatantly meretricious than
the ``male culture'' peddled by Maxim magazine and Comedy Central's
``Man Show.''
 &HT;    And because so much of what is flashing across our television,
movie and computer screens suggests that what women are being
offered is not just separate but sequestered, not challenging or
provocative but intellect-numbing and reactionary _ an expensive,
seductive, glossy mass invitation to disappear into Cyberpurdah.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most insidious paradox of the new women's culture _
from the Oxygen network to ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' to ``Judging
Amy'' _ is that its purveyors can make lots of money from women and
simultaneously claim to be doing it all for women's own good, to
give women what they want and need and deserve. It is like having a
best friend with her hand in your pocket.
 &HT;    Why else _ except to help women like you and me _ would Oprah
Winfrey take precious time from her busy life to star in a new
12-part series, ``Oprah Goes Online''?
 &HT;    This program is among the initial offerings of the new Oxygen
network, which made its debut early in February. Masterminded by
Laybourne, the former president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks (in
cooperation with powerful partners including Winfrey's Harpo
Entertainment Group, America Online and the television producers
Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach), Oxygen Media
combines a cable TV and Internet network into an entertainment and
marketing conglomerate intended predominantly for women.
 &HT;    Billing itself as ``the first and only network to combine
advocacy, technology and creativity for a single purpose: releasing
the energy of women to do great things,'' the Oxygen cable channel
includes such features as the unfortunately titled sports program
``We Sweat''; a comedy series, ``Ripe Tomatoes,'' ``for anyone who
agrees that women's lives sometimes border on the absurd and can be
a laughing matter''; an animated cartoon called ``X-Chromosome''; a
talk show with Candice Bergen as its host.
 &HT;    And, for those dateless Friday nights, ``Pajama Party'': ``New
millennium 'It Girl' Katie Puckrick hosts a weekly pajama party
with her best friend, Lisa Kushell. Sharp, funny and frank, this
talk-variety show subverts the classic sleepover ingredients _
taboo topics, mind-bending trends and far-out music _ into grown-up
friskiness with the help of an audience of 20- and 30-something
women and visiting celebrities, all hanging out in their PJs in
Katie's living room.''
 &HT;    It becomes clear that the trouble with the commercial idea of
women's culture is that ``women's'' is often a euphemism for Bad,
or at least Low-to-Middlebrow. Though it concerns relationships,
``Anna Karenina'' is not a women's novel. Anna Quindlen's novels
are. To attach the word ``women's'' to a cultural product is to
devalue it. In the view of the larger culture, ``women's'' is only
a step above ``young adult.''
 &HT;    Of course there are gender differences, although probably not as
many as there would be if this were a society in which men and
women could casually decide which gender wants to be president this
term, and which one wants to take care of the kids and
Great-Grandma. Humans are adaptive creatures, and the people who
are responsible for the family tend to get interested in family
relationships.
 &HT;    Though no one will admit it, the prevailing wisdom is that women
are stupid and narcissistic and desire childish, mindless
entertainment. To claim that the popularity of the new Web sites,
TV shows and films proves that they're what women truly want is
rather like saying that supermarket shoppers want those hard, pink,
tasteless tomatoes. It's less a question of preference than of
choice (or lack of choice) and availability.
 &HT;    At the same time, the fact that droves of women are hungrily
consuming this substandard culture raises the heartbreaking
possibility that contemporary women's lives are so painful that
what they desire is a good cry and some brainless, narcotizing
amusement.
 &HT;    Hollywood appears to believe that women go to the movies to be
taken on a chain-yanking, tear-jerking, regressive journey down
memory lane, all the way back to Mom. Mother-daughter tensions
(``Anywhere but Here,'' ``Tumbleweeds'') are ever-popular subjects
for the ``chick flick.'' The only thing more commercial, or so
producers hope, is a dying mother (``Stepmom,'' ``One True
Thing'').
 &HT;    It could be claimed that such films are more humanizing than the
mayhem purveyed by ``boys' films.'' And yet many of us, regardless
of gender, would much rather see space aliens vaporize the White
House than watch Meg Ryan's nose twitch as she emotes her way
through ``Hanging Up,'' a new film directed by Diane Keaton and
written by Nora and Delia Ephron.
 &HT;    In its relentless efforts to tug at female heartstrings and soar
off the top of the ``hankie'' index, this giddily manipulative
movie redefines ``one dimensional'' as it invites overworked and
underappreciated women to identify with Ryan's character, Eve
Marks, the most relationship-oriented of three sisters (Diane
Keaton plays a career-obsessed magazine editor, Lisa Kudrow a ditsy
actress) and therefore the one who must shoulder the burden of
caring for, and about, their irascible, lovable, drunken, dying
daddy (Walter Matthau).
 &HT;    In fact, the film may bring tears to one's eyes _ not of grief
and sympathy, but of sheer exasperation and irritation at the level
of condescension and contempt behind its (female) creators' belief
that women are lame enough to fall for this, that this is what
women want.
 &HT;    In the various presentations of commercial women's culture,
there's plenty of advice on how to change ourselves _ woman by
woman, pound by pound, wrinkle by wrinkle _ but not a shred of
guidance on how to change our situation. Nor is there any
suggestion that we might want, or need, to rethink basic issues of
power, equity and economics, or that our interest and passions
should expand to acknowledge the world beyond the narrow confines
of the kitchen, the nursery, the beauty salon and the office.
 &HT;    Quite the contrary, really. Too many of the new features
convince us that anatomy is indeed destiny; they promulgate a
trendy brand of fantasy: professional women who really do have it
all _ rewarding careers, supportive families and really fabulous
hair!
 &HT;    Laybourne's credo for Oxygen _ that women ``are pushed and
pressured in such amazing ways that they deserve to have a place
where they can take a deep breath'' _ falls far short of suggesting
that we examine the source of that pressure, or that we begin to
push back, or that we face the problems that no amount of shopping
can solve.
 &HT;    And finally, there's the ultimate deception: the
marketing-research-driven con, the appalling bait-and-switch
practiced on the woman who is being promised relationship, being
sold on community, and who is in fact buying into a progressively
deeper isolation and seclusion.
 &HT;    For what is this new culture offering us, exactly, except the
chance to work (at least) two jobs, eight hours in the workplace,
another eight in the home, followed by the marvelous reward, the
invitation to watch ``reality'' on television or to read a barely
literate on-line magazine, alone in Cyberpurdah, satisfied and at
peace, with nothing to disturb our blessed, hard-won tranquillity
except the brief, spiky thrill of a purchase and the gentle click
of the mouse?

 A WASTELAND of PSEUDO-WOMEN'S CULTURE

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The TV ads for iVillage.com, one of the rising stars in the
ever-expanding galaxy of women's Web sites, suggests that, for the
modern woman, logging on to the Internet provides all the comfort
Mom found in the long hot bath combined with the fun and fellowship
of an evening out with the girls.
 &HT;    The animation of the actresses playing ordinary women intensely
engaged with their computers implies that the after-hours
``cybervisit'' is the perfect antidote to an exhausting day of work
or child care, or both. It promises relaxation and distraction,
solitude and community, the I and the Village, all during a few
precious moments stolen _ just for us! _ from our families and
jobs.
 &HT;    How dispiriting, then, to discover that what we've stolen is the
chance to read an on-line women's magazine, far below whatever
standard still prevails in the most dumbed-down print magazines,
and with far less attractive graphics than Martha Stewart Living.
The articles are short, vapid, carelessly written. The tone is
Valley Girl friendly, relentlessly chipper and upbeat. Did you know
that chocolate may be good for your heart?
 &HT;    ``Take some time to make yourself look good!'' suggests an
advice column on Making the Transition From Housewife to Employee.
``Not interested in football?'' asks a winter-weekend feature.
``Cook up a 'Souper' Bowl and other tasty snacks for your favorite
football fans!''
 &HT;    The challenge is to absorb all this useful information while
ignoring the flashing full-color advertisements tempting us to go
shopping, the real cure for women's problems. Buy yourself a sexy
new dress and shoes to match!
 &HT;    IVillage is only a symptom of the virulent cultural separatism
currently generating a profusion of products and services created

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Ahmed Chalabi, a Shiite Muslim from a prominent Baghdad family,
is by turns haughty and brooding, princely and strangely
preoccupied.
 &HT;    In the cold weather, he goes about London in a goatskin robe,
which he likes to flick grandly behind him, and Gore-Tex hiking
boots. But while he may look like some tribal elder who wandered
down from the hills (in trendy shoes), he holds a Ph.D. in
mathematics from the University of Chicago and is fluent in several
languages.
 &HT;    He is also the closest thing either the Clinton administration
or its Republican opponents have to a strategy for replacing the
failed policy of containing Saddam Hussein.
 &HT;    Chalabi, 55, is the head of the Iraqi National Congress (INC),
the once and, for now, future guiding body of the Iraqi opposition
to Saddam Hussein.
 &HT;    Pushed aside as leader early last year, Chalabi managed to
reclaim his position at a general assembly of the INC in New York
this fall.
 &HT;    And that, it bears mentioning, was no easy task. The 300-plus
delegates who met at a Manhattan hotel had arrived from Britain,
Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey
and Canada. And they shared little but a history of backstabbing
and mistrust.
 &HT;    In truth, they gathered only to prove to their American patrons
that they were still collectively committed to overthrowing the
only person they loathe more than one another _ the devil in
Baghdad.
 &HT;    In flowing robes and cheap shiny suits, the delegates
distributed ``Free Iraq'' T-shirts and squabbled. They argued
throughout the weekend _ over the buffet dinner, over mint tea and
over the fax machine spewing out messages from across the world.
 &HT;    Yet somehow, by dawn on Monday morning, they managed to conclude
the general assembly by electing a new seven-man leadership, and
with a minimal amount of blood on the floor.
 &HT;    But not before Chalabi had walked out several times in disgust.
 &HT;    ``It was not a pretty sight,'' one delegate said. ``They threw
shoes at each other. I couldn't believe it. They took off their
shoes and threw them at each other.''
 &HT;    Yes, they threw shoes because they are desperate. With
Washington acting as midwife, the organization is now under serious
pressure to get results.
 &HT;    Saddam is now exercising virtual veto power on U.N. weapons
inspectors and, with an impending U.S. presidential election, the
Democrats are anxious to have something, anything, they can
plausibly hold up as a pro-active Iraq policy.
 &HT;    At the same time, the Republicans, eager to pre-empt the
Democrats, are claiming it was their idea to back the INC and that
they had to push the Clinton administration into getting behind it.
 &HT;    With both U.S. political parties competing to patronize the INC,
it would seem to be well positioned to make good on the promise of
fomenting an Iraqi revolution. But it doesn't seem any closer now
to that goal than it did eight years ago, when it was formed in the
wake of the Persian Gulf war.
 &HT;    Although Congress appropriated $97 million to bankroll the seven
main Iraqi opposition groups, the money has remained in Washington
as the groups have jockeyed for power. That struggle seems to be in
abeyance.
 &HT;    The INC still has one major problem, however. It hasn't figured
out a way to outsmart the Iraqi dictator. ``Saddam kills anyone he
doesn't trust,'' says one observer. ``He squashes opposition like a
bug.''
 &HT;    In its short and painful life the Iraqi National Congress has
done little to inspire confidence that it could ever serve as the
linchpin for American policy. Only now can it be said to be coming
of age, and at that, very slowly. The formal seven-man presidency
includes representatives of all the major factions. Chalabi was
given no official title, but he is acknowledged to be acting in a
presiding role.
 &HT;    It is a perplexing group. Each faction appears to have its own
agenda. The Kurds, for instance, have the issue of nationalism; the
monarchists want to see a royal return; the Islamic groups are
paralyzed by infighting. Yet all now protest their undying
solidarity.
 &HT;    ``All Iraqi opposition groups are united on the need to get rid
of Saddam,'' Chalabi insists. ``We all want the same thing. A
democratic Iraq.''
 &HT;    Adds Sharif Ali Bin al-Hussein, the 43-year-old leader of the
Constitutional Monarchy Party: ``We have a common goal and a common
strategy. It's not about power, it's about unity of Iraqi
opposition.''
 &HT;    This was echoed (cautiously) by the Kurdish leader Jalal
Talabani and the others.
 &HT;    ``What is important now,'' one delegate said heatedly, ``is
getting rid of Saddam. Together.''
 &HT;    Chalabi is insistent that this time the opposition will get it
right. ``Look, we don't want to get a bunch of guns and go blazing
into the sunshine,'' Chalabi said. ``We are going to work with
careful steps to prepare with the U.S. so that our forces are
ready.''
 &HT;    For veteran INC-watchers, ``blazing into the sunshine'' is a
not-so-veiled reference to the group's Waterloo _ the 1996 debacle
in Erbil, a town in northern Iraq that served as its base of
operations before it was leveled by Saddam's tanks.
 &HT;    For the INC, Erbil is a gaping, deep wound that just won't heal.
 &HT;    ``You ask why we don't have an army, why we aren't preparing
actively?'' asks Aras Habib, the organization's operations chief.
``We had an army. We had a good army. We had weapons. We were
fighters. It was destroyed in Erbil.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Iraqi National Congress was born in 1992, in the wake of the
Persian Gulf war, with Chalabi as its democratically elected
president. Its operatives lobbied diplomats, opened a human-rights
office and developed military, political and intelligence
operations, largely operating out of Erbil.
 &HT;    What they did not do is establish a financial infrastructure or
a real plan to overthrow Saddam. Vagueness has always been the
Iraqi opposition's downfall. The closest thing to a plan was
Chalabi's ``enclave'' or ``three city'' strategy.
 &HT;    ``I always refused to subscribe to the American policy of
containment,'' he says. ``My strategy was to construct an enclave
and to unite all the opposition groups, including the Kurds, to
form an alliance.''
 &HT;    Chalabi's plan was to capture Kirkuk and Mosul, the leading
cities in the north of Iraq, and Basra, the main southern city, and
slowly squeeze the life out of Saddam's regime.
 &HT;    ``He believed that the Iraqis themselves have the willingness to
rise up against Saddam,'' says Zaab Sethna, an INC adviser who sees
Chalabi more as a visionary than as a naif. ``But this could only
be done if the INC built up its strength in the north and the south
by luring defectors and acquiring arms.''
 &HT;    Whether ultimately feasible or not, the plan had two major and,
as it turned out, fatal flaws. First, it demanded the cooperation
of the two main Kurdish factions _ the Kurdish Democratic Party
(KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) _ which had a long
history of bloody feuds.
 &HT;    ``To think one could unite the Kurds under one anti-Saddam
banner when they had historically been incapable of uniting
themselves was overly optimistic,'' says Patrick Bishop, a
Paris-based Middle East specialist. ``Over the years, the main
Kurdish groups have shown themselves capable of getting in bed with
the devil if they felt it suited their interest.''
 &HT;    Second, the plan assumed the full cooperation of the CIA, which
had been trying for years to oust Saddam. But the agency didn't buy
into Chalabi's strategy, insisting that the dictator would succumb
only to a coup.
 &HT;    However, Chalabi, believing the regime would topple under
sustained pressure and counting on American support, went ahead
with plans to attack Kirkuk and Mosul. By the summer of 1996, he
says, he had a CIA-trained army of more than 1,000 and a highly
effective intelligence operation.
 &HT;    But on the night of Aug. 31, 1996, Chalabi's plans were blasted
into the thin desert air.
 &HT;    ``I was sitting in a meeting at the American Embassy in London
between the PUK and the KDP,'' he says, ``when Saddam's tanks crept
up on the outskirts of Erbil.'' A bitter tone creeps into his
voice. ``We waited for air support, but it never arrived.''
 &HT;    ``Apparently, it was gruesome,'' Sethna recalls. ``Fighters were
calling from the satellite phones. They could see the tanks in the
distance, and they kept calling and calling for help but no one
came.''
 &HT;    Saddam had been invited in by Massoud Barzani, the Kurdish
Democratic Party leader, who saw a way to eliminate both the Iraqi
National Congress and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in one
treacherous move.
 &HT;    The CIA, fearing another debacle like the Bay of Pigs, refused
to help. Hundreds of INC men were executed, and thousands more fled
to Turkey.
 &HT;    Chalabi's critics had long scoffed at the idea that the INC
could ever seriously challenge Saddam's Republican Guard, 80,000
strong, and his superior weaponry. They also dismissed his claims
about his intelligence network and disparaged him as a leader.
 &HT;    But the debate was moot by the morning of Sept. 1, when, for all
practical purposes, the Iraqi National Congress ceased to exist.
 &HT;    By now, having temporarily shelved the three-city plan, the INC,
newly invigorated, has a more modest goal: simply to get off the
ground by setting up bank accounts, re-establishing contacts in
Iraq.
 &HT;    Mostly, says Daniel Byman, a Middle East expert at the Rand
Corp., they are waiting, waiting ``for a lucky break so they can
fill in the gap. I honestly don't think they know what that is.
Maybe Saddam will take a lucky bullet. Maybe there will be a change
in government and they will step in. That seems to be their plan.''
 &HT;    For his part, Saddam is widely believed to have taken advantage
of a year free of U.N. weapons inspectors to resume development of
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
 &HT;    While he is not directly threatened by outside forces, other
than the occasional bombing raid by allied warplanes, he is said to
be paranoid about internal threats. In November, according to
intelligence reports, he called in his military commanders for
consultations in small groups _ an indication of growing suspicion.
 &HT;    Whether he was concerned about the INC or some other, undetected
threat is debatable.
 &HT;    ``There are signs,'' says one academic analyst. ``Saddam was
very nervous about the New York meeting.'' But there are also signs
that he hardly noticed it.
 &HT;    ``If he was worried, the Iraqi press wouldn't be writing about
it in their newspapers,'' another analyst says. ``They are
certainly not writing about what is happening in the south. Now
that would be damaging to Saddam.''
 &HT;    One thing has emerged from New York: The INC has been granted a
last opportunity to grow up and become a serious player.
 &HT;    ``The October summit was like crossing the Rubicon,'' admits one
State Department official, who said he had more faith in the
opposition than ever before.
 &HT;    There is also the growing congressional support, particularly
among Republicans looking to highlight the failed Clinton policy.
But how seriously does Washington really take Chalabi and his
organization?
 &HT;    ``The INC has a lot of support because Congress is full of a lot
of posturing idiots who couldn't find Iraq on the map and don't
know anything about foreign policy,'' says one critic. ``They just
know something has to change.''
 &HT;    But Byman points out that the INC has taken two major steps in
the last year.
 &HT;    ``One is their change in leadership, which remedies some of
their problems,'' he says. ``The other is that they've moved away
from past grandiose schemes like marching on Baghdad to addressing
basic organizational steps that they avoided for too long.''
 &HT;    However, Byman still has his doubts about the fundamental
differences within the coalition. ``They all agree that Saddam
should go,'' he frets, ``but what else they agree on, I'm not
sure.''
 &HT;    The Clinton administration is equally unsure about Chalabi, both
for his personality quirks and for his history. For a time last
year, it even seemed as if the White House would rather see Saddam
in Baghdad than Chalabi.
 &HT;    ``They were down on Ahmed because of Jordan,'' says one
Washington observer. (In 1989, Chalabi was indicted for embezzling
millions from a Jordanian bank he founded in the 1970s. He was
eventually convicted in absentia.)
 &HT;    Another blow came in 1998 when Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of
the American forces in the Persian Gulf, bluntly told Congress that
the opposition groups ``have little, if any, viability.''
 &HT;    But the skepticism has quieted down, whether for cynical
reasons, a growing sense of respect for the INC or plain
desperation.
 &HT;    ``The Saddam regime has got to go,'' says one senior State
Department official. ``We crossed that bridge last year. But what
is different now is the opposition. Their recriminations have
subsided. They're watching each other, watching Washington. They're
more sober.''
 &HT;    Exactly how Chalabi and his men are going to pull off a stunt
like getting rid of Saddam Hussein, when the international forces
during the gulf war could not, remains to be seen. For now, the
Iraqi National Congress appears to be starting with basic
organizational issues that should have been addressed a decade ago.
 &HT;    ``They're asking how broad a coalition they can get, and how
they can share resources and leadership,'' Byman says. ``It has
been a good year because they are sitting down and talking, but
that's the first step in 100 and they still have 99 to go.''

PATTERNED TILE WAS INSTALLED THE `WRONG' WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When I had 12- by 12-inch ceramic tile installed, I think the
tiler goofed. The tiles have a distinct marbleized pattern running
across them, and they should have been placed alternately, with the
pattern of one tile running at right angles to that of the next.
The tiler did not do that, so the pattern runs from side to side,
parallel with the pattern on the next row of tiles. It looks weird.
Can anything be done?
</P>
<P>
   STEVES HOBBS, Westford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure, something can be done. Take up all the tiles and lay
new ones, since most of the old ones will break when they are pried
off. If the tiler does that for nothing, OK _ but it's unlikely
that he will. You could ask for a refund, but his response may be
that there is nothing wrong with the way the tiles were laid. I
don't think there's a hard-and-fast rule as to how they must be
laid. Therefore, your best bet is to live with the weird-looking
tiles. You might get used to them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have to store a refrigerator for six months. Is there any
particular way to store it? Should I cover it? Will it be OK in a
basement?
</P>
<P>
   A.L., Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have to store it in a basement, keep the door open and
throw a plastic tarp over it, but do not tie it at the bottom; let
air circulate around in it. Better yet, remove the door if it is of
the type that cannot be opened from the inside. If you store it in
any place other than a basement or unheated garage, simply keep the
door open, or remove it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a brown stain on my gray granite countertop. I can't
feel anything on the surface, but it certainly shows, and I can't
get it off. I have tried everything available. I think the stain is
from oil. Any brilliant ideas?
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTATED STAIN-SCRUBBER
</P>
<P>
   A. To treat an oily stain, your best bet is to absorb it. And to
do that, sprinkle baking soda on it, liberally, and let it sit
there for an hour or more, then sweep it up and throw it away.
Repeat as necessary. If that doesn't work, you can try washing the
stain with a strong solution of baking soda and water. Do not use
Soft Scrub on granite; it may turn it white, according to the
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Other granite cleaners that might work are TileLab's StoneWash,
Stain Remover, and Stone &AMP; Tile Stripper, sold at Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a large walk-in closet off my master bedroom. It's
great for storage, but has developed a lot of moisture on the walls
and the window (a vinyl replacement window), and there is mold
growing on both walls and window. The room is unheated and has
three outside walls. How can I fix the closet so I can store
clothes in it without fear of moisture or mold?
</P>
<P>
   PETER VISELLI, Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. For starters, open the closet door to let heated house air
circulate inside, and open the window to let the water vapor
escape. The replacement window might have made the room much
tighter than it was, so that water vapor builds up in the closet
and condenses on cool surfaces. You don't have to keep the window
open all the time; opening it a bit for a few minutes twice a day
should be enough to reduce the water vapor. Add heat: A few
100-watt bulbs will help some, as long as they are kept away from
clothing. Or, use an electric heater, again being careful to keep
it away from clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the quick fixes. A permanent fix is to insulate the
three exterior walls. This will help some, even though the closet
is unheated, because the walls will be warmer and water vapor will
be less likely to condense on them. Put a louvered door on the
closet for automatic air circulation.
</P>
<P>
   To get rid of the mold, wash it with a solution of 1 part
household bleach and 3 parts water. Keep this solution away from
the clothes, and wear skin and eye protection. An alternative to
the bleach solution is a detergent called Era; it contains oxygen
bleach, which is milder and safer than household bleach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many of the nailheads in my plasterboard wall are showing,
and some are popping a bit. How can I correct this unsightly
problem.
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Westborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sometimes, nails will pop after the wooden studs dry out and
the nails lose their grip. Sometimes, the nails were not indented
deeply enough before joint compound covered them. For free-standing
nails that are not in joints, drive them deeper into the
plasterboard and give them a final whack with a hammer, making a
dimple that you can fill with joint compound. Apply the compound
once, smooth off, and let dry. Appy a second coat and let dry;
apply a third coat and let dry, then sand smooth. If some of the
popped nails do not seem to be holding, pull them out and subsitute
a drywall screw.
</P>
<P>
   If the nailheads are showing in a taped joint, the tape and
joint compund in the joint must be removed, nails countersunk, and
new compound and tape applied. The rule for compounding three times
still applies.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    ELIAN SAGA TESTING CUBAN FAMILY'S TIES
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Feb. 27 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The angry crowd rushed at Manuel Gonzalez as he stepped
out of Miami's federal courthouse, shaking fists at him and
shouting in Spanish, ``communista'' and ``traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the great-uncle of 6-year-old shipwreck survivor rafter
Elian Gonzalez only ducked his head and walked faster.
</P>
<P>
   In a drama that has divided his once close-knit family and may
finally be resolved in a court hearing the week of March 6, Manuel
Gonzalez, 59, a soft-spoken bus mechanic, has remained largely out
of the glare of television lights.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week.
</P>
<P>
   He was thrust into the middle of the swirling Gonzalez family
saga when Elian's father, Juan Miguel, sent a letter to U.S.
Attorney Janet Reno asking that his son be moved to Manuel
Gonzalez's home.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among his two brothers and two sisters who have fled Cuba
for Miami, Manuel Gonzalez believes Elian should go back to Cuba to
live with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno denied the request, but Manuel Gonzalez didn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where expressing even the slightest approval for Cuban
President Fidel Castro can prompt threats of physical harm, Manuel
Gonzalez filed a motion in federal court asking for custody of
Elian so that he could help reunite the boy with his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It was a move that many see as courageous and principled, but
others fear may be foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lost a son,'' Gonzalez told reporters later, referring
to his own son's death due to cancer. ``I am supporting Juan Miguel
because I know what it is to lose a son. Elian should be with his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   His sincerity didn't stop the talk on Little Havana's streets or
on Miami's ubiquitous Spanish-language radio stations, which buzzed
with callers lambasting Gonzalez for playing into the hands of a
tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   A day after he was hounded on the steps of the federal
courthouse, Manuel Gonzalez wouldn't come to the door of his modest
home in Miami's Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must go to work,'' said his daughter, Rosa, who said
Gonzalez would prefer not to talk about the issue. ``There has been
a lot of pressure, and he feels this is a family affair.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of high-profile public sparring _ with charges of
abuse, spying and treachery flying back and forth across the
Florida Straits _ it would seem the chances are slim that the
Gonzalez family could ever heal the wounds created by the Elian
saga.
</P>
<P>
   But the family has overcome steep obstacles before. Long before
Elian thrust them into the unrelenting glare of the international
spotlight, the Gonzalez clan was a typical example of the conflicts
and painful separations wrought by the Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine brothers and sisters of Manuel's generation, five
have come to Miami, while three remain in Cuba and one has passed
away.
</P>
<P>
   According to press reports, Caridad Gonzalez, the oldest sister,
was the first to come to the United States, arriving in 1966. Her
brother Delfin, who was imprisoned as an anti-Castro activist in
the 1960s, followed in 1979. Then came another sister, Georgina, in
1983, followed by Manuel and Lazaro in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who stayed in Cuba, Juan Miguel's father, Juan
Gonzalez, seems the most closely allied with the Cuban government.
He worked as a police officer in a Cuban ministry, a position that
probably helped his son _ Elian's father _ get a job in the
Communist island's increasingly lucrative tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   The family's experience is like that of thousands of others now
split between Miami and Cuba, said Damien Fernandez, a
Cuban-American political scientist at Florida International
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubans value their families above almost anything, but the
post-1959 politics have managed to split thousands of families
apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Cuban Americans in Miami were largely cut off from
the families they left behind. Labeled ``worms'' and ``traitors''
by Castro, many weren't able to speak to _ much less visit _ their
relatives for years.
</P>
<P>
   The situation began to relax in the early 1990s, with the crisis
triggered by the end of the former Soviet Union's subsidies. In
desperate need of hard currency, Castro relaxed travel restrictions
and allowed Cubans to have U.S. dollars, triggering a trickle of
cash from Miami that soon became a flood.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the 700,000 Cubans living in South Florida _
and elsewhere in the United States _ send $1 billion a year in
remittances back to their families on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami families have become a lifeline, and since 1990
there has been a great trend toward reconciliation,'' said Florida
International's Fernandez. ``Although many families are still
divided by politics, they have learned to forgive and forget and
find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Elian, the Gonzalez family apparently was no different.
The branches of the family regularly talked by telephone and the
Miami relatives went back to Cuba for several family reunions.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's case has broken down the family's fragile truce,
with their political differences exacerbated by the inflammatory
rhetoric flying between Castro's government and exile extremists in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   After making his opinions known, Manuel Gonzalez reportedly was
ostracized by his Miami kin, especially Lazaro, who has been
keeping Elian and who has gone to court to try to keep the boy
here.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been at least one attempt at a resolution. The day
before last Tuesday's federal court hearing, Manuel went to
Lazaro's home to try to work out their differences. Neither side
would say what happened, but when Manuel returned to his house, he
was so upset he felt heart palpitations and was taken to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon released and appeared to be reasonably healthy when
he appeared in court the next morning. But while Cuban exiles
outside the courthouse cheered Lazaro and his family, their angry
taunts seemed to shock Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, however, insists he will continue to stand up for
what he thinks is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong man,'' said Jeffrey Leving. ``He won't let
anyone intimidate him from doing what is in Elian's best
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Lazaro Gonzalez has issued a statement asking
Miami's exiles to respect his brother's opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Gonzalez has told reporters that he believes his family
will recover _ at least partially _ from the divisions Elian's case
has brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wounds of the problem will heal,'' he told the Los Angeles
Times newspaper. ``But the scars will always be there.''

   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ It was Homer, of course, who told the story
of the fall of Troy. But in the pantheon of Red Sox legends, two
epic homers on one October night will forever be remembered as the
rise of Troy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys still going to get on me about not hitting in the
playoffs?'' Troy O'Leary said Wednesday morning, knowing that he
had already authored the answer to his question last autumn in
Cleveland when he hit a grand slam and three-run home run in the
fifth and deciding game of the American League Division Series at
Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember the defining moments of your own career,'' said
fellow outfielder Trot Nixon, ``but if you're there, you never
forget the defining moments of someone else's career, either. That
was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice O'Leary came to the the plate following an intentional
walk to Nomar Garciaparra. Each time, he hit the first pitch into
the seats. His grand slam off Indians starter Charles Nagy in the
third inning, and the three-run home run he hit off reliever Paul
Shuey to break a 8-8 tie in the seventh, take their place with
Carlton Fisk's World Series pole-bopper and Dave Henderson's
Anaheim shocker as the Sox' most dramatic postseason home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Only the six innings of no-hit relief by a hurting Pedro
Martinez in Boston's 12-8 win could compete with the drama of
O'Leary's night. ``We sent a description of that game to Ripley,''
manager Jimy Williams would say afterward, ``and he rejected it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, however, kept it. `I've got the damn tape,'' O'Leary
said Wednesday on the first day of workouts for the full Sox squad.
``(Jim) Thome going deep twice for them, and (Travis) Fryman
hitting one, and (Robbie) Alomar making plays for them, and Pedro
coming out of the bullpen. You can't ask for a better game.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's home run totals have increased the last three seasons,
from 15 to 23 to 28. The same is true of his extra-base hits (51 to
67 to 68) and RBIs (80 to 83 to 103).
</P>
<P>
   He led the Sox last season in home runs, hit .346 against
lefthanded pitchers, and led American League left fielders in
slugging percentage (.495). By all measures, including a noticeable
uptick in his defensive skills, it was the best season of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Leary entered the ALDS carrying the stigma of his 1-for-16
performance against Cleveland in 1998. And even as the Sox were
putting up record numbers against the Indians, including a 23-7
beating in Boston in Game 4, O'Leary's bat had been quiet. He did
not have an extra-base hit or RBI entering the deciding game.
</P>
<P>
   And you ask why Indians manager Mike Hargrove twice elected to
pass Garciaparra intentionally? ``We had been handling O'Leary,''
Hargrove said afterward, ``up until tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nagy walked Garciaparra to load the bases in the third
inning, O'Leary said he went to the plate with this thought: ``I
told myself, `This is what it's all about. Let's see what you're
made of.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The second time, O'Leary said, he dispensed with the philosophy.
``When they walked him again,'' he said, ``it was a tie ballgame. I
didn't care what I did. I just wanted to get the ball up in the
air. I got lucky, man. I was pretty happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said the game was about more than defining one player.
``I think the way we came back from being down two games in a
five-game series told not just about myself but the team,'' he
said. ``People doubted us all year, but Dan (Duquette) did a great
job of bringing people in here. We already knew about Pedro and
Nomar, but Dan brought in other people who knew their jobs and
played well together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is like a second family, the kind of family you want
to be in. Nobody bitches about anything. Hopefully, we'll still
have _ What's that word? _ the same camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, who spent the offseason working out in Arizona, said
that even after last season's success, both he and the Sox will
face their share of skeptics. ``People are still going to doubt
us,'' he said, ``because we don't have many big-name players. Pedro
and Nomar are our only big names, and we build around them. But we
know in our heads and minds that we can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt better about myself in the offseason, but now I'm
thinking about what I'm going to do this year. The home runs? Sure,
they were the best thing I've ever done, no doubt. But who knows
what's going to happen this year?''

<P>
   MIAMI _ The angry crowd rushed at Manuel Gonzalez as he stepped
out of Miami's federal courthouse, shaking fists at him and
shouting in Spanish, ``communista'' and ``traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the great-uncle of 6-year-old shipwreck survivor rafter
Elian Gonzalez only ducked his head and walked faster.
</P>
<P>
   In a drama that has divided his once close-knit family and may
finally be resolved in a court hearing the week of March 6, Manuel
Gonzalez, 59, a soft-spoken bus mechanic, has remained largely out
of the glare of television lights.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week.
</P>
<P>
   He was thrust into the middle of the swirling Gonzalez family
saga when Elian's father, Juan Miguel, sent a letter to U.S.
Attorney Janet Reno asking that his son be moved to Manuel
Gonzalez's home.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among his two brothers and two sisters who have fled Cuba
for Miami, Manuel Gonzalez believes Elian should go back to Cuba to
live with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno denied the request, but Manuel Gonzalez didn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where expressing even the slightest approval for Cuban
President Fidel Castro can prompt threats of physical harm, Manuel
Gonzalez filed a motion in federal court asking for custody of
Elian so that he could help reunite the boy with his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It was a move that many see as courageous and principled, but
others fear may be foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lost a son,'' Gonzalez told reporters later, referring
to his own son's death due to cancer. ``I am supporting Juan Miguel
because I know what it is to lose a son. Elian should be with his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   His sincerity didn't stop the talk on Little Havana's streets or
on Miami's ubiquitous Spanish-language radio stations, which buzzed
with callers lambasting Gonzalez for playing into the hands of a
tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   A day after he was hounded on the steps of the federal
courthouse, Manuel Gonzalez wouldn't come to the door of his modest
home in Miami's Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must go to work,'' said his daughter, Rosa, who said
Gonzalez would prefer not to talk about the issue. ``There has been
a lot of pressure, and he feels this is a family affair.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of high-profile public sparring _ with charges of
abuse, spying and treachery flying back and forth across the
Florida Straits _ it would seem the chances are slim that the
Gonzalez family could ever heal the wounds created by the Elian
saga.
</P>
<P>
   But the family has overcome steep obstacles before. Long before
Elian thrust them into the unrelenting glare of the international
spotlight, the Gonzalez clan was a typical example of the conflicts
and painful separations wrought by the Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine brothers and sisters of Manuel's generation, five
have come to Miami, while three remain in Cuba and one has passed
away.
</P>
<P>
   According to press reports, Caridad Gonzalez, the oldest sister,
was the first to come to the United States, arriving in 1966. Her
brother Delfin, who was imprisoned as an anti-Castro activist in
the 1960s, followed in 1979. Then came another sister, Georgina, in
1983, followed by Manuel and Lazaro in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who stayed in Cuba, Juan Miguel's father, Juan
Gonzalez, seems the most closely allied with the Cuban government.
He worked as a police officer in a Cuban ministry, a position that
probably helped his son _ Elian's father _ get a job in the
Communist island's increasingly lucrative tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   The family's experience is like that of thousands of others now
split between Miami and Cuba, said Damien Fernandez, a
Cuban-American political scientist at Florida International
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubans value their families above almost anything, but the
post-1959 politics have managed to split thousands of families
apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Cuban Americans in Miami were largely cut off from
the families they left behind. Labeled ``worms'' and ``traitors''
by Castro, many weren't able to speak to _ much less visit _ their
relatives for years.
</P>
<P>
   The situation began to relax in the early 1990s, with the crisis
triggered by the end of the former Soviet Union's subsidies. In
desperate need of hard currency, Castro relaxed travel restrictions
and allowed Cubans to have U.S. dollars, triggering a trickle of
cash from Miami that soon became a flood.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the 700,000 Cubans living in South Florida _
and elsewhere in the United States _ send $1 billion a year in
remittances back to their families on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami families have become a lifeline, and since 1990
there has been a great trend toward reconciliation,'' said Florida
International's Fernandez. ``Although many families are still
divided by politics, they have learned to forgive and forget and
find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Elian, the Gonzalez family apparently was no different.
The branches of the family regularly talked by telephone and the
Miami relatives went back to Cuba for several family reunions.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's case has broken down the family's fragile truce,
with their political differences exacerbated by the inflammatory
rhetoric flying between Castro's government and exile extremists in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   After making his opinions known, Manuel Gonzalez reportedly was
ostracized by his Miami kin, especially Lazaro, who has been
keeping Elian and who has gone to court to try to keep the boy
here.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been at least one attempt at a resolution. The day
before last Tuesday's federal court hearing, Manuel went to
Lazaro's home to try to work out their differences. Neither side
would say what happened, but when Manuel returned to his house, he
was so upset he felt heart palpitations and was taken to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon released and appeared to be reasonably healthy when
he appeared in court the next morning. But while Cuban exiles
outside the courthouse cheered Lazaro and his family, their angry
taunts seemed to shock Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, however, insists he will continue to stand up for
what he thinks is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong man,'' said Jeffrey Leving. ``He won't let
anyone intimidate him from doing what is in Elian's best
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Lazaro Gonzalez has issued a statement asking
Miami's exiles to respect his brother's opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Gonzalez has told reporters that he believes his family
will recover _ at least partially _ from the divisions Elian's case
has brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wounds of the problem will heal,'' he told the Los Angeles
Times newspaper. ``But the scars will always be there.''

   PRIMARIES-TURNOUT (Washington) _ At a time when election experts
bemoan low turnout in recent elections, the candidacy of Sen. John
McCain has driven up the numbers of voters taking part in
primaries. Much like Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, McCain is
drawing voters who otherwise might not cast ballots. Will such
voters' interest last into the general election? Yes, some experts
say, if McCain manages to stay in the race. By DAN FREEDMAN.

co-chairman and a target of the religious right, which is out to
defeat McCain any way it can. Pat Robertson of the Christian
Coalition calls Rudman a bigot, an outrageously wild charge based
on nothing more than Robertson's fury that McCain is doing so well.

</P>
<P>
   ``ACTUAL INNOCENCE'' &QL; 
By Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our rush to convict violent criminals and offer justice to
their victims, it's easy to overlook the plight of the innocent
man. Today, DNA tests are used before trial. Of the first 18,000
test results at the FBI and other crime laboratories, at least
5,000 absolved suspects of guilt before their cases were tried. But
what about men who were convicted before DNA testing was common
practice? Lawyers Scheck and Neufeld are founders of the
``Innocence Project,'' which fights for DNA tests for men who are
in prison. The authors present case after case in which bad
lawyering, police misconduct or false testimony by witnesses
resulted in the conviction of innocent men on rape or murder
charges. Although the book is at times overly dramatic (Dwyer, who
writes for the ``New York Daily News,'' refers to ``Barry and
Peter'' as if they are superheroes, swooping in to save the day
with their test tubes), it is a sobering reminder of the forgotten
victims of violent crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``MIRTH OF A NATION'' &QL; 
Edited by Michael J. Rosen (HarperPerennial, $15) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from us to make jokes at Yanni's expense, but we're
willing to laugh if someone else steps up to the plate. In this
case, it's ``New Yorker'' writer Kurt Andersen, who presents
himself as the man who invented Yanni _ the hair, the name
(``Zazu'' and ``Yahweh'' were contenders), the waterbed smile.
Andersen is one of 54 humorists who contribute to this anthology of
funny writing. Among the others: Roy Blount Jr., on the game of
golf (the first time he saw himself hitting a golf ball on video,
he looked exactly like a man killing a snake); Christopher Buckley
on the art of name-dropping; Garry Trudeau, who admits, copiously,
that he has smoked marijuana; Ian Frazier, who visits upon his
children the laws of the home (``Bite not, lest you be cast into
quiet time . . . '') and Dave Barry on his visit to Paris, where
there was only one empty parking space and it was under heavy
police guard at the Louvre museum. This volume is the first in a
series. Rosen invites you to submit work for future installments. &QL;

<P>
   ``WILD MINDS: WHAT ANIMALS REALLY THINK'' &QL; 
By Marc D. Hauser (Holt, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone want to guess what that fine gentleman on the cover was
thinking when someone snapped his picture? Hauser, psychology
professor and head of an animal-research program at Harvard
University, delves into questions that have already spawned many
books and much speculation: Are animals capable of experiencing th
same emotions that we feel? Do animals simply follow rules, or do
they understand those rules and their purpose? Hauser calls
accounts of weeping elephants and altruistic dolphins ``wildly
speculative,'' as faulty as the scientific belief that animals are
``mindless and irrational, driven by instinct and overwhelmed by
their passions.'' He explores such ``animal'' behavior as making
tools, counting, calculating distance, communicating and
cooperating with others, showing compassion, and making and abiding
by rules. In the process, he discusses what sets humans apart from
other animals _ their mysterious awareness of self. We will never
understand animals, he says, until we stop trying to see ourselves
in them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``LOSING YOUR PARENTS, FINDING YOUR SELF'' &QL; 
By Victoria Secunda (Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secunda interviewed 94 men and women who during their adulthoods
experienced the deaths of one or both parents. In the process, she
discovered that ``parental death is a defining event for adult
offspring that, with regard to its impact on one's sense of self,
often eclipses the variables of marital status, career achievement,
being a parent oneself, or the cause and manner of parental
death.'' In other words, it matters, and in many different ways.
Some people feel a sense of euphoric relief when their parents die.
Others feel lost, with no one to talk to or impress. Some find that
their marriages or their relationships with their siblings are
enhanced after a parent dies. For others, those ties deteriorate.
Secunda's book is not perfect (it begins with a bit of baggage, an
overlong description of her terrible relationship with her mother),
but it is interesting in the shared experiences she discovered
among the subjects of her survey _ experiences not of grief, but of
the long-term consequences of an inevitable and life-altering
event. &QL;

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of news books:
</P>
<P>
   ``ACTUAL INNOCENCE'' &QL; 
By Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our rush to convict violent criminals and offer justice to
their victims, it's easy to overlook the plight of the innocent
man. Today, DNA tests are used before trial. Of the first 18,000
test results at the FBI and other crime laboratories, at least
5,000 absolved suspects of guilt before their cases were tried. But
what about men who were convicted before DNA testing was common
practice? Lawyers Scheck and Neufeld are founders of the
``Innocence Project,'' which fights for DNA tests for men who are
in prison. The authors present case after case in which bad
lawyering, police misconduct or false testimony by witnesses
resulted in the conviction of innocent men on rape or murder
charges. Although the book is at times overly dramatic (Dwyer, who
writes for the ``New York Daily News,'' refers to ``Barry and
Peter'' as if they are superheroes, swooping in to save the day
with their test tubes), it is a sobering reminder of the forgotten
victims of violent crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``MIRTH OF A NATION'' &QL; 
Edited by Michael J. Rosen (HarperPerennial, $15) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from us to make jokes at Yanni's expense, but we're
willing to laugh if someone else steps up to the plate. In this
case, it's ``New Yorker'' writer Kurt Andersen, who presents
himself as the man who invented Yanni _ the hair, the name
(``Zazu'' and ``Yahweh'' were contenders), the waterbed smile.
Andersen is one of 54 humorists who contribute to this anthology of
funny writing. Among the others: Roy Blount Jr., on the game of
golf (the first time he saw himself hitting a golf ball on video,
he looked exactly like a man killing a snake); Christopher Buckley
on the art of name-dropping; Garry Trudeau, who admits, copiously,
that he has smoked marijuana; Ian Frazier, who visits upon his
children the laws of the home (``Bite not, lest you be cast into
quiet time . . . '') and Dave Barry on his visit to Paris, where
there was only one empty parking space and it was under heavy
police guard at the Louvre museum. This volume is the first in a
series. Rosen invites you to submit work for future installments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``WILD MINDS: WHAT ANIMALS REALLY THINK'' &QL; 
By Marc D. Hauser (Holt, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone want to guess what that fine gentleman on the cover was
thinking when someone snapped his picture? Hauser, psychology
professor and head of an animal-research program at Harvard
University, delves into questions that have already spawned many
books and much speculation: Are animals capable of experiencing th
same emotions that we feel? Do animals simply follow rules, or do
they understand those rules and their purpose? Hauser calls
accounts of weeping elephants and altruistic dolphins ``wildly
speculative,'' as faulty as the scientific belief that animals are
``mindless and irrational, driven by instinct and overwhelmed by
their passions.'' He explores such ``animal'' behavior as making
tools, counting, calculating distance, communicating and
cooperating with others, showing compassion, and making and abiding
by rules. In the process, he discusses what sets humans apart from
other animals _ their mysterious awareness of self. We will never
understand animals, he says, until we stop trying to see ourselves
in them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``LOSING YOUR PARENTS, FINDING YOUR SELF'' &QL; 
By Victoria Secunda (Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secunda interviewed 94 men and women who during their adulthoods
experienced the deaths of one or both parents. In the process, she
discovered that ``parental death is a defining event for adult
offspring that, with regard to its impact on one's sense of self,
often eclipses the variables of marital status, career achievement,
being a parent oneself, or the cause and manner of parental
death.'' In other words, it matters, and in many different ways.
Some people feel a sense of euphoric relief when their parents die.
Others feel lost, with no one to talk to or impress. Some find that
their marriages or their relationships with their siblings are
enhanced after a parent dies. For others, those ties deteriorate.
Secunda's book is not perfect (it begins with a bit of baggage, an
overlong description of her terrible relationship with her mother),
but it is interesting in the shared experiences she discovered
among the subjects of her survey _ experiences not of grief, but of
the long-term consequences of an inevitable and life-altering
event. &QL;

NEO-NOIR WITH TWISTS: SCREENWRITER CRAFTS ELMORE LEONARD-LIKE CRIME
DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tongue-in-cheek crime drama ``Reindeer Games'' was
originally supposed to open in December, but any movie that opens
with a bloody, lifeless Santa Claus lying in the snow isn't gonna
do much for your holiday spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, Ben Affleck's voice comes onto the soundtrack,
ready to tell the tale of how Santa got into such a state. We
discover that Affleck is a car thief named Rudy whose story begins
during the last days of a prison stretch. Although the current
``Boiler Room'' proves that Affleck can be convincing when he shows
a devious side, at first glance he still looks miscast here. But
his boy-next-door passivity is put to good use in this twist-laden,
irony-heavy guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   During his incarceration, Rudy becomes best buds with cellmate
Nick (James Frain), who develops a pen-pal relationship with an
apple-cheeked woman named Ashley (Charlize Theron). Nick's plans to
meet Ashley after his release are quashed when he's stabbed in a
prison fight, so Rudy decides to take his place. Turns out to be a
good move _ initially, at least: Ashley is beautiful, ready and
willing, as Affleck and Theron demonstrate during a
clothes-ripping, furniture-jarring motel-room love scene, and
Affleck appears to be following his buddy Matt Damon into the
assumed-identity territory of ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Reindeer Games'' has less lofty ambitions than that
complex drama. It has its own complexity, though, which becomes
clearer when Rudy/Nick meets up with Ashley's no-good brother
Gabriel (Gary Sinise), who wants Nick's help in a casino robbery.
Too bad for Rudy that he's just pretending to be Nick, because
Gabriel isn't taking no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   You could call ``Reindeer Games'' the Elmore Leonard movie that
Leonard never got around to writing. Standing in for him is hot
young screenwriter Ehren Kruger (''Arlington Road,'' ``Scream 3''),
who puts all the Leonardesque elements in place: Criminal tries to
go straight, gets mixed up with wrong woman, finds himself working
with dumber criminal and colorful sidekicks in a complicated heist
plot.
</P>
<P>
   Kruger doesn't yet have Leonard's ear for dialogue, but he does
have a knack for twists. How much you enjoy ``Reindeer Games''
depends on how willing you are to fall for the twists, which become
increasingly silly.
</P>
<P>
   But neo-noir fans are also likely to get the biggest kick out of
the movie, thanks to Affleck's winking performance as a guy who
would rather be anywhere than with the people he's become messed up
with and thanks to Frankenheimer's renewed confidence with action
movies. The director, who turned 70 this month, probably will never
regain the form he showed in the '60s with movies like ``The
Manchurian Candidate'' and ``Seconds,'' but ``Games'' is evidence
that he can still make entertaining throwaways.

THE WRITE STUFF: DOUGLAS, MAGUIRE MAKE YOU BELIEVE PEN IS MIGHTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the first frames unspool of Curtis Hanson's delightful new
film ``Wonder Boys'' (his follow-up to the Oscar-winning ``L.A.
Confidential''), the picture envelops you like an engaging novel
savored slowly in front of a crackling fire on a snowy afternoon.
It's fitting praise, especially for a film that largely concerns
itself with the art of writing, but the simile rings true
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas, who has built a career on playing thoroughly
disreputable characters _ be they greedy investors, adulterous
husbands or bored millionaires _ taps into new territory here ... a
character you can like.
</P>
<P>
   Not that college writing professor Grady Tripp (Douglas) is
perfect. Far from it. He drinks too much, gets high too often,
neglects his wife, and to top it off, he's having an affair with
the school's chancellor (Frances McDormand), who just happens to be
married to Grady's immediate boss.
</P>
<P>
   But Grady is certainly one of Douglas' most human portrayals _
an unshaven, terminally disheveled, soft-spoken genius, the kind of
teacher we all dreamed of befriending in college, but whose
challenging courses threatened to cut too deeply into our social
lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder wannabe-writers Katie Holmes (''Dawson's Creek'')
and Tobey Maguire (''The Cider House Rules'') circle his warm glow
like a pair of overeager moths.
</P>
<P>
   But Maguire has a light of his own _ he's a morose loner whose
gloomy personality and penchant for lying betrays his talent as a
gifted writer. He and Douglas are the wonder boys of the title.
One, a promising writer lurking in the shadow of his own secrets;
the other, a great writer trapped in the shadow of his own
brilliant first novel. It will take the two of them, surviving a
wild weekend of misunderstandings and mistakes, to find their way
back into the light.
</P>
<P>
   Like any story well told, ``Wonder Boys'' fills its periphery
with wonderful characters _ Robert Downey Jr. as Grady's sexually
charged gay editor, Rip Torn as a self-important celebrity author,
Holmes as the seductive but wise student, McDormand as a the real
love of Grady's life and Maguire as the wide-eyed Wunderkind. But
Douglas alone emerges from the film with a performance that's
nothing short of a wonder. You won't want it to end.

`BABYLON'S' FIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a Long Island-set ``Magnolia'' directed by early Jim
Jarmusch with an assist from Edward Burns, and you have some idea
what to expect from ``Judy Berlin.'' Or maybe you don't; if those
names don't mean anything to you, it's a good indication that you
should pass on this ready-made cult movie.
</P>
<P>
   For every nine people who are bored or baffled by this movie,
one will be enthralled by its wistfulness and black-and-white
cinematography. ``The Sopranos''' Edie Falco, starry-eyed and
idealistic here, plays the title character _ but the movie isn't so
much about her as it is about the town of Babylon, which the movie
defines as a Long Island Railroad stop and a place where it's not
unusual for thirtysomethings to run into people they went to high
school with.
</P>
<P>
   Judy, who has dreams of escaping to ``the coast'' to pursue her
acting career, runs into former schoolmate David Gold (Aaron
Harnick), a cynical wannabe filmmaker who returned to Babylon after
his dreams were dashed. David's mother (Madeline Kahn, in her last
role) is a dreamer on the verge of a nervous breakdown; her husband
(Bob Dishy) is the local elementary-school principal, who's
contemplating an affair with one of his teachers (Barbara Barrie).
During the course of a talky hour-and-a-half or so, they all work
through their angst.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Magnolia,'' ``Judy Berlin'' features an unusual natural
phenomenon _ in this case, an unusually long solar eclipse, which
gives Babylon an eerie surreality. If ``Magnolia'' is always played
at a high pitch, though, ``Judy Berlin'' is played at almost no
pitch, and its laconic, meandering nature makes its 96 minutes feel
like ``Magnolia's'' three hours.

&HT;     LAWMAKER SEEKS AREA CODE FOR WIRELESS SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Faced with the rapid growth of communications, a
California lawmaker has introduced legislation that would preserve
existing area codes by assigning codes specifically for wireless
phones, pagers and data lines.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal does not comply with existing federal
regulations, the Federal Communications Commission is considering
amending rules to allow so-called overlays for wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Democrat from Marina Del Rey,
introduced the bill that would require the state Public Utilities
Commission to adopt a special code for the wireless services and
determine how to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the Internet, wireless telephones and the
popularity of additional home telephone lines has forced regulators
and telephone companies nationally to add area codes as telephone
numbers are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, this was done by carving up a geographic area and
assigning it a new code. More recently, regulators in some states
have allowed overlays _ essentially new area codes within existing
ones _ to avoid requiring residential and business customers to
change their existing area codes.
</P>
<P>
   In such overlay areas, a home or business may have a phone line
with one area code and a new phone, fax or Internet line with a
different three-digit code. Such overlays often are fraught with
opposition because callers must dial the area code as well as the
seven-digit phone number every time they place a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look around the state at what's happening, area code
after area code is changing,'' said Bowen, chairwoman of the Senate
Energy, Utilities, and Communications Committee. ``It doesn't make
any sense to wait until we're near a crisis and running out of
numbers, to then go and change numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the largest wireless provider in the San
Francisco area protested the legislation, saying that if approved
it would require customers to dial additional digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not customer-friendly,'' said Pam Johnstone, a
spokeswoman for Cellular One.
</P>
<P>
   A technology overlay also could complicate billing and possibly
drive up incremental costs for consumers, Johnstone said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the California PUC splits geographic areas to add new
codes, and has recently approved measures to conserve and
distribute numbers within each code.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have long been asking for a technology overlay,
consumer advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes up consistently at virtually every meeting I've
attended,'' said Natalie Billinglys, an analyst at the Office of
Ratepayer Advocates, the PUC's independent consumer arm. ``When
they're told we're running out of numbers because of the growth in
demand for cell phones and pagers, they ask `why don't you put the
people causing the problem into the new area code?''
</P>
<P>
   However, some questioned the sweeping nature of the bill, which
prohibits the PUC from approving a geographic overlay or split
unless it has already established and exhausted a technology
overlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is well-intentioned bill, but we have look carefully to
make sure it's used in situations to produce positive results,''
said Regina Costa, a telecommunications analyst at the Utility
Reform Network in San Francisco. ``There might be some cases where
it might not work.''

   BRADLEY _ With fewer than a dozen days remaining before a
critical round of primaries, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley
has made a tactical decision to spend nearly half that time in
Washington state. Bradley hopes a win in the state's Feb. 29
primary will give him some momentum heading into March 7. But some
analysts question whether the gambit can succeed in a state that is
typically ignored and in a contest that has no nominating delegates
at stake. Tuesday's balloting is a preference primary only; actual
delegates are chosen at party caucuses a week later. (Foskett,

   DAUMIER-EXHIBIT (Washington) _ Honore Daumier aided, abetted and
recorded the emergence of so many aspects of modern art and life as
we know it that you may have trouble keeping track. Look in any
direction in the sprawling, illuminating retrospective of his work
at the Phillips Collection here _ the largest Daumier show ever

the modern newspaper, the modern city and public transportation,
working-class consciousness, agitprop and political caricature,
popular art and entertainment. By Roberta Smith.

   APPLES-ATLANTA (Atlanta) _ This is a city without a historic
core, a city in constant evolution _ a Deep South version, you
might say, of Los Angeles. It has a past, of course, a real one as
well as the one that Margaret Mitchell so vividly imagined in
``Gone With the Wind.'' A decisive Civil War battle was fought over
this ground, and the momentous civil rights movement of the 1960s
had its principal headquarters here. That most American of
products, Coca-Cola, was invented here. But Atlanta, a city in a
hurry, keeps putting its past behind it. If not for the Cyclorama
depicting the fighting of 1864 and the superlative Atlanta History
Center, with its evocations of Henry W. Grady, the great newspaper
editor, and Bobby Jones, the golfer, and, yes, William Tecumseh
Sherman, who burned the city down, a visitor might easily come here
and miss Atlanta's past altogether. This, after all, is the
vibrant, business-minded capital of the New South, proud to have
played host to the 1996 Olympic Games, pleased to promote itself as
``The World's Next Great City'' and not another tradition-bound
vestige of the Old South. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   DAUMIER-EXHIBIT (Washington) _ Honore Daumier aided, abetted and
recorded the emergence of so many aspects of modern art and life as
we know it that you may have trouble keeping track. Look in any
direction in the sprawling, illuminating retrospective of his work
at the Phillips Collection here _ the largest Daumier show ever
held in this country _ and you'll see the start of something big:
the modern newspaper, the modern city and public transportation,
working-class consciousness, agitprop and political caricature,
popular art and entertainment. By Roberta Smith.

   APPLES-ATLANTA (Atlanta) _ This is a city without a historic
core, a city in constant evolution _ a Deep South version, you
might say, of Los Angeles. It has a past, of course, a real one as
well as the one that Margaret Mitchell so vividly imagined in
``Gone With the Wind.'' A decisive Civil War battle was fought over
this ground, and the momentous civil rights movement of the 1960s
had its principal headquarters here. That most American of
products, Coca-Cola, was invented here. But Atlanta, a city in a
hurry, keeps putting its past behind it. If not for the Cyclorama
depicting the fighting of 1864 and the superlative Atlanta History
Center, with its evocations of Henry W. Grady, the great newspaper
editor, and Bobby Jones, the golfer, and, yes, William Tecumseh
Sherman, who burned the city down, a visitor might easily come here
and miss Atlanta's past altogether. This, after all, is the
vibrant, business-minded capital of the New South, proud to have
played host to the 1996 Olympic Games, pleased to promote itself as
``The World's Next Great City'' and not another tradition-bound
vestige of the Old South. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   The ozone hole above Antarctica may not be damaging life in the
ocean below after all. If Californian researchers are right, then
increased ultraviolet radiation is having scarcely any effect on
the growth of marine plankton, the base of the ocean's food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Kevin Arrigo of Stanford University in Palo
Alto, Calif. has created computer models of phytoplankton growth
over a year in the southern hemisphere before and after the ozone
hole appeared in the 1980s. They included such factors as the
position of the ozone hole, cloud cover, and UV-B strength _ the
type of ultraviolet radiation that increases as atmospheric ozone
declines.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what increased UV-B did to phytoplankton, the
researchers compared two models. One was based on data from 1992, a
year with a yawning ozone hole and the other with the same
parameters except for the ozone levels, which were taken from 1978,
a year of ``normal'' conditions before the hole appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Over the southern hemisphere ecosystem as a whole, they found
that primary phytoplankton production decreased by only about 1
percent in 1992, which is significantly lower than other estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Arrigo's work does not discount the results of a number of
studies showing that increased UV-B can stunt phytoplankton growth
by 10 percent or more in localized areas or in the laboratory. The
difference is that his study looked at the big picture of UV-B for
the whole ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In previous studies, researchers scaled up measurements of
plankton growth beneath the hole and elsewhere to calculate an
overall effect for the whole Southern Ocean. But although they knew
that factors such as cloud cover were important, they are difficult
to include in such calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a cloudy day under a deep hole, there's still not nearly as
much UV flux as on a clear day with no hole,'' Arrigo says.
</P>
<P>
   Another important factor is that, at any given time, around 80
percent of the southern hemisphere's ozone hole is over ice. So
only a small fraction of phytoplankton in Southern Ocean waters
feels the full brunt of ozone depletion, he says. Both these
factors were incorporated into the new models.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Smith, at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
who did landmark research on the effect of increased UV-B on
phytoplankton, says that marine plankton have adapted to cope with
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that the impact isn't going to be catastrophic,''
he says. ``We've had the ozone hole for a decade and a half and the
system is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Arrigo's results are good news, he says we shouldn't
stop worrying about ozone depletion, because phytoplankton is only
one component of the ecosystem. ``There may be species shifts going
on that no one is aware of,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And we shouldn't forget that Southern Ocean phytoplankton could
be stretched to their limit in absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're keeping up,'' he says, ``but if the problem
gets worse who knows?''

<P>
   Ever wondered why listening to loud music or singing at the top
of your voice is such fun? Scientists at the University of
Manchester say a pleasure-inducing hearing mechanism we've
inherited from our fishy ancestors could be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by psychologist Neil Todd, an expert in music
perception, has discovered that the sacculus, an organ forming part
of the balance-regulating vestibular system in our inner ear, is
tuned in to respond to sound frequencies that predominate in music
_ despite the fact that the sacculus is not thought to have any
hearing function.
</P>
<P>
   Even more curious, Todd says, our saccular frequency sensitivity
appears to mimic that of fish _ the only type of creature known to
use its sacculus for hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This primitive hearing mechanism from our vertebrate ancestors
appears to have been conserved as a vestigial sense in humans,''
Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the vestibular system has a connection to the
hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for drives like
hunger, sex and hedonistic responses, Todd believes that people
might be getting a pleasurable buzz when they listen to music _
which could explain why music has developed into such a cultural
force. This buzz may mimic the thrills people get from swings and
bungee jumping, where motion stimulates the balance center.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a proviso. The sacculus only appears to be
sensitive to loud volumes _ above 90 decibels. Despite this,
crooners could also love their own singing because sound levels in
the larynx have been estimated to be as high as 130 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bloody loud in there,'' Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sacculus is buried deep within the ear, Todd and his
colleagues Frederick Cody and Jon Banks could not measure its
reaction to sound directly. But in regulating balance _
particularly head posture _ the sacculus evokes electrical signals
in certain neck muscles. So the team exploited this by asking
students to tense their neck muscles, and using surface electrodes,
they measured the extra signals produced when the sacculus responds
to sound rather than balance.
</P>
<P>
   In tests, 11 students listened to tone pips of varying
frequencies. Their saccular sensitivity ranged from 50 hertz up to
1000 hertz, with a peak between 300 and 350 hertz. On the musical
scale, middle C is 261 hertz. Male and female voices have frequency
ranges up to 200 and 400 hertz. The researchers will publish their
results this spring in a forthcoming edition of the journal Hearing
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distribution of frequencies that are typical in rock
concerts and at dance clubs almost seem designed to stimulate the
sacculus. They are absolutely smack bang in this range of
sensitivity,'' Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Large groups of people singing or chanting together, such as a
choir or a crowd at a sporting event, could also trigger the
mechanism, he adds.

   Plutonium from nuclear bombs exploded underground by India has
polluted Pakistan's nuclear test site 800 kilometers away,
according to sources in U.S. intelligence. If true, India has
breached its commitment to the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, which outlaws explosions that contaminate foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan both carried out nuclear tests in May 1998. A
report in the industry newsletter, Nuclear Fuel, says that
plutonium was later found in samples collected by U.S. intelligence
agents from near the Pakistani site in the Chagai hills. They
initially thought that Pakistan had detonated a plutonium weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, analysis of the ratio of plutonium isotopes in the
samples by the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
has shown that it leaked from one of the Indian explosions in the
Pokaran desert, and was blown over to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds plausible,'' says Trevor Findlay from Vertic, a
nuclear test verification center in London. ``It is more likely
that the plutonium is from an Indian test than a Pakistani one.''

   The irony is sweet. The smell of the potato plant could spell
the end for the dreaded Colorado beetle, which ravages millions of
dollars' worth of potato crops every year. Using powerful aromas
extracted from potato leaves, researchers in the UniS intend to
lure the insects to their death.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dickens and his colleagues at the U.S. Agricultural
Research Service's field station in Beltsville, Md., have isolated
six compounds from spud leaves which draw Colorado beetles to their
meal. By measuring the strength of signals from electrodes
implanted in the beetle's antennae they screened for the most
active substances.
</P>
<P>
   The team then prepared a variety of mixtures of these substances
to see which blend worked best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been an attractant for the Colorado beetle
before, so we're looking at something brand new,'' Dickens told New
Scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments in the potato fields of Maine last summer, the
researchers found blends of two or three leaf substances which
worked well. The most successful blends all contained a volatile
leaf odor called (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate. ``We captured three
times as many insects in baited as in unbaited traps,'' says
Dickens. He expects the results to be published in the journal
Agricultural and Forest Entomology.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the researchers plan to try a ``push-pull''
approach. Working with the ARS team, Randy Alford of the University
of Maine has discovered that Colorado beetles detest limonin, a
bitter substance found in orange peel. Greenhouse experiments this
summer showed that beetles repelled by potatoes treated with
limonin are more likely to be attracted by the baited traps.
</P>
<P>
   An additional bonus was the discovery that the leaf odor
(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol attracts predatory insects which kill the beetles
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Colorado beetle bites the plant, that's released from
the wound site, attracting predators,'' Dickensm says. The
predators it attracts include the two-spotted stink bug (Perillus
bioculatus) and the spined soldier bug (Podisus maculiventris),

   New weapons against the Colorado beetle are desperately needed,
according to Hans Vissen, an entomologist specializing in the
beetles at Plant Research International, a company in Wageningen,
the Netherlands.

   ``In Russia, the problem is so bad they can hardly grow potatoes
any more,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   John Pickett of the Institute of Arable Crops Research in
Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, says he is surprised these attractants
are so effective, because the same chemicals are produced by other
plants. Different proportions of attractants might let insects
discriminate between plants, he says. ``Maybe there's a blend which
tells the beetle that the plant is a potato.''

   The ozone hole above Antarctica may not be damaging life in the
ocean below after all. If Californian researchers are right, then
increased ultraviolet radiation is having scarcely any effect on
the growth of marine plankton, the base of the ocean's food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Kevin Arrigo of Stanford University in Palo
Alto, Calif. has created computer models of phytoplankton growth
over a year in the southern hemisphere before and after the ozone
hole appeared in the 1980s. They included such factors as the
position of the ozone hole, cloud cover, and UV-B strength _ the
type of ultraviolet radiation that increases as atmospheric ozone
declines.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what increased UV-B did to phytoplankton, the
researchers compared two models. One was based on data from 1992, a
year with a yawning ozone hole and the other with the same
parameters except for the ozone levels, which were taken from 1978,
a year of ``normal'' conditions before the hole appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Over the southern hemisphere ecosystem as a whole, they found
that primary phytoplankton production decreased by only about 1
percent in 1992, which is significantly lower than other estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Arrigo's work does not discount the results of a number of
studies showing that increased UV-B can stunt phytoplankton growth
by 10 percent or more in localized areas or in the laboratory. The
difference is that his study looked at the big picture of UV-B for
the whole ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In previous studies, researchers scaled up measurements of
plankton growth beneath the hole and elsewhere to calculate an
overall effect for the whole Southern Ocean. But although they knew
that factors such as cloud cover were important, they are difficult
to include in such calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a cloudy day under a deep hole, there's still not nearly as
much UV flux as on a clear day with no hole,'' Arrigo says.
</P>
<P>
   Another important factor is that, at any given time, around 80
percent of the southern hemisphere's ozone hole is over ice. So
only a small fraction of phytoplankton in Southern Ocean waters
feels the full brunt of ozone depletion, he says. Both these
factors were incorporated into the new models.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Smith, at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
who did landmark research on the effect of increased UV-B on
phytoplankton, says that marine plankton have adapted to cope with
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that the impact isn't going to be catastrophic,''
he says. ``We've had the ozone hole for a decade and a half and the
system is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Arrigo's results are good news, he says we shouldn't
stop worrying about ozone depletion, because phytoplankton is only
one component of the ecosystem. ``There may be species shifts going
on that no one is aware of,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And we shouldn't forget that Southern Ocean phytoplankton could
be stretched to their limit in absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're keeping up,'' he says, ``but if the problem
gets worse who knows?''

<P>
   Ever wondered why listening to loud music or singing at the top
of your voice is such fun? Scientists at the University of
Manchester say a pleasure-inducing hearing mechanism we've
inherited from our fishy ancestors could be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by psychologist Neil Todd, an expert in music
perception, has discovered that the sacculus, an organ forming part
of the balance-regulating vestibular system in our inner ear, is
tuned in to respond to sound frequencies that predominate in music
_ despite the fact that the sacculus is not thought to have any
hearing function.
</P>
<P>
   Even more curious, Todd says, our saccular frequency sensitivity
appears to mimic that of fish _ the only type of creature known to
use its sacculus for hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This primitive hearing mechanism from our vertebrate ancestors
appears to have been conserved as a vestigial sense in humans,''
Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the vestibular system has a connection to the
hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for drives like
hunger, sex and hedonistic responses, Todd believes that people
might be getting a pleasurable buzz when they listen to music _
which could explain why music has developed into such a cultural
force. This buzz may mimic the thrills people get from swings and
bungee jumping, where motion stimulates the balance center.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a proviso. The sacculus only appears to be
sensitive to loud volumes _ above 90 decibels. Despite this,
crooners could also love their own singing because sound levels in
the larynx have been estimated to be as high as 130 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bloody loud in there,'' Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sacculus is buried deep within the ear, Todd and his
colleagues Frederick Cody and Jon Banks could not measure its
reaction to sound directly. But in regulating balance _
particularly head posture _ the sacculus evokes electrical signals
in certain neck muscles. So the team exploited this by asking
students to tense their neck muscles, and using surface electrodes,
they measured the extra signals produced when the sacculus responds
to sound rather than balance.
</P>
<P>
   In tests, 11 students listened to tone pips of varying
frequencies. Their saccular sensitivity ranged from 50 hertz up to
1000 hertz, with a peak between 300 and 350 hertz. On the musical
scale, middle C is 261 hertz. Male and female voices have frequency
ranges up to 200 and 400 hertz. The researchers will publish their
results this spring in a forthcoming edition of the journal Hearing
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distribution of frequencies that are typical in rock
concerts and at dance clubs almost seem designed to stimulate the
sacculus. They are absolutely smack bang in this range of
sensitivity,'' Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Large groups of people singing or chanting together, such as a
choir or a crowd at a sporting event, could also trigger the
mechanism, he adds.

   Plutonium from nuclear bombs exploded underground by India has
polluted Pakistan's nuclear test site 800 kilometers away,
according to sources in U.S. intelligence. If true, India has
breached its commitment to the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, which outlaws explosions that contaminate foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan both carried out nuclear tests in May 1998. A
report in the industry newsletter, Nuclear Fuel, says that
plutonium was later found in samples collected by U.S. intelligence
agents from near the Pakistani site in the Chagai hills. They
initially thought that Pakistan had detonated a plutonium weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, analysis of the ratio of plutonium isotopes in the
samples by the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
has shown that it leaked from one of the Indian explosions in the
Pokaran desert, and was blown over to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds plausible,'' says Trevor Findlay from Vertic, a
nuclear test verification center in London. ``It is more likely
that the plutonium is from an Indian test than a Pakistani one.''

   The irony is sweet. The smell of the potato plant could spell
the end for the dreaded Colorado beetle, which ravages millions of
dollars' worth of potato crops every year. Using powerful aromas
extracted from potato leaves, researchers in the UniS intend to
lure the insects to their death.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dickens and his colleagues at the U.S. Agricultural
Research Service's field station in Beltsville, Md., have isolated
six compounds from spud leaves which draw Colorado beetles to their
meal. By measuring the strength of signals from electrodes
implanted in the beetle's antennae they screened for the most
active substances.
</P>
<P>
   The team then prepared a variety of mixtures of these substances
to see which blend worked best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been an attractant for the Colorado beetle
before, so we're looking at something brand new,'' Dickens told New
Scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments in the potato fields of Maine last summer, the
researchers found blends of two or three leaf substances which
worked well. The most successful blends all contained a volatile
leaf odor called (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate. ``We captured three
times as many insects in baited as in unbaited traps,'' says
Dickens. He expects the results to be published in the journal
Agricultural and Forest Entomology.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the researchers plan to try a ``push-pull''
approach. Working with the ARS team, Randy Alford of the University
of Maine has discovered that Colorado beetles detest limonin, a
bitter substance found in orange peel. Greenhouse experiments this
summer showed that beetles repelled by potatoes treated with
limonin are more likely to be attracted by the baited traps.
</P>
<P>
   An additional bonus was the discovery that the leaf odor
(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol attracts predatory insects which kill the beetles
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Colorado beetle bites the plant, that's released from
the wound site, attracting predators,'' Dickensm says. The
predators it attracts include the two-spotted stink bug (Perillus
bioculatus) and the spined soldier bug (Podisus maculiventris),
which pierce the body of the beetle and suck it dry.
</P>
<P>
   New weapons against the Colorado beetle are desperately needed,
according to Hans Vissen, an entomologist specializing in the
beetles at Plant Research International, a company in Wageningen,
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, the problem is so bad they can hardly grow potatoes
any more,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   John Pickett of the Institute of Arable Crops Research in
Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, says he is surprised these attractants
are so effective, because the same chemicals are produced by other
plants. Different proportions of attractants might let insects
discriminate between plants, he says. ``Maybe there's a blend which
tells the beetle that the plant is a potato.''

   The ozone hole above Antarctica may not be damaging life in the
ocean below after all. If Californian researchers are right, then
increased ultraviolet radiation is having scarcely any effect on
the growth of marine plankton, the base of the ocean's food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Kevin Arrigo of Stanford University in Palo
Alto, Calif. has created computer models of phytoplankton growth
over a year in the southern hemisphere before and after the ozone
hole appeared in the 1980s. They included such factors as the
position of the ozone hole, cloud cover, and UV-B strength _ the
type of ultraviolet radiation that increases as atmospheric ozone
declines.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what increased UV-B did to phytoplankton, the
researchers compared two models. One was based on data from 1992, a
year with a yawning ozone hole and the other with the same
parameters except for the ozone levels, which were taken from 1978,
a year of ``normal'' conditions before the hole appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Over the southern hemisphere ecosystem as a whole, they found
that primary phytoplankton production decreased by only about 1
percent in 1992, which is significantly lower than other estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Arrigo's work does not discount the results of a number of
studies showing that increased UV-B can stunt phytoplankton growth
by 10 percent or more in localized areas or in the laboratory. The
difference is that his study looked at the big picture of UV-B for
the whole ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In previous studies, researchers scaled up measurements of
plankton growth beneath the hole and elsewhere to calculate an
overall effect for the whole Southern Ocean. But although they knew
that factors such as cloud cover were important, they are difficult
to include in such calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a cloudy day under a deep hole, there's still not nearly as
much UV flux as on a clear day with no hole,'' Arrigo says.
</P>
<P>
   Another important factor is that, at any given time, around 80
percent of the southern hemisphere's ozone hole is over ice. So
only a small fraction of phytoplankton in Southern Ocean waters
feels the full brunt of ozone depletion, he says. Both these
factors were incorporated into the new models.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Smith, at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
who did landmark research on the effect of increased UV-B on
phytoplankton, says that marine plankton have adapted to cope with
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that the impact isn't going to be catastrophic,''
he says. ``We've had the ozone hole for a decade and a half and the
system is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Arrigo's results are good news, he says we shouldn't
stop worrying about ozone depletion, because phytoplankton is only
one component of the ecosystem. ``There may be species shifts going
on that no one is aware of,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And we shouldn't forget that Southern Ocean phytoplankton could
be stretched to their limit in absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're keeping up,'' he says, ``but if the problem
gets worse who knows?''

<P>
   Ever wondered why listening to loud music or singing at the top
of your voice is such fun? Scientists at the University of
Manchester say a pleasure-inducing hearing mechanism we've
inherited from our fishy ancestors could be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by psychologist Neil Todd, an expert in music
perception, has discovered that the sacculus, an organ forming part
of the balance-regulating vestibular system in our inner ear, is
tuned in to respond to sound frequencies that predominate in music
_ despite the fact that the sacculus is not thought to have any
hearing function.
</P>
<P>
   Even more curious, Todd says, our saccular frequency sensitivity
appears to mimic that of fish _ the only type of creature known to
use its sacculus for hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This primitive hearing mechanism from our vertebrate ancestors
appears to have been conserved as a vestigial sense in humans,''
Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the vestibular system has a connection to the
hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for drives like
hunger, sex and hedonistic responses, Todd believes that people
might be getting a pleasurable buzz when they listen to music _
which could explain why music has developed into such a cultural
force. This buzz may mimic the thrills people get from swings and
bungee jumping, where motion stimulates the balance center.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a proviso. The sacculus only appears to be
sensitive to loud volumes _ above 90 decibels. Despite this,
crooners could also love their own singing because sound levels in
the larynx have been estimated to be as high as 130 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bloody loud in there,'' Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sacculus is buried deep within the ear, Todd and his
colleagues Frederick Cody and Jon Banks could not measure its
reaction to sound directly. But in regulating balance _
particularly head posture _ the sacculus evokes electrical signals
in certain neck muscles. So the team exploited this by asking
students to tense their neck muscles, and using surface electrodes,
they measured the extra signals produced when the sacculus responds
to sound rather than balance.
</P>
<P>
   In tests, 11 students listened to tone pips of varying
frequencies. Their saccular sensitivity ranged from 50 hertz up to
1000 hertz, with a peak between 300 and 350 hertz. On the musical
scale, middle C is 261 hertz. Male and female voices have frequency
ranges up to 200 and 400 hertz. The researchers will publish their
results this spring in a forthcoming edition of the journal Hearing
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distribution of frequencies that are typical in rock
concerts and at dance clubs almost seem designed to stimulate the
sacculus. They are absolutely smack bang in this range of
sensitivity,'' Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Large groups of people singing or chanting together, such as a
choir or a crowd at a sporting event, could also trigger the
mechanism, he adds.

   Plutonium from nuclear bombs exploded underground by India has
polluted Pakistan's nuclear test site 800 kilometers away,
according to sources in U.S. intelligence. If true, India has
breached its commitment to the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, which outlaws explosions that contaminate foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan both carried out nuclear tests in May 1998. A
report in the industry newsletter, Nuclear Fuel, says that
plutonium was later found in samples collected by U.S. intelligence
agents from near the Pakistani site in the Chagai hills. They
initially thought that Pakistan had detonated a plutonium weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, analysis of the ratio of plutonium isotopes in the
samples by the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
has shown that it leaked from one of the Indian explosions in the
Pokaran desert, and was blown over to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds plausible,'' says Trevor Findlay from Vertic, a
nuclear test verification center in London. ``It is more likely
that the plutonium is from an Indian test than a Pakistani one.''

<P>
   The irony is sweet. The smell of the potato plant could spell
the end for the dreaded Colorado beetle, which ravages millions of
dollars' worth of potato crops every year. Using powerful aromas
extracted from potato leaves, researchers in the UniS intend to
lure the insects to their death.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dickens and his colleagues at the U.S. Agricultural
Research Service's field station in Beltsville, Md., have isolated
six compounds from spud leaves which draw Colorado beetles to their
meal. By measuring the strength of signals from electrodes
implanted in the beetle's antennae they screened for the most
active substances.
</P>
<P>
   The team then prepared a variety of mixtures of these substances
to see which blend worked best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been an attractant for the Colorado beetle
before, so we're looking at something brand new,'' Dickens told New
Scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments in the potato fields of Maine last summer, the
researchers found blends of two or three leaf substances which
worked well. The most successful blends all contained a volatile
leaf odor called (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate. ``We captured three
times as many insects in baited as in unbaited traps,'' says
Dickens. He expects the results to be published in the journal
Agricultural and Forest Entomology.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the researchers plan to try a ``push-pull''
approach. Working with the ARS team, Randy Alford of the University
of Maine has discovered that Colorado beetles detest limonin, a
bitter substance found in orange peel. Greenhouse experiments this
summer showed that beetles repelled by potatoes treated with
limonin are more likely to be attracted by the baited traps.
</P>
<P>
   An additional bonus was the discovery that the leaf odor
(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol attracts predatory insects which kill the beetles
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Colorado beetle bites the plant, that's released from
the wound site, attracting predators,'' Dickensm says. The
predators it attracts include the two-spotted stink bug (Perillus
bioculatus) and the spined soldier bug (Podisus maculiventris),
which pierce the body of the beetle and suck it dry.
</P>
<P>
   New weapons against the Colorado beetle are desperately needed,
according to Hans Vissen, an entomologist specializing in the
beetles at Plant Research International, a company in Wageningen,
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, the problem is so bad they can hardly grow potatoes
any more,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   John Pickett of the Institute of Arable Crops Research in
Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, says he is surprised these attractants
are so effective, because the same chemicals are produced by other
plants. Different proportions of attractants might let insects
discriminate between plants, he says. ``Maybe there's a blend which
tells the beetle that the plant is a potato.''

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Here in Vladimir Putin's hometown,
folks have many names for their most famous native son: Sphinx,
Gray Cardinal, Efficient Manager, Nice Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and confidantes debate whether Putin is a reformer
(given his track record in city government here in Russia's
second-largest city) or more bent on authoritarianism (given his
history in the secret services and his brutal war campaign in
Chechnya).
</P>
<P>
   Still, with one month until Russia's presidential elections,
friend and foe alike agree he will win the race because he has done
one simple thing: He's gotten people to believe that they can be a
great nation again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often we hear that Russia has imperial ambitions, but
this is not true. Russia has only one ambition _ to enjoy respect
from other nations,'' Putin said in January, one of the rare
insights into his vision as a national leader. ``We can count on a
worthy future only if we manage to naturally combine the principles
of a market economy and democracy with Russia's realities.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid churchgoer, who recently revealed that he and his family
celebrated Christmas even during the atheist Soviet times, Putin
added that ``any program should start from the revival of people's
morals. It is essential to begin with the restoration of moral
values, not with taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   This overall message _ although vague _ is music to most of the
country's ears. Russians are jaded after nine years of failed
reform and need something to believe in again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great leader because he's tapped into something deep,
some yearning,'' said Igor Shokhan, a St. Petersburg documentary
filmmaker. ``He's the type of patriot we need. The Soviet past is
dear, but he's looking to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with old neighbors, friends and colleagues of Putin
here in St. Petersburg reveal a vibrant, smart, reserved man. One,
who above all feels a call to duty and service, not to power, and
has the organizational, can-do qualities to get a job done.
</P>
<P>
   The balding, blond 47-year-old with a slight build is described
as a man of integrity. He doesn't drink. He's athletic _ friends
say Putin swims every day even after 15 hours in the office. He
likes to joke, and knows when someone is lying to him.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has made a concerted effort in the last couple of weeks to
show a more human face. In sharp contrast to the glassy-eyed stare
and schoolmasterish style witnessed at previous public events, he
has posed on television with the family's fluffy white poodle,
Tosya, and donned a new casual wardrobe. At the funeral of his
long-time boss and mentor, Anatoly Sobchak, Putin broke down in
tears.
</P>
<P>
   The window into his family life has opened only a crack,
however.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shokhan, the leader is reserved and private. ``His
family is his rock and fortress,'' Shokhan said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has insisted on keeping his two pre-teen daughters, Katia
and Maria, and wife, Ludmilla out of the press spotlight. Since he
unexpectedly became acting president on Dec. 31, his daughters
stopped going to the German-language school they usually attend,
and are being home-schooled.
</P>
<P>
   A fashionably coiffed brunette, Ludmilla Putin was a stewardess
when she met her future husband. She reportedly has dabbled in
business, but now is a full-time mother. She has appeared in public
with her husband a few times, but never on her own. When requesting
her birthday from the presidential press service, the reply given
is: ``It's a state secret.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents, who Putin describes as ``normal, simple folk,''
were working-class. They moved from a provincial village to the
city of St. Petersburg, the intellectual heart of the country,
before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike former presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin,
Putin's family had no ties to the Communist Party elite, or to
politics. Putin's father was a foreman at a machine-building
factory; his mother was a housewife. They both died of cancer
within the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet, unassuming neighborhood off St. Petersburg grand
boulevards that were home to the former imperial palaces of
Russia's czars and dukes, sits the Putin family's old apartment.
Like other buildings on the block, paint is peeling from the
entranceway of the eight-story edifice, and the yard looks forlorn
and neglected.
</P>
<P>
   His old neighbors say Putin would say hello as he passed them in
the hallway, usually early in the morning or after midnight, when
he left and returned for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought having a (political bigwig) around would mean
changes,'' said Marina Valentinova, a 53-year-old teacher who still
lives in his building. ``He could have used some pull to get the
streetlights working. But they're still not working.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's life as an officer in the KGB, which for some conjures
up sinister images of 1930s gulags and repression, seems only to
enhance his stature as an ``Everyman Made Good'' among Russians
who, like Putin, grew up in the post-Stalin years, said Valery
Golubev, an old friend of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose it (the career) out of a sense of duty to his country
_ not to the Soviet government or Communism, but the place where he
was born, the system that gave him an opportunity to go to
college,'' said Golubev, who met Putin when the two shared an
office in the 1970s in their first years with the KGB. ``It was a
romantic career, and a respected one, like an America, when you
work for the police or in the army.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet-era KGB was a monolithic government institution,
containing both domestic security and international espionage, as
if the American FBI and CIA were combined. Putin spent his career
in the foreign department. He learned German as an adult, and spent
five years living in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   His political career began in 1990, when he became a deputy to
Anatoly Sobchak, a prominent democrat of the perestroika era who
left academia to become the globe-trotting mayor of a
then-notoriously corrupt city, St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Officially in charge of foreign investment for St. Petersburg,
Putin cut deals with some of the most successful multinational
companies, like Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co., doing business in
Russia. He quickly rose in importance, taking charge of running
day-to-day operations in the city of 5.5 million people during
Sobchak's frequent trips out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand hesitation about Putin (because of his past),
but I worked with him for six years,'' Sobchak said in an interview
just days before he died of heart failure on Feb. 20. ``Putin
always gave the impression of utter reliability and
self-confidence. He worked hard out of a sense of duty, not
(monetary) reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's six years in the city administration put him at odds
with the city council, and, critics say, the politicians. While
efficient, smart and capable, Putin made his share of mistakes,
like fostering a closed system of private business deals and
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   These deals provoked numerous scandals. In 1991 the city, which
was experiencing food shortages in the final months before the
collapse of the Soviet Union, got special permission from the
Kremlin to export oil and minerals. The money made was supposed to
come back to the country as food supplies. Putin gave out contracts
for the deal, but much of the food never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose obscure companies, didn't use a tender process, and
everything was done without oversight,'' said Anatoly Bellayev, a
city council deputy who was in charge of a probe into the scandal.
It ended without any criminal charges being brought.
</P>
<P>
   More recent criticism has come as a result of Putin's war
strategy in Chechnya, in which he's allowed the Russian military to
use indiscriminate force against civilians to help defeat the
Islamic rebel forces. Some human rights groups have called the
attacks ``genocidal acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Strict information control about battles and war developments,
as well as the disappearance of war journalist Andrei Babitsky _
who had covered the story from behind enemy lines _ have both human
rights groups and journalists afraid that Putin will cut back on
freedoms as Russia's elected leader.
</P>
<P>
   Putin defenders here, however, say that doesn't sound like their
hometown hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Jewish and I couldn't be friends with Putin if he were a
racist or a dictator,'' said Shokhan the film director. ``He
doesn't enjoy war. He's not Hitler, or Stalin. He's a leader that
knows what has to be done and does it.''

   Move over, millionaire wannabes. There's a new crowd in town
tjat is shooting even higher.
</P>
<P>
   The enormously popular bestseller, ``The Millionaire Next
Door'', has competition.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you seeking extra zeros in your let worth should perusd
``Hmw to be a Billionaire: Proven Strapefies from the Titans mf
Wealth'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 310 pages, $24.95) by Martin S.
Fridson.
</P>
<P>
   The two books approach the accumulation of wealti differently.
The millionaire book is based on statistical analysis of hundreds
of millionaires surveyed to determine the lifestyle habits and
workplace strategies of the rich, but usually not so famous.
</P>
<P>
   Among Fridson's 14 subjects are the likes of J. Paul Getty, Carl
Icahn, Warren Buffett and Texas entrepreneurs Ross Perot and H.L.
Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Fridson, who is a managing director at Merrill Lynch and a
member of ``Institutional Investor's'' All-American Research team,
has done his homework.
</P>
<P>
   He has uncovered 10 fundamental strategies for joining the elite
billionaire's club, and he uses his 14 billionaires and a few
others to flesh out those strategies, which include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take monumental risks, as have Hunt and John Kluge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doing business in a new way, as did Perot and Sam Walton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dominating your market, as did John D. Rockefeller Sr. and
Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consolidating an industry, as did Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buying low, as did Getty, Buffett and Laurence Tisch.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Fridson also includes chapters on investing in political
influence and resisting unions, two favorite tactics of
billionaires through the 19th and 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his background in finance, Fridson can perhaps give a
more accurate picture of how billionaires amassed their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he writes that he discovered many surprises that
don't jibe with what the financial media write about billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, journalists sell Warren Buffett short by
portraying him merely as an investment wizard,'' Fridson writes.
``In reality, he has done far more than make passive investments in
underpriced companies and then wait patiently for the stock market
to recognize the hidden value. Anyone who hopes to follow Buffett's
model must be willing to take an active role, either as a corporate
insider or by pushing companies from outside to exploit their
assets more aggressively. It is also important to understand
Buffett's reliance, throughout his career, on outright purchases of
companies (especially insurance companies,) as opposed to becoming
a minority shareholder.''
</P>
<P>
   Such insights, found throughout Fridson's book, offer a much
different look at the likes of Gates, Walton and Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you aren't out to make a billion, this tome is well
worth reading.

   ``Effective Phrases for Performance Appraisals: A Guide to
Successful Evaluations''
</P>
<P>
   By James E. Neal Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Publications, Perrsburg, Ohio, $10.95
</P>
<P>
   One thing we can almost all agree on: Appraisals are a miserable
process to endure to get a raise, and they aren't much more fun on
the other side of the desk. Part of the problem is coming up with
appropriate language to describe what you've done over the past
year _ succinctly, yet impressively. Or, on the other side, to
describe to employees how they have performed. This small book, in
its ninth edition, is chock-full of useful words and phrases that
relate to performance evaluation, such as ``excels in customer
retention'' and ``is tactful in conflict situations.''

MEETING `MISS JULIE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a guy who's not exactly a household name, director Mike
Figgis sure has been busy, releasing three movies within the space
of a year. Somehow, he also found the time to film ``Miss Julie.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgis (''Leaving Las Vegas'') loves to challenge himself, but
the results tend to be pretty hit-and-miss. He's fascinated with
sexual politics _ the subject of ``Miss Julie'' _ and his films
have a dreamlike moodiness. They also, all too frequently, are
pretentious, dreary and/or silly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because Figgis didn't write ``Miss Julie,'' it largely
dodges those traits _ not that there aren't traces of them,
especially dreariness. Still, it's not exactly mainstream as it
adapts August Strindberg's play about a count's daughter (Saffron
Burrows), who gets more than she bargained for when she attempts to
seduce the count's footservant (Peter Mullan). What follows is a
dialogue-heavy examination of sex and class differences, but at
least the dialogue is good, given cinematic rhythms through Helen
Cooper's astute screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is on the acting, and Mullan, in particular, explodes,
tempering his anger with a sense of sadness and desperation. If
he's turning into one of our great unheralded actors, Burrows is
still trying to find her niche. Her indignant poutiness is put to
good use here, but she could still stand to gain a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Not that humor has much of a place in ``Miss Julie.'' People
most familiar with Strindberg have a head start; Figgis' admirers
will probably also be pleased. For everyone else, though, ``Miss
Julie'' will be a slow, grim sit.

FIGHT THE URGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   A bitterly funny short film on the festival circuit called
``Maid! Madonna! Whore!'' laments the limited opportunities casting
directors provide for Latina actresses: If you're not Salma Hayek
or Jennifer Lopez _ and sometimes if you are _ you're likely to be
pigeonholed as one of those three stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   A few indie/orphan movies have tried to change that. The latest
is ``Knockout,'' a Latina boxing drama that trades cliches that
discriminate for ones that don't. And regardless of ethnicity or
gender, they're still cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle (Sophia-Adella Hernandez) scraps her way up from
ambitious amateur to million-to-one title contender. She has an
irascible trainer/father (Tony Plana), a boxer-turned-cop who's
dedicated to saving kids from the street life. Eduardo Yanez is her
shy love interest, her father's partner and one of those kids he
saved from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a formidable opponent known as ``The Terminator,''
whose bout with Isabelle's best friend (resulting in her
hospitalization) is the inspiration for Isabelle's vengeful return
to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   And, if that isn't enough, her mom (Maria Conchita Alonso) died
young, showing up in flashbacks to spread bumper-sticker
inspirationalism such as ``let your light shine,'' a message the
movie takes very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to want to root for ``Knockout'' because it's a
well-meaning, low-budget movie aimed at an underserved audience.
But it's just not very good, and the low budget is part of the
problem: Aside from Plana, who's pretty good as Isabelle's dad, the
performances range from competent to amateurish; the screenplay
lacks the humor that could balance out its overbearing earnestness;
and the fight scenes are among the most poorly choreographed in
history.

A MODERN ECHO OF THE FUROR OVER JACK JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching a replay of Dennis Rodman tossing his jersey to fans in
Reunion Arena recently after being ejected from a game, I thought
of Jack Johnson, the first African-American heavyweight boxing
champion of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it is a bit of reach to connect the newest member of
the Dallas Mavericks to someone like Johnson. Despite being one
tremendous athlete, Rodman will not rate a footnote in the history
of the progress of African-Americans after he finishes strutting
and fretting his bizarre hour on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rodman's flamboyant flouting of conventional norms of
behavior and appearance struck me as being, on a very basic level,
quite similar to the defiance that Johnson exhibited after he took
the heavyweight title from Canadian fighter Tommy Burns on Dec, 26,
1908.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had every right to expect a hero's welcome home when he
returned to the U.S. Instead, he was greeted with scorn and abuse.
White America did not want a black champion because of the powerful
symbolism of boxing's highest achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson-Burns fight was scheduled for 20 rounds, but it was
stopped in the 14th round because Burns' face was swollen to twice
its size, and both his eyes were shut.
</P>
<P>
   Novelist Jack London led calls for a great white hope to take
the title from Johnson: ``The battle was between a colossus and a
pygmy. Burns was a toy in his hands. Jim Jeffries must emerge from
his alfalfa farm and remove the golden smile from the Negro's
face.''
</P>
<P>
   That golden smile was to the white bigots of that day kind of
like Rodman's yellowed hair to some of today's bigots. But where
Rodman's hair, tattoos and body-piercings evoke sarcasm and
laughter, Johnson's golden left front tooth infuriated the Jack
Londons of his day.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Johnson's fights were staged outdoors, and he would
smile broadly to catch the reflection of the sun, while he tattooed
his opponents with lefts and rights and taunted them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson might have behaved differently had it not been for his
rejection by the white public. After all, he'd come a long way from
Galveston, Texas, where he was born on March 31, 1878, and where as
a youth he fought in the battles royal. Those were spectacles in
which black men and boys battered each other for the amusement of
white patrons.
</P>
<P>
   He was not officially recognized as champion until his first
title defense, when he knocked out Victor McLaglen. And the
drumbeat went on for Jeffries to return and take the title back for
the white race.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1910, Jeffries yielded to the pleas. The fight was
preceded with a barrage of laudatory publicity about Jeffries and
vilification of Johnson by the white press. That racist coverage
elicited angry responses in the black press, and the stage was set
for a social explosion.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson pounded Jeffries into submission in 15 rounds,
race riots erupted across America. Scores were seriously injured,
and seven were killed. The Texas Legislature banned the showing of
films of any of Johnson's fights out of fear of setting off more
riots.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to the injury of his whipping up on all white
comers, Johnson lived a flamboyant and lavish lifestyle that
included marrying three white women. Because of that latter offense
to white sensibilities, charges that he violated the Mann Act _
which forbade transporting white women across state lines for
immoral purposes _ were trumped up against Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to flee the country for several years and to fight
and perform in theatrical spectacles in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, Johnson gave up his title to Jess Willard in a fight in
Havana. He threw the fight under the condition that he be allowed
to return to the U.S. The fight was supposed to end in the 10th
round, but Johnson prolonged it until the 26th, when he received a
sign from his wife that she had received all of the money promised
him.
</P>
<P>
   He was ahead on all scorecards when he took the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Even then Johnson was betrayed, and he finally came back home
five years later and spent a year in a federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to put on several exhibition fights and pursued other
businesses before being killed in an automobile accident in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a proud, audacious black man at a time when it took
real guts to be that way. His defiance expressed the hidden
feelings of most of black America and inspired many others in
avenues of life beyond boxing.
</P>
<P>
   He was a role model for Muhammed Ali, and something tells me
that fellow Texan Dennis Rodman has heard of him.

&HT;     KORESH FOLLOWER ADMITS SHOOTING AT GOVERNMENT AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DICK J. REAVIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, a survivor of the Feb. 28, 1993, shootout at
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, has admitted that he
fired at two of the four federal agents who were killed during the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone Fagan, who was one of 11 Davidians tried in San
Antonio six years ago, said in a deposition that he shot at agents
from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on the roof of the
religious cult's compound. Fagan gave the deposition in a wrongful
death lawsuit that survivors and their families filed against the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan was convicted in 1994 of manslaughter and a weapons charge
and is serving a 40-year prison sentence in connection with the
siege. It was unclear whether prosecutors will file new charges
based on his admission.
</P>
<P>
   His deposition, taken earlier this month at a federal prison in
Allenwood, Pa., was made public this week by the Houston legal firm
Caddell and Chapman, which represents several plaintiffs in the
civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, 40, is a party to the wrongful death suit because his
mother, Doris, 60, and his wife, Evette, 30, died in the April 19,
1993, fire at the compound outside Waco. In pleadings, the lawyers
for Davidians and their family members argue that the ATF used
excessive force in its Feb. 28 raid, and that federal authorities
were to blame for the fire seven weeks later in which about 80
Davidians died.
</P>
<P>
   During their 1994 trial, Fagan and his fellow defendants who
were followers of cult leader David Koresh did not take the stand.
In the years since, three survivors of the shootout have testified
before Congress, but none admitted firing on federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan maintains the shooting in which he took part isn't the one
for which he was convicted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During the Davidian trial, federal prosecutors said that late in
the 45-minute battle, Fagan wounded ATF Agent Eric Evers, who took
the stand to identify his assailant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that man over there shot me,'' Evers testified,
pointing at Fagan. `` There's no doubt in my mind that man shot
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his Feb. 1 deposition, Fagan said he wasn't outdoors on
the morning of the ATF raid, as Evers testified. Instead, he was in
the cafeteria of the building housing the Davidians, firing on
agents who were standing on a roof outside Koresh's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan told federal civil lawyer Marie Hagen that he acted in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your government murdered people who were very dear to me,'' he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen both cajoled and pressed for details during the sworn
testimony in Pennsylvania. His confession came in a sudden and
startling exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Hagen: ``Did you shoot at them?''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan: ``Well, they fired at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen: ``OK. But did you shoot at them?''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan: ``And so I responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen: ``Did you hit any of them?''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan: ``I don't know specifically, because I assume that there
were others, too, that were firing then.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the ATF agents on the roof, Todd McKeeham, 28, and Conway
LeBleu, 34, both from the bureau's office in New Orleans, were
killed on the spot. A third man on the roof, Kenneth King, was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The holder of a graduate degree from a Seventh-day Adventist
seminary in Britain, Fagan was not present during the fatal fire
April 19. He had surrendered March 22, he said, because Koresh had
asked him to act as a spokesman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   His admission came as a surprise to fellow Davidian survivors of
the 1993 events. One of them, David Thibodeau, in a memoir
published in the fall, repeated the accepted wisdom among the group
that Fagan, whose manner is that of a theologian, ``was kneeling in
prayer in the chapel while the bullets were flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Doyle, who was acquitted in the same trial that convicted
Fagan, said: ``I think that I saw Livingstone standing by the door
in the cafeteria, but I don't think that he was firing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Fagan's lawyer in the civil suit, Kirk Lyons of Black
Mountain, N.C., was somewhat startled by Fagan's revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy that's been in solitary confinement for a long
time, and he's had nobody of his own mental abilities that he can
talk to,'' Lyons said. ``He's a little stir-crazy.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Half of the potential first ladies in this year's presidential
election have experienced depression or drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The usually upbeat Tipper Gore was treated for depression in
1989, after her son was hit by a car and nearly killed. Cindy
McCain got hooked on Percoset and Vicodin, both prescription
painkillers, while being treated for back and knee pain. She began
filching the pills from a medical charity she ran, until, under
investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration, she 'fessed
up in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many actual or potential first ladies seem to need
chemical assistance for emotional uplift? Think of Joan Kennedy
with her alcohol, Betty Ford with her pills, and Kitty Dukakis with
her rubbing alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Even women usually thought of as thoroughly functional have
flirted with dysfunction. Jackie Kennedy relied on a Dr. Feelgood
to inject her (and her husband) with vitamins and amphetamines.
Barbara Bush sank into despair after her last child left home and
her husband went to work for the CIA, which requires a man to be
even vaguer than usual about what happened today at the office,
dear.
</P>
<P>
   The typical explanation is that it's tough to be the wife of a
politician. You drop everything to help your husband get elected,
and if you're successful, your reward is to be trapped on the wrong
end of the public microscope. Oddly enough, this brings up a few
questions (and answers) regarding the reasons for living this
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   How hard is it to be a candidate's or president's wife? This is
really two questions. First, do politicians' wives have a difficult
job, and second, are the emotional demands on them unusually
intense?
</P>
<P>
   Being a candidate's wife can be a physical strain, particularly
during a campaign. Campaigning involves an exhausting amount of
travel, speaking publicly over and over again, sitting straight and
looking interested while others drone on, shaking an uncountable
number of hands, and eating disgusting quantities of inedible food.
But all this is no more, and probably less, than the candidate
himself has to put up with.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a candidate's wife's emotional life does require a
special kind of fortitude. First, she has to be alone a lot. Few
politicians make it home for dinner, since they do most of their
fundraising after-hours, either at dinners or speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Second, whatever her actual personality, she has to create the
illusion that she's the wife in the representative couple that
voters and pundits appear to want her and her husband to be.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the fate of Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosalynn Carter, Betty
Ford, Hillary Clinton, and even, at times, Nancy Reagan, the wife
must present herself as a helpmeet. But a pleasant and attractive
and supportive helpmeet, not a pushy one. She must neither compete
for his time nor be too involved in his activities.
</P>
<P>
   If she has a career, she should make sure it is as distinct from
his as possible, to avoid charges of nepotism or log-rolling. If
she has political opinions, she should appear to keep them to
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she must do all this with no power of her own and no
remuneration. This is a pretty big sacrifice for little reward _
the royal road to marital frustration.
</P>
<P>
   So why do women do it? One could speculate that there are types
of women (and men) drawn to politicians _ let's call them
masochists _ just as there are types of men and women drawn to
politics, most of whom were or wanted to be their class president.
Masochism is linked to a tendency to succumb to depression, and
depression is linked to abuse of prescription drugs and alcohol,
and so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Like all psychosocial generalizations, though, this explanation
is inadequate in two ways: It doesn't explain the exceptions, and
it may reverse cause and effect. It could be that politicians'
wives develop a taste for masochism _ or drugs _ as a response to
their situation. What if they married before he entered politics
and before she understood what being a politician's wife would
entail?
</P>
<P>
   Calling her a masochist amounts to asking why she doesn't leave,
which displays a limited grasp of the complexity of human
motivations. (This is why demanding that Hillary leave Bill has
always seemed so silly.) What if she loves him and doesn't want to
destroy his career? What if she doesn't believe in divorce? What if
she's afraid of losing the custody battle?
</P>
<P>
   So she should drink or pop pills instead? This is not as crazy
as it sounds. Look at it this way. Your options are 1) leave your
husband and ruin his career; 2) stay with your husband but
demonstrate your frustration in a way that hurts him politically;
or 3) stay with your husband and drug yourself to make it bearable.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? No. 3 is the option that requires the least
sacrifice by all parties.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another twist: If it came out that the wife was
drinking or taking drugs, that would hurt her husband and turn No.
3 into a variant of No. 2. So No. 3 works only if secrecy is
assured. Since that's impossible in today's media climate, No. 3 is
a difficult course to pursue. But if it's successful, it's still
the best one.
</P>
<P>
   Are presidential couples really required to purvey a
soul-destroying fiction to the American public? If you believe Gil
Troy, a historian of presidential couples and the author of
``Affairs of State: The Rise and Rejection of the Presidential
Couple Since World War II,'' the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Troy is astute about the impossibility of the first lady's
position: ``First Ladies have become prime political targets,
attacked, ridiculed, and grilled about their childhoods, their
child rearing, their marriages, their fashions and their
philosophies. It is a thankless task.''
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike other commentators on the modern presidential
marriage, Troy argues that the ``co-presidency,'' as he calls it,
is less the product of feminism and the belief that ``the personal
is political'' than of the mass media, with its emphasis on the
personalities of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   As he sees it, the real job of the political spouse isn't to
provide a foil for the endless conversation about sex roles. It is
to do for her husband what the party used to do for candidates,
``helping to define the country's leader in an accessible and
standard shorthand.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he notes, no matter how much Americans have come to
expect a first lady by the side of the president, we are equally
insistent that we don't want anyone to wield power whom we haven't
elected. Any woman seen to usurp her husband's presidential
prerogatives will immediately witness a drop in her _ and her
husband's _ popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Troy's solution to this is not to fight it: ``Don't be
yourselves; be who they want you to be.'' ``The less power you seem
to want, the more you'll get and the more popular you shall be.''
``When in doubt, go retro.''
</P>
<P>
   Being something of a tragic realist, Troy goes so far as to
conclude that the lies required to create an idealized political
marriage are a social necessity. They are, he says, ``useful
fictions,'' in that they provide the American public with the role
models needed to fight the cynicism he says prevails about both
marriage and democracy today.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, others are less pessimistic. Andrew Sullivan
thinks that first ladies such as Bill Bradley's wife, literature
professor Ernestine Schlant, are the way to go _ that is that first
ladies should have their own careers.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Talbot and Germaine Greer want to get rid of first
ladies altogether, at least as currently conceived _ which is, as
Talbot puts it, ``as so much glorified arm candy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with both these suggestions is that they're
implausible. We won't know how the public would react to Schlant as
first lady, since Bradley seems doomed. But the first lady today
does have several specific and time-consuming tasks, mostly
involving entertaining, which would make it nearly impossible for
Schlant to maintain a full course load or to publish monographs
while her husband was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It's even harder to imagine how we could force media outlets to
stop treating first ladies as ``arm candy'' or demanding intimate
revelations of them. The media's appetite for what Troy calls
``shorthand'' only grows. Given the fierce competition, no
presidential candidate is likely to unilaterally disarm by
campaigning without his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Troy may be overestimating the social utility of illusions _
they seem as likely to produce cynicism as to quell it _ but he's
right about the media's insistence on them. Rather than demand the
unthinkable, perhaps we should federally finance tranquilizers
instead.

RABBIS ASK POPE TO CANCEL PLANNED MASS ON JEWISH SABBATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A group of senior rabbis Thursday asked Pope John
Paul II to cancel plans for a daytime Saturday mass in Nazareth
during his visit to Israel next month, contending that security
arrangements would cause ``massive desecration'' of the Jewish
sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, far-right religious factions put up wall
posters in Jerusalem's Orthodox neighborhoods denouncing the pope
as ``the wicked one'' and condemned planned papal prayer services
here as acts of ``mass idolatry in the heart of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a speech to an international gathering here of Jewish
World War II military veterans, a prominent American rabbi assailed
the pontiff's alleged wartime acquiescence to the Nazi persecution
of Polish Jews. Israel should receive the pope with ``respect'' but
not ``celebration,'' said Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a former chairman
of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations, in remarks reported widely here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg also said the planned Saturday mass ``is a slap in the
face of Jewish dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has declared that a major aim of the pope's
pilgrimage to the Holy Land is to further the cause of
reconciliation between Roman Catholics and their ``elder
brothers,'' as Pope John Paul has called the Jews. Israeli
political leaders, most of whom welcome warmer relations with the
Vatican, are planning to turn out in force to welcome the pope when
he arrives on March 21. The trip will be the first state visit by a
Catholic pontiff to Israel, which established diplomatic relations
with the Vatican just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But as preparations for the papal visit intensify, there are
increasing signs of ambivalence among Jewish religious leaders here
_ and growing indications that the pope may be greeted with
organized hostility by Jewish fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctity of the sabbath _ always a charged issue in the
secular-religious divide within Israel _ has become a focus of
growing unease about the pope's trip.
</P>
<P>
   In a petition presented Thursday to the Vatican's chief
diplomatic representative, a delegation of rabbis asked ``His
Honor'' John Paul II ``to please change your schedule'' and cancel
activities between sundown Friday and sundown Saturday, the
penultimate 24 hours of the pope's six-day visit to Israel and
adjacent Palestinian-ruled territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our apprehension about Shabbat desecration arises from the
fact that thousands of security men and police will be mobilized
for the needs of security for the visit, most of them Jews who will
be required to desecrate Shabbat against their will,'' the document
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Though organized by the rightist opposition United Torah Judaism
Party, the petition was signed by 2,137 rabbis and laymen
representing almost every Israeli municipal rabbinical council and
a spectrum of religious views.
</P>
<P>
   In what both sides later described as a cordial and
``respectful'' exchange, the rabbis and the papal nuncio, Msgr.
Pietro Sambi, discussed further details of the pope's trip. The
chief rabbi of Haifa, Shear Yeshuv Cohen, said he had proposed
advancing the planned Saturday mass to after sundown. ``That is
about six in the evening,'' he said later. ``From 6 to 12 there are
still six hours to this holy day.''
</P>
<P>
   In an itinerary coordinated months ago with the Israeli
government, the Vatican scheduled a midday mass for Saturday, March
25, at the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth, an Israeli
Arab town with a mixed Christian and Muslim population. This
itinerary keeps the huge papal entourage far from major Jewish
population centers on the sabbath holiday, organizers noted. On
Sunday, March 26, the pope plans to return to Jerusalem to
celebrate mass in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank,'' Sambi said after the meeting Thursday, ``I have
to say that from the beginning the government of Israel has made us
conscious of this sensibility, and we have collaborated fully with
the government to reduce to a minimum the disturbance from the
activity of the pope during Shabbat.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Vatican face another religious headache in
Nazareth: Fundamentalist Muslims are camped out next to the
Basilica in a public plaza where they were granted government
permission to build a mosque _ but only after the pope leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli authorities say that if the Muslims don't vacate the
site voluntarily, they will be forcibly dislodged, and permission
to build the mosque will be revoked. But Muslim leaders are
refusing to move, and say they are planning their own welcoming
ceremony for the pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is not expected to alter its long-set plans for the
Nazareth mass. Even if the service was rescheduled, security
preparations for the pope's visit to the city would still need to
be in place hours beforehand. And the itinerary as it stands takes
into consideration the aging pope's frail health, scheduling just
one major event and minimizing travel each day.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope will not be traveling on the Sabbath with the
Israeli air force, as originally planned. Responding to rabbinical
pressure, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday that it was canceling
plans to fly John Paul to Nazareth for the Saturday service.
Alternative transportation will be arranged, the ministry said.

MOSBACHER'S EX-WIFE HINTS SUPPORT FOR McCAIN PROMPTED HALT IN(Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By RAD SALLEE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A lawsuit by businesswoman-author Georgette Mosbacher
suggests that her support for Republican presidential candidate
John McCain was a factor in her former husband's cutting off her
$32,064-a-month tax-free alimony.
</P>
<P>
   Houston oilman Robert A. Mosbacher was secretary of Commerce
under President Bush and is a family friend of his son, Gov. George
W. Bush, who is locked in a tight primary race with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mosbacher denied any political motive and said he cut off
the payments because his ex-wife had breached an agreement that
they would not ``disparage'' one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' he said when told of the lawsuit. ``John McCain
is an old friend of mine, and I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, his former wife feels the same way about Bush. A
Jan. 31 article by George Gurley in the New York Observer, where
the alleged disparagement occurred, says Georgette Mosbacher
``still considers herself a Bush family friend.''
</P>
<P>
   It quotes her as saying, ``We get to pick between two good
men.''
</P>
<P>
   The article headline says, ``Georgette Mosbacher Rides with
McCain'' and ``Gorgeous divorcee serves as his handmaiden to New
York society money; After rough breakup with Bush buddy Robert
Mosbacher, she sides with insurgent.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgette Mosbacher's high spirits and red hair made her a
popular subject of gossip columnists during her 1988-92 stay in
Washington. She and Robert Mosbacher were married 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Her book ``It Takes Money, Honey'' discusses her three marriages
to wealthy men and advises women on how to provide for their
financial future. She also operated a successful cosmetics
business, and a Jan. 10, 1999, New York Post article estimated her
fortune at $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Her suit is set for a hearing June 12 before U.S. District Judge
Lynn Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Although divorce law in Texas does not authorize awards of
alimony, it may be paid by agreement of the parties, said Georgette
Mosbacher's lawyer, Tom Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The couple entered the agreement June 23, 1997, and were
divorced April 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Feb. 15 letter to Alexander from Robert Mosbacher's attorney,
Robert Piro, gave notice that the payments would cease. It cited
``numerous warnings that Georgette's continued breach of ... the
marital agreement would not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says the cutoff is an ``unconstitutional prohibition
of plaintiff's constitutional rights of free speech and to give
support to the candidate of her choice in the presidential
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mosbacher said he was disparaged later in the article
where Georgette Mosbacher is quoted as saying, ``My husband left me
for another woman'' and ``Here's the man who threw the hand grenade
in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She is quoted as saying, ``When the one person you trusted that
was your best friend on earth betrays you, I don't even know that I
can put it in words. I don't know if you ever get over it, totally.
I feel like I've been permanently harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mosbacher said his ex-wife had breached their agreement
previously by making similar comments in the New York Post and
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander contends that Robert Mosbacher is a public figure and
that his former wife has a right to tell the truth. Robert
Mosbacher declined to say whether the infidelity accusation is
true.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also says the proper remedy for disparagement would
be damages, not cancellation of alimony.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the agreed payments, Alexander said, Georgette
Mosbacher, who now lives in New York, gave up claims to the
couple's community property and Houston residence.

RAUCOUS `WONDER BOYS' IS WITTY, GRITTY AND FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irreverence, wit, lies, old movies, writer's block _ and a
murdered dog.
</P>
<P>
   What more can one ask from a film? This ain't your ordinary
teenage frivolity-fest about slashers, sex and prom dates.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-nominated director Curtis Hanson (``L.A. Confidential,''
``The River Wild,'' ``The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'') has stepped
away from the thriller genre and vigorously gone for something
closer to the throat _ and heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' is a terrific movie about middle-age malaise and
a comedy of unusual wit and drollness.
</P>
<P>
   Pot-smoking prof Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a 50-ish
``wonder boy,'' whose first novel achieved J.D. Salinger-like cult
status. But his highly anticipated new tome sits yellowing in the
bottom drawer of his desk, unfinished and unending. And on a
fateful weekend in the slushy dead of winter, Tripp is about to
find out why he cannot finish it.
</P>
<P>
   His personal life also has gone to pot. His young wife has left
him, he's having an affair with the married chancellor of the
Pittsburgh college where he teaches (Frances McDormand) and his New
York editor (Robert Downey Jr.) is chafing to get his hands on
Tripp's new novel.
</P>
<P>
   Standing quietly in the shadows is a morose and brilliant
writing student James Leer (Tobey Maguire), who, appearances to the
contrary, will take Tripp on the ride of his life _ a journey that,
over the long weekend, will restore him to his true purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' is a raucous, poignant rarity in films these
days. It has a '70s sensibility, a real intelligence about writers
and writing blocks and is made more meaningful by great
post-production artists (such as film editor Dede Allen) who have
honed it to near-perfect grittiness.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' Tripp is a disheveled lost soul just waiting for ruin.
The actor casts off his movie-star appeal to slouch into slobbery
and, though he lets Maguire, Downey and McDormand provide the
film's pulse and energy and have the best lines, he's so good that
we end up rooting for his character.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, with his jowly face and unshaven look, gives the film a
stable rhythm. He helps Hanson turn this sad, bittersweet comic
look at middle-age malaise into a poetic ode about redemption and
second chances.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder Boys. Directed by Curtis Hanson. Written by Steve Kloves.
Cast: Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, Katie
Holmes, Robert Downey Jr. Paramount Pictures. 110 minutes. Rated R
for sexual content, language.

WTO TALKS ON ADMITTING CHINA BREAK OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CRAIG SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Chinese and European Union trade negotiators
broke off talks in Beijing Thursday on China's entry to the World
Trade Organization, further complicating the country's troubled bid
to join. No date has been set for the talks to resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap has narrowed, but we are not there yet,'' the EU team
leader, Hans-Friedrich Beseler, said in a statement. An EU
spokeswoman described the talks as having ``broken down'' in their
fourth day.
</P>
<P>
   China's chief negotiator, Long Yongtu, said the two sides had
``come very close,'' the official New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   China's attempt to join the organization has dragged on for 14
years. Last year, the United States and China agreed to membership
terms, but China must reach similar agreements with all WTO members
before it can join. India signed a WTO deal with China on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   China still has a good chance of entering the organization this
year, despite the slow progress. A more imposing threat to its
membership is growing opposition in the U.S. Congress, which must
grant China permanent normal trade relations in order for the
United States to benefit from the terms of China's eventual WTO
membership. And congressional support has eroded because of
resistance from organized labor and rising tensions between China
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China can technically enter the WTO regardless of a
congressional vote, provided it reaches an accord with the EU and
other members, WTO officials say. Both the United States and Cuba
are WTO members, for example, despite trade restrictions between
the two countries. But WTO officials say China has so far indicated
that it will not join if it is not freed from the annual U.S.
review of its trade status, a vestige of sanctions leveled on China
after its crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement with the Europeans, meanwhile, is still within
reach. ``We remain committed to a deal with China at the earliest
available opportunity,'' Anthony Gooch, a spokesman for the
European Union, told a news conference in Brussels Thursday after
talks ended.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats say unresolved issues include the extent to
which foreign telecommunications companies will be allowed to
provide services in China, constraints on the number of business
licenses and geographic coverage granted foreign insurers, and the
extent to which China's market will open to European agricultural
and food products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are the 20 percent that haven't been covered in the
U.S. agreement,'' said a European diplomat in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the Europeans are seeking to clarify areas left
vague by the U.S. talks, in particular regarding current foreign
investment in Chinese telecommunications networks. Companies as
diverse as Sprint Corp. and FranceTelecom made such investments
through a complex holding structure. But China later declared those
investments illegal and demanded they be unwound, basically
nationalizing millions of dollars in foreign telecommunications
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal struck with the United States, foreign companies
eventually will be allowed to own up to 49 percent of fixed line
and mobile telecommunications networks, and many industry
executives hoped that would resolve the dispute. But China has
since offered a different interpretation, insisting that the
existing investments are still illegal.
</P>
<P>
   This is an issue that is very important for the European Union
because there are some European companies involved and they want a
better arrangement, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the EU is pushing for concessions the United
States was unable or unwilling to achieve. The Europeans want China
to allow foreigners to hold controlling stakes in
telecommunications networks, for example. And they want more
business licenses for European insurers. China has granted licenses
to only 14 foreign insurers, including five U.S. companies and five
European companies, but some U.S. companies hold more than one
license. They also want foreign insurers to be allowed to sell
group insurance beyond the two cities in which such sales are
allowed now. Group insurance, covering employees at China's state
enterprises, for example, is the most promising segment of the
Chinese insurance market. The Europeans also want China to drop
trade barriers to British gin, Scotch whiskey, French cheese and
other items not covered by the accord with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the breakdown in talks, European diplomats and business
executives noted that China's negotiations with the EU only resumed
in January after having been suspended last year pending an
agreement with the United States. They said the talks have not yet
moved beyond technical details of the issues involved.

`REINDEER GAMES' SUCEEDS DESPITE AFFLECK'S LESS-THAN-STELLAR
ACTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his face on the cover of half the magazines on the
newsstand this month, Ben Affleck seems to be Hollywood's happening
guy: the first ``new'' star (with a hefty $12 million per film
price tag) to be officially christened by the media in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he has any staying power, however, remains to be seen.
His all-American looks have carried him through most of his roles,
and his heat seems to owe as much to his friendship with Matt Damon
and resemblance to America's fallen prince, JFK Jr., than any real
movie-star persona.
</P>
<P>
   In John Frankenheimer's otherwise effective new thriller,
``Reindeer Games,'' he's vaguely likable, but he's outshone by his
co-stars and never particularly believable in his role. As
entertaining as it is, the film fails to be much of a star vehicle
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck plays Rudy, a convict in a high-security Michigan prison
doing time for grand theft auto who _ two days before his release _
is attacked by another con but is saved when his cellmate, Nick
(James Frain), takes the knife-thrust intended for him.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets out, he meets Nick's pen-pal girlfriend, Ashley
(Charlize Theron). Since she's gorgeous and knows Nick only from
his love letters, Rudy takes on his identity and becomes her lover
_ intending to eventually tell her the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out Ashley has a homicidally malevolent brother
(Gary Sinise) who has learned from Nick's letters that he was once
a security guard at an Indian reservation casino, so Rudy finds
himself pressed into the brother's gang and forced to help them in
a heist at the casino.
</P>
<P>
   As all this segues into a labyrinth of plot twists and crosses
and double-crosses, it never rises to the level of the great
Frankenheimer suspense classics of the '60s (``Manchurian
Candidate,'' ``Seconds''), but the old pro still manages to keep us
positioned well on the edge of our seats.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer also does well with the blistering action
sequences _ his real forte _ and the Elmore Leonard-ish dialogue
(by Ehren Kruger, who wrote ``Arlington Road''), and he gets a
high-octane performance from Sinise, and an even better one from
Theron, who is magnetic and credible in every scene.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck is sporadically effective, but he never soars in the
role. He mugs for the camera, his aura is not strong enough to
carry the movie, and he seems miscast: so clean-cut that his
character would be much more believable as the student body
president of Brigham Young University than as a scheming,
streetwise ex-con.
</P>
<P>
   Reindeer Games. Directed by John Frankenheimer. Written by Ehren
Kruger. Cast: Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise, Charlize Theron. Dimension
Films. 100 minutes. Rated R for violence, nudity and sex scenes.

<P>
   George W. Bush trounced John McCain by a margin of more than two
to one among self-identified Republicans in Michigan Tuesday _ and
lost the primary. How? Independents and Democrats flooded the
contest. They outnumbered self-identified Republicans and voted
overwhelmingly for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says these newcomers aren't real or potential Republicans;
McCain says they are. So the Bush-McCain race has come down to
this: What does it mean to be a Republican?
</P>
<P>
   Some political reporters haven't thought about this question,
others don't understand it, and most of the rest don't care.
They've been trained to report who's up and who's down, not why it
matters.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bush argued that ``Republicans overwhelmingly supported
my candidacy'' in Michigan, reporters brushed it off as post-defeat
spin. Yes, the media are covering McCain's poor showing among
self-identified Republicans, but only insofar as it affects the
horse race. They don't understand that the Bush-McCain war will
determine not just which candidate represents the GOP, but what
he's representing.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of the primaries so far _ Bush winning the
Republican faithful, McCain winning independents and Democrats _
raises one of life's oldest and deepest questions: How far will you
change who you are to get what you want?
</P>
<P>
   How many nose jobs, face lifts and breast augmentations will you
endure to attract a husband? How many colleagues will you step on
or manipulate to win a promotion? How many cigarettes will you
smoke and how many classes will you cut to fit in with the cool
kids? At what point along the road to success does the person who
is succeeding cease to be you?
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he can restore the presidency to the GOP by
attracting independents and Democrats. In his victory speech
Tuesday night, he promised to ``make our party bigger and change
politics in this country for generations. Don't fear this campaign,
my fellow Republicans. Join it. ... This is where you belong: the
Republicans who practice the politics of addition over the politics
of division. We are creating a new majority, my friends _ a McCain
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ``politics of addition'' isn't that simple. Each time a
political, social or economic organization adds new and different
members, it loses a bit of its old identity. When a family grows by
birth or marriage, it changes. When America Online acquires Time
Warner, it changes. When the United States welcomes immigrants who
speak other languages, it changes.
</P>
<P>
   At what point is AOL no longer AOL? At what point is the United
States no longer the United States? At what point is the GOP no
longer the GOP?
</P>
<P>
   These questions can't simply be dismissed as narrow-minded. They
require philosophical answers: What does it mean to be an Internet
company, an American, or a Republican _ McCain prefers debt
reduction and long-term Medicare solvency to tax cuts. He assails
tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Lately he has spent most of his time in the Senate trying to ban
unregulated political donations and to force tobacco companies to
pay a huge fine that would oblige them to raise cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
   How far do these crusades and policies bend the definition of
the GOP? How many Republicans are prepared to change the party to
accommodate McCain, and how many of his heresies are they willing
to absorb?
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wins the nomination and the presidency, he will change
the GOP at least as dramatically as Bill Clinton changed the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would define fiscal conservatism in terms of reducing the
size of government. McCain would define it in terms of balancing
the budget. Bush would emphasize tax cuts. McCain would emphasize
tax ``fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   When vacancies open on the Supreme Court, Bush would need to
maintain his base among Christian conservatives. McCain would need
to maintain his base among libertarian independents.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush would confine the use of American power abroad to
``American interests,'' McCain would extend it to an ambitious
agenda of ``rogue-state rollback.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals don't understand why McCain scares so many Republicans.
The New York Times, for example, chides Bush for ``belittling''
McCain's ``gift for inclusiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, when Clinton was attracting supporters of the
death penalty, the Times saw it as a betrayal of principle rather
than a ``gift for inclusiveness.'' But that's the difference
between your principle and the other guy's.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have every right to shrink in mortal terror from the
prospect of a McCain presidency. The question before them is not
whether they will absorb the ``McCain majority'' but whether it
will absorb them.

determine not just which candidate represents the GOP, but what
he's representing.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of the primaries so far _ Bush winning the
Republican faithful, McCain winning independents and Democrats _
raises one of life's oldest and deepest questions: How far will you
change who you are to get what you want?
</P>
<P>
   How many nose jobs, face lifts and breast augmentations will you
endure to attract a husband? How many colleagues will you step on
or manipulate to win a promotion? How many cigarettes will you
smoke and how many classes will you cut to fit in with the cool
kids? At what point along the road to success does the person who
is succeeding cease to be you?
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he can restore the presidency to the GOP by
attracting independents and Democrats. In his victory speech
Tuesday night, he promised to ``make our party bigger and change
politics in this country for generations. Don't fear this campaign,
my fellow Republicans. Join it. ... This is where you belong: the
Republicans who practice the politics of addition over the politics
of division. We are creating a new majority, my friends _ a McCain
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ``politics of addition'' isn't that simple. Each time a
political, social or economic organization adds new and different
members, it loses a bit of its old identity. When a family grows by
birth or marriage, it changes. When America Online acquires Time
Warner, it changes. When the United States welcomes immigrants who
speak other languages, it changes.
</P>
<P>
   At what point is AOL no longer AOL? At what point is the United
States no longer the United States? At what point is the GOP no
longer the GOP?
</P>
<P>
   These questions can't simply be dismissed as narrow-minded. They
require philosophical answers: What does it mean to be an Internet
company, an American, or a Republican _ McCain prefers debt
reduction and long-term Medicare solvency to tax cuts. He assails
tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Lately he has spent most of his time in the Senate trying to ban
unregulated political donations and to force tobacco companies to
pay a huge fine that would oblige them to raise cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
   How far do these crusades and policies bend the definition of
the GOP? How many Republicans are prepared to change the party to
accommodate McCain, and how many of his heresies are they willing
to absorb?
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wins the nomination and the presidency, he will change
the GOP at least as dramatically as Bill Clinton changed the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would define fiscal conservatism in terms of reducing the
size of government. McCain would define it in terms of balancing
the budget. Bush would emphasize tax cuts. McCain would emphasize
tax ``fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   When vacancies open on the Supreme Court, Bush would need to
maintain his base among Christian conservatives. McCain would need
to maintain his base among libertarian independents.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush would confine the use of American power abroad to
``American interests,'' McCain would extend it to an ambitious
agenda of ``rogue-state rollback.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals don't understand why McCain scares so many Republicans.
The New York Times, for example, chides Bush for ``belittling''
McCain's ``gift for inclusiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, when Clinton was attracting supporters of the
death penalty, the Times saw it as a betrayal of principle rather
than a ``gift for inclusiveness.'' But that's the difference
between your principle and the other guy's.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have every right to shrink in mortal terror from the
prospect of a McCain presidency. The question before them is not
whether they will absorb the ``McCain majority'' but whether it
will absorb them.

 `THE CLOSER YOU GET': WANTED: AMERICAN SWFs WITH A THIRST FOR(Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Lush green fields ... tiny villages by the sea.'' The young
narrator of ``The Closer You Get'' is dutiful enough to keep the
boredom out of his voice, but the theater will fill with tired
sighs from the audiences attending another high-concept Irish
Spring comedy _ collect 'em all! _ from the folks at Fox
Searchlight.
</P>
<P>
   After the success of ``The Full Monty'' and the, er, release of
``Waking Ned Devine,'' apparently someone felt that the hunger for
comedy featuring pale, badly dressed, hearty men clutching pints of
stout hadn't quite been satisfied yet.
</P>
<P>
   So fill your eyes with ``The Closer You Get'' _ from the
producer of ``The Full Monty'' _ where the blarney's as high as an
elephant's eye. Where the men of a seaside town, bored and
impatient over their lack of prospects with women, decide to place
an ad in an American newspaper in hopes of attracting babes from
the States.
</P>
<P>
   The men prepare for the anticipated onslaught of American women
in different ways. Kieran (Ian Hart), the town butcher, dyes his
hair an iridescent blond generally seen only in the World Wrestling
Federation or on a Dixie Chicks tour. He trumpets his new
sophistication to his assistant, Siobhan (Cathleen Bradley), who
loves him. But he's blind to her affection; no doubt his pupils are
still smarting from his hair dye.
</P>
<P>
   Siobhan deduces that turnabout is fair play and invites a pack
of swaggering virile Spaniards, who apparently double as the Gipsy
Kings in their off time, to play the town dance. Only then does
Kieran realize that he loves _ oh, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   It's a little funny that after Kieran is punched by one of the
Spaniards, his bloody nose matches his red velvet suit. It's the
closest he's come to achieving the fashion synchronicity he's been
bragging about all along, and the film misses a chance to get a
joke out of it.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few times an opportunity for corny, predictable
humor is squandered. This underpopulated burg has more winsome gags
than inhabitants. For example, when Father Hubert (Risteard Cooper)
orders up ``The Ten Commandments'' for a showing at the tiny church
and, instead, ``10'' unspools on the screen. (``The Red Sea,''
someone cracks as Bo Derek lolls in the surf with Dudley Moore.)
This happens after he decides to replace the church bells with a
tape recording of ringing.
</P>
<P>
   Later Hubert compares dating to buying a new suit. When he
starts going on about ``slipping in and out of new suits'' and
``silky fabrics against your skin,'' you want to applaud the actors
for not rolling their eyes so far back they pass out.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a little girl trains her brown eyes on her mother
and asks, ``How long before I have breasts?,'' you may bite your
lip in hopes that the film won't last long enough for that to
happen, although it certainly feels that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Closer You Get'' is so relentlessly adorable that the
Irish accents lose their charm, and much sooner than you'd think. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The Closer You Get' is rated PG-13 (parents strongly
cautioned). It includes a bit of randy language and stereotypical
stout-drinking fests. &QL;

SOFTBANK CORP. WINS RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE FOR JAPAN'S NIPPON CREDIT
BANK

 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A group led by Softbank Corp., the global Goliath of
Internet-related investment, on Thursday won the exclusive right to
negotiate for the acquisition of Nippon Credit Bank, one of two
failed banks nationalized by the government in the depths of
Japan's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Nippon Credit, which has long served the political
establishment here, to a nonfinancial company that thrives outside
Japan's insular network of bureaucrats, big business and banks has
the most far-reaching implications for the Japanese banking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an overall viewpoint, this is very exciting,'' said Dean
A. Yoost, the partner in charge of the financial services practice
at PriceWaterhouse Coopers in Tokyo. ``It is clear evidence that
things are changing in Japan and that banking, which we have long
thought of as a traditional, stodgy environment, is now becoming
something more open and dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential deal is in some ways more startling than the sale
last summer of Long-Term Credit Bank, the other, larger
nationalized bank, to a group led by Ripplewood Holdings , at the
time a little known U.S. investment firm. The sale to Ripplewood
marked the first time a Japanese bank had been purchased by a
foreign investment group. Unlike Ripplewood, however, Softbank is a
total nonfinancial entrant in the clubby world of Japanese banking.
</P>
<P>
   The Softbank-led group intends to spend 101 billion yen, roughly
$907 million at current exchange rates, to buy and recapitalize
Nippon Credit, which collapsed in 1998 with 3.98 trillion yen, or
$36.2 billion, worth of bad loans. The government has since
disposed of most of those loans.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale goes through, the Softbank group intends to break
the mold of Japanese banking by redirecting Nippon Credit's lending
to high-risk, entrepreneurial businesses seeking to capitalize on
the information technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will use that same technology to teach Japanese
borrowers and depositors the virtue of Internet-based banking, thus
establishing a much leaner cost structure than its more traditional
competitors. Nippon Credit's relatively few branch offices make an
online strategy even more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans alone could force Japan's lumbering banks to
intensify their own reform efforts. They must also contend with the
entrance of companies like Sony Corp. and Itoyokado, a major
retailer, which have applied for banking licenses in an effort to
exploit the vast opportunities to provide banking services to
average consumers long shunned by Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This presents a good opportunity for the traditional banks
that want to be winners to accelerate the speed of their
restructuring and reconsider their competitiveness anew,'' said
Setsuko Akiba, a banking analyst at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such pressure comes against the backdrop of signs that Japan's
banks, many of them still struggling with mountains of bad loans,
have stalled in their efforts to change their lending practices and
become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The government itself has intervened recently to slow the
progress of bank reform. It has been propping up weak banks rather
than forcing them to close. And it has postponed a plan to limit
deposit insurance, which would have caused a dramatic customer
shift to strong banks.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sense that the drive to draw foreigners into the
banking system has lost momentum since last summer, when the
government chose Ripplewood to purchase the Long-Term Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
   That sale was hotly contested, with the head of the Financial
Reconstruction Commission, Hakuo Yanagisawa, supporting Ripplewood
and a battalion of politicians offering their opposition.
Yanagisawa won because the only alternative would have been to sell
Long-Term Credit to two relatively weak Japanese financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa lost his job when the Cabinet was shuffled last
October and was replaced by Michio Ochi, a former bureaucrat turned
politician and widely regarded as less aggressive about reform.
</P>
<P>
   But in awarding the negotiating rights to buy Nippon Credit,
Ochi was in some ways forced to make an even more remarkable choice
than his predecessor. There were only two bidders for Nippon Credit
_ the other was Cerberus Partners, a U.S. investment fund that
specializes in buying distressed assets.
</P>
<P>
   Cerberus faced deep opposition from politicians, a person with
knowledge of the dealings said. They did not want another Japanese
financial institution purchased by foreigners, although Cerberus
had promised to strengthen the bank and take it public in a stock
offering, thereby returning it to Japanese hands.
</P>
<P>
   So the regulators were left with one choice, a group of
impressive investors headed by a nonfinancial Japanese company that
has made risky bets on Internet start-ups and carries a speculative
grade investment rating.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Softbank's investment goals is to build a system for
financing young companies often neglected by traditional financial
institutions in Asia in general and Japan in particular. Softbank
has itself provided seed money for roughly 120 ventures related to
the Internet, including those in insurance, online securities
trading and leasing.
</P>
<P>
   It recently teamed with Lehman Brothers to create an online bond
trading business. Softbank is also working with the National
Association of Securities Dealers to establish Nasdaq Japan, which
is expected to attract companies like the ones Softbank has
invested in.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing concentration of financial power in Softbank's
hands is starting to raise questions about whether Softbank is
getting too big.
</P>
<P>
   Masayoshi Son, Softbank's founder and a pioneer of the online
world, often refers to the disparate collection of companies that
comprise Softbank as a ``net batsu,'' a play on ``zaibatsu,'' an
old Japanese term that refers to agglomerations of businesses
clustered around a bank that provides all their financing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Such arrangements historically helped to suppress the
development of a competitive banking market in Japan. Some analysts
fear Softbank's move into banking could prove to be a modern
version of this same relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is vital that they quickly establish a fire wall between
the bank's lending decisions and its management and the aims and
aspirations of its largest shareholder, i.e., Softbank,'' said J.
Brian Waterhouse, the senior banking analyst at HSBC Securities in
Tokyo. ``It is going to require very strict controls to ensure that
a situation doesn't arise wherein this bank is being used as a
virtual piggybank for its owner.''

   INSURGENT-CANDIDATES (Seattle) _ If the nation's capital didn't
exist, insurgent presidential candidates such as John McCain and

independents, quickly shifting partisan alliances and the high-tech
economy make this fertile ground for the anti-establishment
candidates. By CRAGG HINES.

   PRIMARIES-TURNOUT (Washington) _ At a time when election experts
bemoan low turnout in recent elections, the candidacy of Sen. John
McCain has driven up the numbers of voters taking part in
primaries. Much like Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, McCain is
drawing voters who otherwise might not cast ballots. Will such
voters' interest last into the general election? Yes, some experts
say, if McCain manages to stay in the race. By DAN FREEDMAN.

   GORE-BRADLEY (Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.) _ Al Gore picks up a key
environmental endorsement as opponent Bill Bradley continues to
hammer him for his conservative record that Bradley says was out of
step with Democratic primary voters. At a scenic site at the edge
of the Hudson River in Westchester County, Gore, who has worked
hard over the years to polish his environmental credentials,
receives the support of the New York League of Conservation Voters.
By BENNETT ROTH.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-GOP (Austin, Texas) _ Susan Weddington, the chairwoman of
the Republican Party in Texas, calls Arizona Sen. John McCain a
``home wrecker'' for reaching out to Democrats and independents in
his bid to defeat Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the Republican
presidential nomination. Drawing heavily on independent and
moderate voters in the North and Northeast, McCain has so far
foiled Bush's march to the nomination. By PEGGY FIKAC.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scott Webb moved to Atlanta expecting ``to be rich
and have a lavish lifestyle,'' his mother told a Senate
subcommittee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her 30-year-old son plunged deeper into debt and
depression before being shot to death by a fellow day trader, said
Alyce Wenzel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of my son continues to haunt me today,'' said Wenzel,
testifying at a hearing at which senators suggested tighter
regulation may be needed to control the fast-paced stock
speculation known as day trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew as much back then about this practice as I do
now,'' Wenzel told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, ``because I would have done everything within my
power to keep Scott from getting involved in day trading in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb was among nine people killed last July 29 by Mark Barton, a
disturbed day trader. Barton killed himself later that day as
police approached his car at a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy highlighted the computer-driven practice of day
trading _ buying and selling stocks within minutes to try to profit
from small fluctuations in price. An investigation by the
subcommittee found that most day traders lose money, while day
trading firms make huge profits from commissions on their
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day trading firms we investigated charged an average
commission of $16 per trade,'' said subcommittee chairwoman Susan
Collins, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The average day trader executes about 29 trades per day, and
thus has to make $450 every day just to break even. Not
surprisingly, most don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best evidence suggests that a significant majority of all
day traders _ more than 75 percent _ lose money,'' said Collins.
She said, ``I believe day trading can be fairly compared to certain
types of gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 15 day trading firms examined by subcommittee
investigators had aggregate revenues of more than $541 million in
1999 and aggregate profits of about $144 million. The revenues of
these firms grew by 276 percent from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of proposing a ban on day trading,''
Collins said. ``But if day trading firms fail to disclose the risks
and entice unsophisticated investors with misleading ads or
exaggerated claims of profitability, regulators _ and the industry
_ must put a stop to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Webb was among thousands of Americans who saw day trading
as the solution to financial problems. Before moving to Atlanta
from the Midwest, he had lost jobs with Enterprise Rent-a-Car and
Dean Witter, the financial brokerage. His credit record was such
that his father had to co-sign a car loan. To open a trading
account with Momentum Securities Inc. in Atlanta, Webb borrowed
$30,000 from his father, Roy Webb, and another $30,000 from a
Momentum customer to whom he promised to pay 18 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son lost money from the beginning,'' Wenzel said. ``His
girlfriend described him as depressed often about his financial
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering his financial failings, she testified that she was
amazed to learn that ``he was hired by Momentum to train other
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Hoehn, the branch manager of Momentum Securities in
Atlanta, testified that Webb had portrayed his financial situation
differently, mentioning income from a trust fund and rental
property. Momentum now requires day traders to initially deposit at
least $50,000 and show a minimum net worth of $100,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time his friend and roommate Webb began trading, Hoehn
explained, the requirements were more ``circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoehn, who was out of the office when the shooting occurred,
said he did not know how much Webb had lost day trading, but that
his account contained about $20,000 on the day of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses told the subcommittee that they were
ill-prepared for day trading and never informed of the substantial
risks. They all lost money.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee investigation found that ``many firms allow _
and even encourage _ unsuitable customers to day trade,'' said
Deborah Field, an attorney with the Securities and Exchange
Commission who led the probe. But these actions are mostly ``under
current regulatory framework _ entirely legal,'' she said.

 &HT;    DAY TRADING FIRMS PROFIT WHILE MOST CUSTOMERS LOSE, SENATE FINDS
 &HT;    With DAY-TRADING-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    With photos.

   WASHINGTON _ Scott Webb moved to Atlanta expecting ``to be rich
and have a lavish lifestyle,'' his mother told a Senate
subcommittee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her 30-year-old son plunged deeper into debt and
depression before being shot to death by a fellow day trader, said
Alyce Wenzel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of my son continues to haunt me today,'' said Wenzel,
testifying at a hearing at which senators suggested tighter
regulation may be needed to control the fast-paced stock
speculation known as day trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew as much back then about this practice as I do
now,'' Wenzel told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, ``because I would have done everything within my
power to keep Scott from getting involved in day trading in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb was among nine people killed last July 29 by Mark Barton, a
disturbed day trader. Barton killed himself later that day as
police approached his car at a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy highlighted the computer-driven practice of day
trading _ buying and selling stocks within minutes to try to profit
from small fluctuations in price. An investigation by the
subcommittee found that most day traders lose money, while day
trading firms make huge profits from commissions on their
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day trading firms we investigated charged an average
commission of $16 per trade,'' said subcommittee chairwoman Susan
Collins, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The average day trader executes about 29 trades per day, and
thus has to make $450 every day just to break even. Not
surprisingly, most don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best evidence suggests that a significant majority of all
day traders _ more than 75 percent _ lose money,'' said Collins.
She said, ``I believe day trading can be fairly compared to certain
types of gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 15 day trading firms examined by subcommittee
investigators had aggregate revenues of more than $541 million in
1999 and aggregate profits of about $144 million. The revenues of
these firms grew by 276 percent from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of proposing a ban on day trading,''
Collins said. ``But if day trading firms fail to disclose the risks
and entice unsophisticated investors with misleading ads or
exaggerated claims of profitability, regulators _ and the industry
_ must put a stop to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Webb was among thousands of Americans who saw day trading
as the solution to financial problems. Before moving to Atlanta
from the Midwest, he had lost jobs with Enterprise Rent-a-Car and
Dean Witter, the financial brokerage. His credit record was such
that his father had to co-sign a car loan. To open a trading
account with Momentum Securities Inc. in Atlanta, Webb borrowed
$30,000 from his father, Roy Webb, and another $30,000 from a
Momentum customer to whom he promised to pay 18 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son lost money from the beginning,'' Wenzel said. ``His
girlfriend described him as depressed often about his financial
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering his financial failings, she testified that she was
amazed to learn that ``he was hired by Momentum to train other
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Hoehn, the branch manager of Momentum Securities in
Atlanta, testified that Webb had portrayed his financial situation
differently, mentioning income from a trust fund and rental
property. Momentum now requires day traders to initially deposit at
least $50,000 and show a minimum net worth of $100,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time his friend and roommate Webb began trading, Hoehn
explained, the requirements were more ``circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoehn, who was out of the office when the shooting occurred,
said he did not know how much Webb had lost day trading, but that
his account contained about $20,000 on the day of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses told the subcommittee that they were
ill-prepared for day trading and never informed of the substantial
risks. They all lost money.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee investigation found that ``many firms allow _
and even encourage _ unsuitable customers to day trade,'' said
Deborah Field, an attorney with the Securities and Exchange
Commission who led the probe. But these actions are mostly ``under
current regulatory framework _ entirely legal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The top officers of four day trading companies _ Momentum
Securities, Providential Securities, All-Tech Direct _ and
officials from federal agencies and the securities industry are
scheduled to testify Friday before the subcommittee.

`CLAIRE DOLAN': A WOMAN WHO NEEDS A NEW JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Lodge Kerrigan's elegantly gloomy film ``Claire Dolan,''
Midtown Manhattan is a forest of chilly glass towers whose
inhabitants gaze forlornly through floor-to-ceiling windows at
other glass towers in which only a few fitful stirrings of human
activity can be glimpsed.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scenes, in which the camera methodically surveys the
geometry of the architecture, establish a mood of glum urban
alienation that recalls certain 1960s European art films (and
several more recent Taiwanese films) that equated modernism with
sterility and anomie.
</P>
<P>
   The decor inside those towers is as spare and functional as
their facades. There are no signs of the glamorous interiors that
became popular in the upper echelons of corporate America during
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's title character, played with a quiet, smoldering
intensity by Katrin Cartlidge (an actress memorable for her
performances in Mike Leigh's ``Naked'' and Lars Von Triers'
``Breaking the Waves''), is an Irish immigrant who works as a
prostitute, servicing business executives in their offices and
hotel suites.
</P>
<P>
   Grim and unsmiling, Claire dispenses her favors with a cold,
mechanical self-possession. More than once one of her clients tells
her she is a ``very beautiful woman.'' But Cartlidge, with her
closely set dark eyes, thin lips and air of guarded
self-containment, is just one step away from being plain.
</P>
<P>
   Furnished with little more than a bed and a telephone answering
machine, Claire's apartment in an anonymous Manhattan high-rise
mirrors the minimalism of the offices she visits. Strangely, she
hasn't bothered to acquire the accouterments or the seductive
manners of a high-priced prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   She dresses neatly but drably. Beyond regaling regular clients
on the telephone with insincere romantic flattery
(anachronistically, she doesn't use a cell phone or a beeper but
relies on public pay phones when out of the house), she discharges
her tasks without the usual teasing wiles. When affronted by a
client, she gives as good as she gets, lashing out with a bitter,
venomous fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claire Dolan'' is the second feature film by Kerrigan, whose
impressive, scary debut, ``Clean, Shaven,'' went about far as a
movie could go in entering the consciousness of a schizophrenic
man. ``Claire Dolan,'' like ``Clean, Shaven,'' is also largely an
interior landscape, but one numbed with dread and cauterized
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is deliberately cagey in giving out information about
Claire. We meet her pimp, Roland Cain (Colm Meaney), who has known
her since she was an adolescent in Dublin and who brought her to
the United States. Claire has been selling her body to pay off a
sizable debt to him, but the whys and wherefores of their
arrangement are never revealed. Nor are we ever given an insight
into their relationship, although Roland obviously hates her. (Does
he have any other women working for him? The movie doesn't say.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bleakness of her circumstances, Claire isn't
entirely anesthetized. In the movie's early scenes, she is
devastated by the death of her mother (Muriel Maida) from cancer.
And when she meets and falls in love with Elton Garrett (Vincent
D'Onofrio), a rough-edged cabdriver who has his own heavy personal
baggage, the relationship that develops is intensely passionate.
</P>
<P>
   The story, such as it is, follows Claire's attempts to extricate
herself from the life she has been leading by paying off her debt,
establishing a relationship (she longs for a child) and eventually
fleeing New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie devotes so much of its energy to building and
sustaining a mood of urban desolation that the story never quite
jells. Especially toward the end of the film, there are huge,
frustrating gaps in the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cartlidge's beautifully still performance, mournful one
moment, defiant the next, lets you see into Claire's soul without
editorializing or begging for our empathy. If only the movie had
done a better job of connecting the dots of her life, ``Claire
Dolan,'' which opens Friday in New York and inaugurates the new
quarterly American Independent Visions series, would be a fully
realized film. &QL;

`NOT OF THIS WORLD': SOULS LOST AND FOUND CONNECTED BY A NEWBORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We are not called upon to do great tasks, but everyday
tasks,'' Mother Superior (Sonia Gessner) tells her young nuns in
her even, unruffled tone. In ``Not of This World,'' it is sometimes
a great task to get through the everyday.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in this loamy soap opera seems slightly depressed _
even Sister Caterina (Margherita Buy), the focus of most of the
film. She is roused from her commitment to God and the church when
a jogger (Stefano Abbati) stops long enough to light up a smoke and
hand her a newborn boy that he found on his run.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Giuseppe Piccioni, shows an eye for small details,
grace notes that can give a scene a memorable touch. When it comes
to fashioning a larger context, though, he is more interested in
pouring on an old-world melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   Piccioni's film wants to ruminate on faith and family as well as
dance with ambiguity. Most of the characters are estranged from
conventional families and try to create familial bonds outside the
boundaries of home.
</P>
<P>
   When Caterina tries to explain why she decides to move out of
her mother's home _ ``I've made a choice to be near God,'' she
explains _ her mother (Giuliana Lojodice) snorts, ``There's always
something more important than your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Caterina is a little older than the other novices. Her path to
the convent probably was not as clear-cut as it was for the younger
women; it has taken her a while to get there. The cost of
spiritually tithing herself to her faith can be seen in her face.
And that faith is shaken as she gets closer to the infant. She
visits him every day in the hospital, and her remote mask softens
each time she lays eyes on the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant in the film's minor mystery concerning the
baby's paternity is Ernesto (Silvio Orlando), the owner of a
laundry and dry cleaner, a doughy sad sack so enraptured of
depression that he can't even remember the names of the bright-eyed
young women who work for him. He treats them all very well, but he
pines for something.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto may be the father of the little boy, whose young mother,
Teresa (Carolina Freschi), yearns for completion like Ernesto.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's Ernesto looks a little like the British comic actor
Peter Sellers and he wrings a bit of humor out of his lost-soul
demeanor, although he is used as an object of sympathy, as is
almost everything in the film. (Ernesto accuses the withholding
Caterina of lacking in feeling; she is the character ``not of this
world.'')
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens Friday in Manhattan, is a wisp of a
weeper, a talky anachronism in these days of South American
novellas and Pedro Almodovar's flights of moistened heartbreak. The
characters spend more time talking about their feelings than they
do showing them.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome score, which at times mourns for the cast, and the
vivacious cinematography add a little life. It all builds toward a
melodrama of modest ambitions, too proud to be shameless _ perhaps
not realizing that soap opera and good taste may be one of the
least appealing of contrasts. &QL;

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Benjamin Bratt
with Madonna in a scene from ``The Next Best Thing.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's every man's fantasy: At night you come home to Hollywood's
reigning female superstar _ and she's as crazy about you as you are
about her. And every morning you go off to work ... kissing
Madonna.
 &HT;    Yes, Benjamin Bratt is having a good time these days. Best known
as one of the most popular stars of television's ``Law and Order,''
he stars opposite Madonna and Rupert Everett in ``The Next Best
Thing,'' which will open March 3. Offscreen, his leading lady is no
less than Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    The movie, Bratt's first major big-screen role, casts him as the
odd man out in an unusual family relationship: He's in love with
Madonna, but she lives with her gay best friend (Everett), raising
their baby together.
 &HT;    Everett, himself openly gay, was impressed with Bratt's aplomb
in handling the controversial story line.
 &HT;    ``Ben doesn't have the classic redneck kind of attitude about
his woman or about a gay man,'' the English actor says.
 &HT;    As for Bratt, it wasn't the script that impressed him as much as
Madonna herself.
 &HT;    ``During her first break she began doing yoga,'' he recalls.
``At one point she had her right foot over her left ear and her
left foot over her right ear, and then she went into this handstand
while her feet were still pretzeled behind her neck.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `That's some woman.'''
 &HT;    Sitting in a New York hotel, Bratt _ sporting a new, wispy
goatee _ is some man, devastatingly handsome in dark slacks and a
long-sleeved, cream-colored shirt. It's not hard to believe that
Madonna would be attracted to him _ or, for that matter, that
Roberts would.
 &HT;    Since he shot the film, he says, everyone's been asking him
about the Material Girl.
 &HT;    ``She is witty, definitely sarcastic, she keeps you on your toes
and she's much prettier in person,'' Bratt says.
 &HT;    ``Someone asked me if she's a good kisser,'' he adds. ``I said,
`Well, it's a safe bet she is. She's never had any complaints.'''
 &HT;    Of course, his relationship with Madonna ended when the camera
stopped. His relationship with Roberts is far more complex, because
it takes place in the real world.
 &HT;    One minute, Bratt recalls, he was fairly anonymous, blending in
with the ``Law and Order'' ensemble as the sensitive Detective
Reynaldo ``Rey'' Curtis. The next moment, his every move was a
magnet to an army of paparazzi.
 &HT;    The actor, one of five children of a single, divorced mother of
Peruvian extraction, says that bringing Roberts home to meet the
folks in San Francisco was an experience worthy of Roberts' recent
movie-star-in-love film, ``Notting Hill'' (1999).
 &HT;    ``Oh boy,'' he says. ``On some level it was initially surreal
for them _ how could it not be? It's a great a tribute to Julia
that, after the first 10 minutes, her real down-to-earth nature
comes out, and I don't think there's any more thought about having
a star sitting in the kitchen.
 &HT;    ``When all is said and done,'' Bratt says, ``she is extremely
bright, beautiful _ a star, but a down-to-earth, simple woman, and
very accessible. I'm really thankful that she and my family got on
so well together _ I get along with her family, too.''
 &HT;    The real problems arise not in their private lives but in the
public arena, the actor says.
 &HT;    ``The worst is when you are traveling through Europe, and you're
in a hotel and you think you're enjoying your privacy,'' he says.
``Then you see someone's head pop behind a fence with a lens, being
followed by a camera-toting paparazzi.
 &HT;    ``We're not really hassled by people,'' he adds. ``Walking on
the streets of New York or any other city in America, there's
almost an invisible bubble that's created around us. People are
respectful. When they do break that bubble, it's mostly done in a
complimentary way, not fanatical.''
 &HT;    Actually, he says, dating a superstar is almost a no-win
proposition.
 &HT;    ``You get a better seat in a restaurant. It stops there,'' he
says. ``Actually, otherwise it becomes a bit of a nuisance. There's
a huge tradeoff with this kind of visibility. You lose one of your
God-given rights of privacy. That's something I hold very, very
dear and close to me, and when that gets invaded I feel threatened
and defensive about it.
 &HT;    ``But I'm learning it's part of the situation, and I have to
practice patience.''
 &HT;    Roberts, of course, is used to the limelight, and Bratt tries to
emulate her serenity in the face of its onslaught.
 &HT;    ``She knows how to handle it,'' he says. ``The only advice she's
ever given me is `No matter what you do, smile.'''
 &HT;    The constant media attention, usually accompanied by speculation
as to the state of their relationship and its future, doesn't
matter to him, the actor says.
 &HT;    ``I'm not daunted by all that stuff,'' he says. ``How we get
along with each other is what counts to us ... We are two extremely
normal _ and you can put quotes around normal _ individuals outside
of the craziness of this celebrity that she is exposed to.
 &HT;    ``And we relate like most normal couples,'' he adds. ``I'm sure
of it. We're not partygoers _ in the two and half years we've been
together, we can probably count on two hands the number of times
we've been out socially to premieres or things of that nature.
 &HT;    ``We're both homebodies,'' the actor adds with a laugh. ``We
have a close circle of friends and family that are dear to us. We
enjoy being together, going to a lot of films and going out to
dinner.''
 &HT;    Speaking of films, Bratt left ``Law and Order'' last year to
pursue a film career, and the early indications are that the gamble
has paid off. Besides ``The Next Best Thing,'' he's completed ``The
Last Producer,'' an independent feature co-starring Burt Reynolds,
and has recently returned from Australia, where he shot the
science-fiction epic ``Red Planet,'' which co-stars Val Kilmer, Tom
Sizemore and Terence Stamp.
 &HT;    ``It's one of those big blockbuster movies, about the first
manned mission to Mars,'' he says. ``I'm an action hero of sorts.
They have plans to make a doll, so I guess that makes me an action
hero.''

   The Path To a `Psycho'
</P>
<P>
   Edward R. Pressman has been living with ``American Psycho'' for
eight years, ever since Stuart Gordon, the director of the
``Re-Animator'' films, gave him a copy of Brett Easton Ellis'
notorious best seller in 1992. ``I remember it vividly because I
was reading the book at my home in the Hollywood Hills, and I could
see downtown in the distance,'' Pressman said. ``It was ablaze, the
sky was bright with fire, and on TV people were lugging away
television sets and air-conditioners.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the height of the Los Angeles riots. ``It was a
very impressionable period,'' he said. ``So I bought the rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Pressman, an independent producer based in New York
whose films include ``Badlands,'' ``Sisters'' and ``The Crow,''
that was only the beginning of the long process that led to the
premiere of ``American Psycho'' at the Sundance Film Festival last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart wanted to do a real X-rated version, black and white,
very hard-core and very true to the novel,'' Pressman said. ``I
felt that was a very difficult challenge to make work, and I
started to explore other ways to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other writers and directors came and went, he said, including
David Cronenberg, Oliver Stone, Rob Weiss and Ellis himself, whose
script, ``was completely pornographic and ended with a musical
number.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I saw `I Shot Andy Warhol' and set up a meeting with the
director, Mary Harron,'' Pressman said. ``She was very interested
in tackling it and thought she could find a solution to the script,
which she would do with Guinivere Turner. She reduced the
pornographic and physically disgusting elements in the book because
what she was really interested in was the social satire.''
</P>
<P>
   To play Patrick Bateman, the novel's serial-killing yuppie,
Harron had only one actor in mind: the former child star Christian
Bale (``Empire of the Sun'').
</P>
<P>
   But then an executive at Lion's Gate, the Canadian company that
had become Pressman's partner, sent the script to Leonardo
DiCaprio, red-hot from the success of ``Titanic.'' ``And lo and
behold,'' Pressman said, ``he responded, and said, `I love the
script and I want to do it.' No one, including Mary, took it too
seriously. But for a couple of months, Leonardo insisted that he
was going to do it but just wouldn't give a date. He never said no,
actually. Finally, after a couple of ultimatums, we said, `We've
got to go on and do it without you.' And so we went back to Mary,
and she was still committed to it. She stuck to what she thought
the film should be throughout all of this Hollywood madness. In the
end, she made the film she wanted to make, and we're all very happy
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, everybody but the Motion Picture Association of America,
which wanted to slap a commercially fatal NC-17 rating on the film.
Apparently it wasn't the sex or violence that disturbed the ratings
board, but a sequence in which Bale watches himself in the mirror
while sporting with two prostitutes. ``It's a scene about
self-absorption,'' Pressman said. ``If it were eliminated, it would
hurt the film significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, it won't be. On Tuesday, the association
granted the film an R rating after Harron agreed to shorten a few
explicit shots of sexual positions in the controversial sequence.
Pressman's long odyssey will reach an end on April 14, when
``American Psycho'' is scheduled for a wide release.
</P>
<P>
   School Days
</P>
<P>
   Once it was called ``Strike,'' and Miramax was supposed to
release it two summers ago. But this teen comedy, starring Kirsten
Dunst, Gaby Hoffman and Rachael Leigh Cook as boarding school girls
who take drastic measures to prevent their beloved institution from
going coed, never found a place on Miramax's crowded schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Now the film's writer and director, Sarah Kernochan, and
producer, Ira Deutchman, have persuaded Miramax to let them release
the film on their own. And Deutchman, an adjunct professor in the
graduate film division of Columbia University and a respected
veteran of the independent film movement, has found a different way
to tackle the complicated logistics and limited financing of a
genuinely independent release: he has made it into homework.
Posting notices on bulletin boards at Columbia and New York
University, Deutchman recruited graduate students in film and
business who wanted some hands-on experience in movie marketing.
</P>
<P>
   He and his apprentices have come up with a new title for the
film, a new ad campaign and a new marketing strategy that will use
the Internet and a network of prep school volunteers _ ``junior
marketeers,'' Deutchman calls them _ to attract the hard-to-reach
pre-teen female audience.
</P>
<P>
   At the weekly marketing meeting in Deutchman's office on Park
Avenue South, Kernochan passed out Chupa Chups lollipops to her
volunteer staff members (cigars are no longer the oral
gratification of choice in the movie business), all bright young
minds in their early 20s. One reported on the status of the
all-important Web site (www.alliwannado.com) and another on
attempts to secure sponsorship from one of the magazines for
teen-agers, while a third hoped to obtain free samples from the
manufacturers of Midol (a product that figures prominently in ``All
I Wanna Do'') to place in the goodie bags for the film's premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ```Their energy level reminds me of what it was like when we
were younger,'' Deutchman said. ``There's no fear; it's like, come
on, let's go, what's next, what do we do now?''
</P>
<P>
   What they need to do now is find a place for the premiere party,
persuade the film's stars to appear on MTV and book the film into
two more theaters in Manhattan for its March 24 debut. ``It's at
that stage now where it's time to get relentless,'' Deutchman
concluded, sending his foot soldiers out into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Awards &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A dark-horse candidate dominated the French Cesar Awards, the
Gallic equivalent of the Oscars, at Saturday's ceremony in Paris.
Beating popular favorites like Luc Besson's ``Jeanne d'Arc''
(called ``The Messenger'' during its brief U.S. release) and
Patrice Leconte's ``Girl on the Bridge'' was Tonie Marshall's
intimate comedy-drama ``Venus Beaute (Institut),'' which won four
awards, including best film and best director. Shown in last year's
Rendez-Vous With French Cinema series at Lincoln Center's Walter
Reade Theater, Marshall's film stars Natalie Baye as a lovelorn
beautician; it still does not have an American distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Viard was named best actress for her performance as a
woman suffering from breast cancer in Solveig Anspach's ``Haut les
Coeurs!,'' which can be seen in this year's edition of Rendez-Vous
on March 11 and 12.

HISTORICAL NOVEL BY TEXAN BEING TOUTED AS A CAN'T-MISS BESTSELLER
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ALAM0-REVIEW) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It seemed, for a long time, that Stephen
Harrigan was destined to be a talented writer whose books got
better reviews than sales.
</P>
<P>
   He has supported his wife and three daughters by writing
screenplays and magazine articles and by teaching. Their home in
Austin is comfortable, but wouldn't be mistaken for a mansion. The
51-year-old Harrigan's favorite accomplishment to date is earning
the respect of peers like Texas writers Jim Magnuson and Elizabeth
Crook, who praise him as a rare talent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Harrigan's circle of admirers could be expanding.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Knopf will publish ``The Gates of the Alamo,'' a
grandiose 577-page novel of the Texas revolution that centers on
the famous battle fought in San Antonio on March 6, 1836. The novel
took Harrigan eight years to write, sandwiched between the
screenwriting and magazine gigs that paid the mortgage and the
kids' college tuition. Advance reviews from publishing's most
prestigious periodicals go beyond raves: Publishers' Weekly calls
the book ``heart-stopping, realistic ... an artful depiction of a
certain time and place,'' while Kirkus judges Harrigan's opus ``as
fine a historical novel as any in recent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Knopf has ordered a 100,000-copy first printing, a sure sign the
publisher plans to put its full marketing force behind the book.
Harrigan, a writer with two of five previous titles already out of
print, is about to get the Stephen King/John Grisham kind of
publicity treatment. If ``The Gates of the Alamo'' makes it as
expected to the top of every bestseller list, if Harrigan and his
agent can parlay that success into a megabucks movie deal, then
middle-aged, unassuming Steve Harrigan may actually, finally,
become rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   Or the book could sell only in the thousands, and Harrigan could
remain a relative unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Harrigan says he can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all uncertain, out of my control,'' he says. ``The only
thing I'm sure of, I guess, is that I've wanted to write this book
about the Alamo for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Stephen Harrigan was 7 years old, living with his
parents in Abilene. That year, he recalls, Disney released ``Davy
Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier'' and, like kids everywhere,
Harrigan was mesmerized by actor Fess Parker fighting to the bitter
end at a movie-set Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, my parents took me to the real Alamo, and it was
just an epiphany,'' Harrigan says during lunch at an unpretentious
Mexican restaurant in north Austin. ``I still had the movie in my
head, that unforgettable ending, and to see the real ground where
it happened was overwhelming. It lodged in my imagination. By the
time I was 14 or 15 and wanted to be a writer, I thought some day I
would write a book about the Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan, a slight, balding man, grins as he recalls his
stumbling path to becoming an author.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to UT (Austin) and wandered through my time there
aimlessly with no educational goals,'' Harrigan says, his soft
voice almost drowned out by the clatter of utensils and buzz of
conversation from adjacent booths. ``I majored in English
literature because I wanted to be left alone to read. I graduated
in '71 and lingered in Austin, working in the school co-op and then
forming a one-man lawn-mowing company. I started trying to write
magazine articles, and eventually got one into Rolling Stone and
then a couple into the Texas Observer.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Monthly was starting up in Austin about the same time; in
1980, Harrigan joined the staff and stayed 10 years, earning a
reputation as a crack chronicler of Texas wildlife and outdoor
adventures. ``Aransas,'' his first novel, was published in 1980,
and established the pattern for his next books: It received good
reviews, sold a few thousand copies and went out of print.
</P>
<P>
   In ``1985 or so,'' Harrigan and a friend decided to try their
hand at a screenplay. ``Ocean of Storms'' was optioned by Sidney
Pollack, but has yet to be produced. Many other Harrigan
screenplays have; ``The Last of His Tribe,'' written for HBO,
garnered several awards. Recently, CBS broadcast Harrigan's
``Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder,'' and
he is currently completing a script about the late singer John
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   With regular screenplay assignments, magazine work and income
from teaching, Harrigan was financially comfortable. But his
favorite endeavor remained writing books, and there was always, in
the back of his mind, that one he wanted to write about the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to start working every day at 8:30 in the morning, and
keep going at least until 5 p.m.,'' Harrigan says, settling in
front of his word processor in the small, backyard guest house
that's been converted into his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason `The Gates of the Alamo' took me eight years was
that I never had more than one or two days in a row to work on it.
Finally I cleared out my schedule for a while so I could finish it.
But it seemed like it took me forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan first pitched an Alamo-themed novel to a publisher in
1990 ``as a book steeped in natural history, and with Jim Bowie and
Davy Crockett as protagonists. I started reading and thinking and
talking to Alamo historians. I realized right away there was a sort
of endless swamp in terms of knowledge I needed to amass. After a
while, the story just started to come out, not in a rush but
gradually, and after I got into it there was really nothing that I
had to go back and seriously reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Magnuson, director of the Texas Center for Writers at
UT-Austin and Harrigan's close friend, says he got his first
glimpse of the manuscript ``when it was about 100 pages long. You
could tell even then the book was going to be special. I thought
the world of Texas he was creating was unlike any I'd ever read
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan's Texas was populated by Indians and alligators and
boarding house owners and recognizably normal men, women and
children, as well as towering historical figures like Sam Houston
and Stephen F. Austin and Davy Crockett. Terrell Mott, the
fictional teen-aged boy who eventually finds himself in the middle
of the Alamo tussle, is human enough to soil himself when the first
bombardment begins; his mother, a widow, makes the mistake of
falling in love with a decent, but weak, botanist. The characters
in the book who resonate most are those least like the made-up
super-protagonists who populate most historical fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess because I'm smaller than life myself, I wanted
characters whose actions made sense to me, whose scale I could
identify with,'' Harrigan says. ``If I'd been alive in that time, I
wouldn't have been like Sam Houston or Travis. I would have been
some insignificant guy trying to live his life amid the
revolutionary chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   But in ``The Gates of the Alamo,'' Harrigan makes readers care
about the Motts, and about the Mexican soldiers under Santa Anna
and the Comanches being forced off their land by encroaching
settlers. Harrigan grew to love his own creations. One of the
book's final scenes has a key character dying in the arms of
someone who could have been, but never was, his lover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had trouble writing that, and for now, at least, I still
can't read it,'' Harrigan admits. ``I've sort of been with these
people for eight years. When all of a sudden one of them is dead,
it's odd.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Harrigan knows his life is going to change for the next
few months. Knopf is ready to send him around the country touting
``The Gates of the Alamo.'' He could be buried under fan mail.
People could come from miles around to look at his house, just as
they do the home of actor Matthew McConaughey, who lives down the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that kind of larger success could be temporarily
welcome,'' Harrigan says. ``There was a time in my life when I
suspect I would have liked to be famous. But it has no appeal to me
now. I know how superficial celebrity is.''
</P>
<P>
   Knopf anticipates Harrigan having to cope with newfound fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe `The Gates of the Alamo' will be a bestseller,''
says Knopf publicist Kathy Zuckerman. ``People who have read it
have compared it to `Lonesome Dove.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is helpful to recall that, before ``Lonesome Dove'' (and the
success of ``Terms of Endearment'' as a film), Archer City's Larry
McMurtry was, like Harrigan, considered a talented but regional
writer. ``Lonesome Dove'' won McMurtry the Pulitzer Prize for
fiction, and the ensuing TV miniseries based on the book cemented
his reputation with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gates of the Alamo'' could do the same for Harrigan. He
admits the possibility is intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if, let's say, `The Gates of the Alamo' sells 40,000
copies instead of 400,000, that's still 10 times more than any of
my other books have sold,'' Harrigan says. ``So if things don't go
the way the publisher expects, I'll just try to write my next book.
I've got my life to live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gates of the Alamo'' has already provided one lasting
career benefit for its author.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real lesson to me here is about subject matter,'' Harrigan
says. ``The Alamo still resonates with everybody. Previously, I've
written about obscure things. From now on, I want to write about
things people are interested in.''

`BEACH BOYS' NOTHING TO SING ABOUT, BUT DAD MAKES BIG SPLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching the second night of ``The Beach Boys: An American
Family'' is like being hooked up to an IV drip of daytime drama, so
it's hard to say the four-hour ABC miniseries is a bona fide
chart-topper. But it's easy to say why the first night is so much
better. Two words: Kevin Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn doesn't play one of the Beach Boys. At least not one of the
Beach Boys America embraced in the early '60s. He plays Murry
Wilson, the tough-loving father of Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson,
uncle of Mike Love. Portrayed as a frustrated songwriter who was
always the next tune away from getting his music played on ``The
Lawrence Welk Show,'' Murry knew enough about the business to be
dangerous. Extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of his boys and intensely jealous at the same time, he
controlled their early rise to pop stardom thoroughly and
ruthlessly. He became the de facto leader of the band because
Brian, the oldest Wilson son and acknowledged musical prodigy, was
reluctant to stand up to his dad, who he assumed was acting in the
band's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's powerful performance carries Sunday's first installment
on a wave of intimidation so convincing, it's a wonder any of the
Beach Boys ever grew up to be a man. Monday's second part offers
substantial evidence that the process was certainly a difficult
one, especially for Brian and Dennis Wilson. But, with Dunn getting
less screen time, it also offers viewers little in the way of
compelling performance.
</P>
<P>
   Brian is the focal character in Part 2, which begins at a point
where he has stopped performing with the band to concentrate on
song-writing and, it would appear, drug-taking. Though adept at
mimicking Brian's idiosyncratic mannerisms, particularly his
crooked-mouthed way of speaking and singing, Frederick Weller never
successfully connects with Brian Wilson's complex, troubled psyche.
Near the end, Weller's performance is more cartoonlike than
live-action, especially as Wilson gains weight, grows a beard and
withdraws from family and society.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Love, Brian's cousin and co-writer on many of the
group's hits, says: ``There is just too much bad karma out there.''
Maybe so, but the real problem with ``The Beach Boys: An American
Family'' is inadequate support for Dunn's spectacular turn as Murry
Wilson. With the possible exception of Matt Letscher, who plays
Love with a measure of passion approaching Dunn's, none of the
other band members makes a splash. And Alley Mills, as Murry's
long-suffering wife, Audree, seems stuck in the same maternal
character she played on ``The Wonder Years.''
</P>
<P>
   The film comes from Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, the closest
thing television has to producers of Broadway-style musicals.
They're responsible for this season's remake of ``Annie,'' last
season's ``Cinderella'' and an upcoming movie about Judy Garland.
But ``The Beach Boys,'' while providing snippets of many popular
tunes, is less about the music and more about the melodramatic
conflicts between Murry and the band, between the band members and
their girlfriends/wives, and ultimately between each member of the
group. It's good, theatrical conflict, precisely the sort of
material that was missing from last week's two-hour film about
Little Richard on NBC, but where ``Little Richard'' was too much
music and not enough story, ``The Beach Boys'' ends up being
exactly the opposite, despite Sunday night's well-balanced
introduction to a band that asked the question ``Wouldn't It Be
Nice?'' but never seemed to get a satisfactory answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Beach Boys: An American Family. Four-hour TV miniseries
about the band that popularized the California surf sound of the
1960s. Starring Kevin Dunn, Alley Mills, Frederick Weller, Nick
Stabile, Ryan Northcott, Matt Letscher, Ned Vaughn, Jesse Caron and
Dublin James. Sunday and Monday on ABC. Parental guideline rating:
TV-14.

   ``The Gates of the Alamo''
</P>
<P>
   by Stephen Harrigan
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $25
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We have the first great American novel of the 21st century. It
is ``The Gates of the Alamo,'' a book by Stephen Harrigan whose
subject is obvious from the title and whose quality is almost
inestimable. Harrigan has given us a story with everything _ brisk
pace, sufficient grounding in history, fictional characters whose
engaging personalities help them blend perfectly with real-life
icons like Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, and yet with the latter
presented as human beings, too, not glossy caricatures. This is
storytelling at its finest, and an opportunity to learn and be
royally entertained at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Any work of historically based fiction must be, essentially,
responsible speculation on the part of the author. Popular
knowledge of the Alamo is based as much on legend as on fact. We
know that William Barret Travis, Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie and their
small band of defenders died on the morning of March 6, 1836, when
Mexican President-General Santa Anna concluded a short siege by
sending his army over the walls to annihilate the outnumbered
rebels. Soon afterward, a Texican rabble-army commanded by Sam
Houston returned the bloody favor at San Jacinto, and Texas had won
its independence.
</P>
<P>
   But within these limited events is room for unlimited
supposition. The creative staff members working for Walt Disney
used their imaginations, causing most Americans of a certain age to
still believe Davy Crockett looked just like actor Fess Parker.
Proud Texans dismiss as fable any rumors that Crockett was
summarily executed after surrendering instead of dying valiantly,
crushing a few last Mexican skulls with the butt of his rifle.
Travis did, or didn't, draw a line in the courtyard dirt with the
point of his sword and ask all those willing to give their lives
for Texas freedom to step across it and die defending a
strategically questionable church/fort in the face of
insurmountable odds.
</P>
<P>
   We view Harrigan's interpretation through the eyes of one of the
finest fictional casts assembled in years. The author bookends
events of the 1820s and '30s with a 1911 parade through the streets
of San Antonio. An honored participant in the procession is
91-year-old Terrell Mott, a former city mayor, but, more
gloriously, ``messenger of the Alamo and last surviving hero of San
Jacinto.'' Mott, responding to his driver's question about whether
Travis really drew that line in the dirt (he didn't), is moved to
think about all those events of oh, so many years ago ...
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Terrell Mott is, at least nominally, Harrigan's
protagonist. Other main fictional characters (as opposed to real
men and women who populate these pages) include Terrell's mother,
Mary, a widow operating an inn in Refugio; Edmund McGowan, a
middle-aged botanist whose contractual agreements with Santa Anna
and the Mexican government conflict with his eventual role in the
defense of the Alamo; Telesforo Villasenor, ``third son of a Pueblo
wool merchant,'' who believes he can satisfy burning ambition by
impressing Santa Anna with his willingness to carry out any order;
and dozens of other men, women and children, American Indians as
well as Mexicans and Texicans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a colorful human stew, fully flavored with lingering
appearances by real-life figures. Stephen F. Austin wanders ``City
of Mexico'' streets while still under house arrest for possible
sedition. Jim Bowie puts together shady land deals. Santa Anna
wonders if Mexico's southernmost holdings might offer financial
windfalls from the harvesting of primitive chewing gum. Imagined or
real, Harrigan's entire ensemble interacts wonderfully. Through
them, readers understand that the events of the Texas revolution
were less accidental than inevitable. Neither side in the emerging
conflict is presented as either saintly or demonic.
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan is especially adept at describing the near-casual
violence that was so characteristic of colonial Texas. Readers will
flinch at an early scene in which Mary Mott is disfigured by
marauding Indians but understand why, after such a horrifying
experience, she can go on with her life, scarred but still strong.
</P>
<P>
   The honesty implicit in every line of the book is exemplified by
Mary's relationship with Terrell. They argue at one point, and he
leaves, going off to join Jim Bowie's Texas volunteers. Mary
follows, accompanied by the prissy McGowan, who isn't certain how
to court her. Mother pursues son in part because their quarrel was
her fault, in part because she senses the immensity of events yet
to come. But nothing, from her search for Terrell to the young
man's reaction when he finally is joined by his mother, is tossed
off to fill a few pages between more explosive events. Readers will
be enthralled by the big scenes because they have learned to care
about the characters in smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Gates of the Alamo'' portrays history before and
after the battle it describes without glorifying, the core of the
book is found in the long section focusing on the mission/fort in
San Antonio. All the major characters come together here, and while
we know the battle's outcome, we can't be certain how each will be
affected by it.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan doesn't betray his readers by sanitizing events, or by
allowing previously three-dimensional characters to suddenly become
faultless superheroes. Davy Crockett is engagingly outgoing, but
his easy familiarity smacks, to Terrell, of a politician who can't
stop hustling votes. Travis is an immature commander whose
posturing compromises otherwise sound judgment. Bowie is brave but,
in some ways, morally reprehensible. As for the attacking Mexicans,
Harrigan does a superb job depicting them as equally flawed _ and
decent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the book's finest scenes depict Santa Anna's army
overcoming incredible misfortune to reach the Alamo at all. Readers
may remember the best of Harrigan's brilliant passages describing a
freak blizzard and its effect on the men trying to survive trudging
through it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally it became apparent that the army could travel no
further. The road was lost beneath the snow, and in the tumultuous
whiteness all human instincts about which way to go were buried as
well. ... They cringed in the cold wind, clutching their
pathetically thin blankets over their shoulders. Their mustaches
and eyebrows were sheathed in ice. Each one of their faces bore a
look of perfect, abject pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Harrigan makes us identify so much with these men (and
the women following them), we care when, having survived this
frostbitten ordeal, many die in the attack on the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   All these things add up to something wonderful. But a reviewer's
frustration in describing this or any other novel as ``great''
comes from the necessity for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Potential readers want to know which classic the new novel is
most like. Among earlier Alamo-related literature, Harrigan
acknowledges debts to Stephen L. Hardin's ``Texian Illiad,'' Jeff
Long's ``Duel of Eagles'' and Walter Lord's ``A Time to Stand.''
These are all quality works, but none parlayed literary excellence
into overwhelming public response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gates of the Alamo'' has the potential to join
history-based novels such as ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``Lonesome
Dove'' as eternal bestsellers, as well as critically acclaimed
titles. It is similar to these two evergreens in that its fictional
characters, presented against the backdrop of history, pulsate with
fascinating qualities. Scarlett and Rhett, Call and Gus, Terrell
and Mary are as real to us as the Civil War and cattle drives and
the Texas revolution. And, like ``Gone With the Wind'' and
``Lonesome Dove,'' ``The Gates of the Alamo'' should someday make
an epic movie.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also differences. After reading Margaret
Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind,'' we think about the great love
story between Scarlett and Rhett rather than the Civil War. In
``The Gates of the Alamo,'' Harrigan's made-up characters are
mesmerizing, too, but within the context of history. Larry McMurtry
gave us printed-word wonders in ``Lonesome Dove,'' but his
characters there, Call and Gus and Blue Duck, are all sort of
literary superheroes, larger than life even amid the elasticized
boundaries of fiction. Harrigan offers us ``people,'' and their
flaws are on a human scale. When the first cannonballs fall on the
Alamo, Terrell Mott soils himself. It's not heroic, but it's very
natural.
</P>
<P>
   So ``The Gates of the Alamo'' is and isn't the same as any other
wonderful historic fiction you've previously read and loved.
Reading it in the expectation it will be exactly like something
else will only be a disservice to Harrigan's magnum opus and the
other books to which it might be compared. Calling a book ``great''
ought to imply that it can stand on its own merits. ``The Gates of
the Alamo'' certainly can _ but if comparing it to ``Gone With the
Wind'' and ``Lonesome Dove'' will induce more people to read it,
then by all means compare away.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be necessary to point out that ``The Gates of the
Alamo'' will remain a stunning literary achievement even if it
doesn't make any bestseller lists. Quality doesn't dictate sales;
otherwise, authors like Paul Auster, Pam Houston, John Edgar
Wideman and Bill Bryson would be rubbing financial elbows with Bill
Gates and Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan, 51, has written five other books, fiction and
nonfiction, but they're mostly out of print. So, even if ``The
Gates of the Alamo'' only sells in the tens of thousands instead of
hundreds of thousands, it won't be the last novel we read by
Harrigan. As a seasoned pro, he'll shrug and try to write something
even better.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Gates of the Alamo'' is such a gift to readers that it
would be more tragic for its potential audience than its author if
it doesn't sell well. Superior authors _ and Harrigan obviously is
one _ write first for the sake of the work, not income or fame.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice, for Stephen Harrigan, if ``The Gates of the
Alamo'' becomes the all-time blockbuster it clearly deserves to be.
Books, ultimately, though, should be written for readers, and ``The
Gates of the Alamo'' will reward anyone who turns its pages. Knopf
promises the book will be in local stores on Tuesday. Do yourself a
favor _ buy it, read it, savor it.

`JUDY BERLIN': IN SLEEPY SUBURBIA, A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This is a recap review) 
(af) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Judy Berlin'' was shown as part of last year's New
Directors/New Films series. Following are excerpts from Stephen
Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times last March
26. The film opens Friday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Judy Berlin,'' Eric Mendelsohn's evocatively eerie
meditation on modern suburbia, takes place during what may be the
longest solar eclipse known to movies. That solar event in the
middle of a sleepy late September afternoon draws the lonely,
withdrawn inhabitants of a middle-class Long Island town out of
their immaculate houses to wander through the deserted streets like
zombies stirring to life after a long, silent sleep.
</P>
<P>
   As they encounter one another in an apocalyptic gloom, in which
the street lights seem to cast a nuclear glow, they tentatively
reach out to reconnect in ways they haven't in years.
</P>
<P>
   The first feature film of Mendelsohn, a former costume design
assistant to Woody Allen, ``Judy Berlin'' is set in Babylon on Long
Island, but it feels more like that eternal television limbo of
dark shadows and anxious faces, ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Suburban alienation and boredom may have been done to death by
movies and by ``The Twilight Zone'' itself, many of whose episodes
were saturated in suburban angst. But Mendelsohn's fusion of
science fiction and Chekhovian melancholy finds a fresh perspective
on a familiar theme.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white cinematography helps give this contemporary
story a timeless aura. Like ``Pleasantville,'' which ``Judy
Berlin'' sometimes resembles, the movie has the stifling ethos of
an eternally rerunning 1950s sitcom whose characters are either
tranquilized or sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   The movie feels especially '50s when it goes indoors and the
camera lingers over furniture, kitchen appliances and cabinets full
of neatly arranged bric-a-brac.
</P>
<P>
   It is the filmmaker's subtly drawn characters that keep ``Judy
Berlin'' from becoming mired in suburban-angst cliches. Madeline
Kahn and Bob Dishy are Alice and Arthur Gold, a compulsively talky
housewife and her taciturn husband, an elementary school principal
who exudes a deep unspoken disappointment and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The couple have a 30-year-old son, David (Aaron Harnick), an
aspiring filmmaker recently returned from Los Angeles who wanders
around the house in a state of agitated depression, fighting back
tears.
</P>
<P>
   The movie crosscuts among members of the Gold household, their
neighbors and the school where Arthur presides as principal. The
fall term has just begun, and Sue Berlin (Barbara Barrie), an
excessively polite and buttoned-up teacher, is instructing the
pupils on how to view the imminent solar eclipse without hurting
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of her demonstration, Dolores Engler (Bette
Henritze), a retired teacher with Alzheimer's disease, wanders into
the classroom and momentarily commands the children's attention.
The clash of authority, in which Arthur intercedes, leaves Sue in
tears. As Arthur comforts her, their unexpressed romantic feelings
well up unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Sue's unhappiness is the imminent departure for Los
Angeles of her spunky daughter Judy (Edie Falco), an aspiring
actress who has been working in period costume as a milkmaid in a
historical village.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's wittiest scene follows a group of tourists around
this make-believe 1857 farm as a guide explains in wooden tones the
grueling rituals of mid-19th-century agricultural life on Long
Island. The comparison between then and now is tacit. Life may not
be as hard today, but it is just as boring.
</P>
<P>
   Judy, whom Falco plays with a winning verve, is the only live
wire in this heap of downed power lines. Garrulous and optimistic,
she is about to undertake the same journey westward that David
made. And when the two, who were high school classmates, run into
each other on the street, you can feel the attraction of opposites.
Her optimism rushes to fill his despair, while his gloom tugs her
down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dramatic tension of a movie that at times moves too
slowly derives from a sense that the filmmaker is biting his tongue
to keep from turning these people into biting satirical
caricatures. At first Kahn's Alice seems like the kind of
insufferable yammerer who would drive anyone mad.
</P>
<P>
   But as the movie goes along, her inane chatter seems more like a
desperate psychic survival tool. And at a moment when she fears she
has lost her husband, she shows a flash of insight. ``I ground him
down,'' she observes bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   Dishy gives the film's deepest performance as a man so weary and
long-suffering that all his dialogue comes in carefully measured
murmurs. ``Judy Berlin'' is the rare movie in which the pauses,
silences and things that remain unsaid by the characters are as
eloquent as anything that comes out of their mouths.

   A 10th Life For `Cats'?
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With sales like this, it should have closed years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the five days since ``Cats,'' the longest-running show in
Broadway history, announced that it would close in June, something
close to pandemonium has set in at the box office at the Winter
Garden Theater. Sales have gone from torpid to torrid, with $1.1
million worth of tickets sold by midday Thursday and requests
coming from around the world. Nearly 400 television stations in the
United States reported on the closing, said Bill Evans, a spokesman
for the show, in addition to outlets from Argentina to Japan. Even
Keith Richards, he of the Rolling Stones, made a special request
for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years after it opened, ``Cats'' is the hottest show on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   All of which prompts the inevitable question: Might it (gulp) be
extended?
</P>
<P>
   Phil Smith, an executive with the Shubert Organization, which
owns the Winter Garden, was slightly oblique on this issue, saying
that the closing date of June 25 was set, but allowing that such
intense sales _ if they persist _ could not be ignored. (Show
officials did discount tabloid reports that the show might move to
another theater.) Unsold tickets for the three shows on June 24 and
25 have been pulled from the box office, presumably to ensure that
VIPs have seats for the closing weekend.
</P>
<P>
   If, of course, that is the closing weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the Wings
</P>
<P>
   An opening Thursday night, 350 miles to the northwest, that may
well determine the final entry of the spring season: ``Enigma
Variations,'' by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, at the Royal Alexandra
Theater in Toronto. The play, about a reclusive writer who is
visited by a young journalist, stars Donald Sutherland and John
Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is that it will transfer to the Brooks Atkinson
Theater in April if the reviews are strong. ``Enigma Variations''
played in Los Angeles last spring, receiving generally good
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Toronto, Emanuel Azenberg, the play's producer,
said that reviews were expected Friday and Saturday in the Toronto
papers, meaning a decision on a transfer to Manhattan would
probably be made by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Revivals With Ambition
</P>
<P>
   The fall season is beginning to take shape. In Los Angeles,
producers said that the revival of ``Finian's Rainbow'' would play
in the Ahmanson Theater from July 12 to Sept. 3 in what is expected
to be a pre-Broadway run. The revival of the 1947 musical, by
Burton Lane and E.Y. Harburg, received almost unanimously good
reviews in Cleveland and Miami last fall, but producers were unable
to book a Broadway house in an especially packed season.
</P>
<P>
   The booking at the Ahmanson confirms the postponement of another
musical: ``The Night They Raided Minsky's,'' which was to play at
the theater this summer. The director of that musical, Mike
Ockrent, died of leukemia in December and no new director has been
named.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, rehearsals will begin in early October for ``A
Thousand Clowns,'' a revival of the 1962 comedy by Herb Gardner. In
a Magnum-size stage debut, Tom Selleck is to play the role of
Murray Burns, the surly, underemployed writer whose idea of
foreplay is to strum the ukulele. He said it was a character he has
wanted to play since he was a drama student in Los Angeles, his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In acting class, when they'd say, `Put up a scene for us,' I'd
bring in Murray Burns,'' he said. Directors did not approve, mind
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 6 foot 4,'' he said. ``I was always being asked to do the
other guy, the guy who always gets the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Selleck, 55, said he had approached Gardner in 1996 about doing
the play but that another version was already in the works for the
Roundabout Theater Co. That production received poor reviews after
its star, Robert Klein, and its director, Gene Saks, left shortly
before its opening.
</P>
<P>
   This time plans are for a short run in Austin, Texas, in
November before a move to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Selleck, who has never been paid to act in a play, said he was
``appropriately terrified.'' But, he said, there is at least one
collateral benefit: ``I've never been able to play an instrument
and got to get serious about the ukulele now.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Man on Stage
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vilanch is not exactly typical star material. With a
basketball belly, a head of blond Chia Pet hair and ever-present
pink-rimmed glasses, he looks slightly like a Teletubby crossed
with Animal, the crazed drummer from ``The Muppet Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fame factor has been growing for the witty Vilanch, who
has written celebrity patter for the Academy Awards for the last
decade. A regular on ``Hollywood Squares'' since last year, he was
also the subject of a documentary, ``Get Bruce,'' and he was
caricatured on ``Saturday Night Live'' last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's confirming his new star status with a one-man show,
``Almost Famous,'' which will open at the Westbeth Theater Center
in the West Village on April 25. Vilanch, a former reporter and
``sit-down comic,'' said the show would include ``musings on my
life in the comedy gulag, some of my journalistic misadventures, a
few songs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I don't have,'' he added, ``is a nightmare
decent into booze and pills.''

 (Attn: Ga., Texas)   `ACTUAL INNOCENCE': DNA TESTS AND THE ROAD TO(Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Actual Innocence,'' by two prominent New York criminal defense
lawyers and a columnist for The Daily News, raises a powerful
challenge to the assumption that all is pretty much well with the
legal system, and that the safeguards against wrongful conviction
are adequately in place.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the experience of Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, the
defense lawyers, ``Actual Innocence'' details several edifying
stories of men cleared of serious crimes. Most often the charge was
rape and the penalty a prison term, though some who were wrongfully
convicted of murder were sentenced to death. Despite a certain
slipshod quality in the writing, ``Actual Innocence'' is an
important, unignorable depiction of the way fallible or, in some
cases, careless, malicious or incompetent men and women have caused
innocent men to spend years of their lives behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the convictions covered by this book's three
authors _ the Daily News columnist is Jim Dwyer _ were eventually
overturned by posttrial DNA analysis. Sperm or hair samples found
after rapes proved that the convicted men could not have committed
the crimes. In that sense, ``Actual Innocence'' is to a great
extent a history of the role that DNA testing, which became
reliably available in the late 1980s, has come to play in criminal
defense work.
</P>
<P>
   But the book has a far wider scope. Its case studies show the
various ways miscarriages of justice take place, from mistaken
eyewitness testimony to racist presumptions about black male
defendants. Most important, ``Actual Innocence'' offers a
cautionary vision of the workings of the criminal justice system in
general. As of August, the book says, DNA testing had ``provided
stone-cold proof that 67 people were sent to prison and death row
for crimes they did not commit.'' But DNA revelations are available
only in certain kinds of cases, most commonly when semen has been
collected after a rape. ``The evidence says that most likely,
thousands of innocent people are in prison, beyond the reach of the
revelation machine,'' the authors conclude.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this book are several chilling stories of men
wrongfully convicted and, after many years and much resistance from
prosecutors and judges, exonerated by DNA testing. In one case, a
rape victim the authors call Faye Treatser identified her
assailant, Walter Tyrone Snyder, during a casual encounter set up
by detectives in a police station in Alexandria, Va. Treatser, who
never had to identify Snyder in a line-up, was positive of her
identification, although later DNA testing proved her to be
mistaken. The authors said they had received an instructive lesson
in the frequent unreliability of the very eyewitness
identifications juries so often find persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   The authors examine other common flaws in the system, including
the use of jail-house snitches to obtain supposed confessions from
suspects, reliance on incorrect microscopic analysis of hair
samples, or just plain prosecutorial sophistry. The authors show
troubling but not surprising statistics indicating that blacks are
far more likely to be wrongfully convicted than whites.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Calvin Johnson of Jonesboro, Ga., a black man
accused of rape by two different white women, was convicted by an
all-white jury and acquitted by a racially mixed jury in another,
almost identical case. The main difference was that the all-white
jury dismissed testimony from three different people who gave
Johnson what would seem to have been a solid alibi. DNA evidence
later proved his innocence in both crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cases presented in detail in ``Actual Innocence''
were the work of Scheck and Neufeld, whose Innocence Project at the
Benjamin Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan seeks the release
through DNA testing of people who have been wrongfully convicted.
To their credit, Scheck and Neufeld do not put themselves at the
center of the stories recounted in their book, which is not a
memoir of two legal careers but rather an argument for reforming
the criminal justice system. The authors point out, for example,
that only two states _ New York and Illinois _ authorize
postconviction DNA testing for inmates, and they recommend that
other states follow suit. In most of the cases recounted in this
book, the exculpatory DNA tests were performed only after Scheck or
Neufeld persuaded prosecutors to allow them, usually after delays
that lasted years.
</P>
<P>
   While admirably modest in its presentation and vigorous in its
findings, ``Actual Innocence'' is strangely unsatisfying as an
exploration of what might be called the psychology of conviction.
Some of the cases covered in this book seem to have been so
manifestly unfair that they make one want to know whether the
presiding judges were awake in their chairs, or whether defense
lawyers tried to get the jury's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The authors do speak of the pressure that the heinousness of a
crime itself exerts _ how, for example, the rape and murder of a
child can lead to such a powerful desire for justice to be done
that injustice is done instead. The depiction of the power of that
desire is helpful, but the authors of ``Actual Innocence'' explore
only a small number of misjudged cases with those who were involved
in them. One wishes they had examined more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this book remains a troubling portrayal of the criminal
justice system from within its well-guarded walls. It is
impossible, for example, to read of the terrifying ordeal of Tim
Durham of Dallas, wrongly convicted in the rape of an 11-year-old
girl, without worrying that a kind of hysteria might be present in
criminal trials far more often than we like to think. Durham had 11
witnesses testifying that he was 300 miles away at the time of the
rape. In prison, Durham was savagely beaten by other inmates
because he had supposedly molested a child. He was eventually
released after DNA evidence proved his innocence, but his case
makes one wonder how many others are in prison who shouldn't be
there. &QL;

`KNOCKOUT': YOU'RE GONNA FLY NOW, LIKE ROCKY

<P>
   The night before her title bout for the women's lightweight
boxing crown, Isabelle Alvarado (Sophia-Adella Hernandez), the
beautiful, brave, loyal contender who has weathered two successive
family tragedies, has a dream in which her dead parents appear in a
silvery mist to offer words of divine encouragement. ``It's all
right,'' they soothe. ``It's your time to shine! Let your light
shine! Let it shine!''
</P>
<P>
   Fortified by a pep talk delivered straight from heaven, it's no
wonder Isabelle enters the ring with a certain confidence to face
the defending champion, Tanya ``Terminator'' Tessaro (Fredia
Gibbs), a mean, surly hellcat who has already sent Isabelle's best
friend, Sandra (Gina La Plante), into the ranks of the permanently
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But things don't go so well for Isabelle until late in the
match, when her parents make one last, brief appearance. There's
nothing like a little divine intervention at the right moment to
re-energize a weary prizefighter and make the gears of a formulaic
plot click into place.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle, whom Hernandez portrays with an appealing misty-eyed
grit, is the heroine of ``Knockout,'' an upbeat, candy-colored
fantasy written and directed by Lorenzo Doumani that wants to be
the ``Rocky'' of Latino female boxing movies.
</P>
<P>
   The production notes describe Doumani, an independent filmmaker,
as ``a true optimist with a strong belief in God and family'' whose
heroes are Theodore Roosevelt, Frank Capra, Muhammad Ali and Walt
Disney, men who ``succeeded against all odds in spreading their
individual visions of goodness in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good. But Doumani's notion of movie optimism
is the writing of naive, fill-in-the-blanks dialogue for cardboard
characters in a drama that has the preachy, sanitized atmosphere of
a children's after-school television special. Underscoring the more
dramatic moments are weepy saccharine ballads that sound like
Whitney Houston or Celine Dion castoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Knockout,'' which follows the rise to glory of
Isabelle, the daughter of a saintly East Los Angeles policeman, is
one long, 1980s-style inspirational cliche. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Knockout' is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned). It
includes scenes of violence. &QL;

<P>
   GWERU, Zimbabwe _ In back of the Msika beer hall, a ruckus is
being raised.
</P>
<P>
   As the bemused men _ many of them peering through bloodshot eyes
_ look on from the shade of the Msika's veranda, about 20 women in
blue denim skirts and white blouses cavort joyfully to their own
songs and drums.
</P>
<P>
   In a swaying semi_circle, they swing their hips and clap their
hands. In their native Shona language, they sing catchy tunes about
the virtues of wearing condoms and going to the hospital as soon as
AIDS symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
   These women know what they are talking about: Each is a former
prostitute, and each is on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   The women are part of a 350_member organization known as the
GWAPA _ Gweru Women AIDS Prevention Association _ which began here
six years ago as a grassroots campaign to do something about the
epidemic that threatens to decimate Africa.
</P>
<P>
   New statistics show that 23.3 million people in sub-Saharan
Africa are infected with the AIDS virus, compared to less that one
million in all of North America. In Zimbabwe, about 26 percent of
the country's 12 million people have AIDS. Among prostitutes, the
infection rate is twice as high.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States and Europe, AIDS in Africa infects more
women than men, and the HIV virus most often is transmitted through
heterosexual contact.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS prevention officials believe that curbing the region's
prostitution trade _ or at least making their business safer _ is
key to getting the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, under
control.
</P>
<P>
   While countless programs sanctioned by governments and
humanitarian organizations have failed to make much of a dent in
the AIDS crisis here, GWAPA _ whose members are most often referred
to respectfully as ``the ladies'' _ seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   While no scientific study has been performed of the program,
which seems to have sprung up nearly spontaneously in 1994, city
officials swear by it. ``I can say honestly that we have seen a
reduction in HIV infections,'' said Elisabeth Xaba the medical
director of Gweru, a largely agricultural city of about 200,000 in
the central Zimbabwean plains.
</P>
<P>
   Xaba believes that GWAPA is an example of a traditional African
approach to solving problems that may work better than programs and
solutions imposed from the outside. ``That tradition of saying,
'What do we need to do to solve the problem, and then solving it,'
that's what we have not had.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has been supportive of the ladies' boisterous crusade
through the town's 11 beer halls. It started with about 30 members
and continues to recruit more, focusing not only on prostitutes but
also widowed and divorced women who often end up as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ladies have plied their trade in the same beer halls
they now enter to preach the gospel of monogamy and safe sex. They
also try to recruit working prostitutes, who descend on beer halls
each day in search of customers with a few dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was addicted to the beer halls,'' says Gertrude Chaidende, a
cheerful 40-year-old woman who says her husband divorced her
because she couldn't have children. ``I had a real reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   As with many of the GWAPA women, Chaidende became a prostitute
largely because there are few other ways for a single woman to make
money in Zimbabwe, which has an unemployment rate of more than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many have children and say they were reduced to turning tricks
for the equivalent of US$3.50 to US$7.50 each so they could get
money for food, school fees and uniforms. Zimbabwe offers no free
education.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Nyamhunda, a 34-year-old mother of three, said she had no
choice. ``My husband left me in 1996 and went to South Africa,''
she says. ``I was forced into prostitution, and it was a very big
problem to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   GWAPA's motto is ``Making Up for the Lost Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The group _ which practices a robust and straightforward
democracy under the gentle guidance of city health workers _ has
taken on the task of seeking alternate ways for its members to make
a living.
</P>
<P>
   It divided the membership into groups that intend to generate
income by catering, growing and selling produce, soap-making and
raising poultry.
</P>
<P>
   The group also supports the 30 children left behind by the 14
members _ many of them from among the founders _ who have died from
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the city signed a $10-a-year lease with the
ladies on an abandoned 11_acre farm, where they already have
installed a corn crop and a few dozen chickens. They are trying to
raise money to renovate the dilapidated brick house on the property
as a headquarters and teaching center. The U.S. and British
embassies here have kicked in enough to renovate two rooms and
provide some tables and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The city's mayor, James Bwerazuva, is obviously proud of the
program and believes it can be exported to other African cities.
``AIDS has been the scare that has overtaken everybody,'' Bwerazuva
said during a brief conversation this week at City Hall. ``It was
imperative that the city do something to check the advance of AIDS
in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their frequent appearances at beer halls and
brothels, the ladies _ and even a few male members _ also take
their message to workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The message seems to be getting through.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Msika beer hall. The women move table to table using
a wooden model to demonstrate the proper techniques in putting on
and removing condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping at the large plastic container of the pungent,
tea-colored local beer, the men and women study intently, breaking
into laughter when the lesson becomes too explicit.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Binga, a man in his 40s, pauses from his beer to offer
his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is good because some people can't learn any
other way,'' he said, taking a sip and gesturing toward the GWAPA
women. ``And these ladies, they know what they're talking about.

A CITY IN FULL: VENERABLE, IMPATIENT ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is a city without a historic core, a city in
constant evolution _ a Deep South version, you might say, of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It has a past, of course, a real one as well as the one that
Margaret Mitchell so vividly imagined in ``Gone With the Wind.'' A
decisive Civil War battle was fought over this ground, and the
momentous civil rights movement of the 1960s had its principal
headquarters here. That most American of products, Coca-Cola, was
invented here.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta, a city in a hurry, keeps putting its past behind
it. If not for the Cyclorama depicting the fighting of 1864 and the
superlative Atlanta History Center, with its evocations of Henry W.
Grady, the great newspaper editor, and Bobby Jones, the golfer,
and, yes, William Tecumseh Sherman, who burned the city down, a
visitor might easily come here and miss Atlanta's past altogether.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is the vibrant, business-minded capital of the
New South, proud to have played host to the 1996 Olympic Games,
pleased to promote itself as ``The World's Next Great City'' and
not another tradition-bound vestige of the Old South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta had never been a true Old Southern city like Savannah
or Charleston or Richmond, where wealth had originated with the
land,'' Tom Wolfe wrote in his novel ``A Man in Full'' in 1998.
``Atlanta was an offspring of the railroad business. It had been
created from scratch barely 150 years ago, and people had been
making money there on the hustle ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite so. Atlanta, or rather the Atlanta region, is one of the
global capitals of New Money, much of it made in real estate. It
goes to build the trophy houses in the ritzy residential area along
West Paces Ferry Road in Buckhead, near the History Center, and to
buy the BMWs and Land Rovers that clog the parking lots around
Buckhead's many shopping centers and to pay for the fine food and
drink in the neighborhood's glossy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   That is one face of Atlanta, but there are many more. Start with
Downtown, bustling by day, much less so at night; people work there
but don't play there, and Centennial Olympic Park, created for the
1996 games, has not quite pulled the area together the way the city
fathers had hoped. Then there is Midtown, staging a comeback as a
pleasant place to live, as well as the poorer and shabbier and
mostly African-American south side of town.
</P>
<P>
   It is in Virginia-Highland, a walkable neighborhood of bars,
boutiques and bookshops, and close-in Inman Park that the city
shows its charm, especially in spring, when dogwood blossoms
brighten the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Put all that and more together, and you have a compact,
relatively small city of 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   A Truer Picture
</P>
<P>
   But that defines Atlanta only in a governmental sense. To get a
truer picture, you must focus on an unruly 17-county sprawl
spreading ever outward, with no mountains or seacoast in the way,
across Cobb and DeKalb, Gwinnett and Forsyth and Cherokee and a
dozen other counties, home to some 3.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the nation's 10 fastest-growing counties lie within
commuting range of Atlanta, and their exploding populations have
helped make Georgia the 10th largest state. But with growth, with
prosperity, with the shady trees and tidy yards of the suburbs,
have come problems: higher taxes to pay for infrastructure, air and
water pollution, and nerve-shattering drives to and from work.
Drivers here endure the longest average commute in the country _ a
34-mile round trip every working day, often snarled by gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club calls Atlanta the most sprawl-threatened large
city in the United States; an official of the American Farmland
Trust termed it ``the poster child for sprawl.'' Stung by those
descriptions, the state government is working on tactics to bring
greater order to the region.
</P>
<P>
   How much such things bother you depends on where you sit. My
friend Colin Campbell, a newspaper columnist, lives in Midtown and
wishes more suburbanites would move there. It still has a slightly
hollowed-out feeling, he said. But our host at lunch, former Mayor
Sam Massell, now known as the unofficial mayor of Buckhead, which
houses 15 percent of Atlanta's population and pays 45 percent of
its taxes, said the only real option to more sprawl was greater
density in town, with more smog and bigger traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Hub
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Atlanta was called Terminus, but that was a
misnomer. It has always been about linkage. It came into being as
the place where the railroads from the bustling port cities of
Mobile and Charleston and Savannah met the line running south from
Chattanooga, which is what made it such a strategic objective in
the Civil War. Later, Atlanta became the southeastern hub of the
highway system, where Interstates 20, 75 and 85 meet.
</P>
<P>
   The civil aviation network, too. Even on your way to heaven,
Southerners used to say, you have to change planes in Atlanta.
Atlanta's airport pioneered instrument approaches and air traffic
control, and today it vies with Chicago's O'Hare for the title of
the nation's busiest.
</P>
<P>
   Several generations of visionaries have made possible the city's
rise from the ashes of defeat. They thoroughly disproved the
prophecy of a Union soldier, Pfc. Theodore Upson, who wrote in his
diary after the Battle of Atlanta in September 1864: ``We have
wholly destroyed Atlanta. I don't think that any people will want
to live there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Grady was the first. As the editor of The Atlanta
Constitution, he argued after the Civil War that the salvation of
his ruined city, state and region lay in attracting northern
investment to a ``New South,'' a phrase he coined. In a famous
speech in New York in 1886, he assured the New England Society that
Southerners had accepted the outcome of the war and bore the North
no ill will.
</P>
<P>
   His vision of good race relations _ ``sunshine everywhere and
all the time,'' as he put it _ was never realized in his lifetime.
The South remained the nation's economic stepchild, and Atlanta's
history was marred by several spasms of intolerance, including the
1906 race riots, in which whites attacked blacks, and the 1913
lynching of Leo Frank, a Jew from Brooklyn. Anti-semitism reared
its head more recently in the 1958 bombing of a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   When the federal government ceased enforcing black rights, Jim
Crow laws brought on segregation in restaurants, hotels and other
public places. Blacks were denied the vote. But they built
successful parallel institutions, including churches, newspapers,
radio stations, banks, insurance companies and two of the nation's
best predominantly African-American colleges, Morehouse for men and
Spelman for women. Between the world wars, Auburn Avenue (``Sweet
Auburn'') became a regional mecca for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, Atlanta's first great international business, was
built by Robert W. Woodruff, who took a tonic developed in 1886 by
Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a local chemist, and peddled it around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff philanthropies, large and small, are inescapable in
Atlanta. The World of Coca-Cola, a self-aggrandizing corporate
museum where the Coke is free but the admission isn't, has a
blinking electronic sign informing wide-eyed visitors that more
than 6 trillion, 39 billion bottles have been sold. So the recent
news that the company was changing CEOs and eliminating 6,000 jobs
worldwide, including 2,500 in Atlanta, hit the city like a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Where King Started
</P>
<P>
   The great visionary of the civil rights movement, of course, was
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., born in a clapboard and
shingle house that still stands on Auburn Avenue, not far from
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King and his father preached. He won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, at the age of 35, the youngest
person ever to do so. He is buried in a marble tomb in a reflecting
pool at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social
Change, also on Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street at a National Park Visitors Center the still
photographs of Birmingham and Selma by Charles Moore and James
Karales evoke that era of strife and accomplishment. But the genius
of the place lies in the films of King delivering his unforgettably
eloquent speeches, in that prophetic voice mingling calm,
cultivation and steely determination.
</P>
<P>
   I heard many of them in person as a young reporter, and like
many of my generation I can recite bits of several from memory _
``Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, I'm free at
last'' _ but neither my wife, Betsey, nor I was prepared for the
powerful waves of emotion that washed over us as we listened.
Atlanta offers no experience to match it, and not many other cities
do either.
</P>
<P>
   King had important co-workers, including Jesse Jackson and
Andrew Young, later a member of Congress, ambassador to the United
Nations and mayor of Atlanta. A large black middle class helped
lend stability to the city when others, potential rivals for
Southern leadership, fell apart. Mayors William B. Hartsfield and
Ivan Allen pronounced their city ``Too Busy to Hate,'' and Ralph
McGill preached moderation in his column in The Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and Turner
</P>
<P>
   Today, the city's leading citizen is former President Jimmy
Carter, much more admired out of office than in, who builds houses
for Habitat for Humanity, lectures, writes books and travels the
world with his wife, Rosalynn, promoting peace and working to
eradicate disease and ease hunger. When not on the road, they
divide their time between the little farm town of Plains and an
apartment at the Carter Presidential Library here.
</P>
<P>
   But he has a rival in Ted Turner, the voluble entrepreneur who
turned an underpowered UHF television station into the Superstation
viewed across the country. He invented CNN, based in downtown
Atlanta, which has become the world's channel of choice when big
news is breaking. He built the Atlanta Braves, winner of eight
division titles under the imperturbable Bobby Cox, into one of the
nation's most successful sports franchises. He married (and split
from) Jane Fonda. He gave $1 billion to the United Nations. And he
owns 1.6 million acres of ranch land, more than any other American.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is full of success stories, from Delta Airlines to Home
Depot and UPS. Over the years, it has built important institutions
like Georgia Tech and Emory University, a superb liberal-arts
school less well-known than Tech because it lacks the Ramblin'
Wrecks' sports legends, and the national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. (Emory's well-regarded Michael C. Carlos
Art Museum was renovated and expanded by the post-modernist Michael
Graves in 1993.)
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta boasts tourist attractions like the zoo, with a winsome
pair of pandas, Lun Lun and Yang Yang, two of only five in the
country, and the Stone Mountain Monument, a kind of Confederate
version of Mount Rushmore, out to the east of the city.
</P>
<P>
   I must not forget the Art Deco-style Varsity, the nation's
largest drive-in, where they move the customers through at
double-time, all day every day. And I must mention a curiosity of
Atlanta nomenclature: there are 32 streets, lanes, drives, circles
and roads named Peachtree in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally speaking, Atlanta remains a stripling, and it has
suffered two important losses this year. Ned Rifkin, the director
of the High Museum of Art, left to run the Menil Collection in
Houston, complaining of a chronic dearth of arts financing, both
public and private. And Harriet Sanford, the director of the Fulton
County Arts Council, announced she would leave in April to take a
similar position in Charlotte, N.C. _ ``a place,'' she said, ``that
just has a different level of appreciation for the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Better Days Anticipated
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta likes to think of itself as a much more important city
than Charlotte and as a legitimate rival to Houston. So it was not
surprising that The Constitution ran an editorial chastising both
business and local governments for failing to commit the big bucks
needed to move the city into the artistic big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But better days seem to lie ahead for the 56-year-old Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra, the largest performing arts organization in the
Southeast, with a budget of $21 million and an endowment nearing
$70 million. It was built, to a considerable degree, by Robert
Shaw, the noted choral conductor, who died last year; but it has
not flourished under Yoel Levi, the Romanian-born conductor who
leaves in May after 12 years as music director.
</P>
<P>
   As the orchestra struggled with a deficit, it endured a 10-week
strike at the beginning of the 1996-97 season, as well as a
protracted conflict between the orchestra's board and management,
on the one hand, and a vocal band of Levi supporters who charged
that he was being forced out.
</P>
<P>
   This month, however, the Symphony named Robert Spano, the
38-year-old leader of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, to succeed Levi.
One of the most highly regarded young American conductors, he had
been mentioned as a possibility for a half-dozen other orchestras,
some of them bigger. Spano made his name in Brooklyn with an
emphasis on the modern, but this, he said, is ``a very different
city'' that might require a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will be getting not one but two marquee names; Donald
Runnicles, the Scottish-born, German-trained music director of the
San Francisco Opera, was named the orchestra's principal guest
conductor.
</P>
<P>
   For many years until 1987, the Metropolitan Opera came to
Atlanta every year on tour. When the touring ended, the Atlanta
Opera, which had begun as an amateur outfit, transformed itself to
fill the void. Starting, in the words of William Fred Scott, its
artistic director, with ``somebody who answered the phone and a
sextet of well-meaning ladies in station wagons,'' it has grown
into a company with an annual budget of almost $5 million. More
than 50,000 people attended its productions last season.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This ``meteoric growth,'' the British magazine Opera Now said
last year, is ``creating noises everywhere.'' In 2000 Atlantans
will see three performances each of four operas _ ``Rigoletto,''
``Cosi Fan Tutte,'' ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' and ``Turandot'' _ in
the glorious, 4,518-seat Fox Theater, an Art Deco movie palace that
retains its ``Thousand and One Nights'' decor. For the first time,
all four presentations will be Atlanta Opera productions.
</P>
<P>
   A Theater Co.
</P>
<P>
   If any Atlanta arts organization embraces the whole city, black
and white, urban and suburban, it is the Alliance Theater Co., a
repertory group based at the Woodruff Arts Center. Its guiding
spirit is Kenny Leon, who must be one of the few artistic directors
around who stands outside after some performances, greeting the
audience members like a parish priest.
</P>
<P>
   Leon, who is black, has cast African-American actors and
actresses in traditionally white roles in ``A Christmas Carol'' and
``Medea,'' which featured the ``Cosby'' star Phylicia Rashad.
Shortly after his appointment in 1990, ticket sales dropped to
13,000 from 20,000, but then rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think controversy is probably my middle name,'' Leon said on
the CBS News program ``Sunday Morning'' a year ago, ``not because I
want to be controversial but because I want to ask questions that
will make us better human beings. I think the theater can be a
place where we can come and realize that we all bleed the same
blood, we all walk the same way, and we all want the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the company's offerings this year are Shaw's ``Heartbreak
House''; August Wilson's ``Jitney''; ``Shadowlands,'' a love story
drawn from the life of C.S. Lewis, the Oxford theologian; and
``Wit,'' the 1999 Pulitzer Prize winner written by Margaret Edson,
an Atlanta kindergarten teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Builders and Buildings
</P>
<P>
   As befits a city whose main business for the last century has
been building itself, most of Atlanta's architecture is developer
architecture. The city's most important home-grown architect in the
postwar period was John Portman, himself a developer, who built
many of the postmodern towers that define downtown Atlanta,
including the vast Peachtree Center, the Atlanta Merchandise Mart
and the 70-story Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But he will be best remembered for the Hyatt Regency Hotel, in
which he adapted and expanded the atrium lobby that had been used
in 19th-century hotels like the Brown Palace in Denver. The Hyatt's
22-story skylit courtyard, with bedrooms opening onto cantilevered
balconies hung with vines and transparent ``bubble'' elevators
whisking awed guests to their floors, was copied all across the
United States soon after it opened in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Johnson and John Burgee contributed a pair of skyscrapers
in the late 1980s, the more successful of the two forming an anchor
for the Midtown neighborhood. Called the IBM Tower, it is a
neo-Gothic campanile, refined in its ornament and satisfying in its
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other notable buildings scattered here and
there, including a series of elegant mansions designed in the 1920s
and 1930s by Philip T. Shutze, a gifted classicist who took his
stylistic cue from the best Regency and Federal models.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the clumsy McMansions that have joined them along the
wealthy, wooded byways of Buckhead in the last two decades have
none of Shutze's finesse. Meant to resemble Venetian palazzos,
Georgian country seats, Tuscan villas or French chateaus, they
succeed only in looking hugely expensive. A scroll pediment here
and a Palladian window there don't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   The High Museum
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the country's leading modernists can be seen at the
peak of his game in Atlanta, and that is Richard Meier, whose High
Museum (1983), clad in dazzlingly white porcelain-enameled steel
panels, resembles a space station that has settled gently onto the
greensward along Peachtree Street. A big, colorful Calder mobile (a
lunar explorer?) sits alongside it, and a series of curving ramps
lead into and through the exhibition spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The High's collection is skimpy in spots, but it has significant
strengths, including the spectacular Virginia Carroll Crawford
collection of 19th- and early 20th-century American furniture and
decorative arts (several Herter Brothers pieces are of special
note) and an idiosyncratic group of objects made by Howard Finster
of Summerville, Ga., one of the nation's best-known outsider
artists.
</P>
<P>
   I especially like the way in which unlikely juxtapositions of
pictures or the like have been created: a Rothko next to a Martin
Johnson Heade, one abstract, one not, but both divided into three
horizontal bands; an old Yoruba door from West Africa next to a
door painted in New Orleans by a black artist named Herbert
Singleton, born in 1945; children as seen by three portraitists,
Mary Cassatt, Samuel F.B. Morse and George Bellows. The pedagogy is
not heavy-handed, but the lessons are there for those who seek
them.

<P>
   &UR; WHAT TO DO  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By R.W. APPLE Jr. &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel
information:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   RITZ-CARLTON BUCKHEAD, 3434 Peachtree Road, (404) 237-2700. Set
in a sterile suburban sea of shopping malls, office towers and
parking lots, the Ritz nonetheless conveys a feeling of graceful
luxury. The public rooms are lush; the bedrooms benefit from thick
carpets and thicker towels, but you may wonder why faxes take so
long to reach you. Renovations are under way. The dining room (see
below) has been a superstar since it opened in 1984. Double room:
From $195 on weekends; $235 on weeknights.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR SEASONS, 75 14th St., (404) 881-9898. Strategically
positioned between Buckhead and downtown, only a few steps fom the
High Museum of Art and the Woodruff Arts Center, this opulent
property occupies the bottom 20 floors of a postmodern high rise.
Offices and condominiums take up the top floors. Corridors and
bedrooms are bright and amply proportioned, and room-service
breakfasts are delectable. Modern computer linkups. Double room:
$165 to $325.
</P>
<P>
   RITZ-CARLTON DOWNTOWN, 181 Peachtree Street NE, (404) 659-0400.
The Buckhead property is the chain's flagship, but this ``other''
Ritz clearly ranks as the best hotel in downtown Atlanta. Acres of
marble, fine Oriental rugs, a 17th-century Flemish tapestry and an
18th-century chandelier lend the lobby all the luxury anyone could
ask for, although the overall feeling is just a little bit
institutional. Some of the rooms have fourposter beds. Double room:
$139 to $295.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SWISSOTEL, 3391 Peachtree Road, (404) 365-0065. Adjacent to
Lenox Square, Atlanta's grandest shopping mall, this streamlined,
sparklingly white building bears a certain resemblance to the High
Museum. Inside, Biedermeier furniture and modern paintings soften
the geometry and lend a human scale; the 365 rooms are up to date
and carefully kept, if not particularly distinctive. A branch of
New York's Palm steakhouse is in the hotel. Double room: $150 to
$390.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   BACCHANALIA, 1198 Howell Mill Road, (404) 365-0410. Newly
installed in a former slaughterhouse west of downtown, Bacchinalia
expends vast effort in tracking down prime raw materials: Niman
ranch pork, lamb and beef; cherry-red Ahi tuna from Hawaii; cheeses
from not only Italy, France and Britain, but also North Carolina,
California, Arkansas and New York. Amazing Meyer lemon souffle for
dessert and great California cabernets.
</P>
<P>
   BLUEPOINTE, 3455 Peachtree Road, (404) 237-9070. At the moment,
this is gastronomic ground zero for Hotlanta, a bold blend of
primary colors, hard edges and wait staff in black Mandarin tunics.
The fusion food is terrifyingly good-looking on the plate and
packed with flavor. Try the Thai chicken and coconut soup, or the
peanut-crusted grouper atop bitter choy sum greens. The atmosphere
at lunch is less frenzied than at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   BRASSERIE LE COZE, 3393 Peachtree Road, (404) 266-1440. A cousin
of Le Bernardin in New York, this is a genuine brasserie, with
white tile floors and Lipp-like mosaics between tall pier mirrors.
Parisian dishes (onion tart, roast skate) as well as
Franco-American specials (soups, salads, a roast lamb sandwich on
olive bread with garlic mayonnaise) _ almost all good. Perfect for
a lunch break during a shop-till-you-drop day at Lenox Square.
</P>
<P>
   FUSEBOX, 3085 Piedmont Road, (404) 233-3383. No short-circuits
here, in one of Atlanta's current hot spots. Tiny sheets of silver
leaf cover the ceiling, and a boat-shaped, marble-topped common
table makes lone diners welcome. The chef, Troy Thompson, has
mastered a broad range of dishes, from delicate Shanghai dumplings
to lobster with pasta and Thai basil to a stunning terrine of duck
confit, suckling pig and foie gras. Shad roe wrapped in a filament
of bacon and slowly sauteed takes on an exquisite texture.
</P>
<P>
   DINING ROOM AT RITZ-CARLTON BUCKHEAD, 3434 Peachtree Road, (404)
237-2700. The United States is full of synthetically sophisticated
Continental restaurants. This, on the other hand, is the real
thing: immaculate service, directed by Peter Krehan; counter-snob
wine advice from Yves Sauboua; and lean, mean, flavor-packed
cuisine fashioned by the brilliant Joel Antunes, whose London
restaurant, Les Saveurs, earned two Michelin stars. Try his lamb
loin in puff pastry, flavored with coriander, curry and basil.
</P>
<P>
   SEEGER'S, 111 West Pace's Ferry Road, (404) 846-9779. Gunther
Seeger introduced world-class cooking to Atlanta, and he continues
to push out its margins at his small, understated restaurant in
Buckhead. His kitchen is bigger than his dining room; his style is
intellectual and abstract. One example: a filet of sea bass,
marinated in sake, covered with an edible Japanese cherry leaf. You
will wonder whether you deserve such refinement.
</P>

 &HT;    Aparo gets label off to good start
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Ala. _ With his dark clothes, a triangle tattoo of
hair beneath his lower lip and a knit skullcap pulled down below
his ears, singer-songwriter Angie Aparo sticks out in a
jock-oriented sports bar like a bug on a windshield.
</P>
<P>
   As Jacksonville State University students high-five and swill
beer under a ceiling decorated with red pennants, he's hunched over
a green salad talking about life, God, the universe and holistic
healing guru Deepak Chopra.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Chopra) has a great explanation of beginner's luck,''
Aparo, who is somewhere in his 30s but won't be more specific,
muses over the pounding Top 40 music. ``A beginner goes into a
situation not knowing what he's supposed to do, so his mind is
actually operating at a higher level. He has so many more
possibilities than someone who has been doing it forever. Once you
think you know what something should be, you've eliminated the
possibilities of what it could be. That's kind of my approach to
music.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based artist is in this college town for yet another
one-night stand, part of a Southeastern tour to promote his dreamy,
experimental first album, ``The American,'' and the single that's
climbing the alternative charts, ``Spaceship.'' The project is not
only Aparo's national debut, but the first music to come out of
fledgling Atlanta rock label Melisma Records, owned and operated by
Grammy-winning producer Matt Serletic.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of Serletic's backing isn't lost on Aparo, who
kicked around the Atlanta music scene for years in cover bands, as
a session vocalist and then an acoustic singer-songwriter. Between
the times when the young producer first heard Aparo in a set at the
Cotton Club and when he signed him to a record deal, Serletic had
become one hot property as the wizard behind Matchbox 20 and Carlos
Santana's comeback single, ``Smooth.'' As a result, Melisma got the
backing of powerful music man Clive Davis and his label, Arista,
which is helping to launch Aparo with a lavish promotional
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The album, to be released March 7, has been hyped for weeks in
movie theaters, where audiences have watched a darkly surrealistic
trailer of Aparo between previews and concession stand ads. There's
a slick Web site (www.angieaparo.com) and a concert tour,
culminating in Saturday's performance at the Fox Theatre as part of
the 99X Chinese New Year concert.
</P>
<P>
   But Aparo says he's ``way over the whole star thing.'' His
passion is his music _ a spacey, layered, somewhat ethereal sound
that Matchbox 20 lead singer Rob Thomas describes as ``Cat Stevens
meets David Bowie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first station in the country to play Angie
Aparo,'' says Leslie Fram, program director of Atlanta's 99X. ``His
music is brilliant. I kept hearing about him from other musicians,
who all said he had the best voice you'll ever hear. When I heard
what Matt did with him, I was blown away. We rushed the record on
the air _ it was that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Aparo is a rare act in a world of comfy, manufactured pop groups
and MTV. He's an intriguing lyricist who explores the ``what ifs''
with his words, often examining politics, personal matters and
spirituality in an approach that is provocatively abstract. On
``The American,'' his songs address deforestation (``Green Into
Gold''), God and technology (``Spaceship'') and the manipulation by
insincere politicians of the holiday honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. (``Memphis City Rain'').
</P>
<P>
   Aparo says he writes most of these tunes while driving in his
car, using a tool called a Groovebox, a kind of musical
sound-effects machine not unlike keyboard toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the size of a laptop, with a little eight-track
recorder in it and a little keyboard, with about 600 sounds,'' he
explains. ``You can compose pieces on it and store them as songs.
Matt (Serletic) encouraged me to not write with a guitar, but start
going at it on the Groovebox at an organic level.''
</P>
<P>
   When the time came to record ``The American,'' Serletic booked a
month of studio time, then sent the backing band he had hired home.
``All right _ what do you want to do?'' he asked Aparo. The two
listened to the demo of ``Spaceship'' on the Groovebox, while
Serletic tinkered with his computerized keyboard. A drummer laid
down a beat, and then a bassist. ``Two hours later, we had 40
tracks'' for the song, Aparo says.
</P>
<P>
   The unjaded ``beginner's approach,'' as Aparo calls it, seems to
be working. 99X is playing ``Spaceship'' regularly, as are about 30
other new-rock stations around the country. Aparo has little time
to spend at his McDonough home these days, touring in an RV with a
band in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a journey,'' he says. ``It's not about all that stuff:
record deals, being a star. It's about what's inside. That's what
makes a great artist, like (Bruce) Springsteen. A great artist is
somebody who can take what's inside of them and touch the fans.''

 &HT;    A change of pace on-screen and off
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Douglas, the Oscar winner who wore tailored suits in
``Wall Street'' and a chief executive's bravura in ``The American
President,'' stands unshaven and maybe a little overweight in a
lilac chenille bathrobe.
</P>
<P>
   The sop cap on his head doesn't add much prestige either.
</P>
<P>
   In his newest movie _ ``Wonder Boys,'' directed by Curtis Hanson
(``L.A. Confidential'') _ Douglas plays Grady Tripp, a 50-year-old,
pot-smoking liberal arts professor who's a bit more than down on
his luck. Seven years ago he wrote the Great American Novel. Since
then it's been one long drought.
</P>
<P>
   In one weekend, Douglas' character ricochets from one outlandish
mishap to another, eventually donning that chenille bathrobe, in an
unusual comedy with co-stars Frances McDormand, Tobey Maguire,
Robert Downey Jr., Katie Holmes, Rip Torn and Richard Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for something different,'' Douglas says about
accepting a role nothing like his usual screen fare. ``I'd done the
sort of prince-of-darkness roles back to back.'' That would be ``A
Perfect Murder'' and ``The Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, of course, there was my sex trilogy.'' Could anyone
forget ``Fatal Attraction,'' ``Basic Instinct'' and ``Disclosure''?
</P>
<P>
   ``And earlier was my white-collar thing.'' As in ``Wall
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Douglas says, he took a big pay cut and launched into
``Wonder Boys,'' a quirky, esoteric tale set in the wintry, wet
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a movie about making choices and people
procrastinating from making a choice,'' he says. ``You don't know
where the movie's going. And that's so refreshing. You know the
ending of most movies in the first 20 minutes. This one's not like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At 55, Douglas is changing more about his life than just screen
roles.
</P>
<P>
   He marked the start of a new century by getting engaged to
30-year-old Catherine Zeta-Jones, the Welsh actress from
``Entrapment'' and ``The Mask of Zorro.'' They met at a film
festival 18 months ago and began dating last March; she's expecting
their first child this summer. (Douglas has one son, Cameron, 21,
from a previous marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   To promote ``Wonder Boys,'' Douglas chatted by phone recently
about his new movie and a recent visit to Atlanta. He also revealed
a tidbit about his relationship with Zeta-Jones: the pickup line he
used on her.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you first become interested in ``Wonder Boys''?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a great screenplay. Really good writing. It's from Steve
Kloves, who directed ``The Fabulous Baker Boys'' (and adapted
``Wonder Boys'' from Michael Chabon's novel). I read it and liked
it. I wanted to do something heroic and a romantic comedy at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did Curtis Hanson get involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I sent the script to him. We sat down for a couple of hours,
and it became a marriage. He looked at me and I looked at him and
we married. Making a movie is a kind of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   I knew it wasn't going to be a vanity production.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Even though you're obviously the star of the movie, it did
come across as an ensemble production.
</P>
<P>
   A: I was most proud of that. It's pretty seamless between all
the characters. Curtis has an incredible sense of timing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't you a United Nations representative for disarmament?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. And it brought me to Atlanta a couple of weeks ago. I
was at the Carter Center for the first time. What a great location.
What a view of downtown. We're trying to reduce the threat of
nuclear weapons, and President Carter was kind enough to sponsor a
meeting. I've always been a fan of his.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your reaction to the recent Oscar nominations?
</P>
<P>
   A: I certainly love the fact that it's an open year. I'm happy
to see ``The Insider'' in it. And ``The Cider House Rules.'' ``The
Sixth Sense'' was close to my favorite picture of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Farnsworth and Sean Penn were healthy to see (in the
best actor race). It's the most wide-open category in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read where once you saw Catherine Zeta-Jones in ``The
Mask of Zorro,'' you were like ``a heat-seeking missile.'' So the
first time you met her, what line did you use?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't recall exactly what I said to her when I first met
her. But within the first couple of hours, I said, ``I'm going to
father your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: And how did she respond to that?
</P>
<P>
   A: She said, ``You know, I've heard a lot about you and read a
lot about you and seen a lot of your movies, and it's refreshing to
see that every bit of it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you a diaper-changing kind of guy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah. It's exciting. You know, when you have your career
squared away you can look at life a whole new way.

 &HT;    `Games' doesn't leave well enough alone
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, 'fess up. Who messed with John Frankenheimer's new movie,
``Reindeer Games''?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the star, Ben Affleck, who sensed that his fans needed a
little more action heroics from him? Was it the producer, Bob
Weinstein (Harvey's brother), who decided that if you've got
Affleck in your movie, then you need some chases, fights and
explosions?
</P>
<P>
   Was it Frankenheimer himself, a multiple Emmy winner
(``Andersonville'') and legendary film director (``The Manchurian
Candidate''), who figured that, when you have a four-picture deal,
why not go with the flow?
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the culprit is, he or she has taken a tart, twisty
little movie and pumped it up into something that's watchable but
sometimes quite ludicrous. Along with the aforementioned
ballistics, there are too many scenes in which the villain blusters
just long enough to forget to kill our hero (you know, like they do
in the James Bond movies).
</P>
<P>
   The less you know about the plot, the better time you'll have.
The opening sequence _ a montage of dead Santa Clauses _ is pure
mordant Frankenheimer. Then comes the credit, ``6 days before. ...
''
</P>
<P>
   That's the day, apparently, when Rudy (Affleck) gets discharged
from prison after serving five years for grand theft auto. For
reasons that will go unexplained (the less you know ...), Rudy
walks out the gates and spies the babelicious Ashley (Charlize
Theron), who's been sending his cellmate provocative letters and
pouty pictures. For reasons that hardly need to be explained, Rudy
decides to pose as the prison pen pal she's never met.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. Then her psycho brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise)
shows up, demanding that Rudy help him rob a casino where he (that
is, the cellmate) was once a security guard. From there, it's just
a matter of schemes and counterschemes. Oh, and those dead Santas.
</P>
<P>
   It's intriguing to watch Affleck stay one step ahead of Sinise
and typically one step behind Theron. But somehow the two stars
seem too glossy for their roles. Affleck does OK with the action
stuff and the wrong-man stuff, but he fails to find the
unscrupulous survival instinct that keeps his character alive. It's
a part Edward Norton would've nailed.
</P>
<P>
   Theron, handed a juicy femme fatale role, seems afraid of
alienating the audience; she lacks the Barbara Stanwyck/Linda
Fiorentino art of seducing us with her duplicitousness. Basically,
she doesn't have enough fun being a bad girl.
</P>
<P>
   Sinise, however, in his long hair and scuzzball goatee, is
having a blast. He struts and sneers and rants and throws tantrums
and pretty much steals the movie. Even the parts not worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise. Directed
by John Frankenheimer. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and
profanity. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: When it's good, it's very good. But when it's bad
...

 &HT;    `Big Tease' lets hair down but has too many split ends
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To echo the Scottish vernacular that's one of its more winning
aspects, there's a wee bit of fun to be had with ``The Big Tease,''
a mockumentary about a Glasgow hairdresser's determination to win
an international stylist competition.
</P>
<P>
   Our protagonist, Crawford Mackenzie (Craig Ferguson, a regular
on ``The Drew Carey Show''), is the proverbial big fish in a small
pond _ a fact of which he remains blissfully unaware. As he tells
us early in his ``Rocky''-esque tale of unlikely triumph over the
odds, ``You can't dominate Glasgow and the five surrounding regions
and not get invited to L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   So when an invitation does arrive from America's West Coast, he
hops the next plane, ready to win the coveted Platinum Scissors and
defeat the reigning champ, Stig Ludwigssen (David Rasche,
delivering a hilarious parody of a snobbish Beverly Hills styling
god, down to the long hair, gofers and requisite Euro-trash
accent).
</P>
<P>
   One small problem: The invitation asked Mackenzie to be part of
the audience, not be in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The competition's coordinator (Mary McCormack) tries to get rid
of him by promising a seat between Daniel Day-Lewis and Carrot Top,
but Crawford is dead set on representing Scotland in front of the
world. All he needs are some contacts, a few lucky breaks and his
own Scottish stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Fisher is amusingly on-target as the hard-bitten
Hollywood agent who eventually befriends him, as is McCormack as a
pandemic Tinseltown type who changes her attitude on the turn of a
dime once Fisher pulls a few strategic strings.
</P>
<P>
   But, overall, the film lives up to its title. That is, it teases
us with an occasional good line, sharp observation or well-placed
cameo. Then a tepid 10 minutes or so pass before anything catches
our attention again.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the movie feels long, even at a brisk 86 minutes.
Still, it doesn't aspire to anything more than sheer silliness.
Plus, every so often, Ferguson, who co-wrote the script, comes up
with a line worthy of Libby Gelman-Waxner, Paul Rudnick's alter ego
in Premiere magazine. The term ``schmooze,'' Crawford confides as
part of his new insider's status, is a Jewish word meaning ``to
talk and have a snack at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Tease''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Craig Ferguson. Directed by Kevin Allen. Rated R for
profanity and implied sexuality.1 hour, 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This Scottish-themed film takes the low-comedy
road.

Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Frankenheimer loves film game
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director John Frankenheimer has worked successfully with a lot
of big, demanding stars: Marlon Brando, Burt Lancaster, Kirk
Douglas, Robert De Niro. But the club sandwich that Frankenheimer
has in his fist right now is being just too difficult. It's got to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't like this sandwich,'' he barks to an assistant,
waving the offending lunch away with his hand. Ditto the soup,
which he earlier shoved aside after a single gulp.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the Mobil five-star rating at the Four Seasons.
Frankenheimer has a big suite in the Midtown hotel, and he's giving
the room-service food hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can they bring up a ham sandwich or something like that? On
whole wheat bread. Something they can't (expletive) up? A ham
sandwich with a little butter and English mustard. You know?''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant wonders meekly whether a grilled cheese might do.
</P>
<P>
   ``A grilled cheese would be fine,'' Frankenheimer says
emphatically. ``With very. Crisp. Bacon. But it has to be hot, and
that already gives you the (expletive) factor. Where if you just do
the ham sandwich. ... Because the soup was ice cold. Just a ham
sandwich on whole wheat bread with English mustard on the side. No
lettuce. No mayonnaise. Just put three slices of ham on two pieces
of bread with a little butter on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The next instant, he's laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholson,'' he says, referring to Jack Nicholson and his
explosive chicken salad sandwich escapade in ``Five Easy Pieces.''
``I can just never get over that scene. One of the great movie
scenes ever done. And I've played that over and over again in my
life, but I can't do it without laughing. He is unforgettable in
certain scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   At 70, Frankenheimer has created his own share of indelible
screen moments. Laurence Harvey looking down a rifle barrel at a
presidential contender in ``The Manchurian Candidate'' in 1962. De
Niro speeding through a tunnel in the astounding chase sequences in
``Ronin'' in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He's also known for helming 1952's Oscar-nominated ``Birdman of
Alcatraz'' with Lancaster; 1964's intriguing ``Seven Days in May''
with Lancaster, Douglas and Ava Gardner; and 1996's failed remake
of ``The Island of Dr. Moreau'' with Brando.
</P>
<P>
   Now Frankenheimer, a four-time Emmy winner (TNT's ``George
Wallace'' and ``Andersonville'' and HBO's ``The Burning Season''
and ``Against the Wall''), is promoting his latest big-screen
effort, ``Reindeer Games.'' It stars Ben Affleck in the modern-day
action tale of a fresh-from-prison auto thief who finds himself
caught in a risky plan to rob a casino. ``Games'' also stars
Charlize Theron, Gary Sinise and Clarence Williams III.
</P>
<P>
   During Frankenheimer's recent visit to Atlanta, he talked about
making ``Reindeer Games,'' his love of the city and several
potential future projects.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get interested in ``Reindeer Games''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bob Weinstein (of Miramax) loved ``Ronin,'' and having seen
that, he gave me the script to ``Reindeer Games.'' I loved the
script. I thought it was just so smart.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I assume you got Gary Sinise involved since he worked with
you on ``Wallace.''
</P>
<P>
   A: I got everybody involved. First guy we had to get was
Affleck. I couldn't put Gary Sinise into it until we cast the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a lot about this movie that says ``action flick.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, to me it's a character-driven thriller, and that's what
I made. It's got some action sequences in it, but it's a
character-driven thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've always loved Atlanta and said you'd live here if you
couldn't live in Los Angeles. Why the affinity for this place?
</P>
<P>
   A: It has everything I want. It gives you privacy. I can drive
in this city. I like the climate. I love to play tennis, and this
is the biggest tennis city in the United States. And I like the
restaurants. I like the cosmopolitan air of the city without it
being overpowering like New York. I like the fact that there's some
space here. Good theater. Good films.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your old yearbook lists you as a ``highway menace.'' What
kind of car do you drive now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have a Mercedes SL. It started life out as a 600 SL, but it
was made for the Sultan of Brunei. So it has a 7.3-liter,
600-horsepower engine in it. Twelve cylinder. It's quite a car.
There's that part of me that likes speed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So will we ever see chase scenes like in ``Ronin'' in more of
your films?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't ever want to do another car chase again. I don't
think I could ever do it any better than that. I had these great
drivers, and I had great situations and cities that cooperated 100
percent. Both Paris and Nice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's up with your deal with Turner?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three projects we are working on. All depend on
casting or script approval. We are working on trying to put
together ``Across the River and Into the Trees.'' Hemingway's book.
We have a miniseries we're working on on Robert Kennedy. Then a guy
I've always wanted to work with is Alec Baldwin. ... And so we're
talking about doing ``The Pentagon Papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Brando and De Niro. Which one is better or, really, easier to
work with?
</P>
<P>
   A: De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Brando just must be something. Did you ever figure out what
he's doing and what he means and what he's about?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Kirk Douglas like he is on-screen? He seems so commanding
and at the same time so completely full of himself.
</P>
<P>
   A: He manages to convey exactly the same thing in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And Burt Lancaster?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was great. He was all the things Kirk Douglas wasn't and
all the things Kirk Douglas wanted to be. I loved him. He walked
like he talked. He was rough. He did not suffer fools lightly. But
he gave what he expected. ... He treated people well. He wasn't a
bully like the other guy. And he was genuinely a good person.
Unlike the other guy.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   8 Oscar nominations: picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), actress
(Annette Bening), director, original screenplay, cinematography,
film editing, original score. The ever-more-remarkable Spacey plays
a man caught in a midlife limbo in this scarily disturbing,
daringly hilarious, well-written and well-acted comedy-drama. It's
a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully Screwed
Up. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Movie'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   featuring Mark Borchardt.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Smith's documentary is alternately hilarious and
horrifying as it chronicles Mark Borchardt's attempts to make his
autobiographical magnum opus, ``Northwestern.'' The 30-ish
Borchardt _ a high-school drop-out with three kids who still lives
with his mother _ is a not-so-young, incredibly selfish film geek.
``American Movie'' is funny, scary and as compulsively watchable as
a train wreck. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' R (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson
</P>
<P>
   and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: original score. A finely made adaptation of
Frank McCourt's popular memoir of growing up in poverty and death
in Ireland. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their favorite parts
re-created onscreen. Others, who don't have the memory of McCourt's
lyrical prose whispering in their heads, might wonder what the fuss
is all about. (SM) 2 hours, 26 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster
</P>
<P>
   and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: art direction, costumes. Maybe we didn't
need another version, but this one is handsome and engaging. Jodie
Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish, songless costume drama
that holds its own against the beloved 1956 musical ``The King and
I.'' (SM)2 hours, 20 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino,
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. Al Pacino plays the coach
of the fictional Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team
co-owner Cameron Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and
emerges as the best actor in the large cast. (Bob Longino) 2 hours,
50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beach'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Leonardo DiCaprio
</P>
<P>
   and Virginie Ledoyen
</P>
<P>
   A secondhand plot. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a restless young man
who travels with other aimless, privileged young people to a hidden
paradise _ then screws it up. It's hard to get attached to
characters who care about only one thing: their next moment of
pleasure. The cinematography makes the most of exotic locations.
But all the beauty in the world can't camouflage the film's
gorgeous emptiness. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: director, supporting actress (Catherine
Keener), original screenplay. It's a loopy original. John Cusack
plays a quirky file clerk who discovers a door that leads into the
noggin of actor John Malkovich. Toying with big concepts _ the
nature of identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire, the
illusion of free will, it's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Tease'' R (profantiy and implied sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Craig Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   There's a wee bit of fun to be had with this slight bit of
silliness about a Glasgow hairdresser (Craig Ferguson) who thinks
he's been invited to compete in a stylist competition held in L.A.
Ferguson is pleasant enough (the Scottish accent helps) and there's
good work by Frances Fisher, Mary McCormack and David Rasche as
L.A. Types. The satire is mostly tepid and the movie more often
takes the low-comedy road. (ERG) 1 hour, 26 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi,
</P>
<P>
   Vin Diesel and Ron Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry
Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to
make their first million before getting their first wrinkle pays
onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's a bracing reminder that
greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: picture, director, adapted screenplay,
supporting actor (Michael Caine), art direction, original score,
film editing. John Irving adapted his own novel. In the first half,
Dr. Larch (Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal abortions in
his Maine orphanage. In the second, less-engaging half, Larch's
protege, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), runs off to learn about the
world. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actress (Julianne Moore), cinematography.
Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM) 1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder'' R (language, sex, nudity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ewan McGregor
</P>
<P>
   and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What begins
as a hypnotic riff on the old surveillance classic, ``The
Conversation,'' ultimately veers off into nowhere. Too bad because
the picture is as stylishly acted as it is directed. An isolated
British surveillance agent (Ewan McGregor) becomes more involved
than he intends in the case of a diplomat's son and a mysterious
femme fatale (Ashley Judd). (ERG)1 hour, 50 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated. Music from Beethoven
</P>
<P>
   and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, shop the mall, then go rent the
original. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity and drug content,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: supporting actress (Angelina Jolie). Two
fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna Kaysen's
memoir about the two years in the '60s she spent at a mental
hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent of
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Winona Ryder steadies the
movie, but Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath.
(ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   4 Oscar nominations: picture, supporting actor (Michael Clarke
Duncan), adapted screenplay, sound. A manipulative but meticulously
crafted, absorbing and beautifully acted adaptation of Stephen
King's prison novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose
latest prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Duncan, has mystical
powers of healing. (SM)3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up'' PG (profanity and mild sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Diane Keaton,
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   Breezily written by the Ephron sisters and briskly directed by
Diane Keaton, the movie's ads want you to believe it's a
side-splitting sibling comedy about three sisters (Keaton, Meg
Ryan, Lisa Kudrow) trying to connect. However, it's really an aging
parent-confused adult child story in which Ryan tries to be all
things to her dying dad (Walter Matthau). (ERG) 1 hour, 32 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke'' R (sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Winslet
</P>
<P>
   and Harvey Keitel.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Campion's movie is about how we blow smoke at each other
emotionally, spiritually and sexually. An Australian girl (Kate
Winslet) who's joined a cult in India is lured home by her family,
who hire a professional deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel). As the two
face off, the question becomes who will deprogram who. It's a
brutally primal battle of the sexes that makes Sam Shepard look
tame. (ERG)1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: actor (Denzel Washington). Washington
delivers his best performance in years as pugilist Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender wrongly imprisoned
for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though ably directed, the
film contains some fabrications to tell this otherwise compelling
true story. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino
</P>
<P>
   and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: Picture, actor (Russell Crowe), director,
adapted screenplay, cinematography, film editing, sound. Crowe, the
hot-tempered cop in ``L.A. Confidential,'' gives an astonishing
performance. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, a real-life cigarette
industry consultant who blew the lid off the tobacco industry. Al
Pacino plays the ``60 Minutes'' producer dogging the story. (ERG) 1
hour, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Tom Cruise), original
screenplay, song. A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families,
love and forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with
small miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
movie is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of thing you live
through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. (SM) 2
hours, 59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube
</P>
<P>
   and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yakking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' R (profanity and sci-fi violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel
</P>
<P>
   and Radha Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual. ``Pitch Black'' is just
the latest sci-fi rip-off of ``Aliens,'' packed with caricatures.
In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to
explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver
the thrills. (SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' R (sex, violence, nudity, and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Charlize Theron
</P>
<P>
   and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad... Ben Affleck
plays an ex-con who poses as his former cell mate in order to bed
babelicious Charlize Theron and gets caught in a nasty mess with
her psycho brother (Gary Sinise) who wants him to help rob a
casino. With John Frankenheimer as the director, the movie is
always watchable, but sometimes it's just plain ludicrous. (ERG)1
hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream any more, but it's a decent wrapup of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween getup. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis,
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment
</P>
<P>
   and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   6 Oscar nominations: picture, director, supporting actor (Haley
Joel Osment), supporting actress (Toni Collette), original
screenplay, film editing. A surprising, spine-tingling gem.
Eight-year-old Cole (Osment) can see restless phantoms with their
skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film that speculates on
what the relationship between the restless dead and a liaison to
the living world might be. (SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp,
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: cinematography, art direction, costumes.
Tim Burton's latest is a blend of scary swordplay, witchcraft and
self-spoofing humor. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane, who
investigates a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy Hollow. The
movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's single-minded
attacks, which don't spare men, women or children. (SM)1 hour, 45
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' PG (mild peril and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A lame kids movie about Syracuse, N.Y., schoolkids trying to
extend one out-of-school snow day into two. Chevy Chase plays a TV
weatherman suffering all kinds of humiliation and Chris Elliott
appears as the ominous Snow Plow Man with bad teeth. (Robert
Denerstein, Denver Rocky Mountain News)1 hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: actor (Richard Farnsworth). David Lynch
shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film based on the true
story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Farnsworth), who drove his John
Deere riding mower more than 300 miles to reconcile with his
brother. It's a sublime celebration of America at its most
beautiful: kind, welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG) 1 hour, 41
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis,
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lipnicki and
</P>
<P>
   the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: visual effects. Based loosely on E.B.
White's 1945 children's book, Stuart is a 3-inch-tall
computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox. He brushes his
teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such convincing visuals
you'll swear he's the next best critter since ``Babe.'' But his
movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into slapstick. (Bob
Longino)1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown'' R (profanity, sexuality and alcohol abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn and
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actor (Sean Penn), supporting actress
(Samantha Morton). This jazzy little doodle of a mockumentary is
middling Woody Allen and, as such, mildly likable once you get past
the insistent whiff of self-justification. Penn is superb as a
legendary (and fictional) jazz guitarist in the 1930s who's an
angel with a guitar in his hands and a louse the rest of the time.
(ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence, profanity, brief
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon,
</P>
<P>
   Jude Law and
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   5 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Jude Law), adapted
screenplay, art direction, original score, costumes. A handsome but
flawed adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty thriller.
Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to Italy to bring
back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his lifestyle and
committing murder. (SM)2 hours, 18 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG) 1 hour, 16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' R (for a scene of risque nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Broadbent
</P>
<P>
   and Allan Corduner.
</P>
<P>
   4 Oscar nominations: original screenplay, art direction,
costumes, makeup. You don't have to be a fan of Gilbert and
Sullivan's operettas to enjoy it. But a love of the theater can
help you appreciate Mike Leigh's meticulously detailed valentine to
performers of the 19th century. (SM)2 hours, 39 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: song. More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than
families have seen in years. Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim
Allen) and old and new characters are locked in a delightful story
of toy rustling and what it means to love a child. It sports an
inspired, hilarious script and stunning visuals. (Bob Longino) 1
hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' R (sexuality, nudity, and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry
</P>
<P>
   and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy with a body count and familiar mafioso premise, but
with enough twists to eventually overcome its familiarity. Bruce
Willis stars as a hit man. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' he doesn't
seem to mind playing genial straight man to his funnier cast mates:
Matthew Perry, Patricia Arquette and Kevin Pollak. (SM) 1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Douglas,
</P>
<P>
   Tobey Maguire
</P>
<P>
   and Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas plays scruffy, scattered English lit professor
Grady Tripp in director Curtis Hanson's (``L.A. Confidential'')
well-written version of Michael Chabon's novel. Part satire and
part coming-of-age tale of a man already in his 50s, the film is
full of episodes and digressions that are as interesting as the
final destination. It's also a feast for actors, who make the most
of tiny, telling moments. (SM)1 hour, 57 minutes. B

 &HT;    In the satirical `Wonder Boys,' Michael Douglas plays a
professor coming of age in his 50s
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This weekend, scruffy, scattered English lit professor Grady
Tripp (Michael Douglas) has more to do than grade the whiney short
stories from his creative writing class. No, in ``Wonder Boys,'' he
has to deal with his hyper New York editor; a transvestite tuba
player; a talented, suicidal student; another student who has a
crush on him; and his married girlfriend, who informs him that,
oops, she's pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Plus there's Grady's own wife, who has just packed her bags and
walked out of the marriage. And there's a blind but vicious dog
that would like nothing better than to make dinner out of Grady's
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Michael Chabon's novel, ``Wonder Boys'' is partly a
satire of the academic life, partly a coming-of-age tale. It just
happens that this coming of age occurs for a man already in his
50s. Grady, like a graying adolescent, has let his life become a
series of accidents waiting to happen. In the space of 48 hours,
most of them do. This comedy-drama is a picaresque adventure, a
series of events that verge on implausible but actually make weird
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaimed for his first novel, published seven years before, the
hangdog Ph.D. hasn't exactly suffered writer's block since then. On
the contrary, Grady's follow-up book is already more than 2,600
pages long. And he can't seem to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't really make any choices,'' his sexy student (and
tenant) Hannah (Katie Holmes) says after skimming his book in
progress. It's the heart of Grady's dilemma. Especially when it
comes to deciding what to do about his lover, Sara (Frances
McDormand), the college chancellor whose husband (Richard Thomas)
happens to be the head of the English department.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the weekend is gloomy but gifted student James
Leer (Tobey Maguire), the sort of kid who can reel off a list of
Hollywood suicides alphabetically and carries a tiny pistol with
him. Grady takes him under his wing, even as he fends off the
attentions of his manic editor, Terry (Robert Downey Jr.), who
comes hoping to read Grady's novel. Terry also has a statuesque
cross-dresser (Michael Cavadias) on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   For anybody expecting the usual single-goal plot of many
Hollywood movies, ``Wonder Boys'' requires an adjustment. Like many
novels, it's full of episodes and digressions that are as
interesting as the final destination. It's a feast for actors, who
make the most of tiny, telling moments: for example, the drag
queen's one-word advice to McDormand on the key to wearing high
heels. Or Rip Torn, in a cameo as a best-selling author, summoning
up the worst of literary pomposity when he proclaims to a fawning
audience, ``I ... am a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   The chain of mishaps is held together by Douglas' bemused gaze,
peering through a haze of reefer smoke (Grady's drug of choice).
While Douglas has never been an actor of great depth or complexity,
it's good to see him turn in his Movie Star badge, grow stubble and
shuffle around in a ratty lilac bathrobe.
</P>
<P>
   While Maguire's blank shapelessness has left a hole in the
center of other films, here he delivers a real performance rather
than just his wide-eyed presence. He radiates a deadpan, impish
intelligence behind his man-in-the-Moon-Pie face. Downey does his
usual up-for-anything performance, while McDormand sketches the
sense of midlife resignation that gives the movie its tinge of
melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   The film bumbles in its final moments with a too-tidy Hollywood
wrap-up that goes against its general tone of sweet, forgivable
shagginess. But the wonder about ``Wonder Boys'' is that director
Curtis Hanson knew exactly the sort of movie to make after his
stylish, complex film noir, ``L.A. Confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady's problem could be a sly reference to Hanson's own
situation. How do you follow up one of the best American movies of
the 1990s? But the director doesn't have Grady's difficulty making
choices. He has created a movie unlike his commercial thrillers
(``The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,'' ``The River Wild''). And he
proves that the world of a college professor can be just as
complex, but much funnier, than the lives of Los Angeles cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire and Frances McDormand.
Directed by Curtis Hanson. Rated R for profanity and drug content.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A small but sweet wonder for anyone looking for a
movie that's not about teenagers.

   JCPENNY _ J.C. Penney's rush to acquire Eckerd and several other
drug store chains several years ago has come back to haunt it. The
department store chain now plans to close nearly 300 Eckerds and 45
of its department stores in the coming months in an effort to
bolster its bottom line. The developments came as J.C. Penney also
reported a larger-than-expected drop in fiscal fourth-quarter
profit and delayed for a second time the initial offering of a
stake in Eckerd. (DeGross, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The truth of an old Russian saying, ``Richer than the
Stroganoffs you'll never be,'' can be appreciated in ``Stroganoff:
The Palace and Collections of a Russian Noble Family,'' an
exhibition of 230 works of art that opened last week at the
Portland Art Museum in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wealthiest families of pre-Revolutionary Russia, the
Stroganoffs had roots going back to the 14th century. They were
responsible for building cathedrals and palaces as well as
sponsoring schools of icon painting, enameling, gilt-bronze works
and lapidary arts. The name was taken to honor the first family
member who converted to the Russian Orthodox faith, who was
``isstrogali'' (``tortured and cut to pieces'') by the Crimean
Tatars.
</P>
<P>
   A lavishly illuminated document in the show, signed in 1564 by
Ivan the Terrible, recounts how the family came to prominence.
After the Stroganoffs mounted a series of successful military
expeditions into Siberia to conquer the Tatars, Ivan gave the
family a tract the size of Virginia on Russia's eastern border.
Here they became rich by processing salt, mining iron ore, trading
furs and cultivating fresh-water pearls. By 1731 they produced half
of Russia's salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pioneers,'' said John E. Buchanan Jr., the director
of the Portland Art Museum. ``They had to conquer the land, but
once they got their wealth, they turned it back. They built
churches and adorned them with icons and gold and silver
embroideries. They opened scriptoriums. They were not just great
shoppers but great connoisseurs and commissioners of art. They were
accustomed to opulence long before they moved to St. Petersburg in
the 1750s.''
</P>
<P>
   Count Alexander Stroganoff (1733-1811) was a particularly active
student of the Enlightenment. After living in Paris, in 1777 the
count sent his talented 18-year-old serf, Andrei Voronikhin, to
Moscow to study architecture and painting. Voronikhin, who may have
been the count's natural son, was then brought back to St.
Petersburg for lessons alongside the count's son Paul, with a
French tutor recommended by Denis Diderot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1785, the tutor took both young men on a tour through Russia
to the Crimea and Black Sea. On his recommendation, Voronikhin was
freed in 1786, and the tutor took them to Paris for more study.
Voronikhin became one of Russia's greatest architects, the designer
of the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg and restorer of the
imperial palace Pavlosk outside the city. When he returned to
Russia in 1790, he redesigned two rooms in the Stroganoff Palace in
St. Petersburg: the Mineral Cabinet and the Picture Gallery, a hall
with coffered ceilings and marble columns. In 1793, he did a
detailed watercolor of the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland museum has borrowed the watercolor and many
paintings depicted in it. It has also borrowed a green malachite
basin, 52 inches high and 41 inches in diameter, designed by
Voronikhin. He used Russia's most highly prized stone, and the
basin is as tall as a person. It sits on a gilt bronze stand, a
tripod with three winged goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the earliest stone basins made in Russia,'' said
Penelope Hunter-Stiebel, the curator of the show. ``It's so heavy
it takes six men to move. On the base, the three females brace
themselves against one another to support the immense weight of the
stone resting on their wings. The inspiration may be Pompeiian, but
the combination of the art, engineering and ingenuity is pure
Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be commissioned only because an enlightened count
promoted his serf's talents and also served as director of the
Imperial Lapidary Works and the state bronze foundry.
</P>
<P>
   Also uniquely Russian are the elaborate embroideries. Some
examples in the show were made by Stroganoff wives and daughters
for ecclesiastical purposes in the 16th and 17th centuries; others
were sewn in workshops established by the family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1656 Anna Stroganoff designed, and then embroidered in gold
and silver threads, the shroud of St. Dmitri the Czarevitch. On its
border, amid the symbols of the Evangelists and the figures of the
Virgin and the Archangel Gabriel, for some reason she added a
medieval man with the head of a smiling dog. He is thought to
represent the founder of a monastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is shown as having a dog's head because official
iconography had not yet been established,'' the catalog explains.
No matter. This charming dog-man would appeal to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Stroganoffs had eclectic collecting tastes, which included
Etruscan terra-cotta busts, Chinese cloisonne enameled vases and
Pre-Columbian sculptures. Count Sergei Stroganoff was an amateur
archaeologist who let his peasants know he was interested in
anything they found on his property.
</P>
<P>
   It was he who received some of the Sasanian silver that had been
hidden in the family's dense forests. The silver, made between A.D.
224-651 in what is now Iran, belonged to Russian hunters and
trappers who traded furs to Middle Eastern merchants in exchange
for silver.
</P>
<P>
   One silver plate depicts a mounted king on a tiger hunt. He is
shown in royal attire, bow bent, arrow pulled back, as the tiger
roars. On the base of the plate, we see the beast again, now dead.
Now in the Hermitage collection, it is a remarkable piece of
craftmanship and amazingly vital in character.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter-Stiebel, a former decorative arts specialist at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, is also the editor of the show's
256-page catalog, with 16 essays, published by Harry N. Abrams.
(For more information, see www.pam.org.)
</P>
<P>
   The show remains in Portland through May 31, then travels to the
Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, to a site in Paris not yet
designated and to the Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 101-year-old nonprofit Horticultural Society of
New York is sponsoring the 80-dealer Gramercy Garden Antiques Show,
Friday through Sunday at the 69th Regiment Armory. ``Because it's
Manhattan in the middle of the winter,'' said Tony Smith, president
of the society, ``we've organized a display of houseplants of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The plants will be in elegant glass and wrought-iron miniature
greenhouses called Wardian cases. Scott D. Appell, the society's
director of education and an authority on the cases, said they were
invented about 1840 by Nathaniel Ward, a London physician who
treated people with black-lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that despite London's terrible air pollution,
ferns and mosses could grow under glass cases when given water. He
presented his findings to the Royal Horticultural Society, hoping
poor people would begin to grow vegetables under glass. People
couldn't afford that, but his idea caught on: when glass got
cheaper, Victorians bought small Wardian cases in neo-Gothic, twig
and other whimsical styles to adorn their salons.
</P>
<P>
   The society will sell contemporary reproductions of Wardian
cases, and antique ones will be offered by several dealers,
including Treillage of Manhattan, Dan Wilson of Raleigh, N.C., Greg
and Natalie Randall of Kent, Conn., and Eleish and Van Breems of
Woodbury, Conn.  &QL;

 `THE 10th KINGDOM': A FAIRY TALE FOR ADULTS (WATCH FOR SNOW(EDS: Production notes at end of review. Time, channel are for New
York area. Check local listings.) 
(bl) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a plucky young waitress from New York find happiness with a
half-man, half-wolf from a seedy fairy-tale realm who pursues her
through a magic mirror? Could you possibly want to hang around for
10 hours to find out?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be too quick to answer that second question. There's magic
afoot. Real-life network wizards are gambling real-life money
(reluctantly, by several reports) on their make-believe marathon,
``The 10th Kingdom,'' which begins Sunday. Once you nibble this
enchanted mushroom, you may have a strange urge to stay.
</P>
<P>
   At this length ``Kingdom'' is leaning against the limits of a
mini-series, not to mention the limits of viewers' attention spans.
NBC is presenting ``Kingdom'' in five two-hour installments:
Sunday, Monday and Wednesday, plus March 5 and 6. So consult your
crystal ball, or at least your calendar, before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The saga's mythical challenges only begin there. On its quest to
win your heart, this film is carrying one of the most ephemeral
elements a television project can bear, whimsy. And by refusing to
take itself seriously or wallow in soupy emotion, it flings aside
the most potent talismans of the mini-series form.
</P>
<P>
   So some strong spell must be brewing, because this goofy project
succeeds. Oh, it stumbles now and then along its meandering route
through haunted forests and down enchanted rivers. But it lives up
to its billing as a fairy tale for adults, stirring childlike
wonder while providing a smattering of grown-up wit.
</P>
<P>
   The tale begins simultaneously in two off-kilter worlds. One is
contemporary Manhattan. The other is the Nine Kingdoms, once the
realm of Snow White. She's long dead, and the place is ``in a bit
of disarray,'' explains Prince Wendell (Daniel Lapaine), ruler of
one of the kingdoms. ``Happily ever after didn't last as long as we
hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell is not himself when he says this. He's a golden
retriever, thanks to the sorcery of the evil Queen (Dianne Wiest),
who has also put the dog into Wendell's body.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell (in the dog's body) escapes through the Queen's magic
mirror and onto a path in Central Park, where he collides with the
bicycle being ridden by that plucky waitress, Virginia (Kimberly
Williams). She befriends the dog and soon guesses that he's not
your regulation pooch. To retrieve him, Queenie dispatches Wolf
(Scott Cohen), who looks pretty human but has some wolfish
longings, as well as a trio of dimwitted trolls. They all follow
through the mirror and, like many first-time visitors to New York,
begin to have misadventures. (The trolls decide that this
unfamiliar place must be the 10th Kingdom.)
</P>
<P>
   The trolls _ Bluebell, Burly and Blabberwort _ are clearly meant
to be slapstick fools, three stooges with pointy ears and very bad
teeth. Later you'll meet their even more revolting dad, the Troll
King (Ed O'Neill), and sit through lots of bits about the trolls'
shoe fetish. The whole troll clan is tiresome, the biggest
miscalculation in the script by Simon Moore, who adapted
``Gulliver's Travels'' into a 1996 mini-series. (Others on this
creative team worked on television extravaganzas like ``Merlin''
and ``Alice in Wonderland.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Moore more than redeems himself with the creation of Wolf,
played to the hilt by Cohen as a wild-eyed parody of every
overheated man and every overacting ham. He finds his way to the
apartment that Virginia shares with her father, Tony (John
Larroquette), whom Wolf bribes with a magic bean that offers six
wishes. ``It's a standard multiple-wish deal,'' Wolf explains, eyes
aflame. ``No going back on wishes once made. No making five wishes
and wishing for a thousand.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf catches up with Virginia at (where else?) Grandma's house.
When Wolf finally sees Virginia, he is overcome with deeply
conflicted desire. ``Perfumes are not for me,'' he pants. ``No, I
respond to the audacity of a woman who flaunts her own aroma. And
you, Virginia, you smell like Sunday lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the story's first solid indication that Virginia is on her
way to self-confidence (yes, there is a point to all this), she
flings Wolf out the window. This being Manhattan's Upper East Side,
he meets a psychoanalyst. Soon Wolf is toting an armload of
self-help books, trying to gain control of his animal nature.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of other stuff happens, and soon Virginia, Tony, the
trolls, Wolf, the self-help books and the princely retriever are
all tumbling back through the mirror. As the first episode ends,
the Queen is hatching her plans to take over the Nine Kingdoms,
passing off the prince's body with the dog's brain as the real
Wendell. (There are housebreaking issues. Wolf is trying to sort
out his feelings and loyalties. And Tony is locked up in Snow White
Memorial Prison, where baked beanstalk is served at every meal.
``It tastes like an old mattress,'' Tony protests. No, says a
wizened fellow inmate, ``old mattress has a sweaty, meaty taste.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The four remaining chapters don't quite match the inventive fun
of the first, but they often come close. One highlight is Camryn
Manheim's cameo appearance as Snow White. (Yes, she's dead, but
that doesn't stop her from telling Virginia her familiar story from
an unfamiliar viewpoint that Freud would have appreciated.) Under
the direction of David Carson and Herbert Wise, the actors
winningly play it straight, never descending into camp. Wiest makes
a scrumptious villain; Williams and Cohen pursue a memorably
off-kilter courtship; and Larroquette endearingly softens and
deepens his signature character, the vain bungler.
</P>
<P>
   The production, designed by Rob Hinds and Julian Fullalove, is
rich in visual details, both funny and wondrous. And the special
effects serve the story without overwhelming it. Tune in early
enough to catch the stunning opening-title sequence in which New
York morphs into a land of make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments of violence, coarse language and the not-so-subtle
suggestion of off-screen sex make the film unsuitable for the
youngest children. That's another miscalculation. And while the
ending does tie things up, the clear suggestion of sequels may
indicate overconfidence among the producers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a trip worth taking. Literal-minded grumps will
be tossed overboard. But those with a taste for loopy fantasy will
enjoy the ride.

&HT;     MCCAIN'S SUCCESS RENEWS FOCUS ON CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Feb. 27)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign is
reviving public attention on how money influences politics, an
issue he has made his personal crusade since being embroiled in the
``Keating Five'' influence-buying scandal a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush even adopted the cause of campaign
finance reform after exit polls in the New Hampshire primary
earlier this month showed McCain's focus on the issue was the top
reason voters gave for preferring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge, dramatic leap forward for the issue,'' said
Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., McCain's ally in their Senate drive to
ban ``soft money,'' the unlimited contributions that individuals,
businesses and unions can make to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   While Feingold and McCain have long complained about the role
campaign contributions play in gaining access to politicians, ``We
simply did not have the megaphone'' to place the issue squarely in
front of the public, Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   That has now changed, Feingold said, because the McCain
candidacy has made campaign finance reform `` a national cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that he goes forward, he makes the cleaning up of
our government more possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill to ban soft money has been stalled in
Congress for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, executive director for the Center for Public
Integrity, a campaign finance watchdog group, said he senses
``change is in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The achievement of McCain, whatever happens to his candidacy,
is that he has forced America to talk about the subject,'' Lewis
said. ``It's possible McCain will have goosed the politicians,
goosed the media and goosed the country to finally address the
subject of political reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith McGehee, vice president and legislative director of
Common Cause, said McCain's history as a war hero and former POW
gives him a credible image to take the issue of campaign finance
reform to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that's been waiting to happen,'' McGehee
said. ``What's happened with McCain is now you have a messenger for
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's zeal for campaign finance reform stems from his searing
experience as one of the Keating Five when he was accused of
trading influence for campaign dollars.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still describes the Keating probe as ``a nightmare.'' He
says that period was one of the most painful of his life ``because
my integrity and honor were under attack.'' McCain also said: ``The
thing I learned was that It's not only impropriety that counts,
it's the appearance that is just as important.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the Keating scandal ``scalded'' McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an epiphany and pledged from that day on to start
thinking about (campaign finance reform) and dealing with it,''
according to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and the other four senators were accused of improperly
intervening with federal regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating
Jr., owner of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Keating,
then Arizona's largest homebuilder whose companies made him the
state's sixth largest employer, had steered about $1.4 million in
campaign contributions and gifts to the five lawmakers between 1982
and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1986, Lincoln's finances were under investigation by
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board because the S&AMP;L was making risky
investments in speculative real estate, jeopardizing the
government-insured deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators in February 1987 also toughened rules
governing how thrifts could invest their money. In March, Keating
sued, challenging the regulators' authority to tighten the
investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1987, McCain joined with Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and met
with federal regulators to ask them to loosen rules on how thrifts
could invest their money and to delay disciplinary action against
Lincoln Savings.
</P>
<P>
   During the Washington session, McCain questioned the propriety
of the meeting and said he was concerned that the regulators might
feel pressured when faced with the senators, according to a later
report by the Senate ethics committee. McCain also advised Keating
afterward not to expect special favors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the Washington meeting, Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich.,
joined the four senators at a meeting with federal regulators who
had examined Lincoln's records because the thrift was making risky
speculative investments in real estate, jeopardizing federally
insured deposits. The senators urged the regulators to end their
two-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Those meetings embroiled the five senators _ the ``Keating
Five'' _ in a Senate ethics investigation that included 23 days of
televised congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   While the five senators argued they were only trying to help a
constituent and ensure that federal regulators were correctly
interpreting the law, the regulators insisted they felt intimidated
and pressured to dish up special treatment. ``The Keating Five''
became synonymous with the corrupting influence of money in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Karp, then chief of staff to DeConcini, describes the
Keating Five scandal as ``hellish'' for the senators. ``It took on
a life of its own to the point where it was terrible beyond
belief,'' Karp said. ``Being one of the targets of it was
nightmarish.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was chummy with Keating: He had received $112,000 in
campaign donations from him, and had flown nine times on Keating's
jets _ including three trips to the banker's Bahamas vacation home
_ from 1982 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearings, McCain said he was sorry that he had
attended the meetings and for creating an impression of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   He sent the U.S. Treasury a check for $112,000, the same sum he
had received as campaign contributions from Keating.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Senate ethics panel let McCain off the easiest,
saying he had not acted improperly but that he had ``exercised poor
judgment'' in intervening with regulators on behalf of a major
campaign contributor. Cranston received the toughest penalty _ a
reprimand _ based on the panel's finding that Cranston ``engaged in
an impermissible pattern of conduct in which fund-raising and
official activities were substantially linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators eventually seized the Lincoln thrift in 1989;
its collapse left taxpayers with a $3.4 billion bailout bill, the
most expensive failure of the savings and loan debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Keating was later found guilty in 1992 of selling $250 million
in worthless junk bonds issued by Lincoln's parent company,
American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, to hundreds of retirees who
lost their life savings. Keating served five years of a 10-year
sentence before being released in October 1996 when his convictions
were thrown out because of juror misconduct. Federal prosecutors
unsuccessfully appealed the case.
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini's career was so tarnished by the Keating affair that
he retired from the Senate and now runs a Washington lobbying firm.
He describes the ``Keating Five'' scandal as ``the worse thing that
ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini says the ``Keating Five'' incident prompted McCain to
take up campaign finance reform in an effort to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped him to become a real zealot on campaign
reform,'' DeConcini said.
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini said he believes McCain rebounded better than the rest
of them because he was so quick to issue a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never came forward and said I'm sorry I did the wrong
thing,'' DeConcini said. ``I said what I did turned out to be a
political error. McCain came forward and said, `I made a mistake
I'm sorry.' It turned out to be a much better spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranston, 85, like McCain, cites campaign finance as a top
priority. The presence of so much money in politics ``leads to the
suggestion of corruption even if there is none,'' Cranston said.
``If somebody contributes to you and then has a problem, that opens
the senator up to the charge that he's been bought. But what do you
do? The only solution is to reduce and end the flow of money in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there is no buying or selling of votes, the person who
contributes gets an advantage,'' Cranston says, adding it's only
natural that a busy senator will see someone whose name they
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access does give an advantage. At least you get to present
your case. It's inevitable that you are going to help somebody who
helps you.''

   `Mr. Smith' Goes to DVD
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have seen it coming but didn't,'' Frank Capra Jr.
said the other day. By 1939 his father, who died in 1991, had
directed films like ``It Happened One Night'' and ``Mr. Deeds Goes
to Town.'' When he went to Washington to plan ``Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington,'' released this week in a fine DVD edition by Columbia
Tri-Star, his reputation helped speed the preparations. ``He had
some very good help from the Senate and the Washington press
corps,'' Capra said.
</P>
<P>
   But in his film he turned around and, precipitating one of the
movies' more celebrated flaps, depicted politicians and reporters
as venal frauds and irresponsible hacks. Or so it was thought at a
time when furors over movies might involve matters other than
excessive sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   By then Capra was known for films that made positive statements
about freedom and the American tradition. In Capra movies,
individuals made a difference by battling well-oiled machines.
That, of course, describes Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), the
fumbling bumpkin shipped east by a canny old pol (Claude Rains) and
a press tycoon who buys politicians (Edward Arnold) to serve out a
Senate term.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring only to secure a few federal dollars to build a boys'
camp, Smith finds himself forced to his feet in the Senate chamber
for a filibuster that in the none-too-subtle Capra style upholds
democracy against a cynical and corrupt establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary on the disc, Capra says his father actually
wanted to make a movie about Chopin, but Harry Cohn, the head of
Columbia Studios, felt that as a subject Chopin threatened his two
rules of movie making: finish on budget and make money. Instead
they chose a novel: ``The Gentleman From Montana.''
</P>
<P>
   Capra disliked screen tests, preferring to sit down and talk
with actors. Told that left-handed people were eccentric, he hired
left-handed Thomas Mitchell to play the rumpled reporter Diz Moore,
who isn't quite a fall-down drunk but has all the other raffish
characteristics generally ascribed to the loudmouthed scribblers of
the Washington press corps.
</P>
<P>
   About the only dependable adult around is Smith's wise and
worldly assistant, played by the truly incomparable Jean Arthur.
``She was unbelievably difficult to work with, hard to rehearse,
very shy,'' Capra says on the disc. Brash and outspoken on screen,
Arthur dived for her trailer after every scene. ``She was very
self-deprecating, worried about her performance,'' Capra said.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Senate floor, the members carry on like arrogant
schoolboys. Capra notes on the disc that when his father scouted
the real chamber, he found senators' initials carved on their
desks. The clock was locked because senators liked to push the
hands forward so they could get out early. ``We tell them what
phonies and crackpots make their laws,'' a reporter says,
explaining his job to Jefferson Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Alben Barkley, then a real-life Senator from Kentucky and later
Harry S. Truman's vice president, attacked the film as a grotesque
distortion as did many other officials. When the film was screened
by the Washington Press Club, someone was sent to shut it off, but
the place was so crowded he couldn't get in.
</P>
<P>
   Random Hearts
</P>
<P>
   A Washington policeman, Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford, with
Kristin Scott Thomas), called Dutch, and a New Hampshire
congresswoman, Kay Chandler ( Thomas), discover that his wife
(Susanna Thompson) and her husband (Peter Coyote) were lovers and
sitting side by side when they died in a plane crash. So Dutch and
Kay have an affair of their own. That established, Sydney Pollack's
movie drifts off into the nuances. A hard case at work, Dutch is
domesticated at home, which makes his wife's infidelity
particularly hard to work through. Kay is more the brisk, efficient
type. Although she and Dutch don't make the coziest couple, Pollack
watches them ``with a stylistic polish and keenness of observation
not often found in American films anymore,'' Janet Maslin wrote in
The New York Times.

   Who is this beautician from Pittsburgh, and why is she talking

mysterious rosary, candles flicker and Frankie starts acting
crazily in ways that interest the Vatican. A special investigator
(Gabriel Byrne) is dispatched and decides that it may all have to
do with a new biblical text that could undermine the authority of
the church. Then it's up to Frankie to keep things jumping in a
film that is ``little more than a series of music-video style
eruptions'' (Stephen Holden).

   Ah, Paris and life around and under the Pont Neuf. In a great

to contain the briefly flaming romance of Michele (Juliette
Binoche), an artist going blind, and Alex (Denis Lavant), a sad
young vagrant in residence beneath the span. But the affair, a
sentimental blend of realism and surrealism, is no match for the
architecture. Scamming for money, Alex and Michele do some
wine-soaked celebrating in a tale that isn't ``easy to stomach
unless you have a high tolerance for whimsy'' (Vincent Canby).

unsentimental documentary, shown on ``Frontline'' in 1998, a young
Nebraska farm couple, Juanita and Darrel Buschkoetter, battle
drought and bankers to save their farm and stand up to the stress
that ends their marriage. ``Living hell'' is far too mild a
description for that kind of pressure, endured with especially
steely resolve by Juanita, who in the end holds it all together. At

&HT;     PRISON GUARDS INDICTED ON SAME DAY AS DEADLY RIOT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. _ It doesn't have the name recognition of
Leavenworth, Sing Sing or any other high-profile hellhole for the
nation's convicts. But despite its brief history, Pelican Bay State
Prison has a reputation in law enforcement circles as one of the
worst maximum security lockups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 years old, the overcrowded prison on 275 acres in
northwest California has been the scene of riots, the subject of
litigation accusing guards of violent misconduct, and the focal
point of a harsh human rights report by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday _ the same day guards shot 13 inmates, killing one,
while halting what the authorities said was a race riot _ two
former Pelican Bay guards were charged by federal authorities with
arranging violent attacks on inmates, one of whom died.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly the same time Pelican Bay's yard became a battleground
for 200 black and Hispanic prisoners, a federal grand jury
indictment was made public in San Francisco accusing guard Edward
Michael Powers, 54, and former guard Jose Ramon Garcia, 44, of
violating inmates' civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman George Grotz said there was no link between the
riot and the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Powers and Garcia, both from Brookings, Ore., allegedly
conspired to instigate attacks between 1992 and 1995 by inmates on
other prisoners convicted of sexual offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, a sergeant, and Garcia, a former officer, each face up
to 10 years in federal prison and a fine of $250,000 if convicted.
They are scheduled to be arraigned March 13 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Powers has been on paid administrative leave since being
escorted off prison grounds in March 1998. Garcia was later
convicted on substantially the same charges in Del Norte County
Superior Court and sentenced to four years and eight months at a
prison that was undisclosed for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who represents Powers and formerly represented Garcia
said both men would deny the federal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Marjorie Knoller of San Francisco, asserted that
Powers and Garcia were whistle-blowers who were being paid back by
vindictive prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Jeanie Esajian
said her agency would have no comment on the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fama, an attorney for the Prison Law Office, a San Rafael
prisoners' rights group, called the indictments emblematic of ``a
deliberate policy of allowing excessive force'' at Pelican Bay
during the early and mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Fama said the use of deadly force to quell the riot Wednesday
and the prison's own internal review of the incident would be
investigated by a federal court monitor appointed in 1995 to
oversee reforms at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The current monitor, San Francisco lawyer John Hagar, will
report to U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson on the incident and
Pelican Bay's response, Fama said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in a landmark prisoners' rights case, Madrid vs. Gomez,
Henderson found in early 1995 that the prison was guilty of
widespread civil rights violations, particularly with regard to the
use of force and the provision of medical and mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hagar, who worked on the Madrid case, Pelican Bay
has made progress in meeting Henderson's demands for change, but
remains obliged to demonstrate to the monitor that it has made all
the improvements required.
</P>
<P>
   Knoller said Wednesday's riot at Pelican Bay and abuses
throughout the state correctional system were the products of
``specific policies'' carried out by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CDC sets it up that way,'' Knoller charged. ``Basically
they put enemies out there and expect them to behave. The more
violence they have, the greater their budgets will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoller has a civil racketeering lawsuit pending against the
Department of Corrections in federal court. She said hostilities
typically erupted between prison gangs whose members often could
trace their origins to street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nature of the beast,'' she said. ``Northern Mexican
prisoners hate southern Mexican prisoners. The Crips hate the
Blood. And among the whites there are the Skinheads and the Nazi
Low Riders.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoller said members of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white racist
gang allegedly responsible for at least three inmate killings, no
longer were allowed to mingle with the general population on prison
yards.
</P>
<P>
   According to state corrections critics, these rivalries have
been systematically exploited by prison guards, generally to
maintain tight control but in some instances for purely sadistic
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The guards' union, a major contributor to both political parties
in California, has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you find 50 inmate-manufactured weapons on the yard, I
don't know that (the riot) falls within that category,'' said
another corrections spokeswoman, Terry Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed any suggestion that underlying official policies
and practices had set the stage for Wednesday's riot.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments of the former guards were hailed by U.S.
Attorney Robert Mueller as the result of a crackdown on
correctional system abuses that he said had the full cooperation of
the Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments were unveiled only nine days after the
conviction of another former Pelican Bay guard, David E. Lewis, in
a 1994 inmate shooting.

&HT;     MCCAIN'S SUCCESS RENEWS FOCUS ON CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Feb. 27)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign is
reviving public attention on how money influences politics, an
issue he has made his personal crusade since being embroiled in the
``Keating Five'' influence-buying scandal a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush even adopted the cause of campaign
finance reform after exit polls in the New Hampshire primary
earlier this month showed McCain's focus on the issue was the top
reason voters gave for preferring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge, dramatic leap forward for the issue,'' said
Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., McCain's ally in their Senate drive to
ban ``soft money,'' the unlimited contributions that individuals,
businesses and unions can make to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   While Feingold and McCain have long complained about the role
campaign contributions play in gaining access to politicians, ``We
simply did not have the megaphone'' to place the issue squarely in
front of the public, Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   That has now changed, Feingold said, because the McCain
candidacy has made campaign finance reform `` a national cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that he goes forward, he makes the cleaning up of
our government more possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill to ban soft money has been stalled in
Congress for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, executive director for the Center for Public
Integrity, a campaign finance watchdog group, said he senses
``change is in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The achievement of McCain, whatever happens to his candidacy,
is that he has forced America to talk about the subject,'' Lewis
said. ``It's possible McCain will have goosed the politicians,
goosed the media and goosed the country to finally address the
subject of political reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith McGehee, vice president and legislative director of
Common Cause, said McCain's history as a war hero and former POW
gives him a credible image to take the issue of campaign finance
reform to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that's been waiting to happen,'' McGehee
said. ``What's happened with McCain is now you have a messenger for
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's zeal for campaign finance reform stems from his searing
experience as one of the Keating Five when he was accused of
trading influence for campaign dollars.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still describes the Keating probe as ``a nightmare.'' He
says that period was one of the most painful of his life ``because
my integrity and honor were under attack.'' McCain also said: ``The
thing I learned was that It's not only impropriety that counts,
it's the appearance that is just as important.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the Keating scandal ``scalded'' McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an epiphany and pledged from that day on to start
thinking about (campaign finance reform) and dealing with it,''
according to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and the other four senators were accused of improperly
intervening with federal regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating
Jr., owner of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Keating,
then Arizona's largest homebuilder whose companies made him the
state's sixth largest employer, had steered about $1.4 million in
campaign contributions and gifts to the five lawmakers between 1982
and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1986, Lincoln's finances were under investigation by
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board because the S&AMP;L was making risky
investments in speculative real estate, jeopardizing the
government-insured deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators in February 1987 also toughened rules
governing how thrifts could invest their money. In March, Keating
sued, challenging the regulators' authority to tighten the
investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1987, McCain joined with Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and met
with federal regulators to ask them to loosen rules on how thrifts
could invest their money and to delay disciplinary action against
Lincoln Savings.
</P>
<P>
   During the Washington session, McCain questioned the propriety
of the meeting and said he was concerned that the regulators might
feel pressured when faced with the senators, according to a later
report by the Senate ethics committee. McCain also advised Keating
afterward not to expect special favors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the Washington meeting, Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich.,
joined the four senators at a meeting with federal regulators who
had examined Lincoln's records because the thrift was making risky
speculative investments in real estate, jeopardizing federally
insured deposits. The senators urged the regulators to end their
two-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Those meetings embroiled the five senators _ the ``Keating
Five'' _ in a Senate ethics investigation that included 23 days of
televised congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   While the five senators argued they were only trying to help a
constituent and ensure that federal regulators were correctly
interpreting the law, the regulators insisted they felt intimidated
and pressured to dish up special treatment. ``The Keating Five''
became synonymous with the corrupting influence of money in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Karp, then chief of staff to DeConcini, describes the
Keating Five scandal as ``hellish'' for the senators. ``It took on
a life of its own to the point where it was terrible beyond
belief,'' Karp said. ``Being one of the targets of it was
nightmarish.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was chummy with Keating: He had received $112,000 in
campaign donations from him, and had flown nine times on Keating's
jets _ including three trips to the banker's Bahamas vacation home
_ from 1982 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearings, McCain said he was sorry that he had
attended the meetings and for creating an impression of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   He sent the U.S. Treasury a check for $112,000, the same sum he
had received as campaign contributions from Keating.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Senate ethics panel let McCain off the easiest,
saying he had not acted improperly but that he had ``exercised poor
judgment'' in intervening with regulators on behalf of a major
campaign contributor. Cranston received the toughest penalty _ a
reprimand _ based on the panel's finding that Cranston ``engaged in
an impermissible pattern of conduct in which fund-raising and
official activities were substantially linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators eventually seized the Lincoln thrift in 1989;
its collapse left taxpayers with a $3.4 billion bailout bill, the
most expensive failure of the savings and loan debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Keating was later found guilty in 1992 of selling $250 million
in worthless junk bonds issued by Lincoln's parent company,
American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, to hundreds of retirees who
lost their life savings. Keating served five years of a 10-year
sentence before being released in October 1996 when his convictions
were thrown out because of juror misconduct. Federal prosecutors
unsuccessfully appealed the case.
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini's career was so tarnished by the Keating affair that
he retired from the Senate and now runs a Washington lobbying firm.
He describes the ``Keating Five'' scandal as ``the worse thing that
ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini says the ``Keating Five'' incident prompted McCain to
take up campaign finance reform in an effort to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped him to become a real zealot on campaign
reform,'' DeConcini said.
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini said he believes McCain rebounded better than the rest
of them because he was so quick to issue a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never came forward and said I'm sorry I did the wrong
thing,'' DeConcini said. ``I said what I did turned out to be a
political error. McCain came forward and said, `I made a mistake
I'm sorry.' It turned out to be a much better spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranston, 85, like McCain, cites campaign finance as a top
priority. The presence of so much money in politics ``leads to the
suggestion of corruption even if there is none,'' Cranston said.
``If somebody contributes to you and then has a problem, that opens
the senator up to the charge that he's been bought. But what do you
do? The only solution is to reduce and end the flow of money in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there is no buying or selling of votes, the person who
contributes gets an advantage,'' Cranston says, adding it's only
natural that a busy senator will see someone whose name they
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access does give an advantage. At least you get to present
your case. It's inevitable that you are going to help somebody who
helps you.''

 &HT;    `Antiques Roadshow' causing stir in publishing
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything old is suddenly new again. The collectibles craze,
fueled by the ``Antiques Roadshow'' on PBS and online auction sites
such as eBay, has created a miniboom in the book business.
</P>
<P>
   Workman's recently released ``Antiques Roadshow Primer'' has
sold nearly 330,000 copies. Membership in Doubleday Select's
Antiques and Collectibles Book Club quadrupled when it changed its
name to the Antiques Roadshow Book Club. And publishers are rushing
to print with related books.
</P>
<P>
   Projects in the works include another ``Antiques Roadshow''
tie-in by Workman on 20th-century collectibles and a page-a-day
calendar for 2001. And this fall, Warner will publish ``Hidden
Treasures'' by two of the show's appraisers, twins Leigh and Leslie
Keno.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Oprah touch: Oprah Winfrey's impact on book sales doesn't
seem to be diminishing. Until the talk show queen selected Robert
Morgan's ``Gap Creek'' (Algonquin, $22.95) for her TV book club,
the North Carolina native expected to sell 10,000 copies. Shortly
after Winfrey's announcement, Morgan's publicist called to say they
were printing another half-million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told somebody it felt as though all heaven was breaking out
at once,'' said Morgan, who teaches creative writing at Cornell
University. ``With the lottery, you have to go out and buy a
ticket. I didn't even do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That Morgan is an author at all is as incredible as his
selection by Oprah. A high school dropout, he managed to get
admitted to Emory College at Oxford and later to the University of
North Carolina as a mathematics major.
</P>
<P>
   The math course he wanted to take was filled, however, so he
signed up for a creative writing class under Guy Owen, author of
``The Flim-Flam Man.''
</P>
<P>
   One day Owen brought in a story Morgan had written and said, ``I
read this story and wept.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hooked after that,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his stories have been inspired by his Appalachian
childhood. ``Gap Creek,'' which follows the fortunes and
misfortunes of a young woman at the turn of the century, is based
on events in his maternal grandparents' hardscrabble lives.
</P>
<P>
   Things were not much better for the 55-year-old when he was
growing up near Hendersonville. His father worked as a stonemason
and farmer and his mother was a cotton mill worker, department
store clerk and beautician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a car,'' Morgan said. ``We didn't have a
television set, either, because my parents were very religious and
didn't believe in it. I saw my first movie in 1961 in Atlanta. It
was Fellini's `La Dolce Vita.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching TV or movies, Morgan's family told stories
that would form the basis for much of his fiction. ``They would
tell stories about my grandmother keeping a fire burning all night
to keep a panther from coming down the chimney. And my
great-grandmother could remember the Civil War. It was a writer's
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the news: Atlanta writer Thomas Stanley's new book, ``The
Millionaire Mind'' (Andrews McMeel, $26.95), lands at No. 4 on The
New York Times Bestseller List Sunday. His previous book, ``The
Millionaire Next Door'' (Pocket, $14), is still going strong at No.
7 on the paperback list.

 &HT;    `City of God' reflects era's uncertainties
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics should acknowledge their prejudices or find another line
of work. Criticism uninformed by point of view _ an impossible
thing to hold together without the glue of preferences, beliefs,
prejudices _ collapses into summary and recapitulation. When it
does, the abdication of judgment masks itself as objectivity. But
criticism is, and should be, subjective in the fullest sense. It is
a response to what is being offered, whether that be a movie, a
meal or a novel.
</P>
<P>
   E.L. Doctorow's ``City of God'' is a novel about many things at
once and nothing for very long. It is one part cultural
kaleidoscope, one part inquiry into the validity of religion at a
time when science, popular culture and all else have diminished
what is sacred and exalted what is profane. But it is also a novel
whose scaffolding _ or a goodly part of it _ happens to be New York
City. Specifically Manhattan. There is no particular reason a novel
set on the Nebraska prairie should have a stronger claim to
authenticity than one set in New York, any more than the cliches of
Southern fiction should ring truer than those rooted anywhere else.
We have our prejudices. And yet there are more complex
considerations as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manhattan,'' Elizabeth Hardwick wrote last fall in ``American
Fictions,'' ``is not altogether felicitous for fiction. It is not a
city of memory, not a family city, not the capital of America so
much as the iconic capital of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely why ``City of God'' could hardly have been
set anywhere else. New York is the nerve center of our culture, and
in that sense emblematic of what we have become. And so ``City of
God'' is not a linear story of the conventional kind _ beginning,
middle, end _ but a meditation on the disconnectedness of our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, such as it is, centers on a brass cross that has
disappeared from an Episcopal church in the East Village and later
turns up on the roof of the Synagogue of Evolutionary Judaism on
the Upper West Side. The cross thus represents an act of double
desecration, and one that brings together the Rev. Thomas
Pemberton, pastor of St. Timothy's, and rabbis Joshua Gruen and
Sarah Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   In setting out to resolve the mystery of the cross _ a phrase
resonant with meaning for Christians _ the three find themselves
also seeking to justify to one another the meaning and purpose of
religion. Intellectually and in other ways, they encounter false
leads and unforeseen complications. The latter come to include,
somewhat predictably, those of the heart as well as the soul.
Rabbis Gruen and Blumenthal are married and young; Thomas
Pemberton, who is older, is having problems with doubt. In Sarah
Blumenthal _ who is grieving for her father, killed in the
Holocaust _ he finds something more than a sympathetic listener.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is narrated in different voices, but it is the voice
outside the story _ that of a New York novelist named Everett _
that lends perspective to the whole. Everett, whom many will take
to be a stand-in for Doctorow, comes upon a news item describing
the stolen cross just when he is in need of an idea that will
germinate into a novel. What the reader is reading, in fact, is
only Everett's diary.
</P>
<P>
   As a fictional device, this is neither new nor reader-friendly.
Doctorow, what's more, has borrowed from history and documented
fact before, notably in ``Ragtime'' and ``World's Fair.'' Here he
does so with insouciant ease. The century that began with Einstein
and ended with e-mail is compacted into a collage of snapshots,
vignettes, pastiches and paste-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our minds today,'' Doctorow told an interviewer recently,
``are buzzing with information, our thought is contingent, as if
we're a patchwork of Web sites, hopping from one claim on our
attention to the next. Our mental rhythm is not what it was 50
years ago. We're no longer exclusively linear in our thinking. We
find meaning in discontinuity. We're the culture of the short
take.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is, of course, true in varying degrees _ more for
some than for others. Yet the idea of disconnectedness is
double-sided, like the heist of the brass cross. We seek it even as
we deny seeking it. But at the center of ``City of God'' _ hinted
at by the title's allusion to St. Augustine's contemplation of the
material world and the spiritual _ is the idea of permanence,
something other than the material. It transcends place, even New
York, and yet it is hard to locate. Is it within us? Within a God
whose presence seems ever fainter as war and cruelty grow more
frequent?
</P>
<P>
   ``The center does not hold,'' T.S. Eliot wrote 23 years into the
century. In E.L. Doctorow's often maddening, occasionally brilliant
novel, it still doesn't. The old certainties _ of faith, of mind
and heart _ are undone by new confusions of purpose, even by denial
of purpose.

`MIFUNE': A BARE BONES SETTING FOR MORAL COMEUPPANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995 the Danish filmmakers Lars von Trier and Thomas
Vinterberg promulgated a list of 10 principles _ the now notorious
Dogma 95 ``vow of chastity'' _ in the hope of rescuing world
cinema, once again, from decadent bourgeois individualism.
</P>
<P>
   To earn the Dogma 95 seal of approval, a film must forswear such
emblems of false consciousness as props, genre conventions and
``temporal and geographical alienation.'' Cameras must be hand
held, only available light and sound may be used and all traces of
directorial personality, including the director's credit, must be
expunged.
</P>
<P>
   Soren Kragh-Jacobsen's ``Mifune'' is the Dogma collective's
third official production, after Vinterberg's ``Celebration'' and
Von Trier's ``Idiots.'' (Harmony Korine's ``Julien Donkey-Boy,''
released last year to widespread critical perplexity, was made
according to dogmatic tenets but without the group's imprimatur.)
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this should not necessarily influence your response to
the film; you pay your money to watch a movie, not a theory, and
``Mifune'' is, by any standard, a pretty good movie. But being
aware of the self-imposed constraints has an effect similar to
knowing the production budget of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kragh-Jacobsen's asceticism is, in its own way, as ostentatious
as James Cameron's profligacy. Watching a rigorously low-tech Dogma
95 picture and watching a state-of-the-art, super-expensive
Hollywood blockbuster are similar experiences: both nudge your
awareness of filmmaking technique.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like a distraction, it is also, in the case of
``Mifune,'' a source of pleasure. When the sun begins to set over
the rural Danish backwater in which most of the film takes place,
you feel a pang of anxiety for the actors and the crew, wondering
where they will find the necessary illumination.
</P>
<P>
   Simple actions like lighting a candle or a cigarette, or the
accidental tipping over of a lamp, flicker with aesthetic
importance. The range of tones and shadows that twilight, cloudy
skies or low-watt light bulbs impart to a single face seems
revelatory. The occurrence of music becomes magical.
</P>
<P>
   In its stringent suppression of auteurism _ all signatories to
the vow of chastity ``swear to refrain from creating a `work''' _
dogmatism, at least as applied by Kragh-Jacobsen, derives
impressive aesthetic authority from ordinary sights and sounds. The
camera does not create beauty, but rather discovers it.
</P>
<P>
   Kragh-Jacobsen's camera also discovers a story, one that is at
once arresting in its strangeness and strangely conventional.
``Mifune'' is a classic tale of moral comeuppance and sexual
redemption. Its lesson _ that love, loyalty and friendship matter
more than status or material things _ is the perfect allegorical
correlative to its formal creed.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been, I hasten to point out, a staple of bourgeois
cinematic false consciousness from Frank Capra to Barry Levinson.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inspired by Dogma 95's cinematic Lutheranism, perhaps by
Hollywood's secular myth making, Kragh-Jacobsen delivers a homily
on the doctrine of the fortunate fall, the idea that suffering is
the sinner's surest byway to grace. The sinner in question is
Kresten (Anders W. Berthelsen), a Copenhagen businessman who seems
to take his cell phone, his BMW and his new trophy wife (Sofie
Grabol) as the visible signs of God's love.
</P>
<P>
   Kresten has never told his bride or her wealthy family the truth
about himself, which is that he grew up in the Danish translation
of a Tennessee Williams play. But a telephone call summons him home
to a rotting farmhouse on the rustic island of Lolland, where he
finds his father's corpse laid out on the dining room table, decked
out with weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Hiding under the table is Rud (Jesper Asholt), Kresten's
mentally disabled brother, whose inner world is governed by a
private mythology involving crop circles, comic books and the
legendary Japanese movie star Toshiro Mifune, obligingly
impersonated by Kresten. Later, we learn that Kresten and Rud's
mother hanged herself from a nearby tree.

<P>
   Grace arrives in the form of Liva (Iben Hjejle), a prostitute on
the run from a nasty pimp and a psychopathic telephone stalker, who
answers Kresten's classified ad seeking a housekeeper. Their
eccentric menage is rounded out by Liva's younger brother, a
raffish boarding-school refugee named Bjarke (Emil Tarding).
</P>
<P>
   What transpires among these characters is, in retrospect, quite
predictable, but the director and his dedicated cast manage to keep
the story, and the audience, off balance for most of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The brusque realism of Kragh-Jacobsen's style _ his careful
suppression of style _ allows a surprising sweetness to emerge.
``Mifune,'' which unblinkingly records scenes of cruelty and sexual
degradation, ends with a slow dance, by dim lamplight, to found
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even cretinous people can be religious,'' a local clergyman
says of Rud, who is, indeed, the film's designated holy fool.
``Mifune'' demonstrates, perhaps inadvertently, that even a
dogmatist can be romantic.
</P>
<P>
   `Mifune' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It contains sex scenes, both ecstatic and
desultory; a few acts of violence; and the deliberate soiling of an
expensive Persian rug. &QL;

&HT;     PRISON GUARDS INDICTED ON SAME DAY AS DEADLY RIOT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. _ It doesn't have the name recognition of
Leavenworth, Sing Sing or any other high-profile hellhole for the
nation's convicts. But despite its brief history, Pelican Bay State
Prison has a reputation in law enforcement circles as one of the
worst maximum security lockups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 years old, the overcrowded prison on 275 acres in
northwest California has been the scene of riots, the subject of
litigation accusing guards of violent misconduct, and the focal
point of a harsh human rights report by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday _ the same day guards shot 13 inmates, killing one,
while halting what the authorities said was a race riot _ two
former Pelican Bay guards were charged by federal authorities with
arranging violent attacks on inmates, one of whom died.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly the same time Pelican Bay's yard became a battleground
for 200 black and Hispanic prisoners, a federal grand jury
indictment was made public in San Francisco accusing guard Edward
Michael Powers, 54, and former guard Jose Ramon Garcia, 44, of
violating inmates' civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman George Grotz said there was no link between the
riot and the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Powers and Garcia, both from Brookings, Ore., allegedly
conspired to instigate attacks between 1992 and 1995 by inmates on
other prisoners convicted of sexual offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, a sergeant, and Garcia, a former officer, each face up
to 10 years in federal prison and a fine of $250,000 if convicted.
They are scheduled to be arraigned March 13 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Powers has been on paid administrative leave since being
escorted off prison grounds in March 1998. Garcia was later
convicted on substantially the same charges in Del Norte County
Superior Court and sentenced to four years and eight months at a
prison that was undisclosed for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who represents Powers and formerly represented Garcia
said both men would deny the federal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Marjorie Knoller of San Francisco, asserted that
Powers and Garcia were whistle-blowers who were being paid back by
vindictive prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Jeanie Esajian
said her agency would have no comment on the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fama, an attorney for the Prison Law Office, a San Rafael
prisoners' rights group, called the indictments emblematic of ``a
deliberate policy of allowing excessive force'' at Pelican Bay
during the early and mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Fama said the use of deadly force to quell the riot Wednesday
and the prison's own internal review of the incident would be
investigated by a federal court monitor appointed in 1995 to
oversee reforms at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The current monitor, San Francisco lawyer John Hagar, will
report to U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson on the incident and
Pelican Bay's response, Fama said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in a landmark prisoners' rights case, Madrid vs. Gomez,
Henderson found in early 1995 that the prison was guilty of
widespread civil rights violations, particularly with regard to the
use of force and the provision of medical and mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hagar, who worked on the Madrid case, Pelican Bay
has made progress in meeting Henderson's demands for change, but
remains obliged to demonstrate to the monitor that it has made all
the improvements required.
</P>
<P>
   Knoller said Wednesday's riot at Pelican Bay and abuses
throughout the state correctional system were the products of
``specific policies'' carried out by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CDC sets it up that way,'' Knoller charged. ``Basically
they put enemies out there and expect them to behave. The more
violence they have, the greater their budgets will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoller has a civil racketeering lawsuit pending against the
Department of Corrections in federal court. She said hostilities
typically erupted between prison gangs whose members often could
trace their origins to street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nature of the beast,'' she said. ``Northern Mexican
prisoners hate southern Mexican prisoners. The Crips hate the
Blood. And among the whites there are the Skinheads and the Nazi
Low Riders.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoller said members of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white racist
gang allegedly responsible for at least three inmate killings, no
longer were allowed to mingle with the general population on prison
yards.
</P>
<P>
   According to state corrections critics, these rivalries have
been systematically exploited by prison guards, generally to
maintain tight control but in some instances for purely sadistic
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The guards' union, a major contributor to both political parties
in California, has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you find 50 inmate-manufactured weapons on the yard, I
don't know that (the riot) falls within that category,'' said
another corrections spokeswoman, Terry Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed any suggestion that underlying official policies
and practices had set the stage for Wednesday's riot.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments of the former guards were hailed by U.S.
Attorney Robert Mueller as the result of a crackdown on
correctional system abuses that he said had the full cooperation of
the Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments were unveiled only nine days after the
conviction of another former Pelican Bay guard, David E. Lewis, in
a 1994 inmate shooting.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A broad flow from the south will continue to direct unseasonably
mild air over most of the East. Afternoon temperatures near
record-setting levels will be common from the southern Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley. Meanwhile, a strengthening low-pressure system
will produce areas of snow along many slopes of the northern
Rockies as well as bands of showers and potent thunderstorms in the
eastern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The day will begin with thunderstorms developing over central
and eastern parts Texas and Oklahoma as an approaching cold front
lifts warm, humid air. Strong, shifting winds will impart rotation
to some of the storms, raising the risk of a few tornadoes,
especially during midday and afternoon. Farther north, potent
thunderstorms will erupt across the lower Missouri River valley.
Localized damaging wind gusts and hail will occur with a few of
these storms.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will develop over the Dakotas and northern Mississippi
Valley during the day as a vigorous low-pressure system emerges
from over the central Rockies. In the colder air west of the storm
center, areas of heavy snow will shift from the northern Rockies
Friday day to the western Dakotas Friday night. West of the
Rockies, drier conditions will develop, although showers will
persist near the Northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will spill into New York and New England as high
pressure expands in eastern Canada. A front marking the leading
edge of the cooler air will be the focus for showers and areas of
drizzle. Meanwhile, the Southeast will stay mild and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Midwest Meltdown
</P>
<P>
   Snow vanished rapidly over the upper Middle West this week, but
warmth was not the salient factor in the meltdown. Indeed, wind and
moisture helped to accelerate the melting of snow. When air in
contact with a snowpack is moist, net condensation occurs more
readily. In the process, latent heat of condensation is released, a
bonus source of energy for melting snow. In turn, feisty winds from
the south continuously imported moist air, in essence adding fuel
to the fire. Had the weather in the upper Middle West been warm,
dry and calm, the meltdown would have proceeded much more slowly.

   INSURGENT-CANDIDATES (Seattle) _ If the nation's capital didn't
exist, insurgent presidential candidates such as John McCain and
Bill Bradley would have to invent it. Washington state's slew of
independents, quickly shifting partisan alliances and the high-tech
economy make this fertile ground for the anti-establishment
candidates. By CRAGG HINES.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARIES-TURNOUT (Washington) _ At a time when election experts
bemoan low turnout in recent elections, the candidacy of Sen. John
McCain has driven up the numbers of voters taking part in
primaries. Much like Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, McCain is
drawing voters who otherwise might not cast ballots. Will such
voters' interest last into the general election? Yes, some experts
say, if McCain manages to stay in the race. By DAN FREEDMAN.

endorsements in California and portrays himself as a ``Reagan
Republican'' with broad appeal. By GREG McDONALD.

<P>
   GORE-BRADLEY (Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.) _ Al Gore picks up a key
environmental endorsement as opponent Bill Bradley continues to
hammer him for his conservative record that Bradley says was out of
step with Democratic primary voters. At a scenic site at the edge
of the Hudson River in Westchester County, Gore, who has worked
hard over the years to polish his environmental credentials,
receives the support of the New York League of Conservation Voters.
By BENNETT ROTH.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-GOP (Austin, Texas) _ Susan Weddington, the chairwoman of
the Republican Party in Texas, calls Arizona Sen. John McCain a
``home wrecker'' for reaching out to Democrats and independents in
his bid to defeat Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the Republican
presidential nomination. Drawing heavily on independent and
moderate voters in the North and Northeast, McCain has so far
foiled Bush's march to the nomination. By PEGGY FIKAC.
</P>
<P>
   MOSBACHER-McCAIN (Houston) _ A lawsuit by businesswoman and
author Georgette Mosbacher suggests that her support for Republican
presidential candidate John McCain was a factor in her former
husband's cutting off her $32,064 in monthly alimony. Houston
oilman Robert A. Mosbacher was secretary of Commerce under
President George Bush and is a friend of his son, Gov. George W.
Bush, who is locked in a tight primary race with McCain. By RAD

since the Civil War. Beets' lawyers are seeking action in federal
court to stop the execution. By JOHN WILLIAMS and KATHY WALT.

<P>
   BEETS-BUSH (Huntsville, Texas) _ The execution of convicted
husband-killer Betty Lou Beets poses an interesting political
dilemma for Gov. George W. Bush. With the primaries of California,
New York and Illinois still ahead _ states that are less
conservative on the death penalty _ will he want to appear more
cautious than usual and give Beets a 30-day reprieve? By JOHN

and fair-mindedness. But then he became Sen. John McCain's campaign
co-chairman and a target of the religious right, which is out to
defeat McCain any way it can. Pat Robertson of the Christian
Coalition calls Rudman a bigot, an outrageously wild charge based
on nothing more than Robertson's fury that McCain is doing so well.

that he says changed his life. By JUDY HOLLAND.

TIGGER GOES ON A QUEST TO CLIMB HIS FAMILY TREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE TIGGER MOVIE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Jim Cummings, Nikita Hopkins, Ken Sansom &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by John Hurt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jun Falkenstein &QL;
</P>
<P>
   G 76 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A.A. Milne's ``Winnie the Pooh'' bunch via Disney animation
pitches in to help their companion Tigger cope with the fact that
he is the only one of his breed and thus has no family. Each friend
helps in his own way, which means that Owl lays on plenty of
pontification, Pooh is constantly distracted by the need for honey,
the ponderous Eeyore can't get out of his own way, Piglet frets too
much to be effective and Rabbit, who is the most capable, has other
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Tigger is left to deal with the problem more or less by himself.
When Owl suggests that a family tree might be the best place to
start determining one's roots, the tiger bounds off through the
Hundred Acre Wood gazing up every tree trunk wondering if it could
hold knowledge of the whereabouts of what he is sure must be a
flock of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating between moods of euphoria and despair, Tigger and
little Roo, his most persistent and energetic ally, sweep the
countryside but come up with no signs of kin or forebears. To cheer
him up, Owl and the others concoct a letter that appears to come
from long-lost family. Determined to invite them all to a reunion,
he prepares the Tigger lair. (Everybody lives in great-looking tree
houses.)
</P>
<P>
   When the attendees turn out to be his well-meaning pals
disguised in tiger outfits, Tigger takes off into the blizzard on
another ancestor hunt. Maybe somebody is missing the point here,
which is that such loyal friends might be family enough. &QL;

   AGES 3-8 This film will eventually get a stiff workout in the
VCR, but there is just enough message and production value to
justify a trip to the theater, where it has been going full tilt at
the box office. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SNOW DAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chevy Chase, Chris Elliott, Mark Webber, Schuyler Fisk,
Emmanuelle Chriqui &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Chris Koch &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 89 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never ones for complexity, generic ``family'' films seldom are
quite this free of mental taxation. Dad (Chase) is an overly
amiable television weatherman. Forced to wear idiotic get-ups that
match inclement conditions, he still has the meteorological smarts
to predict the season's big snowfall down to the last granule.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning everybody wakes up to No School: hog heaven for
students and bother for parents facing a day juggling the
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of related story elements then insert themselves. Out
to clear the streets and spoil the fun, a character with amazingly
bad teeth called Snowplowman (Elliott) barges around in a huge
truck that like a B-17 in World War II bears the logo of a scantily
clad woman and is named Clementine.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonishly nasty, Snowplowman keeps the small children
occupied pelting him with snowballs and diving out from under his
truck, which brakes for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Dad's teen-age son, Hal (Webber), who uses the day
off to pursue Claire (Chriqui), the school siren. Not too
surprisingly, she already has a bigger boyfriend. Fortunately, he's
also a lot dumber, which lets the very clever Hal toy with him like
a matador with an enraged bull while charming Claire with a
television appearance and by digging a huge likeness of a whale
(her favorite animal) in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Really, though, Hal belongs with Lane (Fisk), a bright,
attractive classmate who has a crush on him. While that situation
sorts itself out, the bravest small fry clash with Snowplowman.
Hostages are taken and traded: Snowplowman's pet crow for a fat
little boy with flatulence. Eventually, the children steal the
truck with an eye to unplowing the streets. A second snow day? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE In other hands (Wes Craven's, for instance), the
snowplow would make a fine engine of death and destruction. Here it
roars and charges but succumbs to general harmlessness. That leaves
the violence to snowball fights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX A couple of sanitary kisses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-6 Parents could make far bigger mistakes than taking
small children to this movie. There is nothing too disturbing, and
the storytelling is on their level. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7-10 The one and only age for this film. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BEACH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio, Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume Canet, Tilda
Swinton, Robert Carlyle, Paterson Joseph &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Danny Boyle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 120 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brimming with notions of taking life to the edge, an American
tourist named Richard (DiCaprio) alights in Bangkok, where he
swills snake blood on a dare and otherwise proclaims his lust for
challenge. In a flophouse full of like-minded European and American
adventure-seekers, he meets Daffy (Carlyle), who gives Richard a
map with the location of an island beach so rarefied one mentions
it only in garbled terms and then only on pain of the most dire
consequences if its whereabouts were to become common knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter on judgment than he is on wanderlust, Richard makes a
copy of the map and plants it for others to find. Then he and a
young French couple, Francoise (Ledoyen) and Etienne (Canet),
strike out for the beach on a journey that requires swimming across
a channel that could hold a shark or two and jumping off a 100-foot
cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way they discover that a large field of marijuana they
miraculously come across is patrolled by guards who will kill them
on sight. Scooting from that scene, they happen onto a commune of
similar escapees from civilization, who introduce them to the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   A life of frolic ensues, overseen by Sal (Swinton), the kind of
person who naturally takes charge of loosely organized situations.
An attractive, charismatic lad, Richard assumes some prominence
himself, scores with Francoise and Sal and experiments with
feverishly delusional visions of empowerment. It's fun for a while,
but watch out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Young backpackers are shot down by the marijuana
farmers, two commune members are gorily torn up in a shark attack,
and there are other violent incidents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Richard and Sal have sex on screen, while his tryst with
Francoise goes mostly unseen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Quite a bit and full-strength. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12-14 DiCaprio brings them flocking to a movie that is
strictly for teen-agers. Parents should be aware. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP It's the old story: keeping them away, if that's
the intent, could prove difficult. &QL;

   TRACY CHAPMAN: ``Telling Stories'' (Elektra).
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Chapman is one of those quiet ones you have to watch. She
speaks not for the cool, who hold their tongues, but for the shy,
who struggle to say things that won't misrepresent them. Her plain
melodies and simple lyrics serve the confessions people usually
can't bear to make.

   ``Telling Stories,'' Chapman's fourth album in 11 years, relates
an epic in modest glimpses. Its subject is the tension between
spirit and flesh. The disc begins with rueful glances at a failed
romance, but soon finds its theme in songs that compare a distant
lover to an immanent deity, both cruel and irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Only One,'' with harmonies by Emmylou Harris, is a
religious mother's grieving song, and the striking ``First Try''
uses a West African arrangement to capture the pain of wanting more
than an ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chapman sometimes seeks relief in her weakest style,
that of the generically uplifting ballad of social concern, at its
best ``Telling Stories'' wrenchingly captures the still, small
voice within that utters what is most difficult.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ After years of relative obscurity, Texan Stephen
Harrigan has penned an epic tale about the Alamo that could be the
first literary blockbuster of the century. The novel, ``The Gates
of the Alamo,'' is being touted as a can't-miss bestseller that
might do for the unassuming Texas native what ``Lonesome Dove'' did
for Larry McMurtry. By JEFF GUINN. Story has moved in ``e''

   UNDATED _ How good is ``The Gates of the Alamo''? Star-Telegram
books editor Jeff Guinn, says it may be on par with ``Gone With the
Wind'' and ``Lonesome Dove.'' Guinn says that author Stephen
Harrigan has written a masterpiece, combining real historical
figures with compelling fictional characters to tell the story
about Texas' war of independence and the famous battle that defined
it. By JEFF GUINN. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment

<P>
   UNDATED _ As the first frames unspool of Curtis Hanson's
delightful new film ``Wonder Boys'' (his follow-up to the
Oscar-winning ``L.A. Confidential''), the picture envelops you like
an engaging novel savored slowly in front of a crackling fire on a
snowy afternoon. It's fitting praise, especially for a film that
largely concerns itself with the art of writing, but the simile
rings true throughout. By TODD CAMP. Story has moved in ``e''

it's a well-meaning, low-budget movie aimed at an underserved

early Jim Jarmusch with an assist from Edward Burns, and you have

if those names don't mean anything to you, it's a good indication

those of you plotting for those extra zeros in your net worth, take

to fans in Reunion Arena recently after being ejected from a game,
I thought of Jack Johnson, the first African-American heavyweight
boxing champion of the planet. Admittedly, it is a bit of reach to
connect the newest member of the Dallas Mavericks to someone like
Johnson. Despite being one tremendous athlete, Rodman will not rate
a footnote in the history of the progress of African-Americans
after he finishes strutting and fretting his bizarre hour on the
world stage. By CECIL JOHNSON. Story has moved in ``k'' commentary

   WASHINGTON _ Well now, just who is Warren Rudman?
</P>
<P>
   The former New Hampshire senator is hardly a household word,
neither a hero nor a knave.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired from the Senate in 1993, however, Rudman
had earned an enviable reputation in Washington as a worthy
legislator known for common sense, integrity and fair-mindedness.
He compiled an impressive record, from co-authoring Congress'
budget control measure of 1985 to acting as vice chairman of the
Senate Iran-contra committee, where he helped produce a
tough-minded bipartisan report that refused to whitewash Ronald
Reagan aide Oliver North and other administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Rudman has quietly practiced law and crusaded for
cutting the federal budget deficit. In short, this is a good guy.
He is not a creepy politician of bad character.
</P>
<P>
   But he had the temerity to become Arizona Sen. John McCain's
campaign co-chairman, and in the grand tradition of guilt by
association, that makes him a target of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the founder and president of the Christian
Coalition, set out to demonize Rudman as a ``vicious bigot'' in
South Carolina and Michigan with radio ads and automated phone
calls aimed at arousing conservative voters. The fact that the
charge is outrageous was irrelevant to Robertson, who never met an
exaggeration he didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also has plenty of nasty stuff to say about McCain,
but for the recent primaries he threw in Rudman for good measure.
The true Christian spirit apparently does not interfere with the
instinct for a mean smear campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his calls to voters, Robertson accused Rudman of having
written ``that conservative Christians in politics are antiabortion
zealots, homophobes and would-be censors.'' But what Rudman really
said in a book is that SOME Christian conservatives are bigots
while others are decent folks.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, demonstrating his own zealot credentials, is
basically ticked off because Rudman, who is pro-choice, strongly
backed fellow Yankee David Souter, a moderate on the abortion
issue, for the Supreme Court. On that subject Robertson has no
tolerance for any point of view not his own.
</P>
<P>
   McCain fueled Robertson's fury by once musing that Rudman, a
close friend, would make a fine attorney general in a McCain
administration. As the nation's highest legal officer, the attorney
general can influence Supreme Court choices.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman says he doesn't want the job, and McCain says he wasn't
promising it. But Robertson is so fixated on overthrowing Roe v.
Wade, the Supreme Court decision giving limited constitutional
protection to abortion, that he doesn't care. He operates on fumes,
not facts.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a little question of money and political influence
here. McCain has denounced single-issue groups like the
anti-abortion crusaders for turning their cause into a business on
which they make money.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson fears that McCain's campaign finance reforms would
restrict the amount that the Christian Coalition can spend to
influence elections. Rudman had nothing to do with that, and in
fact McCain has amended his original proposal to add protections
for independent advocacy groups. But Robertson is still sore
because, he says, the concept alone is potentially ``very
damaging'' to the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right, once powerful, has been collapsing
internally the past decade. Partly, the reason is that its air of
moral superiority and doctrinaire extremism grate on mainstream
voters. In part it is because the movement frittered away its
energies on fringe presidential candidates who had no hope of
winning. And in part it is because a majority of voters don't think
abortion is the only issue in the world and don't want it banned
outright even though many favor some limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and his troops rallied around Texas Gov. George W.
Bush early for the same reason other Republicans did. He looked
like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush moved to the philosophical right to please them in South
Carolina, and they delivered for him. But now he is stuck with
Robertson for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   And it is likely to get worse. Robertson may have been an asset
in the South, but he is like a fine wine _ he doesn't travel well.
In other regions, Robertson's smear tactics will backfire unless
Bush disavows him. Bush says he didn't know what Robertson was up
to in Michigan, a cop-out if there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Rudman can't defend himself. He said he wouldn't
respond in kind, however, because he has a policy of ignoring what
he considers to be ``trash commercials written by a group of
imbeciles.'' So there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column, a numbers gremlin played with my computer
keys. Maryland Republican gubernatorial candidate Ellen Sauerbrey
was defeated in 1998, not last year. And California Sen. Dianne
Feinstein was re-elected in 1994, not 1996. She is running for a
third term this year.
