<HEADLINE> India Says U.S. Assessment of Hijacking Not Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, January 27 (Xinhua) -- India Thursday termed as
incomplete the United States assessment of the recent hijacking of
its aircraft by five Muslim hard-liners, asserting that there was
clear evidence of Pakistan's complicity in the drama.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman told the media here that New Delhi's
assessment on Islamabad's complicity "remains unaltered and in
fact has been further strengthened."
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has insisted that Pakistan had been involved in the
hijacking of an India Airlines plane on the eve of the last
Christmas and said the hijackers had indulged themselves in anti-
India activities.
</P>
<P>
U.S President Bill Clinton reportedly told a press conference
at the White House on Tuesday that the U.S. did not have any
evidence "that the Pakistani government was in any way involved"
in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
"Statements from the U.S. suggest that their assessment of the
event and the attendant circumstances is not yet complete," said
the Indian spokesman.

<P>
KATHMANDU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Minister for Tourism and
Aviation Bijaya Gachchhedar said Thursday that Nepal will take
short- and long-term measures to strengthen the security system at
the Tribhuvan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Gachchhedar told a press conference that the short-term
measures would be implemented immediately and long-term measures
would be implemented gradually.
</P>
<P>
He said immediate steps would be taken to categorize the pass
system and make it systematic, improve X-ray machines and install
new metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
Shops would not be set up beyond the security checking area,
special training would be provided to security personnel and
employees, strict rules would be implemented for people to go to
the VIP lounge, and special areas would be allocated for the
passengers, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said these measures are recommended in a report submitted
Monday to the government by an investigation committee related to
the hijacking incident. An Indian Airlines passenger jet was
hijacked on December 24 on route from Kathmandu to New Delhi.

<HEADLINE> World Arms Control, Disarmament "at the Crossroads," China Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China said on Thursday that the
international arms control and disarmament cause is now "at the
cross-roads," and urged the international community to make a
concerted effort to conduct "fair, reasonable and comprehensive"
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"With the advent the new century and the new millennium, the
Chinese people whole-heartedly hope to achieve the goal of peace,
security and development with all the other peoples in the world,"
Chinese delegate Hu Xiaodi told the first plenum of the Conference
on Disarmament in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"International arms control and disarmament is now at the cross-
roads" because of a lingering Cold War mentality, raging
hegemonism and power politics, enlarging military alliances and
other negative developments, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The Cold War mentality still exists in the world today and is
tending to resurge Hu said, adding that hegemonism and power
politics are increasingly rampant, with gross intervention in
other countries' internal affairs reaching its peak, and the use
of massive force among nations taking place without U.N. approval.
</P>
<P>
A mammoth military alliance has been enlarged and consolidated
rather than allowed to wither away, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of requirements and appeals made by the United
Nations Assembly, some countries have applied pragmatic and double
standards on arms control and arms reduction treaties. They have
even sought to weaken or nullify treaties, in order to clear the
way for research, development and proliferation of advanced
missile defense systems, which will imperil strategic balance and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"All these developments, which have weakened confidence and
security perceptions of states, are posing serious threat to the
achievements made in the process of arms control and disarmament
and will certainly bring about devastating effects to the arms
control and disarmament process in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that preventing an arms race in outer space and re-
establishing a special committee on nuclear disarmament should be
priorities of the disarmament conference in its year 2000 session.
</P>
<P>
According to a resolution adopted last year by the U.N. General
Assembly, he said, the forum should play "a leading role" in
negotiating and concluding legal documents to prevent an arms race
in outer space.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requires the conference to re-establish a
special committee on nuclear disarmament in 2000 as soon as
possible so that negotiations could be opened at an early date on
programs to phase out nuclear weapons and their eventual
elimination.
</P>
<P>
The prevention of an arms race in outer space, including
prohibiting arms used in outer space and anti-missile systems that
will damage strategic stability, is the top priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the serious situation in this area that has hindered the
nuclear disarmament process and is undermining the basis of
nuclear non-proliferation, he stressed. Therefore, he added, the
Chinese delegation calls for re-establishing the special committee
on preventing outer-space arms race and opening negotiations on
the experiment, deployment and use of arms, arms systems and their
components in the outer space.
</P>
<P>
China is also for holding serious multi-lateral negotiations on
nuclear disarmament in order to fulfill the lofty goal of
completely eliminating nuclear arms at an early date, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Growth in New Mortgage Lending in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's new mortgage
lending increased last December after having declined for five
consecutive months, reported the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (
HKMA) today.
</P>
<P>
The amount of gross new loans made in December increased by 36.
1 percent to 10.5 billion HK dollars (1.3 billion U.S. dollars)
from November, which saw a five percent decline.
</P>
<P>
New loans approved during December rose by 10.4 percent to 14.4
billion HK dollars (1.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Refinancing loans continued to grow and accounted for 51.1
percent of new loans approved, compared with 50.6 percent in
November.
</P>
<P>
On the pricing front, 85.3 percent of the new loans were
granted at the best lending rate, in comparison with 91.6 percent
in November.
</P>
<P>
The loan delinquency ratio, measured by the ratio of mortgage
loans overdue for more than three months to total outstanding
mortgage loans, fell to 1.13 percent as at December 1999, compared
with 1.17 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
"Competition for mortgage business continues to intensify, as
shown by the further rise in the ratio of refinancing loans and
the increased proportion of new loans at margins below the best
lending rate," said David Carse, deputy chief executive of the
HKMA.
</P>
<P>
"However, the asset quality of the mortgage portfolio continues
to hold up well, as shown by the renewed downturn in the
delinquency ratio," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- About 70 percent Chinese senior
high schools students agree that people up to age 50 should be
allowed to enter college, according to a recent survey of the
China Juvenile Research Center (CJRC).
</P>
<P>
This statistic shows that Chinese senior high school students
have good sense of lifelong education, and also sets the wheels in
motion to extend college entrance age, experts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yunxiao, a researcher from CJRC, said that it is vital to
popularize the concept of lifelong education among the Chinese.
Education is a lifelong process, he said, and should encompass
classroom instruction, experiential learning, and physical
education.
</P>
<P>
This survey, conducted by CJRC, Beijing Normal University, and
Beijing Publishing House, started in October 1998, and was
distributed to middle and primary school students in 10 Chinese
cities.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Inaugurates Bridge Over River Nile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-
Bashir inaugurated a bridge over the River Nile here Friday
afternoon. The project was carried out by China's Jilin Corporation
for International Economic and Technical Cooperation (JCIETC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the Salvation Bridge,
named after the 1989 "Salvation Revolution" coup that brought him
to power, al-Bashir termed the bridge as a fruit of Sudanese-
Chinese cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir declared he was going to honor the chief of the
Chinese company with "the Two Niles Order" of the first class.
</P>
<P>
The China-funded bridge, 757 meters long, 23.5 meters wide and
20 meters high, allows the passage of ships even in the flood
season. It can accommodate the flow of up to 140,000 cars a day,
thus easing the traffic jam on the Umm Dorman Bridge built years
ago.

<P>
ANKARA -- A technological cooperation agreement on airplane
motors was signed between the Scientific and Technical Research
Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) and U.S. General Electric (GE) company
in Ankara on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, three deals were stricken between the two
sides. The first deal allocates land in TUBITAK Marmara Research
Center's techno-park. The second requires GE to transfer high-tech
know-how to the center and to train Turkish researchers in General
Motors' research centers in the United States. The third requires
cooperation on engineering.
</P>
<P>
The government decided on December 29, 1999 to set up the
TUBITAK Marmara Research Center techno-park, a free trade zone, in
an effort to raise the country's level of scientific research and
development.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- A new petrochemical complex is to be opened on Tuesday

</P>
<P>
Local business daily al-Iktsadia reported Saturday that the

Elementary Industries Zone in the city is to produce 480,000 tons
of benzene, 220.000 tons of cyclo-hexane and 3,723 tons of
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Constructed by the Saudi Shevron Company for Petrochemicals, the

Eastern Asia and Northwestern Europe, while the remaining 27
percent would be locally marketed, said the report.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- The government of Dubai emirate of the United Arab
Emirates said it decided to allow the Gulf Co-operation Council
(GCC) national to launch businesses on the same rules adopted for

<HEADLINE> Barak to Appeal Against Comptroller's Heavy Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is to appeal to the High Court against the heavy fines
imposed on his One Israel coalition by State Comptroller Eliezer
Goldberg for violating the Campaign Finance Law in the 1999
elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak's spokeswoman Meraf Parsi-Zadok said that Barak ordered to
prepare the petition because he believes the current law is
impossible to apply to direct elections of a prime minister,
according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Barak's decision is a reaction to the criminal investigation
launched by Attorney General Eliyakim Rubinstein on Thursday after
Goldberg submitted to the Knesset (parliament) a report on party
funding in last year's elections which brought Barak to power.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg asserted in his report that Barak and One Israel
coalition he led used a variety of so-called non-profit
organizations (NPOs) to illegally channel large sums of money from
foreign donors to fund Barak's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg imposed on One Israel a hefty fine of 13.7 million
shekels (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fine would aggravate the finance balancing of the Labor
Party, the backbone of the coalition, since it had already been on
the brink of bankruptcy with a debt of 110 million shekels (about
28.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Labor Party Secretary-General Ra'anan Cohen, who had a soured
personal relationship with Barak, already stated that Barak and his
close aides should bear sole responsibility for the violations and
the party had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
However, other party officials continued to argue that Barak
only took advantage of a loophole in the law at most and thus the
heavy fine on the party is totally ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1973 Party Financing Law, money to fund election
campaigns must come from coffers. No foreign donations are
permitted, and Israeli individuals may only contribute no more than
1,700 shekels (about 430 dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's electoral system changed in 1996, when a new
system of direct election for a premier was introduced. But the
wording of the campaign financing law was not changed to address
personal campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates for prime minister in 1996, Shimon Peres and
Benjamin Netanyahu, established NPOs to fund their campaigns. In
the 1999 elections, Barak and Netanyahu also use the same tactics.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Create Municipal Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece will form a municipal
police force in the country within the next two months to assume a
large portion of the duties now carried out by the Greek police
force.
</P>
<P>
The municipal police force will be organized along the same
lines as the Greek police force and its staff will be trained at
the police academy, the Thessaloniki-based Macedonian Press Agency
(MPA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 people are to be recruited under a similar system
to that used to recruit border guards.
</P>
<P>
The municipal police officers will not be armed, but will
assume 80 percent of the duties currently carried out by the Greek
police force, such as policing violations of the construction code,
traffic code and nightclub closing hours.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows by 5.8 Percent in Final Quarter of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all of 1999, the U.S. gross domestic product rose by 4
percent, turning in three straight years where growth was 4
percent or higher, the Department reported. Strength came from
hardy consumer spending. In 1998, the economy grew by 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter performance marked the strongest growth
since a 5.9 percent rate posted in the final three months of 1998.
Robust consumer spending and a buildup in business inventories
fueled the fourth-quarter growth, while the trade deficit
subtracted from it. In the third quarter, the economy grew by a
breakneck 5.7 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates three times last year,
but the economy continues to grow at a rapid pace that some
economists fear cannot be sustained without later triggering
inflation.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to GDP surged 1.5 percent in 1999, a
worse showing on inflation than the 0.7 percent increase recorded
the year before. In the fourth quarter, the inflation measure rose
2.3 percent, up from 1.7 percent posted in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Worried about the prospects of rising inflation, the bond
market tumbled. Bond prices fell as yields on the bellwether 30-
year Treasury bonds rose to 6.60 percent from 6.52 percent late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Today's report said that consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of all economy activity, rose at an annual rate of 5.3
percent in the fourth quarter and 5.3 percent for the year.
Plentiful jobs, low inflation and stock and bond market gains have
helped put people in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report showed that the U.S. savings rate was
pulled to a record quarterly low of 1.9 percent in the fourth
quarter from 2.1 percent in the previous quarter. For all of 1999,
the savings rate hit an all-time annual low of 2.4 percent. In
1998, the nation's savings rate was 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Businesses, however, increased their stockpiles to 65.4 billion
dollars in the fourth quarter, up from 38 billion dollars in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Business investment on new equipment and plants picked up at an
annual rate of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter, down from a 10.9
percent rate in the third quarter. For the year, business
investment rose 8.3 percent, compared with 12.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
For housing construction sector, it dropped by a 1.2 percent
rate in the fourth quarter, following a 3.8 percent rate of
decline in the previous quarter, reflecting the steady rise in
mortgage rates. In 1999, housing construction rose 7.2 percent,
but was down from a 9.2 percent increase the year before.
</P>
<P>
The report said that U.S. trade deficit continued to be a drag
on the nation's economic growth. Imports jumped at a 10.6 percent
rate in the fourth quarter while exports grew by a 6.9 percent
rate. For all of 1999, imports shot up 11.8 percent while exports
rose 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve meets next week to decide interest rate
policy. Many economists said today's report would raise the odds
that the Fed will follow up the expect rate increase in February
with another one in March.

<HEADLINE> WFP Launches Emergency Aid Operation for Djibouti Drought Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (
WFP) has approved a 2.7 million U.S. dollars emergency operation
to feed 100,000 drought-affected people in Djibouti, U.N.
officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Drought is evident in all areas of the country," said Sanda
Maina, WFP's country representative for Djibouti. "Lack of rain
has left watering holes at a dangerously low level and livestock
have died of a lack of good pasture."
</P>
<P>
The operation, expected to last until the middle of June, will
distribute more than 6,000 tones of food aid, including cereal,
vegetable oil, sugar, salt and blended food. The Djibouti
Government will be responsible for the distribution of the food.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the districts of Al Sabieh and Dihkil was
made worse by the presence of displaced people from Somalia and
Ethiopia. "The influx of nomadic families into the city showed
their growing desperation," Maina said.
</P>
<P>
"We're implementing this operation just in time to prevent
widespread suffering," he added.

<HEADLINE> New Athens Metro Officially Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The first line of the long-
awaited Athens Metro, the largest project which has ever been
undertaken in the Attica Basin, was officially inaugurated Friday
by Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
The official inauguration ceremony was also attended by Greek
President Costis Stephanopoulos, Parliament Speaker Apostolos
Kaklamanis, Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos and some 3,000
members of the public.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said as he opened the first 13-kilometer Metro line at
the downtown Syntagma Square station that it was a day of joy
because it marked for Athens the beginning of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The first Metro line, from Sepolia to the Greek Defense
Ministry, via Syntagma Square, will begin normal operation on
Saturday morning, and the second Metro line from Syntagma Square
to Daphni will be opened to the public in a few months.
</P>
<P>
The new state-of-the-art trains will be running every three
minutes during peak hours.
</P>
<P>
The entire project, comprising 21 new stations, will serve an
estimated 450,000 commuters daily and ease the Greek capital's
severe traffic congestion. Traffic is expected to be reduced by
250,000 cars daily, reducing atmosphere pollution by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Metro project was tendered in 1987, with the contract
signed in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Annan Confirms Support for Russia's Anti-Terrorist Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan here Friday confirmed his support for Russia's underway
counter-terrorist military operation in the rebel republic of
Chechnya and expressed his readiness to carry out U.N.
humanitarian action in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The U. N. is prepared to start such an operation "not only in
the bordering federal republic of Ingushetia, but also in Chechnya
as soon as the situation permits," Annan said at a Friday's joint
press conference with Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Avdeyev after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his position concerning the events in Chechnya, the
U.N. chief stressed that "the terrorists should by all means be
routed, but the force used for it should be proportionate to the
purpose. "The violence shouldn't cause suffering to innocent
people - - that's a breach of international humanitarian law," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Avdeyev reiterated the Russian government's stance that any
talks with Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov are out of the question,
but Moscow is ready to negotiate only with those Chechens who are
looking for peace.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Maskhadov is not a legitimate president of
Chechnya because he had raised the question on Chechnya's
secession from the Russian Federation even during the pre-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Now there is nobody from Chechen side for Russia to negotiate
with and peaceful talks may start as soon as the anti-terrorist
operation by federal troops in Chechnya is successfully completed,
said Avdeyev.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ordzhonikidze
emphasized that the Russian side very cautiously treats the lives
of servicemen and Chechen civilians.
</P>
<P>
"If there had not been such an attitude, the anti-terrorist
operation in Chechnya could have been ended long ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in Moscow Thursday for an official visit, which
is his fifth trip in Russia as the U.N. chief. Acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin meet him earlier Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Employment Costs Rise 1.1 Percent in Fourth Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) - The pay and benefits of U.S
workers rose 1.1 percent in the final quarter of 1999, the Labor
Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that the fourth-quarter rise in
Employment Cost Index (ECI), which gauges what employers pay
workers in wages, salaries and benefits, was up from an 0.8
percent gain in the third quarter. For all of 1999, the ECI was up
3.4 percent, matching the rate of growth in employment costs in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Economists had predicted a 0.9 percent rise in the quarterly
ECI, which the U.S. Federal Reserve watches carefully for signs
that wage inflation may be accelerating in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Higher benefit costs drove up the overall ECI. Workers' wages
and salaries jumped 0.9 percent in the last quarter, matching the
increase in the third quarter. But benefit costs were up 1.3
percent, stronger than the 0.8 percent gain measured in the prior
period.
</P>
<P>
The volatile category of finance, insurance and real estate saw
a 0.5 percent rise, much tamer than the 1.2 percent gain in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report on labor costs will not likely alter widespread
expectations for a Fed interest rate rise next week.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said Friday that
the U.S. gross domestic product grew at a strong 5.8 percent
annual rate during the fourth quarter after a 5.7 percent rate of
growth in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the employment cost data and fourth quarter gross
domestic product numbers came out above expectations. They said
the figures indicated a strong momentum in the economy and that
growth was pressuring prices.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy setting group,
meets next Tuesday and Wednesday, and is widely expected to raise
the federal funds rate to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin on Friday addressed the funeral service in St.
Petersburg for General Mikhail Malofeyev, who was killed by rebels
on January 19 during a fighting for Grozny, capital of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the funeral ceremony held in the Nikolskoye
cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky monastery, Putin said: "Today we
say farewell to a real Russian general, a general of the Russian
army. It has always been so throughout the entire history of our
country that it only takes Russia to get weaker for scum of every
sort to pop up and try to beat our country, tear it into pieces,
and force it to its knees."
</P>
<P>
"No one has ever succeeded nor will ever succeed in doing so,
because simple Russian people have always stood in the way," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Giving "the moral importance to this event, the acting
president canceled all his scheduled meetings and events in Moscow
to come to St. Petersburg and pay his respects to a general killed
in action in the performance of his duty," Putin press secretary
Alexei Gromov told journalists.
</P>
<P>
Putin expressed his condolences to the general's widow and
later stood at the coffin together with Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. Moscow time Malofeyev was buried in the monastery
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Rector of the cathedral Father Nazari and Archpriest Father
Bogdan conducted the service.
</P>
<P>
After the funeral, Putin and his entourage flew back to Moscow
Thursday evening.

<HEADLINE> Somali Gunmen Ambush Food Convoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were
killed and 11 others wounded on Friday when Somali gunmen ambushed
a large food aid convoy at Buqdah village in central region of
Hiran, about 286 Kilometers north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The food aid of maize and cooking oil donated by
CARE-International was destined to Tieglow district of Bakol
region where serious famine has lately been reported.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness in Buqdah village, about five battle
wagons and nearly 60 armed men on board the vehicles exchanged
heavy gunfire with militiamen in the village.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said the security guards of the aid convoy lost
four of their men while several others sustained gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
One more from the security staff also died of his wounds in
Bulo Burte town, about 46 Kilometers west of Buqdah village, where
the wounded were rushed for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses confirmed that four non-combat villagers also
died during the exchange of the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
One resident of Buqdah village said the shooting began after a
rocket- propelled grenade hit one of the battle wagons used by the
security guards of the food convoy, destroying it on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said, however, the security guards probably
suspected gunmen wandering in the sandy lanes of the village and
therefore started the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the food convoy of more than 15 heavy duty trucks
and a tanker carrying fuel later returned back to Bulo Burte
district of Hiran region for security reasons.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Two senior Tanzanian
military officials left here Friday for Bujumbura, Burundi, to
review with their counterparts the security situation in the
border areas.
</P>
<P>
The two-day visit to Burundi by Minister of Defense Edgar
Maokola-Majogo and Chief of Defense Forces General Robert Mboma
was also "aimed at strengthening good relations between the two
neighboring countries", spokesman for the Defense Ministry
Brigadier General S.C. Rioba said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military leaders of the two countries will
discuss the increased influx of Burundian refugees into western
part of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is just an ordinary one and is a follow-up to the
previous meeting which was held last August in Tanzania," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania complains that the influx of refugees has been
creating a lot of inconveniences to local residents near the
refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
Criminal incidents like robbery have increased in villages,
especially in the border areas, because some of the refugees came
into Tanzania while armed.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees, more than 20,000 Burundian refugees have fled to
Tanzania since the beginning of this year to join more than
420,000 refugees already sheltered in the camps.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Parliament Endorses Budget for Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian parliament on Friday
approved a 1. 056 billion U.S. dollar budget for the year 2000,
setting targets of four percent real growth in the gross domestic
product (GDP) and reducing inflation to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The budget presented by Minister of Finance and Economic
Development Katele Kalumba also wants foreign reserve to rise by
at least 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve these targets we will need to limit the domestic
deficit to 1.3 percent of GDP," the budget said.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas in 1998 our GDP shrank by two percent, in 1999 it grew
by two percent. Similarly, inflation fell from 30.6 percent at the
end of 1998 to 20.6 percent at the end of 1999. Our international
reserves also rose by five percent," the budget said.
</P>
<P>
The country's external debt stock at the end of 1999 was
estimated at 6. 5 billion dollars, compared with the stock of 6.98
billion dollars at the end of 1998, according to the budget.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the government's macro-economic objectives over the
year 2000, the minister said the government will continue to
provide the necessary legal, regulatory and stable macro-economic
environment conducive to investment and development of a vibrant
private sector.
</P>
<P>
The government also provides tax incentives to identified
sectors of the economy to enhance production.
</P>
<P>
"The tax incentives are intended to reduce costs of production
and improve competitiveness of our industries as we open our
borders through the proposed Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) Free Trade Areas," said the budget.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that economic growth and prosperity for
Zambia lies in sound economic management, macro-economic
stability, prudent finance, productive enterprise, zero tolerance
for bribery and corruption at all levels and social harmony.

to come to St. Petersburg and pay his respects to a general killed
in action in the performance of his duty," Putin press secretary

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred officers seized
67,000 pirate discs worth 1.2 million HK dollars (150,000 U.S.
dollars) in 45 retail shops in a two-day anti-piracy operation
starting Thursday in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
During the operation, jointly conducted by the Special Task
Force of Customs and Excise Department and the Intellectual
Property Investigation Bureau, 31 people, aged between 16 and 62,
were arrested, said a spokesman for the Customs and Excise
Department.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Special Task Force in June last
year, the piracy problem has been greatly suppressed as a result
of the repeated raid strategy, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The number of retail outlets has reduced from about 1,000 in
June 1999 to around 100 at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated the customs' determination to fight
against piracy activities, saying that similar joint-operations
will be mounted later on, in hopes of driving out piracy
completely.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong Kong's Copyright Ordinance, the maximum
penalty for selling pirate discs would be a fine of 50,000 HK
dollars (6,410 U.S. dollars) per disc and an imprisonment for four
years.

<HEADLINE> Second American Kidnapped in Yemen in 2 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- An unidentified United States
citizen was kidnapped on Thursday by tribesmen in southern Yemen,
sources here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The American was kidnapped in front of a gas station in Shabwa
province. The identity and demands of the kidnappers were not
known.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a U.S. citizen was kidnapped by tribesmen in the
southeaster province of Marib and taken to mountainous area in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni tribesmen often kidnap foreign workers or tourists to
press for economic or political concessions, like better
infrastructure and release of jailed tribesmen, from their
government. Hostages are mostly treated well and released unharmed.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
But in December 1998, Islamic extremists seized 16 westerners in
a kidnapping that ended with three Britons and an Australian killed
in a shootout with Yemeni soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
As its tourism industry was hard hit by kidnapping, Yemen set up
special courts to try kidnappers and introduce the death penalty
for the offenders.  
</P>
<P>
A special security unit was established last November to combat
terrorism.

that persist even as the economy continues to boom.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japanese, Russian Leaders Agree to Hold Summit Soon: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and acting Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed Friday
to hold a bilateral summit at an early date, the Kyodo News
service reported.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi and Putin reached the agreement during a telephone
conversation, the first between the two leaders since Putin was
appointed as acting Russian president following President Boris
Yeltsin's resignation on December 31, last year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to hold the bilateral summit before
Japan hosts the Group of Eight (G-8) summit of major nations in
July in Nago, Okinawa Prefecture, the report quoted government
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Putin told Obuchi that Russia will maintain its policy of
developing ties with Japan, adding he will continue efforts to
conclude a peace treaty and succeed agreements made by Yeltsin and
Japanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Obuchi on Monday, Putin said Russia-Japan
ties remain high on a list of Moscow's priorities.
</P>
<P>
Japan hopes the forthcoming summit will provide fresh momentum
to a 1997 accord hammered out by Yeltsin and then Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at an informal summit in Siberia's
Krasnoyarsk.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, both sides pledged to strive toward resolving
a long-standing bilateral territorial dispute and conclude a peace
treaty by the end of 2000.

HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three crew members of
a cargo vessel was rescued in South China Sea in a rescue
operation mounted by the Hong Kong Maritime Rescue Coordination
Center Thursday, said a spokesman for the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region today.
</P>
<P>
The center immediately mounted a search and rescue operation by
alerting ships in the vicinity to locate the Cambodia-registered
log carrier after it was informed of the ship's emergence
situation at around 4:00 am Thursday, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At 7:50 pm, the center established communications with the
motor tanker "Kwan Siu," which had responded to the appeal and
arrived at the scene, about 429 nautical miles southeast from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 117-meter-long cargo vessel named "Yiew Ying" was listing
35 degrees to starboard amid northeasterly wind of force seven to
eight and very rough sea, according to a report of "Kwan Siu."
</P>
<P>
Of the 23 crew members, 22 Filipinos and one Burmese, 14
boarded "Kwan Siu" and the others boarded "Tsushima," a Japanese
vessel, which later joined the operation.
</P>
<P>
At around 9:00 am today, as "Yiew Ying" continued to take in
water, the captain decided to abandon the ship.

<HEADLINE> HK's Total Exports Grow for Sixth Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports in
December 1999 grew by 15.1 percent over a year earlier to 123.7
billion HK dollars (15.9 billion U.S. dollars), the Hong Kong
Census and Statistics Department said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth consecutive month which saw a rise in the
total exports, comprising re-exports and domestic exports.
</P>
<P>
Within the total, the value of re-exports rose by 16.4 percent
to 107.4 billion HK dollars (13.8 billion U.S. dollars), and that
of domestic exports picked up by 7.3 percent to 16.3 billion HK
dollars (2.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the value of imports increased by 17.0 percent over
a year earlier to 133.6 billion HK dollars (17.1 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
For 1999 as a whole, the value of total exports increased by 0.
1 percent on a yearly basis and that of imports fell by 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The visible trade deficit of 1999 amounted to 43.7 billion HK
dollars (5.6 billion U.S. dollars), much smaller than the deficit
of 81.4 billion HK dollars (10.4 billion U.S. dollars) recorded in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the fourth quarter of 1999 with the third quarter on
a seasonally adjusted basis, the value of total exports rose by 4.
0 percent while that of imports by 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region said that after the distinct upturn in the
third quarter of 1999, export growth accelerated markedly further
towards the year-end, more notably in December.
</P>
<P>
Underlying this robust performance was the continued upsurge in
regional demand as well as the stronger import absorption in the
United States and Europe, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But there might have been some advancement in shipments to
avoid possible problems from Y2K at the turn of the year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that apart from the accelerated growth in
re-exports in December, there was also a distinct pick-up in
intake of imports for local use, which signified a further
strengthening up in domestic demand as the recovery process
gathered pace.

<HEADLINE> New Law on Marine Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's newly revised Marine
Environmental Protection Law will go into effect from April 1 this
year, a environmental protection official said today.
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the law were passed by China's top legislature
last December designed to better protect marine environment and
promote exploration of the marine resources.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuqing, deputy director of State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA), told reporters today that the Law will be
more effective in protecting the marine environment as it provides
a new legal basis for implementing relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
China's marine environment has been facing serious challenges
along polluted coastal areas. The marine eco-system has been
seriously damaged, the deputy director said.
</P>
<P>
The new law stipulates that government departments take
necessary measures to protect marine life. A new clause in the Law
stipulates protection of marine ecology, which will protect
endangered marine species.
</P>
<P>
China has 18,000 km of coastline with more than three million
sq km of sea areas under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Serious pollution in recent years has led to many problems in
the marine environment. There were some 193 instances of red tides
in China's coastal areas from 1990-1998, costing the nation
millions of U.S. dollars in economic losses annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese environmental
protection official said here today that China will take measures
this year to protect the country's marine environment and promote
sustainable exploitation of its marine resources.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuqing, deputy director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA), said a number of regulations and
polices will be formulated by environmental protection agencies in
China to facilitate the enforcement of the newly revised Marine
Environment Protection Law.
</P>
<P>
Coordinated efforts will be made by various governmental
departments such as the SEPA, the State Oceanic Administration and
the Marine Safety Administration of China to launch law
enforcement inspection to control vessel-related marine pollution.
</P>
<P>
Wang also urged local environment departments to improve
administration of coastal areas and protect marine eco-systems.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA will formulate a program to control pollution in the
Bohai Sea, China's most polluted sea, and in other coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
China's newly-amended Marine Environment Protection Law will
take effect from April 1 and provide a better legal basis for
tougher law enforcement, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China has 18,000 km of coastline, with approximately three
million square kilometers of sea areas under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
There has been serious marine pollution in recent years. From
1990-1998, for example, 193 red tides were reported, resulting in
hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in economic losses annually.

<HEADLINE> "Taiwan Independence" Will Not Mean Peace, Vice-Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen today
called on compatriots across the Taiwan Straits to unite and
strive for peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan independence" absolutely will not mean peace but a war
between the two sides of the straits, and compatriots both in
Taiwan and the mainland must make concerted efforts to fight
against it, Qian said at a forum here.
</P>
<P>
The forum was held to mark the fifth anniversary of the eight-
point proposition made by President Jiang Zemin on China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government
will never make compromise on safeguarding national sovereignty
and territorial integrity, Qian said, warning that separatists in
Taiwan must not "play with fire."
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to carry out the basic principle of "peaceful
reunification, and one country, two systems" and the eight-point
proposition put forward by President Jiang Zemin for an early
reunification of the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier hailed Jiang's reunification statement as
realizing Deng Xiaoping's principal concept of "peaceful
reunification, and one country, two systems", saying that it is
the guiding document and principle for resolving the Taiwan issue
at the present stage.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent return of Macao to the motherland, following
that of Hong Kong in 1997, is one great and firm step closer to
the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the Chinese government has had to put up
heated and repeated struggles against Taiwan's separatist force
led by Lee Teng-hui, Qian said, adding that Lee has told the world
his ultimate goal to split the motherland by advertising the "two-
state" theory.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said China's anti-separatist campaign has won
widespread support around the world. There is no country in the
world that supports or chimes in with Lee's "two-state" remarks.
Lee has failed to overturn the one China principle, but instead,
has turned himself a "trouble maker" for the international
community, said Qian.

<TEXT>
<P>
The vice-premier stressed that to realize peaceful
reunification, both sides of the Taiwan Straits must adhere to the
one China principle and seek ways to solve the differences between
them through equal consultations.
</P>
<P>
Policies dealing with the Taiwan issue will be more flexible
than those for Hong Kong and Macao to fully meet the aspirations
and demands of compatriots in Taiwan, said Qian, who is confident
that the Taiwan compatriots will finally come to believe that
reunification under the "one country, two systems" principle is
the best way to safeguard their interests.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier reiterated that the mainland will continue to
promote economic and cultural exchanges, and work for the
establishment of direct links in trade, transportation and postal
services between the two sides of the straits.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that no matter what happens, the legitimate
rights and interests of Taiwan investors will be protected in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The mainland is willing to see Taiwan join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) as a separate customs territory following the
mainland's entry, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait talks under the one China principle are a must to
seek ways for the peaceful reunification, the vice-premier said.
Topics of the talks can be the "three direct links," economic
relations after the WTO entry of the two sides, the international
space for economic, cultural and social activities of Taiwan that
suits it, and the political status of the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of
China, and all foreign countries should respect the feeling and
will of the Chinese people including Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
China firmly opposes any foreign force to sell advanced weapons
to Taiwan, or sell or transfer to Taiwan technologies related to
the so-call theater missile defense system. China also strongly
opposes the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act of the U.S. Congress,
the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, was present at the forum.

<HEADLINE> Barak Nixes Plans of Three-way Summit in Davos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak decided Friday morning to cancel the plan to attend the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on extensive diplomatic activities
expected next week, especially the accelerated talks with the
Palestinians to reach a final-status framework agreement, a
statement issued by Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Barak also wants time to prepare the
meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on Sunday on
accelerating Israeli peace moves with the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts believe Barak skipped the Davos trip in order
to avoid a proposed three-way summit there between him, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Clinton are to show up in Davos to participate in the
annual conference of the world's leading industrialists and
politicians in the Swiss resort.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians hope to hold such a tripartite summit to boost
relations between the leaders in the hope that it will help reach
the framework agreement before the target deadline of February 13.
</P>
<P>
But Barak has little interest in such a plan. His spokesman Gadi
Baltiansky said earlier this week that Barak wants to meet with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But, Baltiansky said, as the U.S. president will be in Davos for
only a few hours on Saturday morning and Barak will arrive that
night, such a meeting is impossible.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak has promised that marathon talks will begin early
next week between top Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in an
effort to reach the framework agreement as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Estrada to Reconsider Peace Process Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Friday he will study a call made by some lawmakers
for him to reconsider his stand on setting a June deadline for the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the Presidential Palace,
Estrada said he cannot afford to let the peace process drag on, as
the people are the ones who continue to suffer if it proceeds
without substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
Estrada earlier extended the December 31, 1999 deadline he had
set for the peace process with armed rebel groups to another six
months, or up to June this year.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that his administration will continue to exhaust
all efforts to ensure just, lasting peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I will still think it over," he said of the proposal to
reconsider his deadline.
</P>
<P>
Estrada noted that while the government has forged peace pacts
with the Moro National Liberation Front and rightist rebels, the
process has been dragging on for 14 years with other armed groups.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason why we have to prolong this because if
we prolong this, we will be prolonging the suffering of the people
of Mindanao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao is the base of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, an
armed group currently conducting formal peace negotiations with
the government.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has vowed to transform Mindanao into the country's next
food basket by pouring government resources in the region and
accelerating the pace of infrastructure projects there.
</P>
<P>
Peace and order is a key element in ensuring economic growth in
Mindanao and the rest of the country, he stressed.

MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Labor Secretary
Bienvenido Laguesma said Friday that the Philippines is seeking to
improve the employability of its workers and reduce the pain and
disruptions related to severance of employment.
</P>
<P>
In a speech before an international labor rights conference in
Manila, Laguesma said labor issues are central concerns of the
Philippine government as well as both the United Nations and the
International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines has always safeguarded the right to
work and healthy work conditions, the freedom of association and
collective bargaining, and social security protection.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma stressed that in the Philippines, employment is
central to the realization of the fundamental rights at work.
</P>
<P>
"The blueprint for the overall employment strategy has been
laid down in our Comprehensive Employment Plan which government,
along with the tripartite partners, adopted last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said the government has strengthened its human
resource development programs and labor information system to
facilitate school-to-work and job-to-job transitions and to
develop a better matching system between labor supply and labor
demand.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to improve the employability of workers, minimize
the period of transitional unemployment, facilitate labor mobility,
and reduce the cost of disruptions related to severance of
employer-employee relations," he said.

STOCKHOLM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Senior representatives of 45
governments stated Friday in the Stockholm holocaust conference
declaration that the international community is liable for
reminding mankind of the terrible suffering of Nazi victims, and
to prevent historical tragedies from repeating.
</P>
<P>
Their declaration was part of the conclusion of a three-day
conference entitled, Stockholm International Forum on the

<P>
The declaration stated that the holocaust, planned and carried
out by the Nazis, fundamentally challenged the foundations of
civilization. After half a century, it remains an event with a
profound impact.

The international community shares a solemn responsibility to
strengthen the moral commitment of all peoples, and the political
commitment of all governments, to ensure that future generations
understand the causes of the holocaust and reflect upon its
consequences.

<P>
It urged governments to promote education, remembrance and
research about the holocaust, with emphasis placed on education in
schools and universities.
</P>

including an annual day of Holocaust Remembrance. The Swedish
government has designated January 27, the day when Auschwitz death
camp was liberated in 1945, as the day of Holocaust Remembrance.
</P>
<P>
It also called on all necessary steps to facilitate the opening
of archives in order to ensure that all documents bearing on the
holocaust are available to researchers.

<HEADLINE> China Drafts Law to Prevent Occupational Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The drafting of an Occupational
Disease Prevention Law aims to prevent, control and eliminate
occupational hazards and diseases and protect the health of
workers, according to an official from the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
In China with a work force of nearly 700 million, occupational
hazards have become a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Health show that
over 420,000 Chinese workers suffered from pneumoconiosis, killing
over 130,000 people. "What's worrying is that some rural
enterprises and foreign joint ventures have become breeding
grounds for occupational diseases," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that over 80 percent of China's rural
enterprises are occupational hazards and 15 percent of workers
suffer from occupational diseases of one kind or another.
</P>
<P>
The Draft Law stipulates that employers should notify potential
employees of the possible occupational hazards and give their
employees regular health check-ups.

<HEADLINE> Former Shas Leader Appeals Against Fraud Conviction in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The former leader of an ultra-
Orthodox party Friday filed an appeal against his conviction of
fraud in the Supreme Court of Israel, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Aryeh Deri, former leader of the powerful Shas party, was
sentenced to four years in prison last March on charges of
accepting bribes, breach of trust and fraud while he was interior
minister in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
A rigid schedule has been set for closing the case. A three-
judge panel will reconvene on February 6 and hear Deri's appeal and
argument of the prosecutor, said the radio report.
</P>
<P>
Deri resigned from the party leadership soon after the national
election last May, clearing the way for the Shas party, which
controls 17 seats in the parliament, to join in the coalition of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.

<HEADLINE> Four People Die Due to Heavy Snowfall in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Four people have died so far
in Israel due to heavy snowfall which hit the country on Thursday,
Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims was a Palestinian man in East Jerusalem who
was hit by the collapse of his shelter house.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow fell in Jerusalem and some mountainous areas of
Israel on Thursday, while many other parts of the country were
awash with floods. The snow is continuing Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday night, nearly 15 centimeters of snow had accumulated
in parts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The snow has brought Jerusalem into a complete standstill. The
municipality has mobilized more manpower and equipment in an effort
to keep main roads open, especially access roads to the city and
roads leading to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The onset of the cold front was felt first in the north
Wednesday night with heavy snow falling on Mount Hermon and rain,
accompanied by strong winds and thunderstorms, sweeping other parts
of the region and later spreading to central districts.
</P>
<P>
The low-lying areas and coastal areas of the country, such as
Haifa and Tel Aviv, experienced heavy rains, including thunder and
hail storms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that residents in Tel Aviv's southern
neighborhoods saw many homes flooded for the third time since this
winter. More than 200 people have been evacuated since Thursday to
community centers, where accommodation was prepared in advance.
</P>
<P>
There are an average of 2.3 snow days in Israel per year. The
longest snow episode ever recorded was in February 1911, when snow
fell in the Jerusalem area for 12 consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
In general, February is Israel's snowiest month.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Says Won't Hamper Court Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's military (TNI) will
not hamper a court process to bring to justice against those TNI
personnel who were allegedly involved in human right violations in
East Timor, military officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will see the process of court and TNI will push (the
process of court) so that the truth can be established," Rear Adm.
Yoost R. Mengko of TNI General Chief of Staff (Kasum) told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The principle of the presumption of innocence must be fully
erected, he added.
</P>
<P>
Scores of TNI personnel had allegedly been involved in human
right violations in East Timor following the announcement of the U.
N-sponsored direct ballot on August 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government last year established the Commission
of Inquiry on Human Right Violation in East Timor (KPP HAM) and
the commission has questioned high-ranking military officials
allegedly involved in human right abuses there, including
incumbent Coordinating Minister of Political and Security Affairs
Wiranto who was then TNI chief.
</P>
<P>
The commission is due to issue a recommendation and hand over
it to the National Commission on Human Right (Komnas HAM) and the
Attorney General on January 31.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is also expected to announce
the outcome of investigations into human right abuses in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
However, Mengko expected that such a recommendation would be
based on transparent measures.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian soldiers allegedly involved in human right abuses in
East Timor are likely to face an international war crime tribunal,
if the KPP HAM's recommendation fails to meet international
standards.
</P>
<P>
But Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab earlier said that
Indonesia would be able to avoid any international tribunal, as
most of the U.N. Security Council members had been convinced by
Indonesia that the country could handle its own problems without
any intervention from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of TNI Military Police Maj. Gen. Djasri Maarim,
who also attended the press conference, said the military police
would conduct an investigation into those found involved in human
right violations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We will launch an inquiry of course. If the TNI personnel
become suspect (in human right violations in East Timor), we will
question them, but there must be conditions, namely evidences and
police reports," Maarim said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, TNI headquarters released on Friday a journal
explaining the position of TNI in connection with the allegations
of human right violations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In the journal entitled "Accusations and Findings; Relating to
Legal, Disciplinary and Human Right Violations Following the
Referendum in East Timor," TNI denied that it had committed
genocide, abductions, and other illegal and undisciplined acts in
the territory.
</P>
<P>
"No clear evidence was found to show that TNI soldiers and
members of Polri (Indonesian Police) were involved in acts of
violence that resulted in the death of thousands of people," the
journal said.
</P>
<P>
"Press reports that the violence following the referendum led
to tens of thousands of deaths in East Timor are erroneous,
systematic and politically motivated, and designed to discredit
TNI and the Republic of Indonesia as a whole," the journal said

<P>
MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Military Officials of the
Philippines and the United States kicked off on Friday their long-
suspended war exercise "Balikatan" in the Philippines, the
official Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the PNA, Balikatan 2000 was declared open by Armed
Forces Chief of Staff General Angelo Reyes representing the
Philippines, and Major General James Donald, deputy commanding
general of the U.S. Army-Pacific, on behalf of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said the objective of "Balikatan" was to improve
Philippines-U.S. armed forces combat readiness in joint and
combined operations and improve inter-operability between the two
forces through exchange of training skills and techniques.
</P>
<P>
The last Balikatan military exercise was held in 1995. It was
stalled for five years before the Philippine Senate ratified last
year the Visiting Forces Agreement, which paved the way for the
resumption of the large-scale military exercise.
</P>
<P>
Balikatan 2000, a month-long military exercise, will involve
close to 5,000 servicemen from both countries. The United States
will send 2,510 military personnel while the Philippines will
provide 2,393.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest war games between the Philippines and the
United States. The exercise is in compliance with the Philippines-
U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two planes and helicopters from the Philippine Air Force
and nine vessels from the Philippine Navy will participate in the
war games. The United States will be sending in 18 aircraft and
helicopters and two ships for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said the first phase of the exercise will include
seminars and workshops for the participating soldiers for the
first three weeks. And the second stage will be the exercise
proper.

PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- President of the Democratic

New York, where he attended a U.N. Security Council debate on the
Congo conflict last week, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown yet which one of France's top personalities will

</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council voted on January 19 to send
5,500 military personnel to the Congo to supervise the cease-fire
between the government forces and rebels.
</P>

Since a truce agreement was signed between the government and
rebels of the country in Lusaka last summer, both sides have
accused each other of violating the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo is supported
by Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, while the rebels are reportedly
backed by Uganda and Rwanda.

<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan held a "
lively, open conversation" on Kosovo and the situation in the
North Caucasus on Friday in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Putin stressed the need to learn the lessons of the Kosovo
tragedy and that Russia does not accept unilateral use of force
against a sovereign country or the notion of humanitarian
aggression, senior Kremlin aide Sergei Prikhodko told the press
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Putin praised U.N. humanitarian efforts in the North Caucasus
and expressed gratitude for the assistance of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said Prikhodko.
</P>
<P>
Russia regards the U.N. as the only universal international
organization, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Putin is "satisfied with the very good, working relationship"
between Russia and U.N. leading bodies, according to Prikhodko.
</P>
<P>
Putin said Russia will try to guarantee favorable conditions
for U.N. humanitarian actions in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Annan agreed that the U.N. is an extremely important
organization for the international community and said he is happy
to be in Moscow and wants to use the visit to discuss important
matters with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Annan also discussed the interaction of the Russian
Ministry for Emergency Situations with U.N. bodies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Putin informed Annan about the situation in the North Caucasus,
the reconstruction of the Chechen economy, the return of the
population to peaceful life and the revival of law enforcement
bodies there, said the Kremlin official.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his turn, said that Russia's efforts against
terrorism are understood and supported, but the humanitarian
situation raises questions.
</P>
<P>
In this context Putin briefed Annan on the humanitarian
aspects of the federal operation in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arrived in Moscow on Thursday for an official
visit, which Moscow regards as very important and a confirmation
of Russia's leading role in international affairs.

<HEADLINE> World Champion Haile to Skip Indoor Track Competitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The world 10,000 meters
champion Haile Gebre-Selassie will pull out all indoor track
competitions this season because of interruptions in his training
after foot injury last year, local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Haile, 26, is also double world indoor champion at 1500 and 3,
000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian sport star gave up the competition in the All
Africa Games in Jonhannesburg, South Africa, last September
because of the injury to his right achilles tendon and the
suffering of blisters on both feet last year.
</P>
<P>
He is okay and training now, but after the injury, he is not in
top shape, Haile's Dutch manager Jos Hermens was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Haile has canceled all his indoor races,
including a meeting on February 20 in Birminghan, England, where
he reclaimed the World Indoor 5,000 meters record last year.
</P>
<P>
Haile, who was 2,000 meters world record maker in 1998, sets at
least one indoor world record every year since 1996 when he ran in
his first indoor competition.
</P>
<P>
The four-time winner of world 10,000 meters outdoor race is now
expecting to defend his Olympic 10,000 meters title in Sydney,
Australia in September this year.

HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A masterpiece depicting some
300 world figures in the fields of politics, business, sports,
science and arts was put on display Friday at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
In celebration of the dawning of the new millennium, Liu Yu Yi,
one of Hong Kong's master painters, produced the masterpiece
entitled "Ode to Fraternity - A Millennial Symphonic Poem for
Mankind".
</P>
<P>
The oil painting is showing 300 world figures such as heads of
state and celebrities from all walks of life in 190 countries and
regions to mark the historic moment at a time when they are
ushering in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The painting measures 1,000 centimeters by 200 centimeters and
captures both night and day, summer and winter on all four corners
of the globe. It is Liu's most important and fascinating work to
date.

The painting Festive Day, one of his masterpieces which depicts
the historic event of Hong Kong's return to the motherland, was
sold for 23 million HK dollars (2.94 million U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Born in Nanjing City of east China's Jiangsu Province, in 1940,

<HEADLINE> Speculations Arise in Sudan Over Egyptian Ambassador's Delayed Arrival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Speculations are surfacing in
the Sudanese capital of Khartoum over the causes behind a long-
delayed arrival of Egyptian ambassador to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
After President Omar al-Bashir paid a visit to Cairo last month,
the Sudanese government pronounced that the Egyptian ambassador
would return to office within a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Al-Sharia Al-Siyasi attributed the delay to the
latest reconciliation reached between Bashir, also chairman of the
ruling National Congress Party (NCP) and ousted Parliament Speaker
Hassan al-Turabi.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dissolved the parliament and declared a three-month
nationwide state of emergency last month due to a rift with Turabi,
also NCP secretary general, a move that gained wide regional and
international support, especially from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The daily said the countries, including Egypt, has chosen to
reconsider their new attitude toward the Sudanese government after
the recent reunion between al-Bashir and al-Turabi whose radical
and fundamentalist ideology raised widespread contempt both
regionally and internationally.
</P>
<P>
The NCP's Consultation Group met on Sunday and forged a
reconciliatory formula under which Bashir is to head the cabinet
and be responsible for the administrative affairs in the NPC while
Turabi is to be charged with managing NCP political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Egypt called back its ambassador to Sudan following the
confiscation of certain Egyptian properties and facilities by the
Sudanese government in early l990s.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Sudan agreed to restore full diplomatic ties during
Bashir's last month trip to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been at odds since Bashir took power in
Sudan in 1989. Egypt accused Sudan of harboring Moslem extremists,
a charge which Khartoum denied.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Speech on Reunification Marked in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held Friday at
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center to commemorate the
5th anniversary of the publication of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's eight-point speech on reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Enzhu, director of the Central People's Government's
Liaison Office in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
HKSAR), delivered a speech at the forum, saying that full play
should be given to the demonstrative success of Hong Kong's
implementation of the concept of "One Country, Two Systems" and
more efforts should be made to advance the realization of the
peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Jiang, the newly-appointed
director of the liaison office, gave a speech on a public occasion
since the former Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch was renamed
the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in HKSAR on
January 18, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"After Hong Kong and Macao's return to the motherland, the
solution of the Taiwan issue and the realization of a complete
reunification of the motherland became the most urgent task
confronting us," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang believed that with joint efforts of the compatriots
across the Taiwan Straits and overseas Chinese throughout the
world, the Taiwan issue will surely be solved soon.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, further progress has been achieved in
the relations across the Taiwan Straits, Jiang said, adding that
the exchange across the straits in economy, culture, education and
sports have further been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government has also paid close attention to expanding
the relations between Hong Kong and Taiwan and taken active
measures to promote the cultural exchange and economic cooperation
between the two places, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the total arrivals of Taiwan residents
in Hong Kong in 1999 amounted to over two million with an increase
of 10.3 percent compared with that of 1998, and the total trade
between Hong Kong and Taiwan rose by five percent to 28.12 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the Taiwan businesspeople are full of
confidence in Hong Kong's economy in the future," Jiang stressed.
He said he is sure that the principle of "One Country, two Systems
" will be implemented in Taiwan smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has successfully
implemented the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong
" with a high degree of autonomy, and the unprecedented and
creative practice of "One Country, Two Systems" in Hong Kong has
won widespread acclaim from the international community, Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people have become masters of their own destiny,
enjoying a high-degree autonomy stipulated by the Basic Law, and
they have received the strong economic support from the great
motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
In foreign affairs, Hong Kong people have also shared the honor
and dignity attained by the great motherland internationally, he
added.
</P>
<P>
More than 110 leading figures from all sectors of the society
in Hong Kong attended the forum. Among them was Henry Fok Ying-
tung, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), along with
officials from various departments of the liaison office and the
HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
Others who addressed the forum included representatives from
the CPPCC National Committee, and sectors of the press, education
and enterprises as well as trade unions and women and youth
organizations.
</P>
<P>
They all appealed to the Taiwan authorities to comply with the
national interests and the interests of the Taiwan compatriots,
and stop creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Participants also expressed the wish to speed up the process of
political and economic dialogues between the two sides and realize
the reunification through political talks under the "One China"
principle.

MACAO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Seven new deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) from the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China were chosen here Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
By means of secret ballot, they were elected by members of an
electoral conference composed of 203 local residents with Chinese
citizenship, among whom 199 members were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The election marks the first time that Macao, after its return
to the motherland, chooses its NPC deputies as an independent
electoral unit," said He Chunlin, secretary-general of the
Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said the election went on smoothly and symbolized the
principle of fairness, justice and openness, noting that "Macao
residents with Chinese citizenship had been rather active in
participating in the election."
</P>
<P>
Together with the five NPC deputies from Macao who were chosen
by the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, the total of 12 NPC
deputies from the Macao SAR will form a delegation to attend the
upcoming third session of the Ninth NPC and participate in
managing state affairs, He Chunlin said.
</P>
<P>
Some newly elected NPC deputies said that they would
conscientiously practice their duties and contribute more to the
prosperity of the motherland and the development of Macao.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Snow Hits Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A heavy snow brought by a cold
front continued hitting Jordan Friday after causing traffic jams
and accidents Thursday, but no fatalities or serious injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
The snow, which started Thursday morning, has blocked roads of
most of the hilltop areas of the capital of Amman by Friday
morning, and no vehicles or pedestrians can be seen in the streets
of the city.
</P>
<P>
Most of the traffic jams and accidents occurred on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 traffic accidents took place Thursday evening in the
35-kilometer highway between Amman and the Queen Alia international
airport.
</P>
<P>
No one died or was seriously injured, as drivers were moving
extremely slowly, some even driving at a speed of less than five
kilometers an hour due to traffic jams and slippery roads.
</P>
<P>
The relatively low lying international airport remained open
Friday, and aviation officials told Xinhua that no flights were
cancelled on Friday as the airport received less snowfalls.
</P>
<P>
The snow was the largest in the current rainy season of the
kingdom, and snowfalls have piled up to nearly 15 centimeters in
Amman by Friday noon.
</P>
<P>
The capital and the western mountainous areas of the kingdom
have a Mediterranean weather, dry and hot in summer, but mild and
rainy in winter.
</P>
<P>
The snow also brought about an unusually cold temperature which
dropped to below the freezing Thursday after night fell in Amman,
home to nearly one third of the 4.7 million total population.
</P>
<P>
However, the snow was welcomed by farmers and officials, who
believe it can greatly improve the water supply conditions for the
summer in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The snow will also help alleviate a severe drought that hit the
kingdom in 1999, the worst in nearly half a century.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom largely depends on stockpiling rain and snowfalls in
winter to meet its water demands in summer.

<HEADLINE> Israel Delivers Upgraded F-4 Planes to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel has delivered to Turkey
the first batch of two F-4E Phantom jets which are upgraded F-4
planes, reflecting the solid military ties between the two
countries, the Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delivery ceremony, held at Eskisehir First Main Jet Base
Thursday, was attended by Turkish Defense Minister Sabahattin
Cakmakoglu, Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces Gen. Huseyin
Kivrikoglu and visiting Israeli officials including Israeli
designated Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Dan Halup and
representatives of the Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI).
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement, Turkey commissioned IAI with modernizing 26
of its 54 F-4s up to Phantom 2000 standard. The project, which will
cost 670 million U.S. dollars, is being financed by an Israeli
state credit.
</P>
<P>
The project, which began in January 1997, is scheduled for
completion in February 2003. The remaining 28 F-4s will be updated
in the upcoming years at the Eskisehir facilities under a
technology transfer agreement with Israel. Turkish personnel is now
being trained in Israel for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Kivrikoglu said at the ceremony that uncertainties in the
international arena, especially in view of Turkey's geographic
position, require Turkey's Armed Forces to be more vigilant to
possible domestic and foreign threats.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, studies on equipping the air force with hi-tech
weapons and equipment are common in the world, said the general.
</P>
<P>
The upgraded jets will enable the Turkish Air Force to perform
around-the-clock operations under all conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli-Turkish military ties have triggered great
suspicions from the Arab countries, particularly Israel's Arab
neighbors. And Turkey has repeatedly promised the Arabs that it is
nothing short of a bilateral issue, posing no harm to the third
side.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish F-4Es are to be equipped with Israel-made Elta
Synthetic Aperture Radar, AGM-142 Popeye medium-range air-to-
surface missiles and 100-kilometer-range Popeye missiles.

<HEADLINE> HK Introduces Broadcasting Bill to Ensure Fair Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government on
Friday published in the Gazette a broadcasting bill to provide a
new technology-neutral statutory framework for the licensing and
regulation of television program services.
</P>
<P>
Entitled the Broadcasting Bill, it will replace Hong Kong's
Television Ordinance to cover all types of television program
services, including the terrestrial and satellite television
services now separately licensed under the Television Ordinance
and the Telecommunication Ordinance respectively.
</P>
<P>
"It marks an important milestone in advancing the government's
policy objectives of widening program choice, encouraging
investment and ensuring fair and effective competition in the
provision of broadcasting services," a spokesman for the
Information Technology and Broadcasting Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bill, "television program services" are classified
into four categories, namely Domestic Free service, Domestic Pay
service, Non-domestic service and Other Licensable service.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard fair competition in an open and competitive market,
the Bill contains a general provision prohibiting a licensee from
engaging in anti-competitive conduct, and a specific provision
prohibiting a licensee in a dominant position in a television
program service market from abusing its position.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Bill will do away with certain existing
regulatory restrictions, which are no longer relevant or necessary
in a liberalized market. The current restrictions on investments
by licensees will also be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
As the competition provisions may affect existing contracts
that a licensee has already entered into, the Bill provides a
transitional arrangement whereby agreements lawfully entered into
before the gazettal date of the Bill will be exempted from the
application of the general competition provision for two years
from that date.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority will be empowered to
enforce the competition provisions, and issue detailed draft
guidelines for consultation with the industry, with a view to
finalizing them by the time the Bill is passed.

<HEADLINE> China to Curb Local Protectionism in Law Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- To tighten the noose on local
and departmental protectionism and low efficiency in the execution
of court verdicts, provincial-level higher people's courts have
been empowered to coordinate and monitor enforcement in lower
courts.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent set of regulations promulgated by the
country's Supreme Court, provincial level courts are now
authorized to deploy all personnel and equipment of lower courts
to enforce court orders.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Supreme Court say that some local and
departmental leaders have been found illegally meddling in the
enforcement of court orders to protect their vested local and
departmental economic interests. The latest statistics available
show that more than 850,000 court rulings are yet to be handed
down, involving over 259 billion yuan (about 31.2 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon for criminals who resist court enforcement
efforts and the police who are sent to take them into custody to
become violent, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court order also said that provincial-level courts
are responsible for coordinating the actions when disputes
crossing the borders of provinces, regions and municipalities
appear and cannot be resolved by lower courts.
</P>
<P>
If provincial courts still cannot agree on certain disputes,
they must come to the Supreme Court for final judgment, the order
said.

<HEADLINE> China Executes 13 Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China executed 13 Chinese
and Indonesian pirates in South China's Guangdong Province today
who in November 1998 robbed the Cheung Son cargo ship from Hong
Kong and killed all 23 sailors on board.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court (SPC) approved the death
sentences of the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court and
issued the order of execution today, the SPC announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The executions of Weng Siliang, Indonesian citizen Soni Wee
and the other 11 who committed the crimes on China's territorial
waters in the South China Sea were enforced in Shanwei City of
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The gang started planning the robbery in August of 1998 with
illegal purchase of guns and buying ships. On November 16, they
intercepted the Cheung Son cargo ship from Hong Kong by
masquerading as Chinese police.
</P>
<P>
They robbed the ship and killed all of the 23 seamen. Later
they sold the contraband for 300,000 U.S. dollars. They also
stole a total of 970,00 yuan in cash.
</P>
<P>
Wen and Soni Wee also were involved in the pirating of two
foreign ships, and Wee was found with 156 grams of narcotics when
arrested, according to court hearings.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Shanwei heard the case in
December last year and issued the 13 death sentences. The
Guangdong Higher People's Court rejected the defendants' appeals
on January 8 ,this year, and asked the SPC for approval of the
death sentences.
</P>
<P>
Other pirates involved in this case were given sentences of
life imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Snow Falls in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua)-- Heavy snow fell in Jerusalem
and northern and other mountainous areas of Israel, while many
other parts of the country were awash with floods.
</P>
<P>
The snow, which started falling Thursday, is continuing Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday night, nearly 15 centimeters of snow had accumulated
in parts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, the snow has brought the city into a complete
standstill. The municipality has mobilized more manpower and
equipment in an effort to keep main roads open, especially access
roads to the city and roads leading to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The onset of the cold front was felt first in the North
Wednesday night with heavy snow falling on Mount Hermon and rain,
accompanied by strong winds and thunderstorms, sweeping other parts
of the region and later spreading to central districts.
</P>
<P>
The low-lying areas and coastal areas of the country, such as
Haifa and Tel Aviv, experienced heavy rain, including thunder and
hail storms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that residents of Tel Aviv's southern
neighborhoods saw many homes flooded for the third time since this
winter. More than 170 people since thursday have been evacuated to
community centers, where accommodation were prepared in advance.
</P>
<P>
On average, there are 2.3 snow days in Israel per year. The
longest snow episode was recorded in February 1911, when snow fell
in the Jerusalem area for 12 consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
In general, February is Israel's snowiest month.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian official in charge of the refugee issue said
Thursday that negotiators made no progress in two months of final-
status talks on refugees and predicted that an agreement will not
be reached "within the next hundred years" unless Israel changes
its stated position.
</P>
<P>
The comments, by Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Executive Committee member Asad Abdel Rahman, came in response to
statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Wednesday in
Stockholm that Israel bears no moral obligation to Palestinian
refugees and that on principle, he is against even one refugee
coming to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Kindergartens, elementary schools and some junior-high and
high schools are set to reopen Friday morning should weather
permits, following Thursday's signing of an agreement between the
Histadrut Teachers Union and the Treasury that ended an 11-day
strike by the union.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Heavy snow fell throughout most of the day Thursday on the
Golan Heights, with lighter but still substantial snowfalls in the
Galilee, West Bank hills and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Snowploughs worked busily to clear central roads - mainly those
leading to hospitals and city centers - and residents were called
upon to refrain from non-essential use of their cars.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein Thursday ordered
a criminal investigation into Prime Minister Ehud Barak's campaign
funding for last year's general elections, after the State
Comptroller's Report accused One Israel of violating the Party
Funding Law and the Penal code.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein did not rule out the possibility of Barak being
summoned for questioning, but stressed to reporters that anyone may
be summoned if deemed relevant to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
In his report released Thursday, State Comptroller Eliezer
Goldberg also slapped a heavy fine of 13.7 million shekels (about
3.5 million U.S. dollars) on One Israel for violating the funding
law. Party officials said they will appeal the fine to the Supreme
Court.

It was reported that Ecevit took 58 public sector projects with

</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The harsh words made by Turkey's Chief of General Staff of
the Armed Forces Huseyin Kivrikoglu on the pro-Islamic Virtue Party
have thrown the party into disarray, triggering worries that the
opposition party might be closed.
</P>
<P>
Huseyin on Thursday accused the party of "being source of
reactionary", saying it was the party that provided political
mentality to reactionary movements such as radical Islamic
terrorist group Hezbollah and enabled their flourishing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Virtue Party Leader Recai Kutan criticized the army had
connection with Hezbollah and used it to combat the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:

<HEADLINE> UAE Construction Sector Slows Down in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The construction and real
estate sector of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) witnessed a
remarkable slowdown in 1999 due to market depression and other
factors, local newspapers reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the sector dropped by nearly 60 billion dirhams
(about 16.4 billion U.S. dollars) last year as compared to 160
billion dirhams (about 43.5 billion dollars) in 1998, said Ahmed
Saif Belhasa, chairman of the UAE Contractors Association.
</P>
<P>
Many agencies in the sector were forced to cut back on profit
margins, with the ultimate beneficiary being tenants, Ahmed was
quoted by the Gulf News daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The abundant availability of new apartments and high-rise
buildings in Dubai and Sharjah emirates as well as in other
emirates has caused a sharp decline of more than 20 percent in
rents, he added.
</P>
<P>
A Higher Council for Building and Construction will be formed in
coordination with the Ministry of Public Works and Housing to deal
with the problems cropping up in the sector, Ahmed added.

<HEADLINE> First Modern Private School to Open in Uganda Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- An ultra-modern private
secondary school, the first of its kind in Uganda, is expected to
be completed and open its doors to students soon, the Monitor
daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The school, Vienna College, at a cost of more than two million
U.S. dollars, will have 18 classrooms, three laboratories and a
modern computer center with 80 computers, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The school is owned by Moser Hans Helmut, an Austrian education
investor who had been an army brigadier.
</P>
<P>
Located some 14 kilometers east of Ugandan capital Kampala, the
school is expected to give quality education to 500 students in
the first year. Total intake will rise to 800 in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In addition to traditional curricula, the secondary school will
offer other subjects like moral training, interior and fashion
design, dance and drama, French, Kiswahili (a language quite
popular in east Africa) and others.
</P>
<P>
So far, 150 students have been admitted. Applications are
still coming from as far as Kenya, Burundi and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Confident in Tanzania's Policies: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is
confident in the development policies and programs Tanzania is
pursuing, the Daily Mail newspaper Friday quoted a bank official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's commitment to Tanzania is also reflected in
the substantial lending portfolio the bank has in the east African
country, James Adams, the World Bank Country Representative in
Tanzania said lately.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has sought to actively support Tanzania's
economic recovery efforts by financing some 131 projects (of which
110 have been completed or closed) in the country since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the bank and Tanzania are excellent,
Adams said, dismissing reports that the bank is unhappy with the
poor African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank official noted that the challenge of
rural development in Tanzania remains large.
</P>
<P>
It is critical that the government, donors and non-government
organizations develop more effective programs to reduce poverty in
the country, he added.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou No Longer Investing in Production Projects: Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Following a failing
investment in a local chemical plant, the Guanzhou city government
will no longer help fund the construction of competitive projects,
Mayor Lin Shusen has announced.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the pledge at a press conference Thursday in answer to
a reporter's question about what lessons should be drawn from
investing in the loss-making Guangzhou Ethylene Project.
</P>
<P>
In November 1993, the Guangzhou municipal government and China
Petro-Chemical Corp. (SINOPEC) provided 8.37 billion yuan to build
an ethylene plant, with the city contributing 90 percent of the
money. The plant opened in August 1997 but had to stop production
just three months later because of high production cost.
</P>
<P>
The plant was taken over by SINOPEC Guangzhou Petro-Chemical
General Plant on January 23 of this year. The Guangzhou city
government has agreed to pay 2.5 billion yuan to cover part of the
debt and will completely pull out from the ethylene project.
</P>
<P>
The mayor also said his city would speed up its pace in
developing high-tech industries this year and turn his city into a
center of scientific and technological innovations in south China.

<P>
KUNMING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Several recent earthquakes in
southwest China's Yunnan province with magnitudes of 5 to 6 on the
Richter scale are "not abnormal phenomena," and local residents
should not fear for their safety, the head of the provincial
seismological bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has been hit by three earthquakes in as many months: one
in the Chengjiang County with 5.2 magnitude on November 25 last
year, and two measuring 5.9 and 6.5 in Yao'an County on January 15,
which killed five, injured 1,544, and left more than 90,000
homeless.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday morning, a 5.5 tremor struck the remote area
between the counties of Mile and Qiube. Only two minor injuries
were reported.
</P>
<P>
"The province is located on a seismic belt and will suffer at
least one or two earthquakes with up to 5-point magnitude every
year, with most of them happening in winter or spring," said Yan
Fengtong, director of the Yunnan Seismological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes have not pre-empted business as usual for the local
residents; the capital city Kunming is to hold its China Tourism
Year festival in April as planned.
</P>
<P>
No reports of economic losses have been reported from the
latest earthquake. Rescue workers were sent to the scene with
tents, blankets and other necessities, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve earthquakes with magnitudes above 6 have occurred in
Yunnan since the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"Earthquakes are actually not uncommon here, and it would be
irresponsible to come to a hasty conclusion that there will be a
disastrous one in the province later," Yan stressed.
</P>
<P>
He Xihu, a seismologist for 40 years who has experienced many
strong quakes, said that the seismic belt is now in its fourth
cycle of earthquakes since 1988, when a quake with a 7.8 magnitude
shook the cities of Lancang and Gengma.
</P>
<P>
Few casualties have resulted from the past earthquakes in the
province. Local hospitals and rescue workers are experienced in
quake situations and local residents are familiar with quake
safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
Records show that six earthquakes with magnitudes above 5 hit
Ninglang County in the winter of 1998, and soon after a 5.0 quake
struck the province's Xuanwei City.

<HEADLINE> WTO A Must for Socialist Market Economy: Guangming Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's bid to enter the World
Trade Organization (WTO) is a part of the natural progression to
build a socialist market economy, the Guangming Daily said in a
front-page signed article today.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "An Inevitable Choice in Developing the Socialist
Market Economy," the article said that China's effort to join WTO
is an important strategic move in its reform, opening-up and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the WTO coincides with the China's efforts to build
a socialist market economy, said the article of the paper which is
designed for the country's intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental aim of China's reform and opening-up since the
end of 1978 is to break up a highly-centralized planned economy
and to build a socialist market economy full of energy and
vitality," it said.
</P>
<P>
The socialism-based market economy is similar to that based on
capitalism in terms of its operation system, and therefore China
should also follow the operation rules and requirements of a
market economy, it added.
</P>
<P>
The multi-lateral trade regime of WTO requires member
governments to observe the market operation mechanism in their
respective trade policy, and not go against the rules of the
market economy and interfere in market deals.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the WTO wants to make the most of the market
mechanism in a larger sphere. It is in this sense, the article
said, that the aim of WTO coincides with China's aim to build a
socialist market economy.

<HEADLINE> WTO A Must for Socialist Market Economy: Guangming Daily (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's entry into the WTO will give the country better access
to the experience of other market economies across the world, and
serves as a shortcut for building China into a socialist market
economy, said the article.
</P>
<P>
To join the WTO, China must follow the basic principles of the
organization and act in accordance with the universal rules of
market economy. Therefore, China's bid to enter the WTO will
accelerate the China market process.
</P>
<P>
In this process, the function of government will have to change.
Government will virtually be separated from the running of
business, and will no longer be directly involved in the operation
of any company, said the article.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules of the WTO, China will have to establish
and improve its market system. China will also create an
environment for fair competition, one that is unified, open, fully
competitive and in good order, it added.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that China's entry into the WTO will bring
more opportunities as well as greater pressure. But again, the
article said, that pressure on certain industries can only be
resolved by speeding up the process of building the market economy.
</P>
<P>
To do that, China should first deepen its enterprise reform to
improve competitiveness. China should also promote the reform of
its government setup, build a better social security system, and
improve its economic and trade laws and regulations, the article
concluded.

northern cities was poor, the China Environmental Monitoring
Center said today.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine GDP Grows by 3.2 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Led by the agriculture and
services sectors, the Philippines' Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
grew by 3.2 percent in 1999 as compared to its negative
performance of 0.5 percent for 1998, the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistical Coordination Board said in its annual
economic report that coupled with net factor income from abroad,
the country's Gross National Product (GNP) expanded 3.6 percent in
1999 from 0.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Growth is at the high end of the government's target," said
Felipe Medalla, secretary of the Social-Economic Planning
Department, adding that the 1999 growth was broad-based as all
sectors grew including industry.
</P>
<P>
The improved weather situation in the country resulted in a 6.6
percent expansion in the combined agriculture, forestry and
fishery sector for 1999, reversing last year's contraction of 6.6
percent, said Medalla.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, growth in the services sector of 3.9 percent for
1999 saw a slight improvement over its 3.5 percent growth in 1998
with all subsectors posting positive growth.
</P>
<P>
The services sector's steadfast performance throughout the year
provided a stable growth base for the economy in 1999 as it
accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the 3.6 percent GNP growth,
Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
Industry, which had been the laggard for most of the year,
produced a strong showing in the fourth quarter with a 3.1-percent-
growth, enabling the sector post a positive growth of 0.5 percent
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter of 1999, the country's GDP expanded 4.6
percent while the GNP grew by 4.8 percent. Agriculture led the
expansion with 7.4 percent, followed by services and industry
sectors with 4.4 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The 1999 growth is not unremarkable especially considering
that private corporations were going through dept work-outs and
industrial restructuring," Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
Medalla stressed that the government is confident of a 4 to 5
percent GDP growth target in 2000 "with the corporate sector's
improved financial standing."
</P>
<P>
He said sources of this growth will come from the expansion of
the sectors of services, manufacturing, utilities, construction
and agriculture.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday elaborated the importance of science and technology,
saying scientific innovations will further improve people's lives
and boost economies in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"In the new century, innovations in science and technology will
be key not only to the health of the environment, but to
miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances
in the economies," the president said in his State of the Union
address.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Clinton said, great breakthroughs in the human
genome research might someday help scientists design genetic
therapies that will cure Parkinson's, diabetes and certain kinds
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate
foreign languages as fast as you can talk; materials 10 times
stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight; and molecular
computers the size of a teardrop with the power of today's fastest
supercomputers, the president envisioned.

<HEADLINE> Japanese FM Stresses Importance of Enhancing Ties With Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei
Kono Friday stressed the importance of enhancing bilateral
relations with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In a policy speech to the 147th regular Diet (parliament)
session, Kono highlighted the "paramount importance of
strengthening bilateral ties with neighboring countries,"
especially with South Korea, China, Russia and members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Japan's commitment to promoting regional
cooperation through regional forums, including the ASEAN regional
forum, the summit framework of ASEAN plus China, Japan and South
Korea, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foreign minister also vowed to maximize efforts
toward normalizing diplomatic ties with the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), describing it as "the most pressing
issue" in Japan's commitment to promote dialogue and cooperation
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Noting Japan and the DPRK began preparatory talks last month,
Kono said Tokyo will "exert utmost efforts" toward reopening
negotiations on normalizing diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Kono also described Japan's alliance with the United States as
the foundation for Asia-Pacific peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, Kono said Japan will continue to direct
its official development assistance (ODA) to help Asian, African
and other developing nations eradicate poverty and achieve
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
He said Tokyo intends to "more effectively and efficiently
implement ODA as a major foreign policy tool and as a means of
contributing to the national interest in a wider sense."
</P>
<P>
Referring to this year's Group of Eight (G-8) summit in Okinawa,
Kono repeated Japan's plan to have the July 21-23 summit reflect
the opinions of Asian nations.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Plegeds to Implement SADC Trade Protocol: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has pledged its
commitment to implementing the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) trade protocol Maputo ratified at the end of last
December.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, which envisages the gradual establishment of a
free trade area in southern Africa, "is a step towards regional
integration," Mozambican Minister of Industry and Trade, Carlos
Norgado, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government "believes in the protocol, though we
are all aware of the challenges of implementation," Norgado told a
one-day private sector seminar on the protocol.
</P>
<P>
As a free trade area is established, all the countries in
southern Africa would become a single market, the Mozambican News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
To survive in that market, "We have to ensure that our
industries are competitive and produce high quality goods", the
minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Mozambican Confederation of Business
Associations was enthusiastic about the opportunities a larger
market would bring.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the federation Egas Mussanhane said that local
industries could now aim, not merely at a Mozambican market of 17
million people, but at a SADC market of around 200 million.
</P>
<P>
"We will be able to diversify and to reduce operational costs.
We shall also be able to attract more investment," said
Mussanhane.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that adjustments would have to be made by both
businesses and the government.
</P>
<P>
"We need an economic policy that takes regional integration
into account, " he said. "It must be reflected in government
action. We won't be successful if government programs are divorced
from reality".
</P>
<P>
The business leader also called for an acceleration of reforms
in Mozambique to scrap antiquated and unnecessary bureaucratic
practices, especially in import sector.
</P>
<P>
SADC is a 14-country regional bloc comprising Angola, Botswana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,
Seychelles, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Meets Senior Chinese Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xiong, who led a military delegation to attend the third
defense consultations between defense departments of the two
countries, said he believed that the common interests and
approaches are more important for the two countries than the
differences that still exist in some areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the Chinese delegation, Cohen
said he is satisfied with the success of the consultations,
stressing that the U.S. administration pays great attention to the
relations with China and hopes to develop a normal, positive and
good relationship with the country.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan, Cohen reaffirmed the principle of "one-China" policy,
commitment in the three joint communiques guiding U.S.-China
relations and the "three no" promise, expressing his hope that the
issue will be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Xiong noted that a stable and sound relationship between China
and the United States, two influential countries in the world, is
not only in the common interests of the two, but also conducive to
world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should view and handle the relationship,
particularly the issue of Taiwan, with wisdom and strategic vision,
he said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to seek common interests, expand cooperation
and narrow differences based on the principles of mutual respect
and equality to bring a sound and stable Sino-U.S. relationship
into the new century, Xiong added.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, who arrived in Washington on January 22, also met U.S.
Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe on a broad range of
subjects including global, regional, military-to-military contact
program and other bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the international situation, Xiong indicated that
despite the unstoppable trend of multi-polarization of the world
order, hegemonism and power politics still exist and such policies
have developed into forms like new "gunship diplomacy," "new
economic colonialism" and "new interventionism."
</P>
<P>
The practice of such policies have undermined the sovereignty
and independence of many countries and jeopardized the world peace
and security, Xiong was quoted by the press release.
</P>
<P>
History has proved that the doctrine of protecting security by
military buildup and alliance cannot ensure security nor safeguard
the world peace, Xiong said.
</P>
<P>
China believes that a new world order with peace, justice,
prosperity and stability can be ushered in only if world leaders
abandon the "Cold War" logic and strictly abide by the five
principles of peaceful co-existence, the United Nations Charter
and other international norms, Xiong added.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe was quoted by the press release as telling Xiong that
links between countries are strengthened and their security is
further interwoven as the economic globalization deepens.
</P>
<P>
He said the role of military power is important in safeguarding
U.S. national security and interests and that the United States
will continue to maintain the power. But cooperation with other
countries is also needed to achieve the goal, Slocombe added.
</P>
<P>
Xiong told Slocombe that the Taiwan issue remains the most
important and sensitive core issue in the Sino-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
China is seriously concerned by the recent sales of weapons to
Taiwan, the attempt by some congressmen to put the so-called
Taiwan Security Enhancement for approval in Congress and the
attempt to bring Taiwan into the U.S. Theater Missile Defense
system, Xiong said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side should recognize the seriousness and harmfulness
of the problems and take effective measures as early as possible
to prevent further damages to the Sino-U.S. relationship, Xiong
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade,
Xiong urged Washington to give the Chinese people a satisfactory
explanation by finishing a thorough and comprehensive
investigation at an earlier date and punishing those who are
responsible.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming the engagement with China, Slocombe said that the
United States hopes China will continue to play an important and
constructive role in the world.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the importance and sensitiveness of the Taiwan
issue, the United States will maintain its "one-China" policy,
Slocombe said.
</P>
<P>
Xiong also met with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Henry
Shelton, Deputy National Security Advisor Jim Steinberg and Under-
Secretary of State Thomas Pickering.
</P>
<P>
The third Sino-U.S. defense consultation was supposed to be
held in the second half of 1999. The Chinese government, however,
decided to postpone the high-level military exchanges after the U.
S.-led NATO bombed the Chinese embassy on May 8, 1999 during the
air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations have improved since President Jiang Zemin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton had a successful meeting in
Auckland, New Zealand, in September. The negotiations on China's
entry into the World Trade Organization ended in success in
November and an agreement on the compensation of the casualties
and property losses during the embassy bombing was also reached in
December.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Vows to Stimulate Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi Friday pledged to put Japan's economy on a full recovery
track by sticking to fiscal stimulus efforts.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my utmost to realize an economic recovery and carry
out structural reforms," Obuchi said in a key policy speech at the
147th regular Diet (parliament) session.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan's economy is showing signs of improvement,
Obuchi said work still needs to be done to achieve a complete
recovery.
</P>
<P>
A major part of the economic stimulus efforts will be a record-
high 84.99-trillion-yen (about 810.2 billion U.S. dollars) fiscal
2000 budget, which Obuchi hopes for an early enactment during the
150-day Diet session that convened on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi delivered the speech at a House of Representatives
plenary session in the absence of opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
The opposition camp, which consists of about 30 percent of the
members in the lower chamber, boycotted the session to protest
against the ruling parties' handling Thursday of a bill to reduce
the number of lower house seats.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Obuchi also pledged to do all he could to ensure
that July's summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) major economies in
Okinawa will be a success.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said he wants to issue "a bright, powerful message" at
the July 21-23 summit to be held in Nago, Okinawa Prefecture,
adding that he hopes to reflect the interests of Japan's Asian
neighbors in summit discussions.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said he will put special emphasis on education and
science, adding they are key to Japan's development in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
He said he will soon establish a new panel to hold wide-ranging
discussions on how to reform the country's education system.
</P>
<P>
On Japan's diplomacy, Obuchi said he plans to further the
recently resumed dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
"I hope to proceed further with the budding dialogue, and
discuss the normalization of diplomatic ties as well as
humanitarian and security issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister also vowed to make every effort to
resolve Japan's territorial dispute with Russia and conclude a
peace treaty by the end of the year, despite the resignation in
late 1999 of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

</P>
<P>
New Jersey's Stephon Marbury netted a season-high 42 points.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Hill bruised his tailbone late in the first half of a loss at
Chicago on Saturday and sat out losses to Dallas and Cleveland.

<P>
In Cleveland, Lamond Murray scored 24 points and grabbed nine
rebounds and Shawn Kemp added 20 and 14 as the Cavaliers beat the

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Support Sino-U.S. Agreement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday urged Congress to give China Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (NTR) this year to win access to the largest developing
country's market in the world.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union address, the president said: "
Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring China
into the WTO, by passing Permanent Normal Trade relations as soon
as possible this year," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement will open China's markets to us, and it will
also advance the cause in Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States reached an agreement with China last
November, giving American enterprises more opportunities to enter
the Chinese market, which would produce more jobs and yield more
profits for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the approval of China's permanent NTR would
"promote the cause of change in China," and make it a "
constructive member of the global community."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also outlined several challenges facing the United
States in the new century in an attempt to keep the United States
in the leading place in the world.
</P>
<P>
The most important challenge, he said, was to "pass a national
security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best
equipped in the world, with heightened readiness and 21st century
weapons."
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest arms producer in the world and
is planning to build National Missile Defense system and Theater
Missile Defense systems, which have already made the world uneasy
over a U.S. expansion of arms race in the post-Cold War era.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Pass Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday urged Congress to cooperate with him on passing the bills
on gun-safety, patients' rights, campaign finance reform and
increase in minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
In his last State of the Union address, Clinton said: "For too
long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most
pressing national priorities."
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged states to issue photo ID licenses for handgun
purchases, much like the licenses for driving or hunting.
</P>
<P>
"We've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong
hands," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope you'll help me pass that in this Congress," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under Clinton's plan, anyone who wants to buy a handgun would
be required to first obtain a license showing he has passed a
background check and a gun safety requirement, such as a training
course or an exam.
</P>
<P>
The president offered a long litany of initiatives, including a
tax cut of 350 billion dollars and big spending increases for
schools and health care, but many of them are sure to be rewritten
or ignored by Congress in an election year.
</P>
<P>
Republicans ridiculed Clinton's proposals but did not rule out
working with him on such issues as education and health care.
</P>
<P>
"If we enacted all the new programs the president has talked
about, we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger and more
expensive government," said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
Many of Clinton's proposals were repackaged from those in
earlier years and, in some cases, resubmitted with spending
figures doubling or tripling the original amounts.
</P>
<P>
In his 89-minute address, Clinton boasted that the nation has
been lifted from economic distress and social decline.
</P>
<P>
Five days before the New Hampshire primary, Clinton seized the
chance to boost Vice President Al Gore in his race for the
Democratic presidential nomination. There were six references to
the role of vice president in the speech.

<HEADLINE> Activities Commemorating Nazi Victims Held in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, Jan 27 (Xinhua) -- Various activities were held across
Germany Thursday to commemorate millions of victims who were
killed by Nazi Germany during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The biggest commemoration was held in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held by parliament and attended by all German
leaders, Elie Wiesel, a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration
camp and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said in a key-note speech:
"Since my people embarked onto the world stage, they have had an
endless list of enemies, many of whom we are very familiar with.
But none of them has hurt us so badly like Hitler's Germany."
</P>
<P>
In the vicinity of the parliament building, German leaders also
held a ceremony which symbolizes the beginning of the erection of
a monument to the Holocaust. Construction of the monument, which
occupies an area of 20,000 square meters between Brandenburger Tor
and Potsdam Square, will formally begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland was the biggest and
most notorious Nazi "death camp" in the world, where some 1.3
million Jews were brutally slaughtered. It was liberated on
January 27, 1945 by the Red Army of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Under a suggestion by former German president Roman Herzog,
January 27 became the commemoration day for Nazi victims, designed
to urge the Germans to never forget this tragedy and not to allow
this history to repeat itself.

<HEADLINE> Poles Commemorate 55th Anniversary of Auschwitz Liberation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Polish people
gathered Thursday at the site of Auschwitz concentration camp,
once biggest and most notorious death camp set by Nazis during
World War II, to commemorate the 55th anniversary of its
liberation.
</P>
<P>
Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski and premier Jerzy Buzek
attended the gathering along with the Auschwitz survivors and the
representatives of its liberator, the Soviet Army.
</P>
<P>
In the speech after laying wreaths and flowers before the
Auschwitz Monument, the president said that so many innocent
people were brutally killed here and all people should learn
something from the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Poland has never forgotten the Auschwitz camp and
has always hoped for world peace. He added that the tragedy will
continue to influence many years to come and the whole world
should remember this killing ground.
</P>
<P>
The Auschwitz camp in southern Poland is the name for over 40
concentration camps around the city of Auschwitz, about 300
kilometers (186 miles) away from Warsaw. The construction of the
camps began in April 1940.
</P>
<P>
Millions of people had been detained here and at least 1.1
million of them, mostly Jews, were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Red Army liberated Auschwitz on January 27, 1945,
and freed some 7,000 survivors.
</P>
<P>
In July 1947, the Auschwitz camp was turned into a museum and
has since received tens of thousands of visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Neo-Nazi force has reared its head in Poland
and elsewhere in Europe. Some people even wrote books to
deliberately diminish the number of people killed in the Auschwitz
camp and deny the existence of gas chambers there.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Tax Cut of 350 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday proposed a tax cut of 350 billion U.S. dollars, big
spending increases for schools and health care as he offered the
final agenda of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his last State of the Union address before Congress,
Clinton said that "the state of our union is the strongest it has
ever been."
</P>
<P>
The president announced that next month the United States will
achieve the longest period of economic growth in the nation's
entire history.
</P>
<P>
Clinton boasted that the nation has been lifted from economic
distress, social decline and political gridlock.
</P>
<P>
"We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The
fastest economic growth in more than 30 years. The lowest
unemployment rates in 30 years. The lowest poverty rates in 20
years. The lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates
on record. The first back-to-back surpluses in 42 years."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's tax program includes marriage penalty relief, tax
deductions of up to 2,800 dollars annually per family for college
tuition and fees and retirement savings accounts for low- and
moderate-income families. He also proposed steps to encourage
charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
The president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by
Republicans and Democrats as both sides battle for the control of
Congress and the White House. Smarting from Clinton's veto of
their 792-billion-dollar tax-cut package last year, House
Republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax
breaks and marriage penalty relief this year. Presidential
candidates have their own proposals, too.
</P>
<P>
The president's tax package would cost 350 billion dollars over
10 years. However, his plan envisions cutting that price tag by
100 billion dollars by closing tax havens, shelters and loopholes,
the White House said. Congress has previously rejected many of
those ideas on grounds they are tax increases.
</P>
<P>
The president also proposed a 10-year, 110-billion-dollar
program to provide health coverage to the parents of children
protected by the state Children's Health Insurance Program. If
approved, it would be the largest increase in health coverage in
35 years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's agenda will revive battles with Republicans over
Social Security and Medicare. He said his proposals would extend
the life of Social Security to 2050 and Medicare to at least 2025.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would devote nearly 400 billion dollars of the budget
surplus for Medicare solvency and prescription drugs.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Joan Benoit Samuelson,
winner of the first Olympic women's marathon in 1984, will try to
make the U.S. team even though she is 42 years old.
</P>
<P>
Samuelson said she would compete in the U.S. marathon trials on
February 26.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't submitted my application, but that's the plan,"
Samuelson said today. She named a few reasons for her decision. "I
'm qualified, I'm 42, this is the year 2000 and my kids have
supported me," she said.
</P>
<P>
She is not a favorite to make the three-woman team for the
Sydney Games against a field of more than 200, but she won't give
up the chance.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still passionate about running. I love the sport. I want
to be a part of it. This will be my last chance."
</P>
<P>
Samuelson won the gold medal at Los Angeles in 2 hours, 24
minutes, 52 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Samuelson didn't take part in the 1988 and 1992 trials, but ran
again in 1996, when she failed to make the team.
</P>
<P>
"Where there's passion, there's a fire. We'll see how high
those flames burn," she said.
</P>
<P>
She ran in the 1984 trials only 17 days after undergoing
athroscopic knee surgery.

<HEADLINE> Three Cops Killed in Guerrilla Raid in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Three policemen were killed
and over a dozen seriously injured in a violent clash with the
ultra-leftist guerrillas Wednesday in a remote village in Salyan
district of mid-western Nepal, The Kathmandu Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily quoted witnesses as saying that the
guerrillas surrounded the police post in Kalimati village
Wednesday night and attacked the post with bombs and rifle fire.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said the guerrillas first asked the police inside
the post to lay down their arms and surrender. The bombing and
firing began when the 25 policemen trapped inside refused to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
Three policemen were killed and 14 were injured in the attack.
About 10 guerrilla members were suspected to be killed in the
cross-fire, but the toll on the guerrilla side could not be
verified.
</P>
<P>
In another guerrilla-related incident, a young man carrying
explosives was blown to bits outside a bazaar Thursday in Rukum
district of mid-western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The man was believed to carry the explosives to blow up the
police post in the bazaar, but the bomb went off before he could
reach the place.
</P>
<P>
According to Home Ministry, the toll in the four-year
guerrillas war has reached 1,128, including 115 policemen, 836
guerrilla members and 177 civilians.

Somboon Prasobnet, deputy director-general of the Corrections
Department, was quoted as saying that in some cells each inmate
has only about one square meter of living space, so they cannot
lie down at the same time and have to take turns, sleeping half of
the night each.
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding was worst in prisons for women, where 200 to 300
people were locked up in a facility built to accommodate only 50.
</P>
<P>
Somboon attributed the surge in the prison population to the
reclassification of methamphetamine as a category one narcotic
drug and the tough policy against drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that drug addicts, who make up over 50 percent of
inmates should not be incarcerated but, instead, should be given
treatment in rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Corrections Department,
on average five Thais were put into prison every hour last year,
bringing the total number of prisoners to 209,070, up 40,000 from
the previous year. It is expected that the total number of
prisoners will rise to 300,000 within two years.
</P>
<P>
Since most of the prisoners were petty offenders, such as drug
addicts, some criminologists suggest that imprisonment should be
reserved for serious offenders or hard-core criminals.
</P>
<P>
It is also suggested that alternative penalties should be
handed down to petty offenders, including fines, seizure of
property, or even suspension of the prosecution proceedings.

<HEADLINE> China Promises Better Investment Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China promised more and better
investment opportunities for foreign companies by further
improving investment environment in the new century, visiting
Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo said Thursday in Zurich,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner hosted in his honor by the Swiss Federation of
Commerce and Industry, Wu briefed prominent Swiss business people
on China's economic situation and the important measures the
Chinese government has taken to further integrate China's economy
into the global system.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the Chinese government has expanded the scope and
increased the number of pilot projects for foreign investment in
the sectors of finance and insurance, commerce, foreign trade and
telecommunications, thus reducing restrictions on foreign
investment in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ventures in China now enjoy expanded operation sphere,
increased financial support from the Chinese government,
preferential treatment in technical development and innovation, as
well as more better administration and service from the government,
the vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
On China's economic situation last year, Wu said the government
met its economic growth target thanks to policies designed mainly
to expand domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Considering both domestic and international factors, it is
estimated that China's economic growth will maintain a strong
momentum in a fairly long period in the future, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
China's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 is expected to
double that in 2001 as a result of an estimated annual average
growth rate of above 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said by the middle of the 21st century, China's per capita
gross national product (GNP) is expected to reach the level of a
moderate developed country.
</P>
<P>
China has seen increasing trade links with Switzerland in
recent years and the government is willing to continue to be of
assistance to Swiss companies in doing business with China, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the two economies are highly complementary
and economic cooperation between the two countries has a bright
future.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Andres Leuenberger, deputy chairman of the Swiss
Federation of Commerce and Industry, welcomed Wu's visit to
Switzerland and expressed the hope for closer ties between China
and his country.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Wu visited the Geneva-based Patek Philippe watch
company and the headquarters of the Swiss food industry giant,
Nestle, in Vevey.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is responsible for China's industrial and
communications sectors, arrived in Switzerland on Wednesday for a
six-day official visit. He is expected to attend the annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Before his trip to
Switzerland, he had visited Britain and Belgium.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras decided on Friday
to withdraw from the U.S. team for next week's opening Davis Cup
clash against Zimbabwe due to a hip injury.
</P>
<P>
The former world number one said he would be out of tennis for
three to four weeks after he suffered the injury during his
Australian Open semifinal loss to Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
"I've hurt my hip, it's a substantial tear and I'm not going to
be able to go to Zimbabwe," Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
Dr David Bolzonello, who conducted the scan, said the tear
happened during the fourth game of the first set against Agassi,
who went on to win a high-quality semifinal in five sets.
</P>
<P>
However, Sampras denied the injury played any part in his loss
to Agassi and said he had not considered retiring from the match.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lays out Plans for Improvement of Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday night laid out his plans for the improvement of education
by spending several billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In his annual State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a
one-billion-dollar expansion in Head Start, an early childhood
tutoring program credited with improving school performance among
low-income children. The money would add about 950,000 children to
the program.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed a 600-million-dollar fund to improve child
care quality and early childhood education for children under age
5.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he wants to spend one billion dollars to improve
teacher quality, including a 50-million-dollar grant fund to offer
better pay to teachers in low-income school districts and a 50-
million-dollar program to reward schools that increase their ranks
of certified and teachers.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that 250 million dollars -- double last year's
amount -- be spent to increase school accountability, turn around
failing schools or close those that cannot be fixed. He also wants
450 million dollars to provide bonuses to schools that make
dramatic improvements in student performance.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed that a 450-million-dollar increase in an
existing program to reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 new
teachers. The new money would pay for 49,000 new teachers and
raise the total for this program to 1.75 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The president renewed a proposal to provide 24.8 billion
dollars in tax credit bonds to modernize up to 6,000 schools. This
proposal would cost 3.7 billion dollars over five years.
</P>
<P>
The White House wants a new 1.3-billion-dollar emergency fund
for school renovation, which the administration claims would
support projects costing nearly seven billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia to Reopen Air Space to Foreign Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has decided to
gradually reopen its air space, shut since NATO started airstrikes
against the country last March, to all foreign airlines, a top
aviation official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Branko Bilbija, director of the Yugoslav Aviation
Administration, said that all parties concerned finally agreed to
the normalization of air transport in the Yugoslav air space
following four to five months of negotiations in Paris, Brussels
and Rome, the state new agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, from the small hours of Thursday
Yugoslavia resumed navigation services in 55 percent of the air
space from 9000 to 13,000 meters above sea level in Bosnia,
Bilbija said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, flights from Central Europe to Greece and the Middle
East will be guided by radar in Yugoslavia. New flights to Croatia
and Italy are also to be opened.
</P>
<P>
Bilbija said normalizing air services in the country will not
only bring in foreign currency but also prompt its air service
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Foreign airlines will save a lot of money by flying the
shortest route from Europe to the Middle East via Yugoslavia, the
director said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Yugoslavia only resumed navigation service for air
links with Macedonia after the end of the 78-day NATO bombing.

PRAGUE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia witnessed an increase
in crime rates in 1999, according to reports from Bratislava on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Interior Ministry indicated that 94,
000 criminal cases were reported last year, or 258 cases a day on
average.
</P>
<P>
Serious crimes such as violence and murders hit a record high.
In all, 141 cases, or 13 more than in 1998, were reported.
</P>
<P>
Economic and financial crimes including bribery, tax evasion
and embezzlement soared 23 percent over the previous year to 5,902
cases.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that inefficiency in crime crackdown was the
basic cause of the worsening situation while the revocation of
death penalties has weakened the legal system's deterrent effect
to offenders.
</P>
<P>
They added that media materials abounding with pornography,
violence, killing and detailed descriptions of criminal activities
were also attributable to the rise in the crime rates.

<HEADLINE> Sweden, Argentina Ask for Prompt Resumption of WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson and visiting Argentine President Fernando de la Rua said
Thursday that the World Trade Organization (WTO) should resume its
trade talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Persson held talks with de la Rua, who is in Stockholm for a
three-day International Holocaust Forum, on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to Swedish officials, the issue of free trade was a
major topic of their talks and the two leaders agreed that WTO
should resume talks following the Seattle conference which ended
last December without achieving a detailed agenda for launching
new round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Both de la Rua and Persson are not for the view that the trade
negotiations could not be resumed until the United States finishes
its presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, Persson met with French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin who was also in Stockholm for the Holocaust forum.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders told reporters that their talks centered on how
to strengthen cooperation among members of the Europe Union (EU),
between France and Sweden in particular, since the two countries
will hold the EU rotating presidency, France in the second half of
2000 and Sweden the first half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The conference on Holocaust, bringing together some 20 heads of
state or government, will end on Friday with a Stockholm Statement.
</P>
<P>
World politicians condemned the Holocaust crimes and warned
against the reemergence of neo-Nazi forces.
</P>
<P>
Sweden announced an annual Holocaust Day on Wednesday to remind
people of Nazi crimes and to honor the memory of victims of the
genocide.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexico received 10.5
billion U.S. dollars in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 1999,
maintaining the high level attained since it entered the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) at the end of 1993, an
official report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The strong FDI figures reflected confidence of foreign
investors in the country, said the report, quoting Commerce and
Industrial Development Minister Herminio Blanco, who was
accompanying President Ernesto Zedillo in Switzerland to attend
the 30th World Economic Forum of Davos.
</P>
<P>
The minister recalled that Mexico had registered 3 billion
dollars in FDI each year before its NAFTA entry and the figure
shot to more than 10 billion afterwards.
</P>
<P>
He said Mexico has been among the most active countries in
opening markets in recent years, having signed free trade
agreements with eight countries and negotiating them with Israel,
Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and the European Union.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia may not be competing
in the Olympic Games women's badminton events at Sydney in
September if their national shuttlers fail to crack the top 12 in
the world rankings in the remaining three championships.
</P>
<P>
The three championships are the All England, Swedish Open and
Japan Open.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really worried none of the Indonesian women's singles will
reach the top 12. Today only Cindana Hartono is in the world's top
12. Other shuttlers are ranked below her," Syaiful Arisanto of the
Badminton Association of Indonesia was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lydia Djaelawidjaja is ranked 16th in the world and Ellen
Angelina 23rd.
</P>
<P>
"National shuttlers must make use of their opportunities in the
three tournaments to improve their world rankings, but they will
face a tough challenge from China and South Korea," Arisanto said.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Open will take place from March 1 to 5, followed by
the All England from March 7 to 12 and the Japan Open from April 5

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Kiwi Facing Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The kiwi, the flightless
bird which has been in New Zealand for 30 million years and is
used as one of the more familiar symbols of the country, could be
extinct on New Zealand's mainland within 75 years.
</P>
<P>
Pam Crisp, an official with the New Zealand Department of
Conservation told Xinhua recently that 200 years ago there were
millions of kiwi living in New Zealand. Today the total population
is about 85,000 and the numbers on the mainland are declining by
about 5.8 percent a year or halving every decade.
</P>
<P>
"If this decline continues, then most kiwi populations on the
mainland face extinction within the next 75 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survival of kiwi is mainly threatened by land clearing and
predatory possums, stoats, dogs and cats, according to briefing
papers prepared by the Department of Conservation.
</P>
<P>
"The decline of New Zealand's unique plants and animals is its
most serious environmental issue," the papers said.
</P>
<P>
One-third of New Zealand's native fish, all giant insects,
frogs and bats and 60 percent of its reptiles and birds are "
threatened species," according to the papers.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's 300 most endangered species, 11 percent are
found only in New Zealand, they said.
</P>
<P>
"An army of predatory and browsing animals and aggressive weeds
is the greatest single threat to New Zealand's indigenous
ecosystems and species on land," the papers said.
</P>
<P>
According to the papers, 85 percent of native forests have been
chopped down, 85 percent of wetlands drained, and more than 45
species have become extinct since humans arrived in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Conservation urged the government to provide
more funds for managing the conservation estate in order to stem
the decline.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Rise Sharply in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. orders for durable
goods soared in December, pushed by the biggest demand for
airplanes and other transportation equipment in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that orders for
durable goods rose 4.1 percent last month, the biggest increase
since July, to a seasonally adjusted 212.9 billion dollars. That
followed a 1 percent gain in November.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, orders for durable goods, including items from air
conditioners to airplanes, jumped 7.1 percent, matching the
increase posted in 1997 and far surpassing 3.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In December, orders for transportation equipment rose a huge 16.
2 percent, led by strong demand for airplanes and aircraft parts,
although gains were reported across the board. The surge was the
largest increase since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Transportation often is volatile from month to month because it
includes such big-ticket purchases as airplanes. Excluding
transportation, overall orders grew by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also, a 4.6 percent jump in orders for electronic and other
electrical equipment including semiconductors, circuit boards,
telecommunications equipment and home appliances also contributed
to the big gain in overall durable-goods orders in December.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for industrial machinery, including computers
and machine tools dropped 4.2 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that orders for primary metals, the category
including steel, fell 1.5 percent in December. This category has
been down four of the last five months.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good signal of current
demand, also rose 0.7 percent in December, the seventh increase in
the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Labor Department said Thursday that
the number of new claims for unemployment benefits in the United
States rose by 1,000 last week to 266,000. Even with this small
gain, the claims were left at a level indicating that employers
are having trouble finding enough workers to fill job openings.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Identify Crucial Gene Blocking Nerve's Regrowth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Three teams of researchers
have identified a gene that produces a protein that prevents
nerves in the brain and spinal cord from regenerating, paving the
way for new drugs that might someday help paralyzed people stand
up.
</P>
<P>
The gene, named Nogo because of its inhibiting effect, was
found by three groups of scientists working at the University of
Zurich in Switzerland, the pharmaceutical company SmithKline
Beecham in England and Yale University in the U.S. respectively.
</P>
<P>
Lab experiments in nerve-damaged rats showed that when the
protein controlled by Nogo is blocked, the spinal cord can repair
itself, leading newspapers in the U.S. reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will now search for the molecular receptor for Nogo.
If this can be identified, drug companies may be able to devise
drugs that might help regenerate damaged nerves in patients who
suffer strokes, spinal cord injuries or other nerve disorders.
</P>
<P>
Neurologists hailed the discovery as a landmark step. "This is
a true breakthrough," said Solomon Snyder, a top neuroscientist at
Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
"It looks very promising that (Nogo) is a key factor that
explains why nerves don't regenerate in the brain. The road to
developing new therapies based on this is straightforward."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firms to Help Renovate Chinese Ethylene Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. firms, Stone &AMP;
Webster and ABB Lummus Global, will take part in renovating an
ethylene company in Shanghai, a major petrochemical base in China.
</P>
<P>
 Renovation of the Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd. involves a
total investment of 4.7 billion yuan (about 566 million U.S,
dollars). The money will be raised by the firm itself and aided by
bank loans.
</P>
<P>
 The technology renovation project, which is expected to be
completed in 2002, will increase the Shanghai firm's ethylene
production capacity from 550,000 tons, already China's largest, to
700,000 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
 The two U.S. companies signed agreements with the Shanghai
enterprise on January 24 and January 26 in Shanghai, respectively,
pledging to provide state-of-the-art technologies.
</P>
<P>
 The project will enable the Shanghai company to reduce the
cost of producing ethylene by 25 yuan a ton, thus sharpening the
its competitiveness edge in the international market.
</P>
<P>
 China's ethylene industry has developed rapidly in recent
years, but there is still a short supply of the chemical in the
domestic market, with a shortfall of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
 The Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd. has been constantly
expanded since it was launched with a production capacity of 115,
000 tons in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
 The new project will help Chinese petrochemical companies
flex their muscles in the upcoming competition with foreign rivals
after China joins the World Trade Organization (WTO), a local
petrochemical expert has said.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Show Vitality in SW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN January 28 (Xinhua) -- Private enterprises have
emerged as the economic front-runner in northwest China's
underdeveloped Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, after years of no-
growth and financial mess.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, about 4,790 private firms have been
established here with registered capital of 2.59 billion yuan (
nearly 298 million U.S. dollars), surging from 393 private firms
in 1990 involving only 58 million yuan (about 6.8 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some 62,000 people are employed in these booming enterprises
now, a jump from 5,500 employees ten years ago, according to Chen
Maolin, secretary-general in charge of the private business in
Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
The private firms here have created a gross domestic product (
GDP) of over 5.7 billion yuan last year, accounting for a quarter
of the autonomous region's total, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Lured by the preferential policies and a satisfactory
investment environment, investors from the United States, Japan
and Malaysia have set up some 430 joint ventures here since 1992,
with 580 million U.S. dollars of investment.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is abundant in agricultural and mineral resources but
is also an economically backward land-locked region in China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994 when the autonomous regional government designated
the development of private economy as a pressing task, more
preferential policies have been introduced to help local residents
open their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
A local survey shows that four private firms here reported
their capital over 100 million yuan, 34 firms showed in excess of
ten million yuan and another 121 registered capital of more than
five million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has set a goal to accelerate the growth
of private firms at the speed of 20 percent annually by the year
2002, when the GDP is expected to make up 40 percent of the region
's total. About 60 percent of the local residents will be involved
in these firms by that time, according to the government's plan.

<HEADLINE> First High-tech Belt in Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The first new and high-tech
industrial belt in western China was recently launched in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The string of facilities consists of six state technical
centers, seven key state laboratories, and 22 universities and
research institutes in Chengdu and the cities of Mianyang and
Deyang, all connected by a 100-kilometer-long expressway.
</P>
<P>
The belt, noted for electronic information, biology, new
materials, space science, and laser and nuclear development,
produced 40 billion yuan of industrial output value in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under a government plan, the belt will take advantage of its
superiority to conduct regional cooperation, upgrade existing
industries, and develop an export-oriented economy. By 2005, it
should be able to increase its pre-tax income to 20 billion yuan
by strengthening market competitiveness and developing new
products.

LONDON, January, 27 (Xinhua) -- Arrows, the only Britain-based

Thursday and revealed Jos Verstappen will drive for them next
season alongside Pedro de la Rosa.
</P>

Verstappen, who will test the car in Barcelona next week, said:
"I'm happy Arrows have chosen me to drive for them on account of
my speed and driving ability and I'm looking forward to a full F1
season."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tyson Ready for War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Controversial American boxer
Mike Tyson came face to face with British challenger Julius
Francis for the first time on Thursday and declared: "I'm ready
for war."
</P>
<P>
"I'm an animal in the ring. I'm a ferocious fighter," the
American told a chaotic news conference in Manchester to promote
Saturday night's match.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready for war - I'm in great shape and I can't wait to go.
"
</P>
<P>
And Francis laid his own claims to victory, before disappearing
behind sunglasses and headphones.
</P>
<P>
Shielded by promoter Frank Warren, Tyson side-stepped questions
about violence towards women, but again denied being a rapist.
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand, if everybody loved me and
everyone was my friend, I'd be an enemy to myself," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I've been wrongly convicted of this bizarre rape scene and
therefore I'm getting a lot of slack. But no-one knows anything
about my situation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just here to fight and I don't care what you think really,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson had kept reporters guessing as the news conference was
delayed amid rumours the boxer was refusing to leave his hotel.
</P>
<P>
But, after a wait of 20 minutes, the boxer's entourage,
including the imposing figure of official cheerleader Steve '
Crocodile' Fitch, swept into the MEN Arena and onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
Wearing an all-black outfit, topped with a hat sporting the
legend "Be real", Tyson answered questions about the problems he
faced in gaining entry to Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The government has to do something about the laws
saying that just because you made a mistake or been in prison or
you got a record, that doesn't mean it's over for you.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean you're a piece of trash and you should be
tossed like a used towel," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed any threat posed to him by Francis.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think he can do anything towards me. I'm just looking
forward to the fight," he added.
</P>
<P>
Francis, meanwhile, was willing to pay a little more lip
service to his opponent.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to win because that's what I believe. I have trained
hard, I have worked hard. I have watched Mr. Tyson through his
career and as everyone knows he's had a good career.
</P>
<P>
"The youngest undisputed world champion, give him respect for
that, but like I've been saying all along, it's about Julius
Francis."
</P>
<P>
Warren said Tyson was loved by the "man in the street" and his
appeal had created massive interest in the fight.
</P>
<P>
Later it emerged that Francis had been told off for climbing on
top of a police van as Tyson arrived at the Midland Hotel in
Manchester city center on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police urged Francis to get down and then began to drive away
to force him off.
</P>
<P>
A police spokeswoman said: "We advised him about his
inappropriate behaviour and told him the next time we would drive
off at a much faster speed."

<HEADLINE> FA Cup Final No Longer Climax Showpiece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The FA Cup final will not be the
traditional end-of-season showpiece event next year as a result of
fixture changes which will see the last round of Premiership games
taking place a week later.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association, Premier League and Football League
have held a series of meetings over recent weeks designed to find
a blueprint for the next three years to cope with growing fixture
chaos within the game.
</P>
<P>
The FA's stated priority had been to "re-establish the FA Cup
in its traditional place in the football calendar" - and to a
large extent they have succeeded in that aim.
</P>
<P>
The third round will now be restored to its normal January date
after the December experiment proved to be a much-criticised
failure, while no club will be allowed to be exempt in the future
like Manchester United were this season.
</P>
<P>
The Premiership season will also be delayed by two weeks until
August 19, giving players a longer summer break after the European
Championship finals and ensuring that they are better prepared for
England's vital World Cup qualifier against Germany in October.
</P>
<P>
However, with replays also being retained in the FA Cup until
the semi-final stage and the Football League's play-off weekend
being protected at the end of May, something had to give.
</P>
<P>
It has proved to be the date of the FA Cup final, which has
previously always been scheduled as the climax of the domestic
season, while Premiership clubs will also be forced to cram
matches into a season which is two weeks shorter.
</P>
<P>
Next season's FA Cup final - to be held at either the
Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Twickenham or at the ground of a
leading club not involved in the match itself - will therefore
take place on May 12.
</P>
<P>
The final round of Premiership matches is then scheduled for
May 19 to ease the burden on clubs reaching the latter stages of
European competitions and to allow a 'get-out' date of the
previous Wednesday on which to hold any postponed games.
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists already angered by this season's tinkering with
dates could well be further upset and the situation may arise that
at least one of the FA Cup finalists could find themselves
preoccupied with a vital relegation or title decider the following
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Beats Togo 2-0 with One Man Sent Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Ghana snatched the lead in Group
A after defeating Togo 2-0 despite having a man sent off at the
22nd Africa Nations Cup finals on Thursday co-hosted by Ghana and
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian spectators were stunned when Eben Dugbarty was
dismissed for dissent the Moroccan referee half an hour from time.
</P>
<P>
But latter it might be the turn for Togolese television
watchers to feel angry when they saw their players failed to
capitalize on the advantage, and let the Ghanaians keep the two-
goal lead to the end.
</P>
<P>
Sporting Lisbon striker Kwame Ayew opened the scoring after 27
minutes and Otto Addo for the Borussia Dortmund added the second
before the interval for the co-host's side.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's captain Charles Akunnor had two chances to add to the
tally, hitting the post from 25 yards and then firing inches over
the bar.
</P>
<P>
Togo had begun the game hoping to repeat its memorable win over
Ghana at the last African Cup of Nations or that of a friendly
match held recently in Togo's capital Lome, during which the
Togolese trounced the Ghanaians 4-0.
</P>
<P>
The two joint second-placed teams, Cameroon and Cote d'Ivoire
will meet on Friday with both sides knowing defeat will leave them
facing possible elimination.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, who now seems almost certain to reach the quarter-finals
is to play Cote d'Ivoire on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Guerrillas Attack Israeli Outpost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese guerrillas on Friday
attacked an outpost of Israeli troops in Balat, in the occupied
south Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after Israeli forces bombed suspected guerrilla
hideouts in the region earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, lebanon called for an urgent meeting of the April
Understanding Committee to review the increasing Israeli attacks on
south Lebanon in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising representatives from the United
States, France, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, was formed after the
Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Israel
reached an understanding in April 1996 after a massive Israeli
attack on Lebanon which killed 200 civilians. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understanding forbids attacks on civilians or
from civilian areas on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops stepped up attacks on south Lebanon this week
after an Israeli soldier was killed Tuesday by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Since then Israeli forces have frequently exchanged fire with
Lebanese guerrilla groups which have been fighting to oust Israeli
forces and the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army from the country.

The media quoted sources living inside the occupied area as
saying that Israel had been conducting survey operations over the
past two weeks in several villages and towns in the central and
western sectors in the area.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon,
which covered about one tenth of the Lebanese territories, in 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israel to Hold 10-Day Intensive Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians and Israel will
hold 10 days of intensive talks starting next Wednesday in southern
Israel, trying to reach a framework peace agreement, Israel Radio
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the marathon talks in the Red Sea resort of Eilat, the two
sides would make a last-ditch effort to meet the February 13
deadline for concluding a framework peace agreement, as was
stipulated in an interim agreement signed last September.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, which will also be participated by United
States Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, a meeting is scheduled
to be held between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to decide whether to move their talks to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have to reach tentative agreement over a host of
thorny issues, like Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements and water rights, before attaining the framework deal,
which would pave the way for a final Palestinian-Israeli peace
treaty by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have recently expressed concerns over whether they
could meet the February 13 deadline, signalling the possibility of
a delay of one or two months. But they have vowed to make efforts
to pick up the pace of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Offer Fierce Resistance, Vow to Hold Grozny Till February 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebel groups are
offering stubborn resistance to the Russian federal units in south
Chechnya and its capital Grozny, and "Chechen President" Aslan
Maskhadov ordered his formations Friday to hold their positions in
the city until February 23, reported the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry press service said Friday that the
rebels continue to hold the dominating heights at the entrance of
the southern Argun gorge despite federal artillery and air strikes.
A new rebel unit, probably the Borz task force, has been
discovered in the foothills in west Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The ministry reported clashes in Nozhai-Yurt and Sharoi
districts and also near Nizhniye Kurchali, Dubai-Yurt, Chishki and
other south Chechen districts. Russian interior Troops are mopping
up Pionerskoye, which was cleared of militants Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The press service reported rebel plans to stage major acts of
terrorism in the flatlands of Chechnya controlled by the federal
force.
</P>
<P>
Up to 7,000 rebels are fighting in the mountains in south
Chechnya. Their arsenal includes armored vehicles, large caliber
mortars, air defense installations and mobile anti-aircraft rocket
systems, the Interfax cited the headquarters of the Russian
federal force in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Chechen separatists -- Aslan Maskhadov,
Shamil Basayev and the Jordanian Khattab -- are currently in the
mountainous Chechnya, and another prominent Chechen leader,Movladi
Udugov, "is obviously abroad," General Valery Manilov,deputy chief
of the Russian General Staff told a Friday press conference in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of the size of the separatist forces in Chechnya,
Manilov said that in Grozny there are still about 3,000 and in the
south 6,000-8,000 active fighters. He stressed, however that these
figures are not unchanging. In the course of Russia's anti-
terrorist operation, from 2,000 to 3,000 additional fighters
joined the rebels and local residents are constantly being
recruited.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fierce fighting continues in Grozny. Chechen leader
Aslan Maskhadov ordered his formations Friday to hold their
positions in the city until February 23.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov instructed his forces "to engage in positional
fighting and attack Russian units," the Chechen presidential press
service announced.
</P>
<P>
There are still reserve units in Chechnya that have not been
engaged in fighting yet," the press service said, without
disclosing the strength of these reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax reported that rebel groups made three attempts to
break out of the besieged city Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the federal force in the North Caucasus on
Friday said that up to 40 rebels were killed when these attempts
were repelled.
</P>
<P>
The heaviest fighting continued in Oktyabrsky district of
Grozny and federal assault units approached the strategic Minutka
square from the north and east. After assault units crossed the
Sunzha river federal formations became entrenched on new lines in
Staraya Sunzha in the northern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
Staff headquarters said the more than 2,000 rebels in Grozny
are suffering from a pressing shortage of ammunition, medicine and
food. The Russian military believes the rebels will only be able
to offer serious resistance for a few days. Rebel groups are
preparing to leave the city in different directions, by using
underground pipelines and passages and in other ways, the
headquarters said.

WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Friday the approval of a credit of 26 million U.S. dollars to
strengthen the participation of Mozambique's private sector in the
country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise development project will support the government'
s program of reforms to address a wide variety of continuing
weaknesses in its business environment, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has successfully undertaken a series of economic
reform programs which is providing a stable environment for growth.
However, small to medium-sized businesses still face constraints
relating to the development of business strategies, technical know-
how, markets, finance and government regulations.

<P>
By addressing these constraints, the project will help improve
the competitiveness of approximately 200 small to medium-sized
businesses in the manufacturing, agro-processing, and handicraft
sectors, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the bank's lending arm for the poorest
countries, on standard IDA terms of 40 years maturity, including

<P>
MANAGUA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Eduardo Montealegre denied Friday that the Nicaraguan army had
been put in a state of "maximum alert" because of the maritime
limits conflict with Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Montealeger said that Nicaragua will resolve its disagreements
with Honduras "only through peaceful and diplomatic means."
</P>
<P>
Honduras presented Thursday a forceful protest to Nicaragua for
the statements made by National Army chief of operations Colonel
Cesar Delgadillo.
</P>
<P>
Col. Delgadillo said, according to the British news agency
Reuters, that the Nicaraguan army is in maximum alert and that "We
will possibly deploy army troops to the zone of conflict with
Honduras, which had been mobilized to combat bands of criminals in
the north of the country."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Montealegre said that "the Nicaraguan decision
is clear. The resolution of our differences with Honduras will be
only by means of diplomacy and international laws."
</P>
<P>
Montealegre attributed the problem to a wrong interpretation of
Delgadillo's statements by the journalists.
</P>
<P>
Honduran Foreign Ministers Roberto Flores and his Nicaraguan
counterpart Montealegre met on two occasions to alleviate the
tensions with the mediation of Luigi Einaudi, Organization of
American States (OAS) special envoy.
</P>
<P>
Both countries agreed in December in Miami on the definition of
a military zone exclusion in the Caribbean and the separation
of forces in the border zone.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers will meet again in February in El
Salvador.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply In Fear Of Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
sharply Friday as investors got worried about inflation that could
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to cool off the
U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
At close of the session, the Dow Jones industrial average
plunged 289.15 or 2.6 percent at 10,738.87 as investors sell
shares of the big companies such as general Electric and General
Motors. The Blue chip index lost 512.84 points this week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 38.40 at 1,360.16 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 152.49 at 3,887.07, well below the 4,000
milestone.
</P>
<P>
The market tumbled as the Commerce Department reported that the
U.S. economy grew 5.8 percent in the final quarter of 1999 and for
all of 1999, the growth rate stands at 4 percent. Investors
therefore feared that the red-hot economy could trigger inflation
and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board raised rates three times last year as
preemptive moves to cool off economy in efforts to keep inflation
under control. Most analysts believe the Board will raise rates
again at the next meeting on February 1-2.
</P>
<P>
A separate report from the Labor Department added to that fears.
The report said employees' wages and benefits surged 1.1 percent
in the fourth quarter, more than the 0.9 percent increase in
expectation. The increase in labor costs could lead to inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 14.95 at 611.81 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 14.56 at 868.24. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 12.40 at 504.62.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 2-to-1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 2,082 down, 984 up and 469 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.1076 billion shares from 1.115
billion in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> NATO Approves Eurocorps' Kosovo Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The NATO allies approved
Friday the five-nation Eurocorps to run the NATO-led peacekeeping
operations in Kosovo for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Eurocorps, comprises France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and
Luxemborg, will provide 350 officers and troops to the Kosovo
mission headquarters, which is scheduled to rotate in April
Eurocorps staff will be augmented by personnel from 30 other
participating nations, said sources from the 19-nation NATO.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a non-NATO group has been selected to
lead a NATO operation, although officials were quick to point out
that Eurocorps has always been available for NATO missions.
</P>
<P>
The choice of Eurocorps is also important to the European Union,
which decided at its summit in Helsinki, Finland, last month to
create a European rapid reaction force to dispatch to crises when
NATO chooses not to get involved. Eurocorps might form the basis
of the new force and would develop larger role in the future,
analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
Eurocorps was set up in 1992 to enhance European military
cooperation. In addition to its 1,200-man headquarters staff and
support battalion in Strasborg, France, 60,000 troops in five
countries are earmarked as Eurocorps troops.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Trains Collide in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Two passenger trains collided
in northern Belgium Friday, injuring 71 people, three of them
seriously, according to local news media.
</P>
<P>
The two trains collided near Herentals. Belgian state railway
company SNCB is investigating the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the company said the trains must have been going
slowly when they hit in the late afternoon on the same track.
</P>
<P>
Three people were seriously injured, 23 moderately, and 45
slightly, the local TV report said. All the injured had been sent
to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Sources said all the 300 passengers had been evacuated from the
two regional trains. Teams would work throughout the night to
remove wreckage from the track and the SNCB is trying to restore
normal service by Saturday morning.

<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- London stock market ended one
percent lower Friday after interest rate woes surfaced once more.
</P>
<P>
Its benchmark FTSE 100 closed down 65.4 points at 6375.6, led
by losses in telecoms and banks. The decline was prompted by
renewed concern over rates, following the release of stronger-than-
expected U.S. employment costs and GDP numbers.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking kicked in after in-line UK growth data for the
fourth quarter of 1999 supported economists' expectations for more
impending rate hikes by the Bank of England.

Germany's Xetra Dax finished 0.8 percent lower, at 7066.60. It
ended the week 1.05 percent higher. Paris CAC 40 index closed at

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Attack Main Colombian Oil Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sabotage affects the movement of 430,000 barrels a day
through the central oil pipeline of Colombia, that takes the
crudes from the Cusiana fields, in the northeast of the country,
to the Covenas oil exporting port in the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The ELN, the second guerrilla force in the country, is carrying
out a powerful campaign of sabotage against electric energy towers
and pipelines to pressure the government to grant it a
demilitarized zone where it would make peace negotiations with the
Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
The Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline, that moves 120,000 barrels
of oil every day, has been attacked four times this month with
explosives.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Oil Company (Ecopetrol) and the international
companies exported last year three billion dollars worth of oil,
very significant for a country that only produces 800,000 barrels
a day.

coalition by State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg for violating the
Campaign Finance Law in the 1999 elections.

Barak's spokeswoman Meraf Parsi-Zadok said that Barak ordered to

impossible to apply to direct elections of a prime minister,
according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Barak's decision is a reaction to the criminal investigation
launched by Attorney General Eliyakim Rubinstein on Thursday after

<HEADLINE> Millennium Dome Dogged by Loan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Friday that the
Millennium Dome, the centerpiece of the country's year 2000
celebrations, might need fresh funds after poor attendance in its
first month.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street confirmed that the Millennium Commission is
prepared to release more funds for the Dome as it fails to attract
the number of visitors needed to break even.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Millennium Commission would scrutinize ticket
sales before agreeing to the loan.
</P>
<P>
It added that the loan would only be made if the New Millennium
Experience Company, operators of the Dome, could prove the cash
would be paid back.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot rule out that it may need at some stage a short-term
cash flow boost in order to get it to the end of the year,"
Cabinet Office Minister Lord Falconer told BBC Radio Five Live.
</P>
<P>
Falconer, whose responsibilities include the 750 million pound
(1.23 billion U.S. dollar) Dome, did not provide further details.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail said the Dome managers would ask ministers for a
60 million pound (98 million dollar) loan to make up for sluggish
ticket sales. It said attendance had fallen to barely 5,000 a day
this week and the Dome needed a daily 20,000 to break even.
</P>
<P>
Takings at the door were hardly enough to cover daily running
costs and pay the staff of 2,000, the Daily Mail said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in January, managers said they were still confident of
reaching their target of 12 million visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
The Dome has 14 "zone" attractions -- ranging from a money zone
lined with one million pounds (1.6 million dollars) in 50-pound
notes to a body zone where giant hearts pump and stomachs gurgle.

<HEADLINE> IRA Faces New Pressure on Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The IRA is under renewed
pressure to hand over some weapons as Northern Ireland awaits a
crucial report on the decommissioning of paramilitary arms.
</P>
<P>
A leading loyalist has called on the Protestant paramilitary
group the Ulster Freedom Fighters to decommission immediately in
order to step up pressure on the IRA to give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
The weapons issue is threatening to derail the Northern Ireland
political process, as Ulster Unionist First Minister David Trimble
has pledged he will pull his party out of the executive if the IRA
has not started decommissioning by January 31.
</P>
<P>
The head of the decommissioning body, former Canadian General
John de Chastelain, has been discussing the possibility of
disarmament with republican and loyalist paramilitaries, and is
due to report to the British and Irish governments Monday.
</P>
<P>
Trimble will face his party's 860-member ruling council on
February 12 to review whether decommissioning has commenced.
</P>
<P>
The first minister said an alternative to collapsing the
executive with his resignation could be the temporary suspension
of the main political institutions set up under the Good Friday
Agreement. This move would have to be taken by Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
Trimble's party colleagues say the way to avoid either of those
options is for the IRA to start decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The IRA is also facing renewed pressure to surrender some
weapons from one of the main loyalist groups in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Clinton Uses Speech To Boost Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
in his last State of the Union address on Thursday night, outlined
both the past achievements and future tasks of the Clinton-Gore
administration, giving a boost to his vice president in his bid
for presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much
prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis or
so few external threats," Clinton said in his 89-minute address,
the longest one in history.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the past two years, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal
generated questions about whether Clinton would survive in office,
Thursday's speech was delivered against the backdrop of the 2000
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Setting the terms of the election year debate that will
dominate Washington this year, Clinton called for 350 billion
dollars in tax cuts and increased funding for social programs.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said his dozens of policy proposals have little
chance of enactment before he leaves office in an election year
when the Democratic and Republican parties battle for the White
House and control of Capitol Hill. The New York Times described
the address as "an election-year manifesto for his party".
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged his vice president's role in the triumphs
and thanked him for his leadership on environmental and education
issues. He also pointedly echoed Gore's campaign proposals on
preschool education and health care.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, I propose that we follow Vice President Gore's
suggestion to make low-income parents eligible for the insurance
that covers their children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Gore, who returned from a New Hampshire campaign
trip for the speech, sat behind Clinton and gave the president
warm applause as he spoke. Clinton made five positive references
to Gore in his speech.
</P>
<P>
He also singled out Gore's wife for praise, hailing her as the
person "who has led our efforts to break down barriers to decent
treatment of mental illness".
</P>
<P>
Clinton's open efforts to boost Gore are considered to be
unprecedented in modern times.
</P>
<P>
Insiders disclosed that as the speech was written, Gore chief
of staff Charles Burson urged the Clinton staff to note Gore's
contributions and to promote some of his campaign proposals,
especially on health care and education.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was trying "to keep himself from being too much of a
lame duck," presidential historian Michael Beschloss said, "to
start trying to frame his presidency for those in my line of work..
.and to elect Hillary and Al Gore."
</P>
<P>
For Clinton, Gore's election has become one of his most
important tasks. "That's how he sees a very important part of his
legacy," said Stephen Hess, a veteran of several White House
staffs. "Particularly for a president who faced impeachment, it's
a justification of where he stands. It's the equivalent of a third
election."
</P>
<P>
With the New Hampshire's first-in-the nation primary just four
days away, Clinton's State of the Union address will surely build
up Gore in the state in his competition with rival Senator Bill
Bradley for presidential nomination, analysts said.

provide Panama with antidrug technical assistance and training,
according to an agreement signed Friday by Foreign Minister Jose
