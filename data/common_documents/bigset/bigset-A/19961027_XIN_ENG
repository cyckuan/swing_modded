<HEADLINE> London Club Cuts Macedonia's Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia's external debts have
dropped to 1.1 billion from 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, because the
London Club has agreed to cut 364 million of the 644 million
U.S. dollars it owed to the club.
</P>
<P>
The agreement for write-off was result of negotiations between
the club and the Macedonian government, said a news release by the
Macedonia Information Center today.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia's Deputy Prime Minister, Ljube Trpeski, announced
Friday that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had
also determined to reduce Macedonia's debts because it only shared
11 percent of the total debts owed by the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia would have to repay its remaining external debts
within 15 years, and would enjoy four years of grace, said the
deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, now having successfully convinced major
international financial organizations to cut their debts, had
created conditions to attract foreign investments, added the
center.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese skaters
each collected two gold medals from four events to dominate the
Asian Figure Skating Championships which ended here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Host skaters took the limelight on the ice rink in the
afternoon. After Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo won the pairs event, Li
Chengjiang added the second title for China in the men's singles.
</P>
<P>
Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo, 15th at the World Championships in
Edmonton, Canada this year, had 1.5 points after free skating
while Li Chengjiang, 17, won his first ever Asian title with 2.5
points.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of former world champion Chen Lu, Arakawa
Shizuka had the women's singles for Japan after her teammate Kawai
Aya and Tanaka Hiroshi displayed the best performance in the ice
dancing.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lu, runner-up at the last world championships in Canada,
was forced to pull out of the tournament by a recurring problem of
foot injury.
</P>
<P>
For the 14-year-old Shizuka, it was the first time to win at an
Asian meet. "I gave my best today and I think I could also win
even if Chen skated."
</P>
<P>
Japan is taking the Asian Championships as a clinic for its
young skaters, who put their eyes on the next Olympic Winter
Games, which will be held in Nagano, Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Shizuka is one of our most talented skaters," said Ona
Nagahisa, manager of the Japanese team. "And our aim is at the
Winter Olympics two years later."

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A mass media training
center, the first of its kind in Ethiopia, was officially
inaugurated by Ethiopian Minister of Information and Culture
Wolde Michael Chemu here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, General Manager of the
center Tsehaye Debalkew said modern journalism started in
Ethiopia in the 1960s and 1970s, when there were few numbers of
professional journalists and no training centers.
</P>
<P>
Tsehaye said favourable conditions are being created to help
the center get the recognition of the Minsitry of Education.
</P>
<P>
He added that the center lacks mass media equipment, inspite
of the presence of TV and radio studios in the center.
</P>
<P>
According to a brochure issued by the center, its major
objective is to create media professionals who could play an
active and constructive role in the acceleration of the cultural,
social and economic development in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
It is also aimed at providing skilled journalists to
governmental and non-governmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
Present during the ceremony were general managers of the mass
media enterprises in the country, diplomatic corps and invited
guests. enditem

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Foreign Exchange Reserve Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign exchange
reserve has come down below two billion U.S. dollars, arousing
concerns among economists and professionals.
</P>
<P>
According to sources here today, the country's exchange reserve
stood at only about 1.97 billion dollars at the end of September
because of higher amounts of import compared to export earnings
and sales of shares by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
During the last fiscal year of 1995-1996 that ended on June 30,
Bangladesh witnessed a 17 percent increase in import while its
export registered only an 11.8 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserve grew to 2.21 billion
dollars in 1992-1993, 2.765 billion dollars in 1993-1994 and 3.07
billion dollars in 1994-1995 compared to the 880 million dollars
in 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign exchange reserve began to fall at the beginning
of 1995-96 when it stood at 2.039 billion dollars, due to economic
setbacks caused by political chaos in the country.

<HEADLINE> New Caledonian Woman Poet Presents New Horizon in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Dewe Gorode, a 47-year-old woman
poet from the South Pacific island of New Caledonia, has presented
a new horizon of life and humanity from her home island at the
Book Saloon of Overseas Territories open here on October 26-27.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that Gorode, who used to be a militant
independence fighter of the aboriginal Kanak nationality in the
French colony, illustrates the emergence of a contemporary Kanak
literature.
</P>
<P>
Although she began writing poems in 1972, she did not have her
books published until 1984, the year when she left the militant
Party of Kanak Liberation to take a teaching career in a village.
</P>
<P>
"I began this transfer from oral literary tradition to written
literature with part of what I have inherited from the Kanak
culture. Writing is a moment of satisfaction, just like ploughing
the land," she said.
</P>
<P>
When she is at home, she plants her own taro, a local fruit
regarded by the Kanak people as the plant symbolic of women. "I
did not leave for Paris without having planted my taro. When we
women travel, there is something which is growing in the land,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Gorode's works are focused on her attachment to the land of
Kanak people, the fight of women, solidarity between men, respect
for others, and respect of the fundamental values of the Kanak
people.
</P>
<P>
In the poetry collection "Agenda," she tells the story about
a little girl looking for her ancestor by counting the twinkling
stars.
</P>
<P>
Educated in France, she returned to the South Pacific island in
the 60s to teach French and the Paici language, which is one of
the 28 tongues used in New Caledonia as well as her mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
The Book Saloon of Overseas Territories, organized by the
French Ministry of Overseas Territories and Departments, displays
works from the French Polynesia, New Caledonia, the Reunion, the
Antilles and the independent state of Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Former Defense Minister Arrested in Arms Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korean police today
arrested former Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho in connection with an
arms scandal.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 59, was charged with accepting 187,000 U.S. dollars in
bribes from Daewoo Heavy Industries Company through an arms dealer
in April last year regarding an army light helicopter project.
</P>
<P>
"Lee admitted last night that he received a bag containing
187,000 U.S. dollars through the arms dealer, Kwon Pyong-ho. He
also confessed that the money was provided by Daewoo which asked
for a state license to participate in the arms buildup program," a
prosecutor said here.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also charged the ex-minister with leaking secrets
while in office by writing a memo in English regarding the Defense
Ministry's plan to purchase F-16 fighter automatic inspection
equipment. Lee allegedly gave the memo to Kwon.
</P>
<P>
However, the prosecution failed to prove the allegation that
Lee received an additional 1.62 million dollars from Daewoo in
November last year.
</P>
<P>
Also arrested were Sok Jin-cho, former president of Daewoo
Heavy Industries Company, a unit of Daewoo Group, and two
employees of a company owned by Kwon.
</P>
<P>
The bribery scandal involving Lee was exposed by the main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP), tipped by
Kwon, on October 17, hours after Lee was removed from his
ministerial post as part of a reshuffle of the military's top
brass.
</P>
<P>
The affair has embarrassed President Kim Young-sam, who has
staked his reputation on an anti-corruption drive that has led to
the trial and conviction of ex-presidents Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo
Hwan.

<HEADLINE> IMF Delegation Holds Talks With Pakistani Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A six-member delegation of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) began talks with Pakistani
government officials here today to work out details on the
resumption of a 600 million-US dollar standby arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The delegation initiated the talks with the officials at the
Finance Ministry, according to official sources. But the sources
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived here Friday night, is led by
Fourtado, who is in charge of the IMF's negotiations with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to stay here for a couple of weeks, according
to the sources.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Pakistan, the delegation would hold a
series of talks with Pakistani officials and complete its review
of Pakistan's economic performance, which is to be presented
before the IMF's executive body in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The executive body will deliberate on the report submitted by
the delegation. After the approval of the report, the release of
the second tranche of 80 million-dollar, which should have been
released in March this year, would get approved.
</P>
<P>
A positive outcome of the review would not only facilitate the
release of the standby credit but also pave the way for an early
resumption of the stalled Pakistani-IMF talks on a new three
billion-dollar Enhanced Structural and Adjustment Facility (ESAF)
for long-term fiscal and structural reforms in the economy, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended disbursements of the 15-month long standby
arrangement for a 600 million-dollar loan signed in December 1995,
on the grounds that Pakistan's economic performance was not
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the IMF delegation here is a sequel to a recent
visit of a high-powered Pakistani delegation to Washington, which
held talks with IMF officials on the resumption of the 600
million-dollar Standby Arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held comprehensive discussions on a modified
package of reforms approved by the federal cabinet of Pakistan
early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government last week announced a new package of
economic reforms to meet the conditions the IMF put forward for
the release of the standby loan.
</P>
<P>
The economic reforms, which include tough measures to cut down
the government expenditure, new taxes and an 8.5 percent
devaluation of the Pakistani rupee, drew wide protests in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition and the business community led a nation-wide
strike today in protest at the package.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A committee has been set
up in Ethiopia to create conditions for the return of a Axum
obelisk from Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said today in a statement that the
committee consists of ministries of information and culture, foreign
affairs and justice as well as the House of People's Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the committee, to be chaired by the
Ministry of Information and Culture, will facilitate the return
of the obelisk looted by facist Italy.
</P>
<P>
It said the committee will also establish an Ethio-Italian joint
team of experts in charge of facilitating conditions for the return
of the Axum obelisk.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government last month expressed its desire to
return the obelisk.
</P>
<P>
Axum obelisks are most striking relics of the ancient Axum
Kingdom established about 2000 years ago in Axum, an ancient city
600 km north of here.
</P>
<P>
They are made of single blocks of granite carved in the
representation of multi-storey buildings. The tallest, now
fallen, stood over 33 meters high and represented a building of
13 storeys. The biggest still standing is 23 meters high with 10
storeys.
</P>
<P>
The Italian aggressors took away one of the obelisks to Rome in
1937. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hariri Calls for Awareness of Challenges from Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Rafik Hariri, the designated
Lebanese prime minister, today called on his people to take into
account the challenges the Middle East peace process -- no matter
what results it has -- would bring to their country.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in an open dialogue with some 100 students and
teachers at the Saint Yoseph University of Beirut on formation of
his next government.
</P>
<P>
"The peace, if reached, will impose on Lebanon big and new
challenges which should be taken into account," he said, "and if
the peace is not reached, we should be ready to withstand the
conditions which Israel wants to impose upon us."
</P>
<P>
He described Lebanon as "the first target" of Israel because
Lebanon is an adversary for the Jewish state in all fields. But he
reiterated his country's adherence to the stand of participating
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to form a "harmonious" government without any
dissidents, saying he does not want anyone who disagrees with the
majority in the government on its general policy to take part in
the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"The opposition is in the parliament, not in the government,"
he said, "there should not be something called opposition in the
government."
</P>
<P>
He said his next government would create more jobs and seek
"new relationship" with the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
Since being designated Thursday by President Elias Hrawi to
head a new government, Hariri has started consultations with
people of different circles including several former prime
ministers on the formation of the new cabinet, the third since he
came to office in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and his 29-member cabinet resigned last week to make way
for the formation of the new government following the opening of
the newly-elected parliament on October 22.
</P>
<P>
He won the general elections in August and September to be the
head of a bloc of over 20 deputies, one of the biggest in the
parliament.

<P>
PARIS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Bombs planted on the tracks went
off when a passenger train ran over them in western Algeria
Thursday, killing eight people and injuring more than 30 others,
according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The train hit several bottles filled with explosives placed on
the tracks between Baba Ali and Oued Smar, about 15 kilometers
south of Algiers, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the powerful explosion of the bombs, which
were covered up by soil and leaves, "reduced eight cars, which
were full of passengers, into a heap of scrap iron."
</P>
<P>
The passengers were "either crushed inside the cars or
completely cut to bits or shreds after being thrown to the road,"
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Several attacks have been launched upon trains between the
towns of Oued Smar and Blida, known to be a stronghold of the
Islamic group, the Islamic Armed Group (GIA).
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed estimations, 90 people have been
killed since September in an intensified wave of terrorist attacks
allegedly by Islamic extremists in the country.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Calls for Awareness of Challenges from Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Rafik Hariri, the designated
Lebanese prime minister, today called on his people to take into
account the challenges the Middle East peace process -- no matter
what results it has -- would bring to their country.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in an open dialogue with some 100 students and
teachers at the Saint Yoseph University of Beirut on formation of
his next government.
</P>
<P>
"The peace, if reached, will impose on Lebanon big and new
challenges which should be taken into account," he said, "and if
the peace is not reached, we should be ready to withstand the
conditions which Israel wants to impose upon us."
</P>
<P>
He described Lebanon as "the first target" of Israel because
Lebanon is an adversary for the Jewish state in all fields. But he
reiterated his country's adherence to the stand of participating
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to form a "harmonious" government without any
dissidents, saying he does not want anyone who disagrees with the
majority in the government on its general policy to take part in
the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"The opposition is in the parliament, not in the government,"
he said, "there should not be something called opposition in the
government."
</P>
<P>
He said his next government would create more jobs and seek
"new relationship" with the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
Since being designated Thursday by President Elias Hrawi to
head a new government, Hariri has started consultations with
people of different circles including several former prime
ministers on the formation of the new cabinet, the third since he
came to office in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and his 29-member cabinet resigned last week to make way
for the formation of the new government following the opening of
the newly-elected parliament on October 22.
</P>
<P>
He won the general elections in August and September to be the
head of a bloc of over 20 deputies, one of the biggest in the
parliament.

<HEADLINE> PA Calls For Strict Adherence To Signed Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority
(PA) in a statement today called on Israel to stop attempts to
change the peace agreements signed by the Labor government and
the PLO, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued at the end of the weekly cabinet
session, which was briefed by Palestinian negotiators on the
on-going negotiations on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet accused Israel of conducting a media campaign to
shift blame on the Palestinian side for the delay of redeployment
from Hebron. It stressed that the Palestinians would not agree to
change even a coma of the agreements already signed.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat met in Gaza last night with
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross to exchange views
on how to wrap up an agreement on Hebron as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Arafat rejected outright charges by Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu of delaying progress toward an
agreement. Netanyahu made the complaints when he phoned
U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat phoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
brief him on the development of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision adopted at the Washington summit at the
beginning of this month, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
have conducted a non-stop talks on Hebron redeployment for the
past three weeks. Major progress has been made on civilian
affairs, but talks on security aspects have progressed slowly.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are scheduled to resume the talks tonight
following overnight negotiations in three days running this week.
</P>
<P>
Ross, on the instruction of Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, will stay away until a final agreement is
struck.

<HEADLINE> GCC to Resume Talks on Unified Customs Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Finance and foreign
ministers of the six-state Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will
resume Sunday their discussions on ways of concluding a uniform
customs tariff agreement in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh,
according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
This would be the second meeting to be held since the start of
this year by the ministers on the issue which has been described
as an important step toward reaching the long sought economic
integrity by the Middle East regional political and economic
joint body established in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The finance and foreign ministers of the GCC states -- Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and
Qatar -- held their last session in early June.
</P>
<P>
The GCC assistant secretary general for economic affairs,
Abdallah Bin Saleh Al-khalifi, recently said that "chances are
high to overcome obstacles and reach an agreement" in regard to
the issue. Meanwhile, GCC Secretary General Sheikh Jamil
Al-Hujeilan was making intensive efforts and contacts with member
states to reach the agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that during the two-day meeting, a proposal
to apply a unified 8 percent tax rate and the exemption of around
5 percent of the commodities from taxes would be
disussed. Besides, Oman, which currently chairs the session,
could submit fresh proposals, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is in line with the instructions given by GCC
leaders during their 16th summit in Muscat, Oman, in December
1995 when the leaders underlined the importance of unifying
customs tariffs among members states.
</P>
<P>
In its final communique, the summit assigned GCC finance and
foreign ministers for this delicate task.
</P>
<P>
Despite long discussions of the issue of unified custom
tariffs, no progress has been achieved yet.
</P>
<P>
GCC sources indicated that certain member states such as Saudi
Arabia and Bahrain insisted on maintaining relatively high
customs tariffs in order to rationalize consumption and support
national industries while other states adopted a free-trade
policy including low taxes.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have been imposing duties of more
than 20 percent on some imports, while the United Arab Emirates
and Oman have been levying tariffs below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world biggest oil producer and supplier,
fears lowering the tariff will hurt its non-oil industries while
Bahrain has sought compensation as it heavily relies on taxes,
given its relatively small oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
However, GCC officials said this year they had completed most
of the work in classifying more than 900 products covering those
to be taxed or exempted.
</P>
<P>
Absence of unified customs tariffs hinders prospects for
enhancing GCC inter-state trade which is still minimal. In 1995,
imports among them constituted only 8.2 percent of the total
Gulf imports, and exports constituted 20 percent of the total
GCC-non oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that integration operations in a
number of other economic sectors rely on what could be achieved
in the lingering trade exchange awaiting the endorsement of a
unified GCC customs tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Tariff unification is also essential for a GCC common market,
stipulated by their 1983 economic agreement which could give
birth to the biggest consumer market in the region with imports
of more than 50 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
It would also mean the biggest oil bloc in history, holding
more than 45 percent of the world's total proven crude reserves.
</P>
<P>
Customs unification has also been demanded by the European
Union as a pre-requisite for their proposed free trade
agreement. The GCC and European Union foreign ministers agreed at
talks in April to set a deadline of no more than two years to
complete the free trade accord between the two trading partners
-- an issue under discussion for more than 10 years.

<HEADLINE> 26 Enterprises to Be Privatized in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
expected to earn more than 50 million U.S. Dollars from the
planned privatization of 26 enterprises during the 1996/97
financial year, according to the latest issue of "Quarterly
Budget Review".
</P>
<P>
Preparation for the sale of these enterprises is at an
advanced stage with l9 companies and 13 subsidiaries being
privatized in the second half of this year, the review noted.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 207 enterprises earmarked for privatization, the
government has either completely divested its holdings or reduced
its share in 140 enterprises since the beginning of the public
enterprise program in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the sale amount to about 160 million U.S.
Dollars, out of which more than 90 million U.S. Dollars has so
far been received, the review said.
</P>
<P>
The privatization aspect of the program is intended to enhance
the productive base of the national economy by transferring
ownership of the enterprises to the private sector.

<HEADLINE> No Fresh Polls in Zanzibar: Amour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President
Salmin Amour today assured Revolutionary Party (CCM) government
there are no internal or external forces which can call fresh
elections to appease some political groups till the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News paper quoted Amour as saying at a
mammoth rally to mark one year after his re-election in Zanzibar
today that there would be no fresh polls to impose a new
government to satisfy some politicians in the isles.
</P>
<P>
Amour, who doubles as the CCM Vice Chairman (for Zanzibar),
said people should not be swayed over the idea Zanzibar would
call fresh polls on grounds that the last October election was
"not free and fair".
</P>
<P>
He said those wishing to rule Zanzibar should prepare for the
next elections in 2000, insisting that the government is firm to
respect the constitution against any attempts of violations.
</P>
<P>
The president was reacting to reports being circulated in
Zanzibar by the opposition that Zanzibar should be pressurized by
the international community to hold fresh elections soon.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Amour won in multi-party elections by a meager
50.2 percent againstized his opponent Seif Shariff Hamad of the Civic
United Front (CUF) who polled 49.8 percent out of more than
300,000 votes casts.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to work hand in hand with the government
to bring development instead of fanning fire of emotion and
confrontation in the isles.
</P>
<P>
Amour noted that this is not the time to depend on foreigners,
but the duty of every one to chart out development strategies for
the benefit of all Zanzibaris.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he assured that despite tight financial situation
the government would strived to bring a balanced development in
Zanzibar and Pemba irrespective of one side's political
inclination.

<HEADLINE> Israel: No Drilling for Oil on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel has denied reports
that a state-owned company plans to drill for oil on the Golan
Heights, Israel Radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The National Infrastructure Ministry turned down a report by
the Hebrew daily Ha'aretz Friday which said the National Oil
Company has the right to prospect oil on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, there had been plans to drill for
oil in the area, but since the government intends to privatize
the company, all plans for further prospecting have been shelved,
including on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the strategic Golan Heights from Syria during
the Six Day War in 1967, and the renewal of Jewish settlements on
the heights began immediately after the war.
</P>
<P>
On 14 December 1981, the Knesset (Israel's parliament) passed
The Golan Law, announcing "The law, jurisdiction, and
administration of the state shall apply to the Golan Heights."
</P>
<P>
At previous peace negotiations with Israel, Syria insisted
that the Golan Heights be returned, in accordance with the
principle of "Land for peace," which has been rejected by the
new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Syrian official newspaper Tishreen today criticized Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for reportedly approving a
request to drill for oil on the Golan Heights, demanding for a
total Israeli pullout from the area.

<HEADLINE> French Far-Right FN Deputies Demonstrate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- About 100 local deputies from the
French far-right National Front (FN) party of Jean-Marie Le Pen
today demonstrated in front of the building of the National
Assembly to protest its unanimous adoption of a new law on
fighting racism.
</P>
<P>
The deputies, including members of the European parliament and
deputies in provincial administrative and legislative councils,
were led by the 68-year-old Le Pen himself when staging the
protest, which ended without any incident.
</P>
<P>
The deputies asked the parliament to withdraw the new
anti-racist law which they called "Law Toubon" in reference to
its elaborator, the Minister of Justice Jacques Toubon.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen, who will pay a three-day visit to Hungary from Sunday
at the invitation of the Hungarian far-right Party of Justice and
Life of Hungary (MIEP), said that this "small, symbolic
demonstration" was also a public show of "the future FN
deputies" to the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The FN is aiming to enter the parliament after the 1998
legislative election, as the French government is expected to
adopt a proportionate representative system in the parliament to
allow small parties, such the FN and the Green Party, to be
represented in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time within one week for the FN to stage a
demonstration in Paris. Several hundred FN supporters gathered at
the Arc of Triumph on October 21 to protest the anti-racist law,
which gives a stricter and clearer definition to racist remarks
and behaviors then a previous law adopted in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen's forthcoming visit to Hungary has caused concern of the
Hungarian government, which has expressed its hope that the visit
would end without any incident.
</P>
<P>
"We know the ideas of Mr. Le Pen and the carrying out without
any incident of the manifestation should be the responsibility of
the party which organizes this visit," said a Hungarian Foreign
Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The FN has been actively seeking ties with other far-right
European parties such as the Austrian Nationalist Party (FPOe) led
by Joerg Haider, which won more than 28 percent of the votes in
Austria's first election for its deputies to the European
Parliament this month.
</P>
<P>
The FN, which has seven deputies in European Parliament
including Le Pen himself, is also trying to put together an
"anti-Maastricht camp" in the European Parliament with the
Belgian far-right Vlaams Blok and the German far-right Republican
party led by Franz Schoenhuber.

ABU DHABI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan Ben Zayed al Nahyan
today called on the U.S. to put pressure on Israel and make it
abide by the Middle East peace process.
</P>

During a meeting with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of

the United States, the chief sponsor of the Middle East peace

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official on Hebron Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli negotiators are still
setting many obstacles to the possibility of reaching an
agreement on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank city of
Hebron, and are seeking to renegotiate items of the old
agreement, according to a high-ranking Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Abed Rabbo, minister of culture and information in the
Palestinian Authority (PA), made the remarks in an exclusive
interview with the Tunisian newspaper Asherouq, which was
published today.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo, who is also member of the Palestinian negotiating
team, added that a number of major issues remain unsettled, and
that the Israeli government is colluding with Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Among the points of disagreement between the two sides is the
fact that the Palestinians are supposed to be immediately in
charge of most areas of the city in the initial stage, yet the
Israelis are seeking to make the Palestinian responsibility of
the city formal, Abed Rabbo explained.
</P>
<P>
Another point of disagreement, he continued, is the so-called
"hot pursuit," the right of Israelis to enter the areas that
would come under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
All these issues should be tackled, with the two sides taking
into consideration that both the unity of Hebron and the
Palestinian Authority's powers should be maintained, Abed Rabbo
argued.
</P>
<P>
In an agreement between Israel's previous government and the
Palestinians, Israeli troops were to pull out of 80 percent of
Hebron in March. Soldiers were to remain only in areas where the
settlers live. However, four suicide bombings in the spring that
took more than 60 lives delayed the pullout. It was rescheduled
for June, then further postponed after the election victory of
Binyamin Netanyahu who has taken a hardline policy toward the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo affirmed that points of agreement outnumber points
of disagreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis, and
that Israeli troops that will withdraw from Hebron should not
return to the city.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian Authority's stand obtains wide understanding
at the Arab, Islamic and international levels, so we ought to
keep patient," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. role in the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations, Abed Rabbo said that delaying and obstructing the
peace process on the Palestinian track would have negative
effects on all other tracks and on the future regional plans
including the Cairo economic summit due to be convened next month.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about what was announced by Dennis Ross,
the U.S. Mideast peace coordinator, that reaching an agreement
was imminent, Abed Rabbo said what was stated by Ross was partly
true.

AMMAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross today told Jordanian King Hussein that
the differences between Israel and Palestine in their
negotiations have been narrowed.
</P>
<P>
Ross was briefing Hussein over telephone on the progress made
in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on Israeli redeployment
in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Ross said the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators would meet
tonight in Tel Aviv in another attempt to overcome obstacles in a
bid to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. peace envoy directly participated the negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israelis which was launched shortly
after the Washington summit early this month.
</P>
<P>
His participation in the talks over the long delayed Israeli
redeployment in Hebron was widely seen here as an indication that
the United States hopes for an agreement which would salvage the
endangered peace process.

<HEADLINE> American Weapons for Bosnia Not Loaded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A chartered ship left the
Croatian port of Ploce on Saturday without loading its cargo of
American heavy weapons for the Muslim-Croat federation, the
Bosnian television reported.
</P>
<P>
The ship was carrying 45 M-60 tanks, 15 attack helicopters, 80
armored personnel carriers and other weapons, which formed the
bulk of the 100-million U.S. dollar weaponry that Washington
promised to give to the federation army.
</P>
<P>
The ship reportedly left Ploce but was staying in the deep
waters because the Muslim side of the federation refused to meet a
U.S. request to fire Hasan Cengic, the deputy defense minister of
the federation, for his alleged connection with Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, interview on the BiH TV, Bosnian prime minister Hasan
Muratovic denied that the United States had demanded Cengic's
removal. But he admitted that Washington was unsatisfied with the
cooperation between the Muslim and Croat officials in the
federation's defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic hinted that Cengic might leave the defense ministry
because there would be reorganization of the federal government
soon.

<HEADLINE> 24-Hr-Service on the Rise In China's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- In the old days, Chinese worked
from sunrise to sunset, but all that's changed now.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Beijing, more and more a person can eat and
drink from restaurants and bars, and services ranging from shops
to telephones are available from sunrise to sunrise, in this new
age of catering to the new customer class.
</P>
<P>
Some attribute the phenomenon to the country's booming economy,
more diversified off-hours activities, and growing night life.
</P>
<P>
Others believe that the growing competition among rival
companies and shops with an ever decreasing segment of the market
is responsible for the trend.
</P>
<P>
In any case, Beijing's "Window Industries", meaning the service
trade sectors in general, are pushing quality service as part of
their scheme that includes increased hours, making it possible for
customers to stay in restaurants until late into the night.
</P>
<P>
Most important of all perhaps is that people believe that the
round-the-clock service in Beijing demonstrates a simple fact: the
purchasing power of ordinary Chinese has grown significantly in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Three Chinese Service Centers Become 'Enterprise Incubators' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Three hi-tech service centers
in the capital city of Beijing, Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu
Province, and Chongqing in southwest China have been named the
country's first international 'enterprise incubators'.
</P>
<P>
The designation means helping to create the environment and
conditions needed to provide small and medium-sized
technology-intensive enterprises, with access to the market.
</P>
<P>
Since the first incubator was set up in Wuhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province, in 1987, 80 more have been added
in various parts of the country, helping "hatch" 2,500 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology commission, with the aid of
the United Nations Development Program and Industrial Development
Organization, decided to select a number of enterprises as
international 'enterprise incubators' last year. This is aimed to
promote direct co-operation among hi-tech enterprises both in and
outside China.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission is expected to
select the second group of incubators in the cities of Shanghai,
Tianjin, Chengdu, and Wuhan, sources say.

BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Wanda, which won the
league title one week before the end of the season, extended its
unbeaten run to 34 matches on Sunday, the 22nd and the final round
of the China professional soccer league.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Team, coached by former Chinese international player
Chi Shangbing, began their unbeaten run since the 14th round last
season.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Dalian team played an away match against Sichuan
Quanxin at Chengdu. Captain Xu Hong levelled the score 2-2 for
Dalian just 30 seconds before the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time for the Dalian team to win the league
title. In 1994, the Dalian team surprised their opponents by
taking the inaugural China professional league. But one year
later, they finished only third behind Shanghai Shenhua and Beijing
Guo'an.
</P>
<P>
The draw was good enough for the team which comes from China's
most famous "Soccer City". They totalled 46 points from 12 wins
and 10 draws in the season, six points clear of the second-placed
Shanghai Shenhua.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Shanghai Shenhua, which suffered from seven
consecutive draws during the season to drop out of the title
contention, conceded their third loss this season, losing 0-1 to
hosts Beijing Guo'an.
</P>
<P>
But they still maintained the second place with 39 points from
10 wins, 9 draws against 3 losses, 4 points ahead of the Chinese
Army team which was beaten 0-1 by Guangdong Hongyuan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Samsung played an exciting match against Guangzhou
Apollo on home turf. Yu Genwei scored twice to secure the victory
for the Tianjin team.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen and Guangzhou Songri, playing only for their honor in
the last round, forcing Yanbian Hyundai and Jinan Taishan to
goalless draws respectively. But they still dropped to the second
division.

DAMASCUS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The assistant secretary of

<P>
Briefing the delegation members about the latest developments

withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights.

In response, Huang Huang praised the great achievements won

<HEADLINE> Third Party in French Colony Prefers Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Rather than independence or total
adherence to France, the third largest political party of the
French colony of New Caledonia today reaffirmed its choice of a
large degree of autonomy for the South Pacific territory.
</P>
<P>
Une Nouvelle-Caledonie Pour Tous (UNCT), or "a New Caledonia
for All" reiterated its stand at its first congress.
</P>
<P>
"I see New Caledonia as a largely emancipated community,
administrating itself in many fields, but longly tied to France by
the common values and institutional mechanism," local media quoted
UNCT's president Didier Leroux as saying in Noumea, capital of New
Caledonia.
</P>
<P>
The UNCT, the third party of the island since July 1995 with
nine seats in the local parliament, keeps distance with both the
pro-independence Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak Socialiste
(Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, FLNKS), and the
anti-independence Rassemblement pour la Caledonie dans la
Republique (Rally for Caledonia in the Republic, RPCR).
</P>
<P>
The UNCT president also denounced the tripartite negotiations
for the island's future exclusively between the French government,
the FLNKS and RPCR.
</P>
<P>
Late French President Francois Mitterrand started an
independence process for New Caledonia in 1988 after the militant
wing of FLNKS launched a series of attacks upon French police
forces and local European inhabitants in the mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The French government planned a referendum in 1998 on the
future of the nickel-rich colony, which has a population of some
118,000 and a territory of 16,750 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Leroux also criticized FLNKS for advocating building the future
of New Caledonia on the "claiming of the Kanak identity," which he
said would only be a threat to peace and lead to exclusion of
other communities.

<HEADLINE> China Evaluates Its Lawyers' Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Justice has
decided to carry out a two-month evaluation of lawyers and their
work as a study of professional ethics, sources with the ministry
say.
</P>
<P>
The assessment is scheduled to be done from October 20 to
December 20, during which time ministry officials will look for
any illegal conduct by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
This could include being employed by two law firms at the same
time, acting as agents for both sides in a lawsuit, using
unscrupulous means to get business, refusing to handle a case
without a good excuse after having already taken it, not showing
up in court on time, and not protecting the privacy of clients.
</P>
<P>
Improper behavior can also include asking for favors from
clients, offering bribes to law-enforcement personnel, causing
disturbances in court, interfering in the legal process, and
faking evidence on purpose.
</P>
<P>
Any lawyers found engaging in any form of unscrupulous behavior
will be subject to strict penalties, while those who perform their
jobs well will be commended, officials with the ministry said.

<P>
CHANGSHA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Procuratorial departments in
central China's Hunan province, have ferreted out 571 economic
cases involving 572 people in abnormally unprofitable enterprises
in the first nine months this year.
</P>
<P>
The province has retrieved more than 66 million yuan (8.1
million U.S. dollars) of money embezzled or received from bribes
during that period.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, the procuratorial departments dispatched
teams to 486 companies to investigate their production, materials
supply, product sales and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The city of Changsha, the provincial capital, witnessed the
creation of many development projects in the suburban areas over
the past few years, while a construction company in charge of the
development reported rising profit losses.
</P>
<P>
After in-depth investigation conducted by the Yuhua District
Procuratorate, nine people, including the company's manager, the
deputy director of the district's construction bureau, and the
director of the Xinmin Development Zone were found to have taken
bribes valued at some 600,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hunan's procuratorial agencies have also helped to improve the
administration and finance systems for companies that have
reported heavy losses in income.
</P>
<P>
With their help, 51 of the failing enterprises have reduced
their losses and another 16 enterprises are making substantial
profit increases.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Males Feel Greater Daily Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey in China's
leading industrial and financial city has shown that its male
residents are feeling much greater pressure in their lives than
are females.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Shanghai's Hongqiao Friendship
Shopping Center, Youth Daily, and the Shanghai Branch of China
News Service and showed that 15 percent of the city's males
responded with "sleep" when they were asked "What do you usually
want to do on the weekend."
</P>
<P>
Only 2.5 percent of the females say they want to spend their
weekends sleeping, opting for shopping, watching TV, and enjoying
music instead.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai men are known for their gentleness with their wives
and doing housework voluntarily and some say most could be called
"model husbands", and many of them now have to worry about buying
housing even before they get married.
</P>
<P>
Of some 1,000 people surveyed, 38.7 percent of the males say
they are saving money for a house as soon as they get a job, but
only 7.2 percent of women think of saving money for a house.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that 10.9 percent of males save money
for electric appliances after they get a girlfriend, but only 3.7
percent of the females save money for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's men are also suffering much greater psychological
pressures, another survey says, since most women require their
husbands to share more of the housework, while moving ahead in
their careers at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai women however seem to be able to balance the conflicts
of the ideal with the real, and although they have high hopes for
their husbands their marriages are stable, because men have more
opportunities to look for jobs and being promoted than women do.

<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Fresh evidence shows that the
British government has eased its military equipment supply
restrictions against Argentina enforced since Falklands conflict
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Britain's famous engines company Rolls-Royce, which made
the engines that power the Argentine navy's frigates,
admits it was told by the government to resume sales of
hitherto banned naval spares to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The British newspaper "The Observer" quoted a senior
Argentine official as saying "British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind himself confirmed the spares offer while oil
talks were going on".
</P>
<P>
The ban was relaxed on June 2, l995, six days before
Rifkind's predecessor, Douglas Hurd, sat down for the oil
talks, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, Rifkind told Parliament last Thursday that the
policy on Argentine arms has not changed. But it turns out
the ban has been "reinterpreted."

<HEADLINE> Both Grain Imports and Harvest Go Up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Grain imports in China during
the first eight months this year saw a 71 percent rise from the
same period in 1995 to reach 8.43 million tons, though the country
is expecting a bumper grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
The government is expecting an import increase, coupled with a
grain harvest anticipated to surpass 480 million tons this year,
in order to keep inflation at bay, today's "China Daily" quoted
the State Statistics Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's participation in the international grain trade is
strictly monopolized by the government, explaining that the
massive purchase of foreign cereals this year corresponded exactly
with official plans, according to analysts from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Despite a bumper summer grain harvest to rise three percent to
top 110 million tons this year, the country stepped up cereals
imports by three percent as early as during the first half this
year to hit 6.7 million tons, while exports of such commodities
decreased 11 percent to reach 586,000 tons during the same period.
</P>
<P>
However, some areas in the countryside still suffer from a
grain shortage and others anticipate difficulties arising from
too-low prices both on the free market and in sales to the State.
</P>
<P>
This year the government raised its purchasing price for rice,
wheat, maize and soy beans by an average 40 percent to stir
farmers' production enthusiasm.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Audit on Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China has started a careful tax
audit on representative offices opened by foreign companies in the
country, today's "China Daily" quoted the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move started earlier this month and will be concluded by
the end of June 1997, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
China has now more than 7,000 registered representative offices
of foreign firms, a big leap from 1,000 in 1985, but the annual
tax revenue from the offices can hardly reflect the growth, said
Su Xiaolu, head of the foreign tax inspection division of SAT's
foreign investment taxation department.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of tax levied on the offices is very low, added
Su.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the registered offices, only one-third have
declared their income, although much more foreign offices have
operational income by conducting intermediary services.
</P>
<P>
Tax authorities will first select some key offices for the
audit, and serious tax evaders will be listed publicly. Methods of
tax collection will also be improved, said Su.
</P>
<P>
Taxation departments will also co-ordinate with other
departments to standardize management of the offices, in the
process of closing some unlicensed offices, added Su.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies began to open representative offices in China
in earnest in the early 1980s, which can also conduct
supplementary services for their companies, such as seeking
customers in China.
</P>
<P>
But an investigation in the mid-1980s revealed that these
offices have not only assisted their own companies, but also
provided some intermediary services for other companies for
commission, prompting China to collect consolidated industrial and
commercial tax and enterprise income tax on them in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The offices began to pay business tax and enterprise income tax
instead of the previous two consolidated taxes after the country's
reform in the tax system in 1994.

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The final 10 days of the 1996 presidential campaign are
shaping up as a furious struggle by the two major parties and their
allies to get their supporters to the polls, in the face of
widespread indications that sagging voter interest may well
diminish turnout.
</P>
<P>
-- The Justice Department declared that Richard A. Jewell is no

Olympic Park.

Croats, economic growth has turned out to be much slower than
expected.
</P>
<P>

Dole has a point when he lambastes the liberal news media.

<P>
TAIYUAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- An attempt to turn the eroded
loess plateau in north China's Shanxi Province into a "green land"
has paid off, thanks to increased input from the central and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
A report from the local water control department shows that the
central government has put 225 million yuan into projects on the
Sanchuan, Yongding, and Fenhe rivers in the past eight years. Some
3.4 million hectares of eroded land has become fertile, and half
of the eroded soil in the province is expected to be green by the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Of the 156,000 sq km on the loess plateau in Shanxi, 70 percent
is eroded wasteland. In the late 1970s, some 366 million tons of
soil was eroded and emptied into and carried away by the Yellow
River every year.
</P>
<P>
However, historical records indicates that about 1,500 years
ago, the Yellow river was a clean river of limpid water with its
banks teemed with tall trees.
</P>
<P>
The loess plateau project was launched in the early 1980s, when
Miao Hunman, a farmer from Xiaowang Village in Hequ County, signed
a contract with a local government to plant trees in a 2.5-km-long
valley.
</P>
<P>
Miao and his family members built damed, terraced mountain
sides and planted trees and grass in the valley. Three years
later, the valley began to turn green, and the average per-capita
grain output reached 2,000 kg, with per capita income jumping to
1,500 yuan on average.
</P>
<P>
Many officials and experts, from both at home and overseas,
visited the valley after that, marking the start of the province's
project to tackle the eroding wasteland problem.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 percent of the wasteland in the upper reaches of the
Sanchuan and Yongding rivers has been reclaimed, and about
130,000 hectares of eroded earth along the Fenhe river turned into
rich and fertile farmland.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Nigerian Villages Sacked by Chadian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Villagers in six villages
in the Nigerian northeast state of Borno have been displaced
within one month by fleeing anti-government elements from chad.
</P>
<P>
The sacked villages, in three local government areas of the
state, include two fishing settlements in the lake chad
shores, the Nigerian paper "Sunday Champion" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who operate mostly with sophisticated weapons,
raided unsuspecting villages and confiscated the foodstuff and
animals of the villagers periodically, forcing them to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Three villages along the border with Chad have become desolate
owing to the constant threats to the lives of the villagers by
armed bandits from the neighboring chad, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A local government chairman was quoted by the paper as saying
that the rebels always struck when the able-bodied men were in
the farms or grazing their cattle. whenever they struck, they
maimed and raped women indicrminately in addition to taking away
foodstuff and animals, particularly donkeys, horses and goats
which are still highly priced in Chad.
</P>
<P>
The situation became so acute that the villagers stormed the
mobbar local government council headquarters, demanding to be
given refugees' status as the security of their lives could no
longer be guaranteed, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The sacking, according to the report, has not been revealed
until Victor Ozodinobi, the State Administrator, visited the
areas recently.
</P>
<P>
The report also mentioned the attack of Nigerian villages at
the border areas by Cameroonian gendarmes, but it did not give

<HEADLINE> Anti-Corruption in Fujian Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Law bodies in Fujian have, since
1993, looked into some 6,000 economic corruption cases, 71.7
percent of the total number of cases investigated. Each case
involved 10,000 yuan or over and 90 cases each with one million
yuan or over, according to the provincial government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also revealed that from January 1993 to
September 1996, prosecutors at all levels looked into 8,363
corruption cases, including 2,051 graft allegations, 3,582 bribery
cases, together taking up 67.4 percent of the total, and
recovering losses of 320 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the anti-corruption campaign, procuratorial bodies focussed
their efforts on corruption cases involving leading government
officials at administrative law enforcement, judicial and economic
management departments.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the prosecutors have dealt with 2,778 cases of this
kind, and investigated 233 major cases involving officials ranking
above county magistrate level, with bribery cases taking up 76
percent, the statistics said.
</P>
<P>
With the in-depth development of reform, new types of economic
crime are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors are paying close attention to the fast
expanding economic sectors, such as financial, tax-reform and
state-run enterprise reform sectors.
</P>
<P>
A total of 659 directors of state-run enterprises have been
investigated since 1993, the statistics shows.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thai Parties Jockeying for Position in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Now with the candidacy
registration over, political parties in Thailand have begun
explaining their campaigning platforms to the public to capture as
many seats as possible in the new 393-seat House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day registration from October 21-25, 13
political parties fielded a total of 2,310 candidates for the
November 17 general election.
</P>
<P>
Since candidates in some constituencies are uncontested,
rivalry in others will be fierce when candidates from several
different parties are seeking election of one seat in one
particular area.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, campaigning strategies and
vote-buying are more important than platforms for capturing their
coveted votes, political commentators said.
</P>
<P>
Election campaigning has been characterized by mud-slinging and
dirt-digging, with each party claiming itself to be the best and
the most suitable to be the core for forming a new coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the strength of each candidate's team fielded by
the various parties and their popularity among voters, it appears
that the top three contenders for Thailand's 22nd premiership
since the adoption of a constitutional monarchy in 1932, are
Democrat Party leader Chuan Leekpai, New Aspiration Party leader
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, and Chart Pattana (National Development)
Party leader Chatichai Choonhavan.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party, whose stronghold is in the south, will
capitalize on its credible image and rising popularity, promoting
party leader Chuan as an honest and capable politician, who will
drop off his indecisiveness and make prompt decisions.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit is obviously the most ambitious and most anxious to
become prime minister, commentators said. A few years ago, he
resigned as army commander-in-chief and declared his intention to
become prime minister through means acceptable to the people.
</P>
<P>
Having failed in his previous bids for the post, he recently
said his party's big win in the election would be key to the
country's political stability, peace and order.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been the behind-the-scenes power broker of two
former prime ministers, and believed that the time was now ripe
for him to rise to prominence, adding that with him as prime
minister, his party would be able to solve the country's major
problems through a "dream team" of experts.
</P>
<P>
However, his daring remark was frowned upon by other prime
minister hopefuls as well as his political foes.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai, a former prime minister who was ousted by a military
junta in 1991 over alleged rampant corruption in his
administration, promised to revive "the golden era" of the
country's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
He is regarded as a possible compromise choice for the top
post.
</P>
<P>
The democrats and Chart Pattana, both of which were in the
opposition before the House was dissolved by caretaker prime
minister Banharn Silpa-Archa on September 27, have reportedly
agreed to cooperate during campaigning and after the polls.
</P>
<P>
The democrats, who headed a coalition government from
1992-1995, expect to win 120 seats, up from 86 seats it won in the
July 1995 election, while New Aspiration hopes to win at least 100
seats this time. In 1995, it won 57 seats.
</P>
<P>
Political observers say with two political heavyweights --
Chavalit and Chatichai -- vying for the top post, vote-buying
would be even more rampant in the 19 northeastern provinces ahead
of the election.
</P>
<P>
Although vote-buying is seen as widespread in the country, none
of the top contenders would confirm or deny that billions of bhat
are being spent in vote-buying across the country.
</P>
<P>
In Thai politics, a platform is necessary, strategy is
important, but after all, money is most crucial.
</P>
<P>
Of the three top post contenders, none lacks rich financial
supporters.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Successful in Eliminating Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Over 100,000 farmers a year in
Tujia-Miao Autonomous Prefecture in middle China's Hunan Province
bid farewell to poverty.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture, in Xiangxi or western Hunan, is surrounded by
mountains and known as one of the poorest areas in the
country. It has a population of over two million, with
two thirds being of minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
With the help of central and provincial governments, over 230
enterprises have been set up in recent years in the prefecture,
covering food, leather, and timber processing, textiles, and
cigarette- and wine-making industries.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output value of those enterprises accounts now
for more than 80 percent of the prefecture's revenues.
</P>
<P>
Also, the prefecture has newly cultivated 73,000 ha for fruit
trees, medical herbs, mulberry and tea, 13,000 ha for tobacco, and
700,000 goats have been raised.
</P>
<P>
Production of mandarin oranges alone brought in a total income
of over 100 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, 151 "Hope Schools", primary schools
supported with aid-the-poor funds, have been built. Every year,
the prefecture collected 5.5 million yuan to help 30,000 children
with their education.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the prefecture has invested 23 million yuan in the
improvement of infrastructure, with 1,454-km of roads built. Now
electricity is available for 85 percent of the villages in the
prefecture.
</P>
<P>
So far, 58.8 percent of the prefecture's area is covered by
forest, which serves to store 15 million cubic meters of timber,
while providing a good ecological environment.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Remain Far Apart in Talks: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian negotiator Hasan
Asfour said today that the latest round of Israeli-Palestinian
talks achieved nothing because of Israel's "obstinacy" on
security matters.
</P>
<P>
Asfour's remarks were carried by the Jerusalem Media and
Communications Center (JMCC), a Palestinian press service based
in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
No progress has been made in the talks held Saturday night at
the Tel Aviv residence of U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk with the
presence of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, the JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides are still far apart from achieving a limited
mechanism to implement the signed agreement," Asfour said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Palestinian negotiator charged that Israeli side
demanded "security measures of political tone which aimed at
minimizing the role of the Palestinian Authority (PA)."
</P>
<P>
The sticking point remained on Israeli demand for conducting
hot pursuit of suspected terrorists in PA-controlled areas in
Hebron. Asfour said the Palestinian side flatly refused
"Israel's obstinacy which demonstrated the PA as powerless."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ross continued his mediation efforts today to
finalize a deal on Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron. He is
to hold a meeting with Netanyahu to discuss the latest
developments in the talks.
</P>
<P>
State-run Israel Radio reported that Ross was also expected
to hold a meeting with PA President Yasser Arafat in order to
solve the last differences in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was briefed on the latest talks Saturday night and
he urged Arafat to continue the path of peace instead of
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources reportedly said that a meeting between
Netanyahu and Arafat could take place today to wrap up the three
weeks of talks. But there has been no sign that such a summit
would be held.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted political sources close to the talks as
saying that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were expected to
draft the agreement on Hebron redeployment.

<P>
LUSAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Zambia
Democratic Congress (ZDC) walked out at an Electoral Commisstion
meeting here on Saturday, local newspaper "Sunday Mail" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The ZDC also warned that their participation in the next
month's elections will depend on the Electoral Commission's
enthusiasm to iron out contentious issues in the electoral
process.
</P>
<P>
At a highly-charged meeting between major political parties
and the commission, ZDC National Secretary Derrick Chitala and
Deputy National Secretary Azwell Banda packed their notes and
headed for the doorway when Commissioner Lucie Kasanga insisted
that electoral rules will not be bent for the ZDC's sake.
</P>
<P>
The two branded Kasanga an cadre of the ruling Movement for
Multi-party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Later Kasanga said she has never been a politician.
</P>
<P>
Chitala said the whole composition of the commission is a
"circus and a joke."
</P>
<P>
Chitala earlier told the commissioners that their conduct does

<HEADLINE> Jeep Drivers to Stage Strike in Metro Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Drivers of jeepneys, a kind of
popular minibus resembling jeeps in the Philippines, announced
here today that they will stage a strike in metro Manila on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The jeepney drivers said they will begin their strike at 5 a.m.
across metro Manila, but total paralysis of traffic is only
expected in Makati and Paranaque, the two commercial cities in
metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
The jeepney drivers decided to stage the strike after
authorities rejected their demands for raising fares following the
increase of gasoline and diesel prices in the country.
</P>
<P>
But Romen Maganto, traffic executive director of the Metro
Manila Development Authority (MMDA), said the strike will not
attain its goal since two biggest jeepney drivers' associations
are not joining the stoppage.
</P>
<P>
He added that traffic in metro Manila would not be paralyzed
because the MMDA has adopted preventative measures to deal with
the situation.

<P>
CAIRO, October 27 (Xinhua)-- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries
International Development Fund has signed agreements with five
countries on extending new loans worth a total of 24.7 million
U.S. dollars, according to the Arabic-language newspaper Al Ahram
today.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Fund said that Egypt would receive under
these agreements 10 million dollars in assistance for development
of primary education programs.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the rate of interest on the loans ranged
between 2.5 and 3 percent payable over a period of 17 years with
a five year period of grace.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A Egyptian cabinet minister said that Egypt has
become one of the most important "economic tigers" in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
A deal between Egypt and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the Paris Club debt waiver both attributed to international
recognition of the success of Egypt's economic reforms, said
Egyptian State Minister of Cabinet Economic Affairs Youssef
Boutros Ghali Friday in statements, which were carried by the
English-language Egyptian Gazette today.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club decided to scrap 4.2 billion U.S. dollars of
Egypt's debts only days after Egypt and the IMF signed the deal
under which the IMF approved Egypt's second-phase economic reform
plan, currently in effect.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's debts now amount to 31 billion dollars, he said,
adding that Egypt now refrains from borrowing money.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan will lower charges both for local and
international telephone calls from January 1, 1997, the
English-language daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Walid Dweik, director-general of the Telecommunications
Corporation (TCC), said the new charges would regard national
calls within the governorate as local calls and would reduce
national calls in all government rates to a unified charge of 41
fils (about 5.74 U.S. cents) per minute.
</P>
<P>
He said that night tariffs will be applied to national calls
on Fridays and national holidays.
</P>
<P>
International calls will be charged 20 percent less in
average, and the board of directors will specify the charges
with each country according to bilateral agreements, Dweik added.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordanian Minister of Labor Abdul Hafez Shakhanbeh
said that 50,000 new jobs must be created each year to maintain
the unemployment rate at its current level, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the importance of small projects in
creating jobs, according to the English-language daily Jordan
Times.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of non-Jordanian workers who hold
permits to work in agriculture was about 34,000 but the actual
number of workers in this category exceeds 100,000.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Ministry of Labor planned to
reduce the number of foreign laborers in the kingdom from the
current 400,000 to 100,000 in order to alleviate the
unemployment pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
Alien workers are mainly employed in the long-work-time and
low-pay professionals as agriculture and construction, upon which
most Jordanians look down, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged all Jordanian workers to accept whatever
work available in the market.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the unemployment rate in the
country is 15 percent while unofficial estimates claim that it
is up to 20 percent.

<P>
CAIRO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli ex-Prime Minister Shimon
Peres is having talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
immediately after his arrival in the Sinai Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh early today.
</P>
<P>
Peres' visit, at the invitation of Mubarak, will cover the
latest developments of the Middle East peace process and in
particular the faltering Palestinian-Israeli talks on the
implementation of already signed accords on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party leader, a Nobel Peace Prize
laureate, is instrumental in making the historical peace deal
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, together with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his predecessor Yitzak Rabin,
who was assassinated a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Rabin government had reached agreement with the PA under
which Israeli soldiers would leave the bulk of the West Bank town
of Hebron, where about 400 Jewish settlers live among 100,000
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said he wanted better security arrangements for
the settlers before he ordered the pullback.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's Cabinet Saturday blamed Israel for lack of progress in
redeployment talks.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Peres warned Netanyahu that the Israeli people
would not stand by and "let the deterioration which has taken
place in the state continue."
</P>
<P>
Peres' Labour Party has already lent its support to a coalition
of Jewish and Arab opposition parties whose sole policy is to
denounce Netanyahu and promote the peace process.

<HEADLINE> More Greek Land Turns Into Desert: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A Greek expert said that nearly
one third of the country's arable land is turning into deserts,
while 150,000 acres of land in great Athens area have already
turned bare, local daily "Ta Nea" (the News) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nikos Yiasoglou, a professor of agriculture and chief organizer
of an impending international desertification conference, said
desertification would have devastating effects on Greece's farm
production, farmers' income and the environment in general.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that government's urbanization plans are
encrouching on green areas, such as Pendeli and Messogia in
northern Athens, instead of using lands already barren.
</P>
<P>
Yiasoglou said the desertified landscape has already lost 50-60
percent of its capacity to grow farm products, warning that in 10
to 20 years the total grain output of the country will plunge by 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
The professor, chairman of the organizing committee of the
conference due to open in the Cretan town of Iraklio on Tuesday,
said more than 630,000 square kilometers of EU land have become
desertified due to human factors.

<HEADLINE> Gun Trade Rampant in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A range of weapons can be
easily purchased illegally in Kenyan cities or towns such as Nairobi,
Isiolo, Namanga and Kiambu, the Kenyan "Sunday Standard"
today reported in an exclusive investigation report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that powerful weapons like AK-47s and machine
guns were available in many towns in the East African country
stretching from Namanga on the Kenya-Tanzania border to Isiolo in
Northeastern Province bordering Somalia and even in the capital.
</P>
<P>
A variety of guns including pistols can be bought at various
prices ranging from 700 Kenyan Shillings (more than 12 U.S.
Dollars) to 200,000 Shillings (nearly 4,000 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Largely on sale are Italian-made Berreta, American pistols
and Russian-made weapons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Nairobi's Kibera slum, pistols and machine guns are
available "for hire" at 12,500 Shillings a day.
</P>
<P>
One dealer told investigators of the paper that "after all, if
you are smart, you will make millions out of it (gun) once you
have it."
</P>
<P>
Many gun dealers prided themselves as ex-soldiers taking part
in armed conflicts in neighboring Ethiopia and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The investigation report pointed out that the gun runners
looked quite unafraid and expressed confidence in surviving a
gun-fight with the Kenyan police.

<P>
Recently, frightening stories on armed robberies haved been
carried on every local newspaper almost every day and it is
becoming increasingly impossible for people living in the country
to feel secure.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police spokesman Abraham Gachanja acknowledged that
"there are plenty of illegal guns in Northeastern Province that
are in very wrong hands."
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Shedrack Kiruki has on many occasions said
that crime in Kenya has become complex due to sophisticated
firearms used by gangsters.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution of Kenya, only a person bearing a
firearms license certificate is allowed to posses a gun which is
purchased from an official firearms dealer.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the paper appealed the government
to pool all resources to stem this illegal arms trade at the
source and deal with the gun-runners ruthlessly.

<P>
NANJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu province
exported 9.5 billion US dollar-worth of products in the first 10
months of this year, up 12.5 percent over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a readjustment of state foreign trade policies,
exports in Jiangsu -- the nation's third largest exporter - showed
a decline earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
But the downward trend was reversed after April, and since then
exports have spiralled.
</P>
<P>
In October alone, exports hit 1.5 billion US dollars, setting a
new record.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 foreign-funded enterprises in the province exported
more than 4.1 billion US dollar-worth of goods in the first nine
months, a rise of 32.1 percent over the corresponding period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The export value of specialized foreign trade companies in
cities or counties totalled 2.6 billion US dollars in the nine
month period, making up 27.6 percent of Jiangsu's total export.

<P>
CHENGDU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Families in a southwestern
China city of Chengdu will soon be moving into the country's
first 'cyberspace' housing community.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Gun Law Reform Still Patchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Six months after the Port
Arthur massacre that shocked Australia and the world, progress
toward strict uniform gun laws was still patchy with some states
lagging behind, the National Coalition for Gun Control (NCGC)
says.
</P>
<P>
More than 110,000 semi-automatic weapons have been handed in
around the country since April when a lone gunman opened fire at
tourists in Port Arthur of Tasmania, killing 35 people and
wounding 18 others, the NCGC said in a report available here
today.
</P>
<P>
Tasmania has made the best effort to control firearms by
quickly passing new laws and introducing an effective gun buy-back
scheme. The Australian Capital Territory (Canberra) also reduced
its private gun stockpile by an estimated 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NCGC, however, noted that in Queensland the buy-back of
prohibited weapons has yet to begin, new gun laws have yet to be
passed and the sale of military-style semi-automatics is still
legal.
</P>
<P>
NCGC Chairman Rebecca Peters said it was the federal
government's job to ensure compliance with the gun control
agreement reached at the Australian Police Ministers Council soon
after the April 28 massacre.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the Commonwealth to make sure the states and
territories keep the promise they made to implement the agreement
in full, the people have put their trust in the federal government
to reduce the saturation of deadly weapons in our community and to
make it much more difficult to acquire guns."
</P>
<P>
The NCGC said the continued availability of large-caliber and
semi-automatic handguns was a continuing problem across all
jurisdictions and Australia should ban such weapons as well.

GUANGZHOU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 street
cleaners put on special uniforms recently in the capital of south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Psychologists and labor experts claim that the move, the first
of its kind in China, will make a change in the workers' image of
a person in slippers, worn clothes, and torn hat working on the
streets. It will also serve to reduce the possibility of accidents.
</P>
<P>
The uniforms are specially designed for workers whose job is to
clean the downtown streets of Guangzhou, and each one is provided
with four uniforms, two pairs of shoes, two hats, and one
reflector belt.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the local government has put aside three
million yuan (about 360,000 US dollars) for the uniforms to create
a new image for the workers and increase their security.
</P>
<P>
Other major cities have started to provide their street
cleaners with yellow or red vests to reduce the possibility of
accidents when they are on the job.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Oil Giant Tries Hard to Maintain Leading Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Daqing Oilfield, which
has 5.26 billion tons of proven oil reserves and has produced 1.35
billion tons of crude oil since it began production in 1959, has
been trying hard to maintain its role as a leading force in
China's economy.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guiming, director of the Daqing Petroleum Administration,
told reporters that, since the beginning of this year, workers and
officials in the oilfield have been making a greater effort to
stabilize production and establish a more modern enterprise
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
It has a record among the world's similar sandstone oilfields
in keeping its annual oil output at 50 million tons for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
However, 35 years of exploitation of oil reserves has made it
more difficult for the oilfield to maintain stable
production. Economic growth has slowed down and the oilfield's
role as China's top enterprise has also been challenged.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield will maintain its annual petroleum of 50 million
tons up to the year 2010, using greater applications of science
and technology, and will sink 47,000 new wells to bring an
increase of 46 million tons in total production capacity, the
director noted.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield will also strive to develop a more diverse economy
and will be active in natural gas exploration in other parts of
China and in foreign countries, the director said.
</P>
<P>
The administration has set a goal of 185.8 billion yuan in
total output value by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Egypt Becomes "Economic Tiger" in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A Egyptian cabinet minister said
that Egypt has become one of the most important "economic tigers"
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
A deal between Egypt and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the Paris Club debt waiver both attributed to international
recognition of the success of Egypt's economic reforms, said
Egyptian State Minister of Cabinet Economic Affairs Youssef
Boutros Ghali Friday in statements, which were carried by the
English language Egyptian Gazette today.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club decided to scrap 4.2 billion U.S. dollars of
Egypt's debts only days after Egypt and the IMF signed the deal
under which the IMF approved Egypt's second-phase economic reform
plan, currently in effect.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's debts now amount to 31 billion dollars, he said, adding
that Egypt now refrains from borrowing money.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt does not intend to draw from the 391 million dollar loan
offered by the World Bank. Many ministries and authorities
canceled former debts after getting financial independence," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ghali added that the government will try to reduce the
inflation rate, currently hovering at 7-8 percent, to 6 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to cut the budget deficit by 1 percent every
year, to achieve a 5 percent economic growth and create 400,000
new jobs, Ghali said, adding that the foreign currency reserves
soared to 18 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a report by the German Center for
Foreign Trade Information affiliated to the German Ministry of
Economy hailed the success of Egypt's ambitious economic reforms
and development plans, especially in attracting investments.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the number of industrial projects in Egypt
has jumped by 71 percent to 1,938 with a total capital of 2.6 billion
dollars in the period from May 1995 to March 1996.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Must Create New Jobs to Alleviate Pressure: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Labor
Abdul Hafez Shakhanbeh said that 50,000 new jobs must be created
each year to maintain the unemployment rate at its current
level, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the importance of small projects in
creating jobs, according to the English-language daily
Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of non-Jordanian workers who hold
permits to work in agriculture was about 34,000 but the actual
number of workers in this category exceeds 100,000.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Ministry of Labor planned to
reduce the number of foreign laborers in the kingdom from the
current 400,000 to 100,000 in order to alleviate the
unemployment pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
Alien workers are mainly employed in the long-work-time and
low-pay professionals as agriculture and construction, upon which
most Jordanians look down, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged all Jordanian workers to accept whatever
work available in the market.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the unemployment rate in the
country is 15 percent while unofficial estimates claim that it
is up to 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Arafat May Meet Today to Finalize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu may meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
today to finalize a deal on Hebron redeployment, Palestinian
sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators continued the talks on
Hebron redeployment Saturday night in order to reach an
agreement to wrap up three weeks of non-stop negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were Israeli Army Chief of Staff Amonon
Lipkin Shahak, Army planning chief Shaul Mofaz, top Palestinian
negotiator Mahmoud Abbas, and Palestinian security officials
Mahmoud Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub. U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross
and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk also participated in
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub, head of Palestinian security forces in Jericho, said
that Netanyahu and Arafat could meet as early as today to
finalize the Hebron agreement, the English-language daily The
Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no official confirmation of the
Netanyahu-Arafat meeting by both sides. Netanyahu received a
full report on the latest talks Saturday night and he urged
Arafat to continue the path of peace instead of
confrontation. Netanyahu asked Ross to convey his message to
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post said that, if the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting
could not be held today, then the talks between Israel and
Palestine would likely drag on at least another week due to
Arafat's travel schedule. Arafat is to visit Europe for one week,
beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of Arafat, the talks are expected to be
recessed, Palestinian sources said.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub said Saturday that differences remained on four issues
concerning security arrangements, but if Israel "comes back with
practical responses, then it could be wrapped up tonight."
</P>
<P>
Ross and top aides held a meeting with Netanyahu earlier
Saturday and with Arafat on Friday night in efforts to advance
the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see a final agreement as soon as possible. I think
we really exhaustively went into the issues and we're really
trying to work together to overcome differences," Ross said in
Gaza. The U.S. envoy created an uproar earlier this week by
threatening to return home out of disappointment with the lack of
progress in the marathon talks.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Ross telephoned Jordan's King Hussein to
brief him on the talks. He said that Israel and the Palestinians
had narrowed their differences over redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Ross said the two sides were trying to overcome the obstacles
to reach an accord over Hebron redeployment to allow them to
move ahead to implement other accords related to the interim
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority (PA) blamed Saturday
Israel for stalling progress on an agreement for the troop
redeployment from Hebron. The PA later issued a statement saying
it would insist on the implementation of the agreements already
signed.
</P>
<P>
"We refuse to change it in any way. We refuse to change even a
comma," the statement said, adding Israel was responsible for the
lack of progress in the talks because it attempted to renegotiate
the agreements.

<HEADLINE> GCC States Agree on Efforts to Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The information ministers
of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have agreed to
make joint efforts to fight against the western media
penetration which they described as promoting "poisoned ideas"
and "broadcasting inaccurate reports about the Gulf states."
</P>
<P>
The ministers, at the eighth GCC information meeting held
in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh Saturday, called for
boosting cooperation among the GCC media organizations and
upgrading their technical capacities to compete effectively with
modernized foreign agencies, according to local media reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad bin Abdel-Salam bin Mohammed
Faresi, expressed dismay at some western news agencies for
broadcasting inaccurate reports about the GCC states, saying "the
hostile media is (are) trying to harm the others by distorting
facts."
</P>
<P>
He said the agencies have been using high technology "to
influence the public opinion and promote poisoned ideas. He added
that the GCC countries believe that they live in a
media-controlled world, pointing out that the GCC ministers have
perceived "this issue with open hearts and minds."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jamil Al-Hujeilan, the GCC Secretary General, echoed
Faresi's points of view, saying that the ministers disussed the
latest developments on the GCC media arena.
</P>
<P>
The GCC officials also discussed means of coordinating joint
Gulf information activities abroad to "reflect an honest picture
of Gulf achievements and problems."

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Lower Telephone Call Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will lower charges both
for local and international telephone calls from January 1,
1997, English daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Walid Dweik, director-general of the Telecommunications
Corporation (TCC), said the new charges would regard national
calls within the governorate as local calls and would reduce
national calls in all government rates to a unified charge of
41 fils (about 5.74 U.S. cents) per minute.
</P>
<P>
He said that night tariffs will be applied to national
calls on Fridays and national holidays.
</P>
<P>
International calls will be charged 20 percent less in
average, and the board of directors will specify the charges
with each country according to bilateral agreements, Dweik added.
</P>
<P>
The reduced night charges, which are 30 percent less than
day charges, will also apply on Fridays and national
holidays for all international calls, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the committee preparing the executive
measures to implement the new telephone charges were still
working to undertake all the necessary program changes before
actually effecting the new charges.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Becomes Presidential Nominee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's hardline Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri has become presidential nominee of
the most powerful political group in the political arena of
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC) made the decision
recently on nominating the 53-year-old speaker as the
presidential nominee for the seventh presidential elections
scheduled for early August 1997, the Persian daily Akhbar
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an unidentified source as saying that the
nomination of Nateq-Nouri is SCC's final and unequivocal
decision. He is one of the founding members of SCC and he is
bound by its decision which he has accepted.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that the SCC has not issued any
official statement on Nateq-Nouri's nomination so far.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri is among the eminent personalities of the Islamic
system and has held important posts after the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
He is regarded as the most active candidate and has a better
chance of success than anyone else. He launched his unofficial
campaign two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The SCC, the most influential political group in Iran,
defeated the moderate camp backed by President Hashemi Rafsanjani
during the parliament elections in March. It now occupied the
majority of seats in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The SCC has close ties with the merchants in Iran's
traditional market known as the Bazaar. It has several satellite
groups that strengthen its hold on all the traditional sectors of
the society.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the SCC can easily mobilize the poor
as well as the middle class.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Approves Sale of 3,000 Settlement Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has approved the sale of 3,000 housing
units in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, effectively lifting
the settlement freeze imposed by the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported this morning that among the housing
units on offer are 700 apartments in Ariel in the Gaza Strip,
while others are located in Karni Shmoron and Kiryat Arba in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's move was welcomed by Aharon Domb, newly elected
director-general of the Council of Jewish Community in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Domb said it was time to expand the Jewish settlements
and revoke the previous Labor government's ban on new
constructions for settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Domb, who once served as one of the leaders of the
settlement in the West Bank town of Hebron, was the
architect of the settlement council's active campaign on behalf
of Netanyahu during the May 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's decision came after a series of meetings with
settlement officials last week to hammer out details that would
facilitate the selling of the government-owned housing units.
</P>
<P>
The meetings took place a week after Netanyahu promised
settlement leaders that he personally would ensure that a
freeze on selling these units would be reversed.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the Knesset (Israel's parliament) Finance
Committee approved a 57-million-shekel (some 18.5 million US
dollars) allocation to the Housing Ministry for completing the
infrastructure for the houses.
</P>
<P>
The construction of these units was initiated by a former
Likud government led by Yitzhak Shamir, but after the Labor
government began its settlement freeze, these units stood empty,
as the government refused to market them.
</P>
<P>
One settlement council official pointed out that it was
clear that Netanyahu's involvement in the issue was meant to
counterbalance any Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, leaders of the Gush Katif
settlement in the Gaza Strip took up arms after hearing of a
suggestion made by Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
to move the settlements of Netzarim and Kfar Darom as part
of a final deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Although this was advocated by various ministers in the
previous Labor government, Kahalani is the first member of the
Netanyahu government to voice the idea.
</P>
<P>
"We are dumbstruck by Kahalani's words," a statement issued by
the Gush Katif Regional Council issued reads. It also said the
two active settlements are meant to preserve an important Israeli
foothold in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the two settlements are an
integral part of the Gush Katif settlement, and evacuating
them would represent "surrender to the Palestinian violence."

ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Entry points to Pakistan's
capital were blocked today to stop the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI)
protesters from carrying out a planned sit-in outside the
Parliament House.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, intensive security measures were
enforced to prevent any untoward incident amidst threats by JI's
armed workers to siege the capital.
</P>
<P>
Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) have been put on alert
for any emergency-like situation, police said.
</P>
<P>
Main entry points to Islamabad and its twin city of Rawalpindi
were barricaded through barbed wires, sand bags and trailers which
were parked on various roads to stave off any forced entry.
</P>
<P>
According to the police sources, some JI activists were taken
into custody. Local reports said several thousand JI activists
had been arrested in the past few days.
</P>

<P>
NANJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Pocket-size girl Zhao
Lujun, 17, is walking taller, for the first time in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
The girl's height has increased by two centimeters and her
weight has by 400 grams, after three months of special treatment.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Lujun was born in March, 1980, in Tongzhaipu Village of
Tanghe County, in central China's Henan Province. She was 57 cm
long and weighed 3.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
She stopped growing when she reached two years of age, when she
was 65 cm high and weighed 4.4 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
By chance, a doctor from a hospital in Nanjing, capital of
Jiangsu province, learned that Zhao's bone age was only two years
old, and there was possibility of her growing taller.
</P>
<P>
The doctor started to treat Zhao in July, using traditional
Chinese medicines, with help of Western medicines, trace elements
and physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
During the past three months, Zhao's height increased from 65
cm to 67 cm, and her weight from 4.4 kilograms to 4.8 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Doctors are confident that they can help Zhao grow even taller,
stronger and more capable of taking care of herself.

<HEADLINE> South Chinese City's Goal Of Becoming Modern Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The capital of Guangdong
Province plans to build itself into a large modern port capable of
handling ships above 50,000 dead weight tonnages by the early
years of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is the biggest foreign trade outlet in south China,
with Whampoa and the old Guangzhou ports and is divided into four
zones. It has 173 km of waterways and 797 berths and mooring
points.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Guosheng, director of the Guangzhou Port
Administration, the city has organized a group of experts who have
helped Guangzhou draft a modernization plan, according to which
Guangzhou will improve industrial layout of the port by starting
different kinds of businesses adapted to the respective zones.
</P>
<P>
The city will also invest heavily in dredging the waterway to
the sea and plans to use 750 million yuan to make the present 9-m
depth, 11.5 m, to allow the port to handle 35,000 dwt ships. By
the year 2005, the waterway will be dredged to a depth of 12.5 m,
capable of handling 50,000 dwt ships.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary dredge work, with an investment of 140 million
yuan, started in June and will be finished in December of next
year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the port handled 73 million tons of cargo, ranking
third in the country and accounting for 61.3 percent of the
combined handling volume of the province's coastal port cities.
</P>
<P>
The city will build more berths at the port, so that by 2005,
the port will be able to handle 100 million tons of cargo
annually.
</P>
<P>
Ships and vessels from Guangzhou now go to more than 300 ports
in 80 countries and regions, and in 1995, it handled 3.07 million
passengers.

<HEADLINE> China's Two Airlines Preparing for Overseas Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China Southern Airlines and
Chine Eastern Airlines, two of the country's largest and most
profitable carriers, are accelerating preparations for overseas
listing, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines aim to raise funds through overseas listing to
expand their business.
</P>
<P>
An executive with the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) said CAAC is taking an "active but prudent" attitude
towards the move.
</P>
<P>
China Southern is now undertaking an internal restructuring to
establish a market-based corporate mechanism in line with listing
requirements, said an official at China Southern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
"In view of such factors as fluctuations on the stock exchange,
we are considering to select the optimal chance to step in," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, the two airlines have achieved remarkable
progress in terms of expansion of fleets and air routes, and
modernization of infrastructure and air traffic control facilities.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has had 11.5 billion US dollars of overseas
investment in civil aviation, most of which are foreign government
loans and credit from foreign banks. The funds is confined to use
in construction and operation of civil airports, as well as in
purchase and lease of aircrafts.
</P>
<P>
CAAC's fleet of airlines totals 416, including 60 airplanes
leased from abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Railway transportation in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has seen a speedy
development this year.
</P>
<P>
Officials say it is due to the application of new technology

volumes increasing more than five times, and income from the
service has risen 14 times.
</P>
<P>
The region has had 1,620 kilometers of railway lines for 30
years, but the railway bureau surpassed freight targets to
transport nearly 30 million tons of cargo during the first-eight
months this year, hitting a record income which exceeded one
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During recent years, the bureau has invested more than 100
million yuan developing electrified railways, and moderning
control systems at all railway stations.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has introduced diesel locomotives on nearly all
trains, increasing traction force by an average of 61.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also applied new joint free railway line technology
to improve the quality of local railway lines, laying more than
1,000 kilometers of joint-free lines.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee traffic safety, up-to-date technology and
equipment have also been installed in trains.

<HEADLINE> Government Support Makes State-Owned Enterprises Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises in Datong, an industrial center in north
China's Shanxi Province, are operating with growing vitality,
thanks to enthusiastic support from local government, "People's
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Datong has 43 key state-owned enterprises which generated 70.69
percent of the city's total industrial added-value in the first
eight months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Their assets made up 77 percent of the city's total industrial
firms and their combined profits made up 92.6 percent of the total
manufacturers in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the rapid development of the state
enterprises in Datong to a government policy of supporting strong
and well-operated enterprises and deepening enterprise reforms in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, leading municipal government officials made a
door-to-door visist to these enterprises, helped them to raise
funds for technological transformation and provided them adequate
electricity, water and gas.
</P>
<P>
The government also assisted debt-ridden enterprises to break
up chains of debts among enterprises, promote sales and raise
efficiency in an all-round way.

<HEADLINE> Perry: No Decision on NATO's Future Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense
Secretary William Perry said today that neither the Clinton
administration nor NATO has decided what is next for U.S. and
other NATO troops deployed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Perry said he has not yet received analyses from NATO military
advisors studying what should be done as the one-year deadline
approaches to withdraw the 60,000 NATO troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The force was there to enforce the Dayton peace accord, which
ended a four-year ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
"I have not yet made a recommendation to the president," Perry
said in a statement released by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"The president has not yet made a decision on which of those
options to select. In fact, neither NATO nor the U.S. has made a
decision yet."
</P>
<P>
Perry told a Senate committee this month that NATO military
advisors are studying four options, that is, the complete
withdrawal of the peace force; the establishment of a "deterrence
force" to prevent outbreaks of fighting; the creation of a
"sustaining force" to provide security; and the keeping of the
current mission in Bosnia despite the one-year deadline President
Clinton set when the force was deployed.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO military authorities are still analyzing the
options.
</P>
<P>
Perry denied a New York Times report that U.S. officials have
decided to keep at least 5,000 American troops in Bosnia through
1997 but are reluctant to make a formal decision until after the
U.S. presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited Clinton administration officials, NATO
leaders and European diplomats as saying that U.S. troops would be
part of a force of 15,000 to 30,000 troops remaining in Bosnia to
enforce the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
It also reported that presidential aides said Clinton would not
give formal approval for the continued participation of troops
until after the November 5 election.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Audit on Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China has started a careful tax
audit on representative offices opened by foreign companies in the
country, today's "China Daily" quoted the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move started earlier this month and will be concluded by
the end of June 1997, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
China has now more than 7,000 registered representative offices
of foreign firms, a big leap from 1,000 in 1985, but the annual
tax revenue from the offices can hardly reflect the growth, said
Su Xiaolu, head of the foreign tax inspection division of SAT's
foreign investment taxation department.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of tax levied on the offices is very low, added
Su.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the registered offices, only one-third have
declared their income, although much more foreign offices have
operational income by conducting intermediary services.
</P>
<P>
Tax authorities will first select some key offices for the
audit, and serious tax evaders will be listed publicly. Methods of
tax collection will also be improved, said Su.
</P>
<P>
Taxation departments will also co-ordinate with other
departments to standardize management of the offices, in the
process of closing some unlicensed offices, added Su.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies began to open representative offices in China
in earnest in the early 1980s, which can also conduct
supplementary services for their companies, such as seeking
customers in China.
</P>
<P>
But an investigation in the mid-1980s revealed that these
offices have not only assisted their own companies, but also
provided some intermediary services for other companies for
commission, prompting China to collect consolidated industrial and
commercial tax and enterprise income tax on them in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The offices began to pay business tax and enterprise income tax
instead of the previous two consolidated taxes after the country's
reform in the tax system in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Both Grain Imports and Harvest Go Up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Grain imports in China during
the first eight months this year saw a 71 percent rise from the
same period in 1995 to reach 8.43 million tons, though the country
is expecting a bumper grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
The government is expecting an import increase, coupled with a
grain harvest anticipated to surpass 480 million tons this year,
in order to keep inflation at bay, today's "China Daily" quoted
the State Statistics Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's participation in the international grain trade is
strictly monopolized by the government, explaining that the
massive purchase of foreign cereals this year corresponded exactly
with official plans, according to analysts from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Despite a bumper summer grain harvest to rise three percent to
top 110 million tons this year, the country stepped up cereals
imports by three percent as early as during the first half this
year to hit 6.7 million tons, while exports of such commodities
decreased 11 percent to reach 586,000 tons during the same period.
</P>
<P>
However, some areas in the countryside still suffer from a
grain shortage and others anticipate difficulties arising from
too-low prices both on the free market and in sales to the State.
</P>
<P>
This year the government raised its purchasing price for rice,
wheat, maize and soy beans by an average 40 percent to stir
farmers' production enthusiasm.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Toyota Motor Corp. may raise its
per-share dividend from 19 yen (17 U.S. cents) to 20 or 21 yen for
fiscal 1996 ending next March due to buoyant business performance,
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Toyota has had a policy of paying dividends according to its
business results in response to last year's proposals by the
Federation of Economic Organizations to revitalize the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
The possible increase of the annual dividend for the first time
in eight years will maintain the targeted pay-out ratio of the
largest automaker of Japan at some 30 percent, the business daily
said.
</P>
<P>
The pay-out ratio shows the extent that a company's net profit
is paid as a dividend to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The net profit of Toyota is expected to jump by 48 percent to
270 billion yen (2.4 billion dollars) for fiscal 1996 compared
with the previous year.

<P>
TOKYO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese telegraph and
telephone company, KDD, is planning to make Japan the information
linkage for Internet users in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The KDD plans to build a large-capacity telecommunications
network to handle data transmission among computer users in Asia,
Europe and the United States, industry sources disclosed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company is seeking cooperation with on-line
service companies in Asian countries which prefer not to spend
heavily on building their own lines linking with the U.S.-based
information provider.
</P>
<P>
So far on-line service companies in Singapore, Hong Kong, South
Korea, India and Taiwan are expected to join the KDD network by
the end of fiscal 1996 which ends March 31, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Information providers in Indonesia, Malaysia and China showed
interest in joining the network next year.
</P>
<P>
The KDD will expand the capacity of its transmission line to
link its customers with on-line service companies and other
information providers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The KDD is operating a line with a transmission capacity of 45
megabits per second. It plans to increase such lines to three by
the summer of next year.

<HEADLINE> Banknote Withdrawals Increase in North Thai Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Withdrawals of 100-baht (4 US
dollar) banknotes from commercial banks have increased
considerably in the northernmost Thai province of Chiang Rai,
according to a local news report today.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawals of 100-baht banknotes in Chiang Rai increased
seven-fold during the past month since the House of
Representatives was dissolved late last month.
</P>
<P>
The unusually high increase in the withdrawal of the 100-baht
denominations indicates that vote-buying could be rampant in the
lead-up to the general election on November 17.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Rai is one of the provinces where contest between
candidates of different parties is fierce.
</P>
<P>
Eight political parties have fielded a total of 44 candidates
for election campaigning in the province.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Rai Governor Wijarn Chaiyanant expressed concern about
vote-buying, saying that provincial officials cannot take action
unless someone is caught buying votes.
</P>
<P>
Bank managers, who have noticed the unusual increase, said they
could do nothing to stop it as they have no rights to question
bank customers.
</P>
<P>
In Khon Kaen, northeast Thailand, business tycoon Charoen
Pattanadamrong, also said, "enormous amounts (of money) are
already being changed into 100-baht notes."
</P>
<P>
He said that although he was opposed to vote-buying it was
difficult to prevent.
</P>
<P>
Financial support to election candidates is given through the
financier's own bank account or his network of businesses, which
would be difficult to trace, according to a source close to the
tycoon.

<HEADLINE> Canada Wants Auto Airbags Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has told
automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as
early as the next fall.
</P>
<P>
The government wants automakers to change airbag design
voluntarily for 1998 models, make airbags to deploy with less
force, and not to deploy at speeds as low as they do now.
</P>
<P>
"We must work together urgently to minimize the associated
risks," Canadian Transport Minister David Anderson said in a
letter to automakers.
</P>
<P>
"If the cooperation isn't there, we would have to regulate,"
Anderson warned.
</P>
<P>
Auto airbags were introduced in the late 1980s to reduce
accident injuries to drivers and passengers. They have since saved
an estimated 100 lives in Canada.
</P>
<P>
However, airbags have also been implicated in the deaths of
three Canadians, according to today's Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Now, airbags only meet specifications set by the United States,
where they are tested on dummies that do not wear belts, because
only 60 percent of Americans regularly wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, 92 percent drivers and passengers wear belts. But
the airbags are deployed with the same force as in the United
States, which can kill or hurt people who are not sitting properly.
</P>
<P>
In one case, a Canadian passenger was leaning over to adjust
the radio when an airbag blasted him back into his seat and killed
him, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Police, Kerb Marketmen Clash in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 21 persons were
arrested following an hour-long clash between Kerb market
operators of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and the police on
Saturday afternoon, according to police sources.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people were injured and many of the traders lost
their money and share certificates in the melee, said the police
sources, adding that the incident may ultimately lead to the
closure of the Kerb market.
</P>
<P>
The clash started when the police tried to rescue a suspected
snatcher who was caught by the angry people at the Kerb market.
Thousands of traders everyday come to the bullish market for
trading.
</P>
<P>
At one stage, the agitated people, most of them young
investors, started throwing bricks at police. In retaliation, the
police used tear gas shells and made baton charges to face the
people.
</P>
<P>
Within moments, the entire area centering the DSE turned into a
battlefield halting all sorts of traffic movements.
</P>
<P>
Many traders alleged that some plain clothes policemen also
took part in snatching the cash and share certificates in the
melee. The police, however, denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the incident, a section of Kerb market operators
staged demonstration against the police action and demanded an

<HEADLINE> Germany Ends Daylight Saving Time One Month Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany ended its daylight saving
time for 1996 today, a month later than before, to keep in step
with other member states of the European Union (EU) and its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry let the residents to set back their
clocks by one hour at 03:00 a.m. today. It was the first time for
the country to end its daylight saving time at the end of October
rather than at the end of September as it used to do.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the European countries have made great
efforts to coordinate their daylight saving time systems in a bid
to start and end it on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The different time systems practiced by different countries has
caused much inconvenience and confusion to the international
transportation and the daily life of the residents.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have proposed that the daylight saving time system
be stopped because the initial aim for it -- to save electricity
by taking full use of the sun light -- is hard to be proved true.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany will continue to adopt this time system next
year because the government decided in 1994 to practice the
"central European daylight saving time" in 1995, 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The residents shall remember to set their clocks forth for one
hour on March 27, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Wants to Change Political Equation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition party
is still determined to change the political equation in the
country even one year after the three-party ruling coalition was
formed, according to a top party leader.
</P>
<P>
Madhav Kumar Nepal, General Secretary of the Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), said on Saturday that
his party is determined to do so and the present coalition
government could collapse at any time.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at a tea party reception hosted by CPN-UML
 President Man Mohan Adhikari, Nepal said the government is
relying on an unholy accord, referring to the three-party alliance
led by the Nepali Congress (NC) Party in September last year to
oust the minority CPN-UML government.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition CPN-UML in March this year launched a
challenge against the government by tabling a no-confidence motion
in the parliament but failed as the second coalition partner
National Democratic Party (RPP) decided to be remained in the
coalition. The CPN-UML earlier had hoped the RPP to withdraw from
the ruling coalition by offering to form a new coalition.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML leader on Saturday also attacked the reappointment
of Ram Sharan Mahat as finance minister by the government earlier
this month, saying the move was against the parliament norms.
</P>
<P>
Mahat resigned as finance minister three months ago on moral
grounds after the revelation of his secret personal foreign bank
account in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CPN-UML general secretary said his party will
launch a nation-wide campaign soon to prepare the upcoming
by-elections for four vacant parliamentary seats and local
elections.
</P>
<P>
An alliance would be possible among leftist parties during the
local elections, he added without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
According to him, corruption, inflation, law and order, and the
misappropriation of government resources will be the party's main
agenda in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Present at Saturday's reception, held on the occasion of the
last day of the Grand Dashain Festival, were Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba, cabinet members, opposition leaders and senior
government officials.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Attaches Much Importance to Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said today that the revival of agriculture was the revival of the
whole Ukraine and made agriculture the president's basic work.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said it was imperative to strengthen the integration of
agriculture with processing industry and establish various forms
of agricultural organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that a new taxation system should be established for
the agricultural producers following the reform of land ownership.
</P>
<P>
He stood for the changing of various levying systems into only
one land tax and ordered the government to set up a system of
purchasing agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma proposed that policies and measures concerning
agricultural production be made in the governmental program of
action.
</P>
<P>
He said purchasing prices should be guaranteed to be equal,
priority investment be given to agriculture-industry complexes,
and material and technological basis of collective economy be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also put forward methods of encouraging agricultural
production. He said government subsidies should only be given to
those who had plans for production, the sense of being the master
of their land and who worked hard.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Ukrainian grain output will be only 26
million tons. Big drop in agricultural production has brought
great impact to the national economy and export of agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
But Kuchma claimed that its grain was enough to meet the
domestic demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas
Klastil today urged the nation to speed up reforms in his speech
to mark the Austrian national day.
</P>
<P>
Klastil pointed out that Austria "has been lacking in the
strength and courage to abandon the old, create the new and bear
risks."
</P>
<P>
He said that time was pressing, the Austrians should work hard
and make prompt decisions to overcome various obstacles in the
process of reforms.
</P>
<P>
His speech was published in written form on the advice of his
doctor. Klastil has been hospitalized for pneumonia since early
September.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, also made a statement
at the special meeting of the Council of Ministers today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Austrians should not be satisfied with their
living standard as it is, and that they should effectively meet
the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky also stressed that Austria would adhere to its
commitment to maintaining neutrality, but he said that this would
not prevent Austria from participating in the EU in the drawing up
of a new all-Europe security system.
</P>
<P>
After World War Two, Austria was occupied by the U.S., the
former Soviet Union, Britain and France. All the occupation armies
withdrew on October 25, 1955.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian National Council passed the Constitution of
Austria the next day which declares its permanent neutrality, thus
October 26 becomes Austrian National Day.

<HEADLINE> Sustainable Development a Must for China: Qiao Shi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China's adoption of a
sustainable development strategy is not only a means of fulfilling
its commitment to the international community, but more important,
is a must for China's economic and social development, a senior
Chinese leader said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, made this remark at a meeting with
participants in the high-level international roundtable conference
on China's 21st Century Agenda.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting at the Great Hall of the People, Qiao said
China has made historical achievements in economic development
since it began to implement the reform and opening up policies 18
years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China should take the road of sustainable
development, because it has a big population, limited resources
and low-level economy and technology.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said China has mapped out its 21st Century Agenda in
accordance with the actual situations, and is serious in promoting
its implementation and eventual realization.
</P>
<P>
He told the audience that the NPC has passed a large number of
laws and regulations concerning sustainable development and made
amendments to some legal codes in environmental protection and
resources management accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The legislation on sustainable development provides an
important guarantee for its implementation and enables China to
actually attain the objectives of the ninth "Five-Year Plan" and
the long-term objectives up to the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Nay Htun, associate administrator of UN Development Program,
said the roundtable meeting in Beijing indicates China's
determination, commitment and the work it is doing in the course
of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The international community is willing to exchange experiences
and information with China to help promote its sustainable
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and other
high-ranking Chinese officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will establish a Nuclear
Energy Ministry to better coordinate the country's nuclear energy
industry.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made today at a meeting of the State Committee
on Security and Defense.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Gorbulin, secretary of the committee, told the press
that the new ministry will be more powerful than its predecessor,
the State Committee on Utilization of Nuclear Energy.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry will be responsible for all matters
related to nuclear energy, especially the safety of nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine witnessed the world's most serious nuclear disaster in
1986 when the No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl nuclear power plant
exploded on April 26, killing 31 people and forced the evacuation
of 1,350,000 others, with losses totaling 12 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The accident, which happened when Ukraine was still a republic
of the former Soviet Union, also sent radioactive materials across
most of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin said a new corporation will be set up to manage the
operation of the country's nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has to import up to 90 percent of its natural gas and
oil from abroad. Some 40 percent of the electricity were supplied
by nuclear power plants.

HUHHOT, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A China-made machine for
extracting oil from sea buckthorn has successfully completed its
test operation in Huhhot, capital of north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, which is abundant in sea buckthorn.
</P>
<P>
The so-called C02 extraction technology is the most advanced

are able to manufacture the equipment.
</P>
<P>
The C02 sea buckthorn oil-extracting unit, a key project
co-researched by a technology industry company in the region, and
Guangzhou Light Industry Research Institute in south China's
Guangdong Province, has been examined and accepted by the state,
indicating the country has caught up with international
technological levels.
</P>
<P>
The successful trial operation is expected to give impetus to
development of China's sea buckthorn processing industry.
</P>
<P>
The equipment is expected to generate nearly 14 million yuan a
year in output value and more than nine million yuan in pre-tax
profits, by extracting 20 tons of oil from 2.5 million to three
million tons of sea buckthorn a year.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 26 (Xinhua) -- French woman cyclist
Jeannie Longo set the one-hour world record at the Olympic Sports
Center here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Longo covered a distance of 48.159 kilometers, bettering the
previous mark by 748 meters, set by Yvonne McGregor of Britain on
June 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The feat was achieved in her second attempt at the 333-meter
track, after she aborted her first attempt on Wednesday because of
strong head winds.
</P>
<P>
Longo, 38, bagged home two gold medals at the Atlanta Olympic
Games this summer.
</P>
<P>
After she finished her last three laps, husband trainer Patrice
Cipreli cheered with the jumps and Longo was taken to the medical
center for routine drug testing.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that Longo bettered the record of the
event in Mexico City where she had trained for the past 11 days to
get acclimatized to its altitude of 2,350 meters.
</P>
<P>
She first broke the record on October 1, 1989, covering a
distance of 46.352 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> WFP Evacuates Aid Workers From Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
evacuated 128 international aid workers Saturday from the eastern
Zairian town of Bukavu because of armed clashes raging there.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to evacuate is an extremely difficult one for WFP
because it means pulling out as humanitarian needs are mounting"
said Trevor Rowe, spokesman of the Rome-headquartered organization.
</P>
<P>
"However, the security conditions are such that it is
completely unrealistic for us to remain and it will be impossible
for us to carry out our task of feeding the refugees," said Rowe.
</P>
<P>
"Remaining in Bukavu would mean exposing out staff needlessly
to danger."
</P>
<P>
The aid workers will be flown to Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian relief operations have virtually been halted in
the Bukavu area because of mounting insecurity and attacks on
relief workers.
</P>
<P>
Three WFP vehicles were stolen by armed men Friday night. On
Thursday a WFP staff member was attacked and beaten by armed men.

<HEADLINE> Euro-Bomb Envisaged by France, Germany, Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- France, Germany and Italy planned
to make a Euro-bomb nuclear missile system in the late 1950s, but
the plan was abruptly banished by France after General Charles de
Gaulle returned to power in 1958, said a report by the daily Le
Monde today.
</P>
<P>
The report, written by historian Daniel Vernet, described the
plan as "the most secret episode of the Fourth Republic," and
said that at the end of 1950s, France made a decisive step toward
the building of nuclear arms, by co-financing with Germany and
Italy an isotopic separation factory in Pierrelatte, south-central
France.
</P>
<P>
The French decision was made during the Suez Canal Crisis in
1956, when France and Britain sent troops to help Israel fight
Arab forces in Egypt. It was further pushed by the suppression of
the Hungarian riot by Soviet troops in the same year which led to
the split of Europe into two blocs, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The French government of Guy Mollet at that time was greatly
humiliated by the threat of intervention into its action in the
Middle East by both the Soviet Union and the United States, the
two nuclear powers at that time, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Mollet discussed with Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of Germany the
possibility of making the bomb, during the latter's official visit
in Paris in November 1956.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British government under Anthony Eden yielded to
U.S. pressure and abandoned its military operation in the Suez.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Bourges-Maunoury, the French defense minister at that
time, invited his German counterpart Franz-Josef Strauss to visit
the French nuclear installations in the Sahara desert in January
1957, and the two signed the agreement of Colomb-Bechar to launch
close cooperations in the military fields.
</P>
<P>
The text of the agreement remained a strict secret until 1993,
when historian Georges-Henri Soutou revealed that the two
countries decided then to develop "new weapons" -- the rockets
for carrying nuclear heads.
</P>
<P>
In November 1957, France, Germany and Italy signed a tripartite
protocol in Paris on cooperations in building combat aircrafts and
missiles, and in "military applications of nuclear energy."
</P>
<P>
The three countries said in a note to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization that they intended to "develop a ground-to-ground
ballistic missile system capable of carrying a thermo-nuclear head
in a range of about 2,800 kilometers."
</P>
<P>
In January 1958, the three countries also agreed to share the
estimated 140 million U.S. dollar cost for developing the nuclear
arm, with both France and Germany bearing 45 percent of its cost,
and Italy providing 10 percent. In April 1958, they signed a
protocol on carrying out the project in the Pierrelatt factory.
</P>
<P>
But the return to power of General Charles de Gaulle in May
1958 turned the plan into a bubble.
</P>
<P>
On February 13, 1960, France blew up its first nuclear bomb in
Reggane, Algeria.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Security Guard Cleared in Olympic Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. security guard Richard
Jewell was cleared of suspected involvement in the bombing at the
Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta during the Olympic Games in
July.
</P>
<P>
Jewell received a letter from federal prosecutors Saturday
saying he is no longer a suspect in the bombing, the Associated
Press quoted Jewell's lawyer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The lawer, Jack Martin, said he received the hand-delivered
letter from U.S. Attorney Kent Alexander and showed it to Jewell.
</P>
<P>
"It says what we have known all along that he is no longer a
suspect in the bombing," said Martin.
</P>
<P>
"This is to advise you that based on evidence developed to
date, your client Richard Jewell is not considered a target of the
federal criminal investigation into the bombing...," said the
letter, which was signed by Alexander.
</P>
<P>
Jewell was working as a private security guard in Centennial
Olympic Park when the pipe bomb exploded on July 27, killing one
person and injuring more than 100.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish television cameraman died from a heart attack rushing
to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Jewell initially was hailed as a hero for spotting the bomb
before he became a suspect.

<HEADLINE> UK GDP Grows 0.8 Percent in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- British Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) rose by 0.8 percent in the third quarter of this year,
showing that economic growth in the UK has accelerated to its
fastest rate since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced Friday that
the figures compared with a 0.5 percent growth in the previous
quarter, giving an annual growth rate of 2.3 percent, up from 2.2
percent in the second quarter and nearing the Treasury's forecast
of 2.5 percent for 1996 as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Services grew at a similar pace to the second quarter, with
finance and business services being the star performers, the ONS
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke hailed the
figures as evidence that there was new "zip" in the economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are well on course to grow faster than France and Germany
for a fourth successive year," Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
But Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, is
expected to step up his call for higher interest rates when he and
Clarke hold their regular monetary meeting next week by pointing
to the threat that strong growth poses to the government's
inflation target.

<HEADLINE> Three Albanians Arrested in Serbia's Kosovo Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The police of Serbia's
southern Kosovo province has uncovered a five-member group of
Albanians, members of the pro-Iranian Shi'ite organization
Selefia.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted Milijana Doncic, public prosecutor in
Kosovo's western town of Pec, as saying that three members of the
group have been arrested and two are still at large.
</P>
<P>
This group was suspected of desecrating numerous Muslim
gravestones and monuments near mosques in the region of Pec since
1995, Doncic said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects had been "aware that members of other nations
would be suspected of committing these crimes, thus causing
religious intolerance and hatred between peoples of different
religions," she added.
</P>
<P>
"This in fact occurred because the Albanian media and foreign
press had blamed the Serbs for pulling down the Muslim
gravestones," Doncic said.
</P>
<P>
The arrested suspects had confessed that they had pulled down
Muslim gravestones as members of the pro-Iranian Selefia
organization under the direct influence of Imam Safet Hodzha of
Pec, and on the basis of religious literature which allegedly bans
Muslims from erecting gravestones, Doncic said.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Promises Equal Treatment of Bosnia's Two Entities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb parliament
speaker Dragan Kalinic said Saturday he had won assurances from
the international High Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt that
the two entities in Bosnia receive equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
Kalinic, after a meeting with Bildt in Serb capital Pale, said
Republika Srpska planned to build a democratic society with an
open market, to enable the inflow of foreign capital, in order
that the damages of the war be repaired, according to Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's three-men presidency agreed on Friday that key posts
in the government would be allotted on the principle of equality
of Bosnia's two entities and three nations.
</P>
<P>
The presidency, including Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, Serb
Momcilo Krajisnik and Croat Kresimir Zubak, held their meeting in
Sarajevo's Serb district of Lukavica. The three men agreed the
Muslim-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska, as well as
Bosnia's Muslims, Serbs and Croats, would receive equal treatment
in the allotment of government posts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bildt told reporters that he was paying a working
visit to Pale and had wished Kalinic the best in his new post as
parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
Kalinic was elected the Serb parliament speaker last week to
replace Krajisnik who was elected Serb representative in the
Bosnian presidency in September 14 elections.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also said the talks included other outstanding issues,
including economic ones, Tanjug reported.

<HEADLINE> UK World Trade Gap Narrows to 584m Pounds in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's global trade deficit
declined sharply in August to 584 million pounds (928.6 million US
dollars), less than half of the 1.22 billion pounds (1.9 billion
US dollars) recorded in July, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that this was the smallest shortfall between
exports and imports since November last year, and was mainly due
to a surplus in its trade with the rest of the European Union
countries, which was only the fourth month since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Exports to other EU countries exceeded imports by 13 million
pounds (20.7 million US dollars) in August, compared with a
deficit of 505 million pounds (803 million US dollars) in July.
</P>
<P>
In August Britain recorded a surplus in its trade with France
for the first time since January and cut its deficit with Germany
to a 19-month low.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said the
figures demonstrated how competitive the UK economy was.
