<HEADLINE> Roundup: Britain Urged to Be More Cooperative on HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese side on the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) today urged the British
side to change their attitude and to be more cooperative on
related issues that have not been solved.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the three-day 40th plenary session
of the JLG which ended here today, Ambassador Zhao Jihua, Chinese
senior representative on the JLG, said that the Chinese side felt
very disappointed at the failure of the British side to adopt a
positive and cooperative approach at the session.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is still much work to do for the JLG in the
remaining days before the handover, such as the transfer of Hong
Kong government assets and Hong Kong archives and some other
issues on which no progress was made at this just concluded
plenary session.
</P>
<P>
"The British side should be more cooperative and have
consultations with the Chinese side on these matters, so as to
find earliest possible solutions to all these issues well before
July 1," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past 12 years the JLG has basically solved
most of the subjects that have been discussed by the two sides
within the framework of the JLG.
</P>
<P>
"I should say the discussion and settlement of these issues
have helped to ensure a smooth transition and helped to ensure the
long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it has been proven that it is quite necessary to set
up the Sino-British JLG and to have consultations in the JLG for
the smooth transition and for the long-term stability and
prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"With the great efforts we have made over the past years, we
have laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong to continue to be an
international financial, shipping and trade center," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides have so far discussed and had
consultations on many economic matters which straddle July 1,
1997, and with the appointment of the SAR Chief Executive and
principal SAR government officials, all these economic issues have
been gradually transferred to the SAR government, because these
economic issues are within the scope of the high-degree autonomy
of the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
"We did make it very clear to the British side that in the
final days before the handover, if the British side takes any
major measure on economic matters that straddle July 1, 1997, we
have a responsibility to express our concern and we have asked the
British side to have consultations with us," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the handover ceremony, he said that so far the
two sides have laid down a basic arrangement for related issues in
general.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the British side to take effective measures to
resolve the question of Vietnamese boat people and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Britain should take the lead in accepting and resettling
Vietnamese refugees held up in Hong Kong and not leave a burden on
the future HKSAR government, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that the sole role that the JLG plays is
"liaison", not "monitoring", both before and after July 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Arrives in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
arrived here today for a 24-hour visit to Ukraine where he is
expected to sign a landmark friendship treaty between the two
former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
The first official visit to Ukraine by Yeltsin would be "the
most complex one, as well as the president's most important
foreign policy action this year," Russian presidential spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said in Moscow today, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival, Yeltsin and his wife Naina were greeted by
Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Yeltsin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid
Kuchma, are to sign the friendship and cooperation treaty.
</P>
<P>
Kiev and Moscow initialed the friendship treaty two years ago,
but Yeltsin postponed his visit to Ukraine to its signing six
times, because of disputes over the Black Sea Fleet and its bases
on Crimea.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the premiers of the two countries entered
agreement on the fleet and its bases, paving the way for the visit
and the pact.

<HEADLINE> New Home Sales in US Down by 7.7 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Department
reported today that the sales of new single-family homes in April
plunged by 7.7 percent, the sharppest decline in six months.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales of new homes decreased to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 772,000 from the 11 year high
in March.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed a surprising rebound in March sales. The
Commerce Department originally reported a 2.5 percent decline, but
revised the figure sharply today to show a 2.0 percent gain. The
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 836,000 reached during the
month is the highest since April 1986, when it reached 857,000.
</P>
<P>
The turn-around in April is the largest decline in sales since
last October when sales fell 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year, however, the April sales rate was 4.2 percent
higher than in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Still, the supply of homes for sale at the end of April was
the lowest since August 1993. This inventory level would be
depleted in 4.5 months at the current sales rate.
</P>
<P>
The median sales price of new houses sold in April was 151,600
dollars, up from 145,000 dollars in March and by 8.3 percent from
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales declined most sharply in the West, down by
16.5 percent. The sales fell 6 percent in the South and 2.9
percent in the Midwest. They were unchanged in the Northeast.

<HEADLINE> Eight Handicapped Killed in Fire in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Eight mentally handicapped people were
killed and nine others injured when a fire swept through a home
run by the Protestant church in eastern German city of Frankfurt
on the Oder, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out at about 11 p.m. Thursday at the back of
the home in the center of the city which is on the Polish border.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters said about 90 of the home's 145 residents were
evacuated and taken to hospital with breathing problems. One of
the injured was still in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The rescue operation was difficult because many of the
residents were too disabled to walk or bedridden. Many others
panicked and were unable to help themselves, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police said the cause of the fire was still unknown, but arson
was not suspected.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Up at 5.8 Percent Rate in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic growth surged
at a 5.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year,
the best in a decade, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted annual growth rate in the gross
domestic product (GDP) was quicker than the U.S. government's
first estimate of a rate of 5.6 percent and the highest pace since
the fourth quarter of 1987.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the upward revision resulted mainly from
a larger exports than originally thought and businesses built
their inventories at a faster rate.
</P>
<P>
Those two changes more than offset a downward revision in
consumer spending from a 6.4 percent rate to 5.7 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The export in the first three months advanced at an 11.2
percent rate, better than the initial estimate of 8.1 percent. But
the imports were also revised up to a 23.2 percent rate from 21.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The real change in business inventories added 34.3 billion
dollars to the first quarter change in real GDP, after subtracting
17 billion from the fourth quarter change.
</P>
<P>
Gross private domestic fixed investment in the first quarter
surged at a rate of 10 percent and the government spending edged
up at just a 0.1 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The gain in first-quarter U.S. GDP translated into an increase
of 98.8 billion dollars, bringing the economy's inflation-adjusted
output to an annual rate of 7.09 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But an inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose at a 2.8 percent
rate, the worst in two years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists have predicted that the U.S. economic growth
during the rest of this year would average a modest 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The expectation of moderation apparently prompted Federal
Reserve policy-makers at their meeting last week to pass up the
chance to raise short-term interest rates. Instead, they've opted
to wait and see how much growth slows before deciding whether to
follow up on the rate increase of late March.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Report on Intelligence Head's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel denied today a newspaper
report which quoted army intelligence head Moshe Yaalon as
saying that Egypt needed a psychiatrist to sort out its
contradictory policy toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
The leading Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot reported that Yaalon
was quoted by diplomatic sources as making the satiric remarks
on Egypt. At today's weekly Cabinet meeting, Yaalon strongly
denied having made such comments.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also denied at the meeting
that Yaalon had ever made such statements, adding the report was
false and should be viewed with great severity.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai stressed that the report has caused unnecessary
damage both to the army intelligence head, whose assessments are
usually highly regarded, and to the sensitive relations with
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Today's report was published in the wake of a summit held
Tuesday in Sharm el-Sheikh by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The two leaders
discussed ways of reviving the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The summit was seen as a change of attitude by both Israel and
Egypt, which had been at odds with each other over the current
deadlock in the peace process. Before the summit, Egypt used to
join the Palestinians' verbal attacks against Israel for
sabotaging the peace process, while Israel blamed Cairo for
being an obstacle to advancing peace.
</P>
<P>
Following the summit, Mubarak promised to take upon the role
of mediator between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) in order to break the deadlock in the peace process. He is
working to arrange a three-way summit, which will include PNA
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In his first shuttle mission, Mubarak's special envoy Osama
Baz traveled to Gaza Wednesday to brief Arafat on the results of
the Sharm el-Sheik summit. Baz then visited Tel Aviv Thursday to
brief Netanyahu on his meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said Baz is expected to return back in the
coming days for another shuttle mission aimed at breaking the
Israeli-Palestinian deadlock since Israel began building the Har
Homa settlement in East Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> Game to Spread Patriotism among Computer Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A computer software game on the
Opium War (1840-1842), developed by the Optical Memory National
Engineering Research Center of Qinghua University, will be issued
15 days before Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The game, which took one year to produce and cost approximately
one million yuan (120,000 US dollars), is a multi-media creation
featuring the large-scale anti-intrusion battle that occurred in
modern Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The developers hope that the game will help to educate computer
fans about Hong Kong's history of takeover by imperialist powers,
and help them to learn more about the patriotic spirit of those
who laid down their lives for the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The game is the first of its kind ever developed in China.
</P>
<P>
Students from the Beijing No. 4 Middle School who have
experimented with the software called it "a really fascinating and
inspiring game."

<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China is to strengthen its
scientific research conditions including lab animals, chemical
reagents, books, and information networks by offering more
government funds and bank loans.
</P>

<HEADLINE> OAU to Take Measures to Deter Military Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A committee set up by the Organisation
of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management
and Resolution is drawing a list of measures to be adopted by
African states in the event of any military takeover of a legitimate
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
OAU spokesman Ibrahim Dagash said here today the committee,
chaired by Gabon, was expected to recommend measures that would deter
coups.
</P>
<P>
In the past the OAU merely condemned military coups without
taking preemptive action due to the organisation's policy of
non-interference in internal affairs of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
But since the establishment of the peace-making organ in 1992 the
OAU has increasingly been involved in internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Dagash said, ''we have to talk to these military governments to
persuade them to return to democratic rule. We have to speak to
them.''
</P>
<P>
He added, ''the OAU also feels that Nigeria is a big country and
what happens there affects other countries. That is why we did not
want to hurry the process of democracy and lead to a fragile
arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
He said the committee's recommenations would be tabled before the
OAU's peace-making organ for adoption and implementation. enditem

<HEADLINE> Taliban Militia Flushed Out of Key Northern Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Anti-Taliban forces led by
commander Ahmad Shah Masood today seized Jabul Siraj, the key
northern town located about 77 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today from Kabul said that the Taliban
have also withdrawn their forces from three northern provinces of
Jozjan, Sar-i-Pol and Faryab.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban entered the three northern provinces only last week
after general Abdul Malik, a key commander under Uzbek warlord
Abdul Rashid Dostam, rebelled.
</P>
<P>
After overrunning Jabul Siraj, Masood forces are now heading
towards Charikar. The Taliban and Masood forces are locked in
heavy fighting for control of Charikar, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Charikar, capital of northern Parwan province, lies about 65
kilometers from Kabul near the strategic Salang Highway leading to
the north.
</P>
<P>
Taliban officials had conceded the fall of Jabul Siraj.
However, they called it a "tactical withdrawal", one report said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban forces suffered heavy casualties Thursday when Massood
launched a pre-dawn attack and captured Gulbahar and Sherqat, two
strategic towns at the mouth of the Panjshir valley, where his
troops are located.

ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting was continuing
between Afghan Islamic Taliban militia around Charikar, a major
city north of Kabul, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who suffered a series of setbacks over the past
few days, were struggling to defend Charikar, capital of northern
Parwan province, after losing a nearby town of Jabul Siraj,

Masood's forces have seized the key northern town of Jabul
Siraj from the Islamic militia as well as three vital provinces,

HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) is seeking the support of African countries on its call for
an international ban on child labour, recruitment of children into
military forces and the production, storage and use in landmines.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Deputy Director Stephen Lewis said here today that his
organisation was concerned that children continued to bear the brunt
of economic and social upheavals and armed conflicts in africa.
</P>
<P>
He said his organisation was attending the Organisation of African
Unity's Council of Ministers and heads of state and government
meetings in Harare to drum up support for its anti-landmine and
anti-child labour stance.
</P>
<P>
Between 80 and 100 million children were involved in child labour
of one form or the other or were exposed to hazardous conditions in
Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of initiatives, he said, had been mooted in conjunction
with the OAU, governmental and non-governmental organisations which
might ensure a hopeful future for African children.
</P>
<P>
He said in its effort to stop the violation of children's rights
UNICEF was calling for the immediate elimination of hazardous child
labour, the legal protection of children, the production of data on
child labour and the signing of an international protocal on the ban
of child labour and landmines. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Economy Continues Uptrend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy continued to
be robust during the first quarter this year, with a stable strong
growth in the gross national product (GNP), a downtrend in
inflation and a rallying stock market.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the GNP, buoyed by strong showing of
agriculture and services sectors, grew by 6.1 percent, slightly
lower than the expected 6.4 percent and the revised year-ago level
of 6.9 percent, according to official figures released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP), on the other hand, rose by 5
percent, close to the year-ago level of 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GNP is a country's total output of goods and services,
including income from abroad such as remittances of overseas
contract workers, while the GDP refers to the figure after
adjustment for foreign income.
</P>
<P>
Despite a slowdown in the GNP, both government economic
managers and many private analysts here agreed that the country's
economy progressed at a comfortably healthy pace, contrary to
initial negative market expectations.
</P>
<P>
The stock market and the country's currency peso have both come
under strong pressure since late April, largely on fears that the
Philippines' economy was on a serious downturn and would soon
suffer the same fate as Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the country's growth for the rest of
the year is expected to accelerate and thus the government's
average growth rate target of 7 to 8 percent for the full year
will still be attained.
</P>
<P>
The actual economic growth rates for the first quarter,
although slightly weaker compared to year-ago levels, were just
within or little less than expectations, they explained.
</P>
<P>
They said the poor showing in industry sector led by
manufacturing, a key factor blamed for the slowdown of the entire
economy, was temporary.
</P>
<P>
From January to March, industrial output grew only 3.8 percent,
compared to 6.1 percent a year earlier, due to restructuring in
manufacturing and labor-related problems in rubber, textile and
metal industries.
</P>
<P>
"A pick-up in growth is expected to materialize in the next
quarters as economic restructuring continues and certain troubled
sectors get out of their temporary difficulties," said Planning
Secretary Celieto Habito.
</P>
<P>
Another vital economic indicator, the average inflation rate
for the first quarter, settled at 4.7 percent, a sharp decrease
from last year's 8.4 percent. Inflation for April dipped further
to 4.6 percent from 4.8 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by this trend, the government Wednesday scaled down
its inflation targets for 1997 and 1998 to show confidence in the
economy and dispel fears that the country could go the way of
Thailand, which has experienced a bumpy economic growth and
currency troubles in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The target for 1997 was reduced to 5.2 to 5.7 percent from 6 to
6.5 percent, while that for 1998 was lowered from 6 to 5.5 percent
even in view of the national elections that year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's stock market has begun to regain some
of its lost grounds in recent weeks after the Central Bank took a
series of measures to prevent speculative attacks on peso and
limit banks' exposure to the property sector.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine stocks index (Phisix) reached an all-time high
of 3,447.60 points on February 3 but began to dump since late
April because of fears of a glut of property and a destabilized
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank reduced again the overnight borrowing and
lending rates to 16 percent and 18 percent, respectively, Thursday
as the stock market continued to rebound for six consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
One day after the announcement of the first quarter
macro-economic fundamentals, the Phisix jumped by 50.84 points
today to 2,809.45 points.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to stabilize as investors' confidence in
the economy further improved after they gained a clearer picture
of the country's overall economic situation, analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's badminton
queen Susi Susanti signed off her last world badminton champions
here on Friday but said she would still play one year.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to play maybe one more year and I have duty to
bring youngsters up for Indonesia's women's singles," said Susanti
after her straight-game loss to China's Gong Zhichao in the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
But she then said even one year was not guaranteed because she
would have to consult her husband Allan Budi Kusuma.
</P>
<P>
"I have to discuss this with Allan," she said. "It Allan
said 'Stop' I would stop (playing)."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Chinese dominance in the event, Susanti said the
Chinese still have players like South Korea's Ra Kyung Min and her
compatriot Mia Audina to look out.
</P>
<P>
Susanti sung praise for her opponent Gong, saying "She has
potentials and she would follow my steps to the titles."
</P>
<P>
Susanti, who married Allan Budi Kusuma this February, is one of
the all-time giant in the sport.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old has had all major titles under her belt,
including the world championships, all England, world cup, the
Olympics and world grand prix.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hopes for Revival of Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchett said here today that the only
way to achieve the peace in the region is to sign an agreement of
just and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett made the remark upon departure today after winding up
the first fact-finding tour in the region of a minister in the
newly-elected British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, the
British official stressed that expectations for progress in the
Middle East peace process have not totally died.
</P>
<P>
"We should work for a revival of the peace process and
find out the means to resume the peace negotiations," Fatchett
said.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to achieve the peace in the region is to sign an
agreement of just and comprehensive peace because it is in the
interests of all sides and will realize stability, security and
economic prosperity," he added.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity for all the parties involved in the
peace process to have confidence in others and in themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We should work in order to reach conditions to ensure the
achievement of progress in the peace talks, and what I felt
from my meetings with the leaders in the region is that we
should not give up the peace process, but should seriously
treat the issue," Fatchett said.
</P>
<P>
The British minister began his tour earlier in the week
with a visit to Egypt, followed by Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas of West Bank and Gaza Strip, Jordan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
During his short stay in Beirut, he held meetings with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.

<HEADLINE> SIB's Campaign on Review into Pensions Misselling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Investments Board
(SIB) launched today an advertising campaign designed to heighten
the public's awareness of the review into pensions misselling.
</P>
<P>
The campaign forms part of the investor awareness program,
which will also target selected trade and consumer publications
and other suitable media.
</P>
<P>
Under the banner, "Have You Lost Out On Your Pension?", the
advertisements seek to underline the importance of the public
playing its part in the review.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the publicity program has been chosen to coincide
with the mailing of questionnaires by firms to investors.
</P>
<P>
It is vital that investors respond to the questionnaire, even
if they are unable to provide all the information asked for, the
SIB said. Otherwise, their case cannot be resolved speedily.
</P>
<P>
For the next three months, investors can call a 24 hour
freephone for a free copy of the SIB factsheet on the review.
</P>
<P>
The advertisements convey the purpose of the review and how it
works in a way that is clear, eye-catching, and informative.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that two out of five people contacted by firms
which sold them a personal pension do not reply to letters asking
for information about whether they might have been missold a
personal pension.
</P>
<P>
Unless investors reply, they may miss out on their right to
redress. By the end of March 1997 investors had accepted offers of
redress worth a total of 163.477 million US dollars to 12,650
people, an average of 12,000 US dollars.

LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- By 2002, global automotive capacity
will increase by 11 million units, according to a forecast by
DRI/McGraw-Hill.
</P>
<P>
With auto manufacturers racing to seize emerging market
opportunities, these markets will account for 86 percent of the
capacity expansion, said the report due to be published early
next month.
</P>
<P>
Developing Asia alone will absorb 54 percent of the growth
increasing capacity by 5.8 million units, while Eastern Europe and
South America will account for 3.2 million units or 32 percent of
the increase.
</P>
<P>
"Strategic considerations, not over capacity issues, dominate
emerging markets as auto manufacturers continue to announce new
assembly activity," noted Philippe Schwarz, managing director,
DRI/McGraw-Hill Global Automotive Services.
</P>
<P>
"However, with more and more manufacturers entering these
markets and increasing competition, the utilization rates fall.
This is a clear threat to large investments," he added.
</P>
<P>
The forecast said that the global capacity utilization rates
will remain at around 76 percent, well below the optimal rate of
90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Developing Asia capacity utilization will fall to 60 percent in
2002 from its 1996 level of 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, DRI pointed out that with the sluggish growth and
severe competition that will characterize the mature markets -
Western Europe, North America and Japan - during the coming years,
the over capacity issue should not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
In Western Europe through the 1990s, 1.9 million units will be
added to car capacity production, the report forecast.
</P>
<P>
The UK and Germany will absorb 60 percent of the capacity
expansion, and Japanese manufacturers will account for close to 40
percent of the total additional units. As a result there will be a
slow recovery in capacity utilization.
</P>
<P>
With a flat sales market, North America is in the best position
capacity-wise, according to the forecast.
</P>
<P>
Utilization is forecasted to grow from 88 percent to 93 percent
in 2002 while Japan will see little improvement in capacity
utilization improving only one percentage point to 68 percent by
2002.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz emphasised that over capacity is not an insurmountable
issue, saying that "increasing the flexibility of assembly plant
to meet market demands and respond more quickly to unpredictable
changes in the global marketplace is key to confronting over
capacity."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Seeks Better Economic Ties with Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Jordan will strengthen
bilateral economic cooperation, said Adnan el-Goodsy, chairman of
the Iraqi Industrial Union, here today.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Jordanian economic officials for better economic
ties, Goodsy said Iraq's relations with any other country will
not affect the "distinguished" Jordanian-Iraqi ties.
</P>
<P>
Goodsy's visit came when the sanction-ravaged Iraq is seeking
cooperation with Arab neighbors and lifting of U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan will be one of the first countries to benefit from the
lifting of the U.N. sanctions," said the chairman, who expressed
appreciation for Jordan's efforts to alleviate Iraqi people's
suffering incurred by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan promised to provide more facilities in its Red
Sea port Aqaba, the only way that commodities can be imported into
Iraq, to improve the conditions for food and medicine into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq hopes for an increase of 50 million U.S. dollars in its
trade protocol with Jordan now estimated at 255 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 13 Jordanian companies have received
permissions from the U.N. Sanction Committee to export
detergents, cooking oil and medicine worth more than 35 million
dollars to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was one of the most important economic partners for
Iraq before the Gulf crisis, but it distanced itself from Baghdad
in an effort to end its isolation from the Arab world and the West.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of this year, the amount of oil supplied
free by Iraq for Jordan was raised from 250 million dollars
to 300 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean new military
government has closed the country's borders and banned all
aircrafts from flying over its territory, a report reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The ban by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council was
broadcast via the National Radio on Thursday night and was to
take effect immediately, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the order, however, the U.S. began evacuating its
citizens by air from Freetown today.
</P>
<P>
A stream of U.S. helicopters were reportedly lifting its
citizens to the helicopter carrier "Kearsage" berthing on the
Sierra Leonean coast.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Lebanon and Belgium have been evacuating their
citizens since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wide lootings have been reported in Freetown since the
military coupists took power and ousted civil President Ahmad
Kabbah in a coup on Sunday. At least 18 deaths have also been
reported.
</P>
<P>
The coup has been widely criticized by the United Nations, the
Organization of African Unity, the U.S., France, Germany, Nigeria
and other countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Another 200 soldiers of the West
African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG was air-lifted today
from neighboring Liberia to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
This added the total number of ECOMOG troops to 600 in Sierra
Leone the last three days, according to a BBC broadcast.
</P>
<P>
There will be 700 ECOMOG soldiers arriving in Freetown on
Tuesday by two warships. But their mission has not yet been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Chief of Defence Staff, Major-General A. A. Abubakar
is already in Freetown for talks with the new military
authorities over the restoration of power to the elected
government toppled in a coup last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The increase of ECOMOG troops to Freetown is seen as means to
put pressure on the coupists led by Major Johnny Paul Koroma.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Koroma "is not happy" with the arrival of
the ECOMOG troops, saying that he did not want any
confrontations.

<HEADLINE> UK's Trade Deficit Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's trade performance improved
in March with no sign of damage from the strong pound in world
foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics took City economists by
surprise with news of a decline in the gap between export earnings
and the bill for imports from 771 million pounds (1233.6 million
US dollars) to 671 million pounds (1073.6 US dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
The trade gap with Europe shrank to just 20 million pounds (32
million US dollars) from 290 million pounds (464 million US
dollars) in February, making it the second time in nine months
that a position of near balance has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
City analysts had warned for some months that exports would be
hit by the strong pound. But the latest official figures show the
trade picture in Britain is improving.
</P>
<P>
Dharshini David, an economist at HSBC, said there were few
clear signs that the strength of sterling was damaging the trade
position yet.
</P>
<P>
However, most economists still expect the damage to show up
later this year, following survey evidence indicating declining
export orders.

<HEADLINE> International Community Pressures Bosnia Leaders on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINTRA, Portugal, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The international
community urged on Friday Bosnia's elected authorities to
implement the Dayton peace agreement in full or face a number of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This was voiced at a meeting of the Steering Board of the Peace
Implementation Council(IPC), created after the signing of the
Dayton Agreement which ended the Bosnia war 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held in the Portugese town of Sintra, was
participated by the countries involved in helping implementing the
Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
Three members of Bosnia's rotating presidency - Alija
Izetbegovic, a Muslim, Dresimir Zubak, a Croat, and Momcilo
Krajisnik, a Serb, also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Carl Bildt, the outgoing international envoy to Bosnia, told a
new conference after the meeting that there was "strong
endorsement of the principal" at the meeting that international
assistance with economic reconstruction should be conditional upon
full compliance with the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
A declaration issued after the meeting said that sanctions
would be considered if the new three-man Bosnian presidency had
not appointed or confirmed new ambassadors by August 1 this year
to represent the entire country.
</P>
<P>
From January 1998, the declaration said, only cars with new
Bosnian registration plates would be allowed across international
borders
</P>
<P>
It warned that existing nationalist flags and other symbols
would no longer be recognized after September 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Economic aid would be cut off to "those municipalities which
continue to tolerate indicted persons working in a public
capacity".
</P>
<P>
The meeting also called on the Bosnian authorities to take
necessary actions to reform property laws, pass citizenship laws,
restructure police forces, and hand over indicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
It was also announced that a Donor's Conference was planned to
be held in Brussels at senior official level on June 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States, France and Britain, the main contributors to
SFOR,the international peace force in Bosnia, fear failure to make
progress in implementing the civilian aspects of Dayton Agreement
could see Bosnia slip back into war after SFOR's mandate expires
next July or force them to keep troops there indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Megan Trial Defendant Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Jesse Timmendequas has been
convicted on all charges and could face the death penalty for
kidnapping, raping and killing his 7-year-old neighbor, Megan
Kanka, whose death gave rise to laws warning communities about sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
Jurors at the trial that lasted 17 days in New Jersey
deliberated for just over four hours spread over two days before
reaching their verdict today.
</P>
<P>
The same jury, selected in neighboring Hunterdon County because
of heavy pre-trial publicity in Mercer County where the crime
occurred, must now decide the sentence. Mercer County Superior
Court Judge Andrew Smithson told jurors he would have to discuss
scheduling of the penalty phase with lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Megan disappeared in July 1994. A few hours later, Timmendequas
led police to her body in a park.
</P>
<P>
Timmendequas, a twice-convicted child molester, was sharing a
house with two men he had met in New Jersey's prison for sex
offenders. Neighbors in Hamilton Square, a quiet suburb of
Trenton, were not aware of the three roommates' past crimes.
</P>
<P>
The case inspired "Megan's laws" in New Jersey, in other states
and Congress requiring sex offenders to register with police and
community notification of the presence of those deemed to be
dangerous. Those laws are facing challenges in state and federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that Timmendequas lured the girl into his
home, fondled her and strangled her with a belt when she began
struggling and threatened to tell on him.

<HEADLINE> Work or Leave, A Question for Egyptians in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of some 300,000 Egyptians
working in Jordan should either obtain valid work permits or leave
the country with the current exemption of fines as of today.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed between Jordan and Egypt in
March, from April 1 on, all Egyptian workers found in violation
will be deported or face legal actions by Jordan's Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
This is in light of the government's decision to cut down the
number of Egyptians working in the economic recession-hit
country. It was believed their over presence has incurred
unemployment among Jordanians and loss of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment among the Jordanians is largely due to those who
shun jobs (which are then) taken by non-Jordanians," said
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali on May 18 while
meeting Minister of Labor Saleh Khasawneh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a bank official said that foreign labor here
usually remitted some 28 million dollars a quarter out of Jordan
and a large part of it was remitted by the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
This made up some one 15th of the money remitted back into
Jordan by Jordanian expatriates, said Ahmad Mustafa, executive
director of the Research and Studies Department at the Central
Bank of Jordan, on May 24 in an interview.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 Egyptian are working in Jordan and most of them
illegally, according to officials here. Some had demonstrated the
desire to return home but were unable to do so as heavy fines were
levied for staying in the kingdom with expired visas.
</P>
<P>
The workers were then granted a grace period ending today to
leave Jordan without penalty or obtain, by paying an annual fee of
some 140 U.S. dollars, work permits, issued by the Jordanian Labor
Ministry and approved by the Egyptian embassy in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Labor Ministry issued 42,796 work permits to
non-Jordanian workers in 1996, down from 94,333 in 1995, thus
strictly complying with measures announced by the Cabinet in
1996 to cut the number of guest workers in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
A 1996 government order also closed 16 different occupations
to non-Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt have enjoyed close cooperation since 1984 when
Jordan became the first Arab state to resume diplomatic relations
with Egypt. Most Arab League members cut off their ties with
Cairo in 1979 to protest the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Top Palestinian Negotiators in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- With no apparent progress in
breaking the Mideast crisis in sight, two Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) negotiators held consultations with Egyptian
officials here today on Egypt's efforts to save the flagging
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, PNA minister of local administration and senior
negotiator, and Hassan Asfour, coordinator of negotiations
affairs, arrived here on Friday night for talks with senior
Egyptian officials on the latest development in the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came a day before Osama el-Baz, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak's political advisor, is due to go to Israel again in
a bid to bring the Israelis and the Palestinians back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz, who has been shuttling between the two sides since
Tuesday's summit between Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu, is expected in Jerusalem on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Intensive Egyptian diplomatic efforts to revive the Mideast
peace process climaxed last Tuesday when Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak met with Netanyahu in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership, during a weekly meeting in
Ramallah of the West Bank on Friday night, voiced welcome and
support of the Egyptian bid to reactivate the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arab
radio today, Arafat's advisor Ahmed Tibi downplayed the
possibility of holding a Palestinian-Israeli summit, something
Mubarak had hoped to arrange in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks broke down when Israel
began building a new settlement in Har Homa, a Jewish quarter in
Arab East Jerusalem in March. The PNA has made its return to the
negotiating table conditional on a halt of Israel's expansionary
policy.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was reportedly floating a five-point plan to persuade
the two sides to the negotiations, which includes a temporary halt
of settlement activities in Jerusalem and the West Bank and the
resumption of Palestinian-Israeli security coordination.

<P>
SHENYANG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The city of Dandong has turned
out to be a popular tourist resort on the Sino-Korean border by
providing tourist programs with local features.
</P>
<P>
Since most of its attractions are in the mountains, the city
has spent heavily in recent years on mountain resorts, and has
several national reserves and forest parks for tourists.
</P>
<P>
To help tourists, villages have been built linking various
spots, and an effort has been made to use the natural beauty along
the border that stretches for more 1,000 kilometers along the
Democratic Republic of Korea, with several routes featuring rivers
and ravines.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the city has attracted more than a
million Chinese and overseas tourists each year, and about 20,000
Chinese tourists have taken part in Korean tours organized by
local tour operators.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Ships Using East China Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The deep-water port at Beilun near
Ningbo in Zhejiang Province in east China has been handling an
increasing number of foreign ships because it is an ice-free port
year-round.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest bulk carrier, oil, and container terminal,
it is large enough to accommodate about any ship.
</P>
<P>
Last June, China Ocean Shipping Corporation (COSCO) started
weekly service from Beilun to the east coast of the US, and
recently, included a route to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, LITTMAS of Germany and CMA of France
opened container routes to Beilun, and set up offices there.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some US shippers have contacted port authorities in
Beilun to inquire about opening container routes to the west coast
of the US.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign shipping companies' enthusiasm for Beilun comes
from its sophisticated port conditions and its geographical
location and connection with the vast inland area of China," one
port expert commented.
</P>
<P>
In order to make itself more attractive, the port has made an
effort to improve infrastructure even more and its services.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Capital Injected in Home-funded Car Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Guizhou Yunque (Lark) Car
Corporation, the only major automaker with no foreign capital,
recently settled an agreement to form a joint venture with a
Japanese company.
</P>
<P>
After five years of contracts, owners of the corporation, the
China Guizhou Aviation Industrial Corporation and China Guizhou
Joint Automotive Industrial Corporation (CGJAIC), signed a letter
of intent with Japanese Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. during a recent
trade fair held in this capital of southwest China's Guizhou
Province.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Chinese side is to pour 306 million
yuan (36.87 million US dollars) in the new joint venture, taking
51 percent of stake. And the Japanese side agreed to provide 294
million yuan (35.42 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new venture is set to have a manufacturing capacity of
10,000 compact cars.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Binyan, general manager of CGJAIC, even
though the venture has already been named by the Chinese
government as one of the country's eight major car production
projects, the shortage of capital still restricted its
expansion.
</P>
<P>
"The new company will carry out technical renovation on the
existing production lines in a bid to produce and sell quality
Yunque cars," he said.
</P>
<P>
The company will also increase its local contents proportion to
reduce costs and hone its competitive edge in the marketplace,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Compact cars are best-selling models in China's auto
market. Other major compact car model, the Alto, is produced by a
joint venture between a local automaker and Japan's Isuzu
Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai-Tibet Highway Plays Big Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Qinghai-Tibet Highway has been
playing an important role in the growth of local economy in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, the country's only
provincial region that has no rail route.
</P>
<P>
Some 85 percent of the autonomous region's goods and materials
are moved in and out by road; all heavy equipment needed to build
large projects has to be trucked through the highway to reach
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The highway has resulted in the mushrooming of a number of new
towns in Tibet which are dotted throughout the grasslands, and
local products, including livestock, have found their way into
inland markets.
</P>
<P>
Construction began in 1953 on the road, more than 1,100 km in
length, which extends from Gormu City, Qinghai Province, to Lhasa,
the capital of Tibet. In 1984, the central government invested
billions of yuan to upgrade it to an asphalt-covered motorway.
</P>
<P>
Snaking along at an average height of 4,500 m, it is the
highest road in the world. Bad weather frequent the area, where
winter temperatures can dive as low as -40 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
After years of work, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway has been built
into a second-grade model, over which vehicles can travel at
speeds as high as 100 kmh.
</P>
<P>
A project is currently underway to tackle such problems as
foundation-distortion and sinking in the frozen-earth area which
covers an over 700 km-section of the road. It is the second such
project, costing more than 900 million yuan (108 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
An isolation layer will be added to solve the frozen-earth
problem, according to experts with the project.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Opposition Rally Broken up, Causing Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan anti-riot police today
dispersed a banned rally of opposition parties asking for
constitutional reforms in downtown Nairobi, causing hours of
turmoil in which at least dozens of people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Heavy-armed police drove more than 1,000 opposition
sympathizers out of the central Uhuru Park, the planned venue of
the rally, in panic after wielding billies and clubs, and firing
tear-gas grenades.
</P>
<P>
Police helicopters circled around over the center of the city,
where all business came to a complete standstill, to coordinate
and move dozens of trucks of Kenyan polices and security forces.
</P>
<P>
There were fierce running battles between the stone-throwing
crowd and the police, who protected themselves with shields and
helmets.
</P>
<P>
Cavalries were also deployed in downtown to dispel the
demonstrators, who repeated shouting like that:"Moi must go",
"change Now!"
</P>
<P>
Stones scattered fully around some streets. Windows of several
shops were smashed.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders today also held a press briefing,
calling for opening of a constitutional conference immediately.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have been putting pressures on
President Daniel arap Moi to conduct constitutional reforms
before the forthcoming general elections, while Moi insists he
will only do that after the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders call for a change of the clause,
demanding the future president get more than 50 percent of the
total votes nationwide, otherwise form a coalition government.
But the call has already been refused by Moi.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government issued a statement on Friday, banning
today's rally, the second rally organized by the four main
opposition parties in the eastern African country -- Democratic
Party, Ford Kenya, Ford Asili and the National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the conveners of the meeting had
neither sought nor been given any licence and it is therefore "
illegal for any person to attend such a meeting."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan governmental forces banned and then broke up the
first rally of opposition parties earlier this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 31 (Xinhua) -- To promote relations with Ukraine is a
top priority in Russia's foreign policies, said Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov at a meeting here on Friday with his
Ukrainian counterpart Gennady Udovenko.
</P>
<P>
Moscow hoped to build not only neighborly but brotherly ties
with Ukraine, added Primakov who was accompanying Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on a two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing that Yeltsin's visit indicated Russia's hopes to forge
good-neighbor relations with his country, Udovenko stressed that
these relations should be based on mutual respect for each other's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Talking about relations with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), Udovenko said that Ukraine fully supported
Russia's efforts to enter into partnership with NATO, which would
be an important element in maintaining European stability.
</P>
<P>
He added that Ukraine welcomed the Founding Act of Mutual
Relations, Cooperation and Security between Russia and NATO
and hoped that it would completely end the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that Ukraine would follow Russia's example and
promote relations with NATO.

<HEADLINE> Italy Beats China in World League Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- World top-ranked Italy trounced
China in straights sets in the first round of the World Volleyball
League Group B preliminaries here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Italy, two-time world champion and world cup holder, met no
challenge from the hosts before winning with three identical 15-6
in one hour and 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese spikers, led by the newly-appointed coach Wang
Jiawei, were apparently no match with the Italians, who won the
wolrd league champions for five times but finished second last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, spearheaded by two-time World Champion Andrea
Giani, raced to a 7-1 lead soon after the action.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were deadlocked at 14-6, exchanging service for
some ten times before Italy took it 15-6.
</P>
<P>
Italy then pulled away in the following two sets with their
powerful attacks, well-knit defences, strong service and solid
blocks.
</P>
<P>
"Our service is very effective, and our blocks very good, "
said Italy's head coach Bebeto de Freitas, who just took over the
Italians from legend Argentine Julio Velasco early this year.
</P>
<P>
Freitas, who had coached his native Brazilian national squad
for 10 years, was very happy with the win.
</P>
<P>
"We started well in the first and I hope it will be also good
in the second," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's head coach Wang, a former national who led China to a
record fifth in the World Cup tournament, said: "The loss reflects
the real gap between China and world's first-class teams. I hope
it will be helpful to us."
</P>
<P>
"It's a good and expected result because we only assembled and
trained together less than half a month. We need time," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
The two teams will play their second match on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China, who was drawn in Group B with Italy, Yugoslavia and
Spain, had played against Yugoslavia and Spain twice each on the
road, only to be defeated in all six outings.
</P>
<P>
Teams from 12 countries and regions compete in the World League
in three groups. Each team plays six home-and-away matches through
June 22. The two top teams from each group will advance to the
final round scheduled to begin on June 30 in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Children's Gymnastics Show Held in Tian'anmen Square </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 five- and
six-year-olds from both inland areas and Hong Kong staged a lively
gymnastics show in Tian'anmen Square in Beijing today to celebrate
International Children's Day and greet the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
For an hour in the cool morning air, the kids demonstrated the
newly-created Chinese Basic Exercises for Children.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the square, printed slogans such as "Building up
strong physique and fostering a new generation," and "Entering the
21st with healthy physique and minds," fluttered from colored
balloons.
</P>
<P>
A countdown board on the east side of the square showed that
only 31 days remain until the return of Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of pigeons, which symbolize peace and happiness, were
set free into the sky when the children began their routines.
</P>
<P>
The basic exercises are designed to improve children's physical
health and help them develop an awareness of unity and interest in
group activities, said Li Shiming, an official with the China
National Committee on Care for Children.
</P>
<P>
"Today's children need more exercise," Li said. "A recent
survey shows that about ten percent of the children in big cities
are overweight, while many are too thin."
</P>
<P>
He said that the basic exercises, both amusing and easy to
learn, are suitable for children between the ages of three and six.
</P>
<P>
China has many one-child families, due to the state's family
planning policies, he said, children in those families easily
become self-centered because they receive too much attention from
their parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the group exercises can help them to learn
many things, he said, including how to treat each other politely
and behave well. More than 100,000 preschool children around the
country are doing such kind of exercises.
</P>
<P>
Today's activity was jointly organized by the China National
Committee on Care for Children, the All-China Women's Federation,
the China Gymnastics Association and other units.
</P>
<P>
A group of children from Hong Kong demonstrated "Chair
Exercises" in the square today.
</P>
<P>
"I had been wondering if my son could do it well," said Ko Yin
Fan, mother of six-year-old Law Wai Yee. "But everything turned out
all right."
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we have come to Beijing, and my son is
really excited," she said. "He likes this city."
</P>
<P>
She said she hopes they can come to Beijing again after July
1.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Cooperating with Areas along with Beijing-Kowloon Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen will now be able to
cooperate closely with areas along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway
line, as the first train from Beijing to Kowloon entered Hong Kong
via the north-south trunk line in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
A group of experts from local organizations, including the
Shenzhen Comprehensive Development Institute, predict that more
and closer cooperation is expected in the fields of communications
and transportation, business transfer, market and resource
development, and the use of overseas funds between Shenzhen and
the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
The experts say that Shenzhen, which has the advantages of
bordering Hong Kong and being a pioneer in China's opening-up
drive, will become a successful service center through which
overseas businessmen can invest in interior areas, especially
those along the Beijing-Kowloon line.
</P>
<P>
The city, with 12 national checkpoints of exit and entry by
sea, land and air will offer standard and efficient services in
finance, information, personnel training, and transportation and
storage.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Kowloon line traverses seven provinces and two
municipalities from north to south, affecting 117 million
people. The areas along the line have abundant natural resources
and great potential for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, as a major train stop of the north-south trunk line
at its southern end, had made a use of 11.87 billion U.S. dollars
of overseas funds as of the end of 1996, including investment from
more than 130 international consortia and transnationals.
</P>
<P>
The city has so far put 2.49 billion yuan into 866 projects in
areas along the rail route, while these interior areas have also
invested 4.99 billion yuan in Shenzhen, with Beijing and Tianjin
ranking far ahead of other places in terms of investment scale.
</P>
<P>
Economic and technical cooperation between Shenzhen and
interior areas along the trunk rail line had previously been
confined only to the aspects of trade, commerce and real estate.
</P>
<P>
Interior areas had supported Shenzhen's economic expansion by
way of securing funds and providing the city with advanced
technology, qualified talent and labor, and eventually developed
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shenzhen made advanced economic and technological
progress in these interior areas by the means of launching its own
solely-funded businesses, setting up joint ventures, and engaging
in leasing, trading of properties and takeovers.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Post Found on Beijing's Northwestern Outskirts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The ruins of an ancient post have
been discovered on Beijing's outlying northwestern outskirts.
</P>
<P>
The post, named Yulinbao located in Yanqing County, is the
oldest and the best preserved site of its kind ever found in the
Beijing area.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the post was important in the Yuan
(1271-1368), Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) Dynasties, and
a number of poets mentioned the place in their work.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor
Guangxu of the late Qing dynasty used the post as a resting place
on their way out of Beijing, when the city was overtaken in the
year 1900 by the Eight-Power Allied Forces, or the intruding
troops sent by the Western powers including Britain, the United
States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Many cultural relics remain in the post, which has 800 meters
of city wall and 34 ancient buildings intact, and in which 257
relics were found.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the post is of great importance for the
research into the history of posts and communications in the
region, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The site is expected to be developed into a tourist attraction,
according to sources.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for Establishment of Tobacco Free World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today called upon all African governments, private and
public sectors, young and old people to redouble their efforts
for a tobacco free world.
</P>
<P>
The call came from a statement issued by the WHO office in
Addis Ababa to mark the 10th anniversary of the World No Tobacco
day which falls on today.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged African countries and member states of the
WHO in particular to take a retrospective look at our
achievements over the past 10 years in regard to the control of
tobacco use and project themselves into the future to see what
remains to be done, in order to overcome this scourge.
</P>
<P>
The statement listed the fact that the United Nations system
has taken necessary measures to control tobacco use in the world,
such as: WHO has prohibited smoking on its premises since more
than ten years, the World Bank and its associates no longer give
bank loans for the cultivation and promotion of tobacco, FAO has
been helping countries whose economy is dependent on tobacco to
find substitute produce to replace the cultivation and marketing
of tobacco, the International Civil Aviation Organization has
since 1996 requested all airlines worldwide to prohibit smoking
on their flights.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the African region, over 39 percent of the WHO
member states have already adopted laws, decrees or regulations
prohibiting tobacco use in public places or buildings such as
hospitals, schools, cinema halls, as well as in public transport.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that the number of smokers in an
african country ranges between 10 percent and 50 percent of the
population depending on the country.
</P>
<P>
''Youths, boys and girls, are still lured by the lifestyles of
smokers often idealized by the mass media as examples of social
success,'' the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
''Unfortunately, in Africa, cigarettes are sold without
restrications or mandatory warning on the attendant health
hazards. No mention is made of the different ingredients and
additivies, including of the worst kinds, used in the manufacture
of cigarettes,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement emphased that all these constitute serious
obstacles to efficient and effecitve tobacco control.

<HEADLINE> Legislative Council Commission Bill Tabled to HK PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Legislative Council
Commission (Amendment) Bill, which aims to facilitate
administrative support to the legislature of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) after July 1, was tabled to the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) here today.
</P>
<P>
Michael Suen, secretary for policy coordination of the Chief
Executive's Office of the HKSAR, moved the draft bill to the PLC's
full sitting for first and second readings.
</P>
<P>
Suen said that under Article 8 of the Basic Law, the existing
Legislative Council Commission Ordinance will continue to be in
force after June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the continued application of the ordinance from July
1 and to make transitional arrangements arising from the
establishment of the PLC and its supporting structure," Suen
noted, the Working Group on Administrative Matters under the PLC
had earlier reviewed the ordinance and recommended a number of
modifications.
</P>
<P>
These recommendations were adopted at a PLC meeting on May 17
and the bill seeks to implement the recommendations, he said.

"Legislative Council Commission", with changes to certain terms
and references also being made.
</P>
<P>
It states that several existing references such as "Crown" and
"standing orders" shall be changed to "Government" and "rules of
procedure" respectively so as to be consistent with the Basic Law
and to reflect the situation after Hong Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
The existing Legislative Council Commission was established in
April 1994 to provides through the secretariat the council
administrative support and services to the Hong Kong Legislature.
</P>
<P>
Transitional arrangements are made for members of the working
group, which performs functions similar to those of the existing
Legislative Council Commission, to become members of the PLC
commission from July 1 and to supervise the operation of the
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposes that the membership of the PLC commission be
increased to a total of not more than 13, including three
ex-officio members -- the president of the PLC, and the chairman
and deputy chairman of the PLC House Committee.
</P>
<P>
The bill also seeks to facilitate convergence of the
administrative set-up and support services to the PLC with the
existing Legislative Council Secretariat.

<HEADLINE> Planned Vaccination Benefits Children in Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Four million children in
central-south China's Hunan Province have benefited from
vaccination programs, as proved by a drop of 90 percent over the
past decade in the incidence of such common infant diseases as
diphtheria, pertussis, and measles.
</P>
<P>
According to an evaluation by the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and the Chinese Ministry of Health, more than 97
percent of the children in Hunan have been inoculated against
these diseases.
</P>
<P>
No cases of polio have been reported in Hunan over the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
Hunan started to build a cold storage system for vaccines back
in 1984, and set up the first inoculation program that covered
over 60 counties and cities the following year. The province-wide
planned vaccination system was completed in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Hunan has appropriated 2.5 million yuan (300,000 US
dollars) annually to purchase the polio vaccine, which has been
used to inoculate 20 million people and caused the vaccination
rate for the disease to exceed 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province initiated a three-year project to add
2.5 million yuan (301,000 US dollars) each year for the renewal of
cold storage equipment for vaccines.

<HEADLINE> Youngsters Enthusiastic about China's Anti-Tobacco Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Primary and middle school students
in the Chinese capital today challenged their counterparts across
the country to become the first generation of non-smokers in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 1,000 "Smoke-free Schools" in Beijing issued
a proposal to put a stop to teenage smoking in a bid to protect
people's health and the environment, and to contribute to the
nation's development in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"As the new generation of the 21st century, we should devote
ourselves to China's anti-tobacco campaign. We should not take
cigarettes, encourage smokers to kick the habit, and stop illegal
smoking in public places," they said in the proposal issued today,
the tenth "Worldwide No-Tobacco Day."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the group presented to the organizing committee of
the Tenth World Conference on Tobacco and Health a 100-meter-long
list of 200,000 Beijing students who signed their names and wrote
anti-tobacco slogans in support of the global anti-smoking drive
and the conference, scheduled to be held here in August.
</P>
<P>
"We should always attach importance to the control of teenage
smoking, because this group will make the number of smokers in
China higher," said Ming Lu, an official who is in charge of
smoking-control work at the National Patriotic Hygiene Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Of the 350 million smokers in China, five million are under age
18.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Chen Minzhang has warned that if measures
are not taken immediately, two million smokers will die from
smoking-related illnesses annually by the year 2020, and many of
them will be young people.
</P>
<P>
In order to curb the growing rate of teenage smoking, the
Ministry of Health and the Chinese Association on Smoking and
Health have urged primary and middle schools across the country to
take action.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, 1,000 schools, or one-third of the total number,
have become smoke-free.
</P>
<P>
About one million young people, responding to a call by the
Soong Ching Ling Foundation, have taken part in no-smoking
activities for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The foundation appeals to youngsters not to smoke, not to sell
or buy cigarettes, to tell their families to stop smoking or smoke
less, and to discourage people from smoking in public places.

<HEADLINE> Hukou Waterfall, Renowned Scenic Spot in Northwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUKOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A ten-year effort for comprehensive
development has turned a unique waterfall on the Yellow River into
one of northwestern China's most renowned scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
The Hukou Waterfall, situated between Shanxi and Shaanxi
Provinces, has a drop of more than 30 meters and is the only
yellow-colored waterfall in the world.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 million yuan (2.4 million US dollars) has been
used to develop the tourism resources at the Hukou falls since
1988, when it was listed as one of the country's state-level
scenic beauties.
</P>
<P>
The landscape also has, since 1994, been included on the list
of attractions for the country's tourism-promotion campaign "Visit
China '97."
</P>
<P>
Shanxi Province's Jixian County, located near the waterfall,
takes the advantage of the falls to host an international tourism
festival each year. The county alone received a total of 136,000
domestic and overseas tourists last year and earned 760,000 yuan
(95,600 US dollars) in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Work on infrastructure construction in tourism zones adjacent
the waterfall is nearly completed, boosting the growth of the
local tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Rural and Urban Consuming Gap to Narrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Narrowing the gap between rural and
urban consumer goods is one of the major trends in China this year,
market analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is that urban sales will decrease while rural
sales increase, with a gap of about two percentage points, while
overall sales of consumer goods are expected to rise by about 20
percent in China.
</P>
<P>
However, overall supply will still exceed demand and problems
in the supply structure will still remain.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are expected to mature psychologically this year,
which will contribute to fewer fluctuations in the market, the
experts believe.
</P>
<P>
While cars and houses are hardly expected to become the focus
of consumers this year, the demand for telephones, air
conditioners, microwave ovens, wide-screen TVs, and VCD players
are expected to continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
Market competition is also expected to become more fierce and the
growth of privately-owned and other forms of commercial outlets
will exceed that of state- and collectively-owned commercial
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> New Growing Technology to Help Boost Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China is increasing the use of
plastic sheeting as a technique to improve wheat growth and to
sustain agricultural development, according to a recent meeting in
Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Gansu
Province started using the technology in 1992. The new technology
increased per-unit output by more than 30 percent, saving from 900
to 1,500 cubic meters of water per hectare, and increasing
farmers' income by 1,500 yuan per ha.
</P>
<P>
China has been successful with cotton and corn growing using
plastic sheeting, which saves water and is drought-resistant, and
especially suited to the particular type of farming in dry
northern China.
</P>
<P>
If the technology is applied to 3.3 million ha to 6.6 million
ha of the 11.33 million ha of spring and winter wheat land in north
China, the country can expect five to ten billion kg more in wheat
output, accounting for one-third to two-thirds of the national
target for grain output during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, experts
say.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Likely to Intervene in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- There are signs that the
Nigerian-led West African Peace-keeping Force known as ECOMOG may
intervene in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Following a silence-breaking presidency statement on Thursday
condemning the coup in Sierra Leone, Nigerian Foreign Minister
Tom Ikimi on Friday re-affirmed his government's support for
outsted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to a debate on Sierra Leone at the meeting of
foreign ministers of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in
Harare, Ikimi described Kabbah as "a great leader, upright in
stature and a man of peace".
</P>
<P>
He blamed the west countries for pressing Sierra leone into
the last election without allowing it to address the inherent
problems that led to the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Many people doubted at that time if the necessary conditions
for election existed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi disclosed that as the Chairman of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), Nigerian Head of State, General
Sani Abacha has been holding intensive sub-regional consultations
to ensure a quick restoration of peace, stability and
installation of a legitimate government in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ikimi told BBC that Nigeria deplores "the
loss of lives and the wanton destruction and looting of property
which have accompanied the incident in Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility as a country, Nigeria and General
Abacha as the Chairman of the ECOWAS to assist Sierra Leone to
resolve its conflicts and find a durable solution."
</P>
<P>
Since May 27, 1,300 ECOMOG soldiers in Liberia have been sent
to Freetown. Reports said that they have been involved in
evacuating forign nations.
</P>
<P>
Before the coup, Nigeria already had at least a battalion in
Freetown to help train Sierra Leonean troops in accordance with
to an agreement signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Nigerian soldiers were involved in
the fighting against the coupists and in helping President Kabbah
to flee his country, as they have been deployed to guard the
presidential house.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian media reported today that the United
States government has given its backing to any action by Nigeria
to restore the legitimate government of Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, the coup leader, Paul Jonny Koroma said in an
interview with BBC on Friday that he received signals that the
Nigerian government had instructed the ECOMOG troops to attack
under a code name.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that Sierra Leone will resist any foreign invasion of
its territory.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council set up
by the coupist ordered the immediate close of the country's sea
and land border.
</P>
<P>
The order also banned all aircraft from flying over the
territory of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The coup in Sierra Leone has been widely condemned by the
United Nations, the OAU and many countries.

<HEADLINE> 98 Percent of Kuwaiti Territories Cleared of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said today that 98
percent of its territories are free of land-mines and other
explosives left by the Gulf War in 1991 which have claimed the
lives of nearly 1,800 victims so far.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Am published
today, Kuwaiti land forces engineering corps commander Colonel
Jassem Al-Sumait said so far 1.03 million mines, including 567,650
anti-tank mines left by the Iraqi occupation during the Gulf War,
have been removed, neutralized or detonated.
</P>
<P>
He said 98 percent of Kuwaiti territories, including Failaka
Island, had been cleared. The remaining uncleared areas include
the oil lakes, some inside desert areas, and certain coastal
locations.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Kuwait was liberated by the U.S.-led allied forces
in 1991, Kuwait was divided into eight areas and contracts were
awarded to eight companies and armies for demining hundreds of
thousands of various types of mines.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sumait said 53 people were killed and 164 others from
various nationalities were wounded in removing or detonating the
mines.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society Barjas Al-Barjas
said recently that "the victims of mines in Kuwait amounted to
4,000 civilians, of whom 1,700 died and the injured people was
2,300."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "although we removed most of the mines, we
called upon people to be aware especially in coastal and desert
areas."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait so far has refused to forgive Iraq for the military
incursion with no sign in sight of resuming ties between the two
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Chinese Region Building Five Agricultural Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, which is rich in water, soil, light and heat
resources suitable for farming, is building five production bases
for cotton, grains, livestock, beets, and fruits to increase
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the State decided to help build cotton and grain bases
in Xinjiang by providing more than 10 billion yuan in financing
for the next few years. The region is also taking advantage of
China's westward shift in economic development to promote
agriculture and help narrow the east-west gap in earnings.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has been China's largest cotton producer for years and
produced 940,000 tons of cotton last year, accounting for nearly a
third of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
Last year's grain production was 7.8 billion kg, with
per-head grain output rising from 15th place in the nation
to fifth among China's provinces.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region is one of the country's five largest
grassland areas, and raises the largest number of sheep. This
makes the region the second largest sugar beet grower, after
Heilongjiang in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The region is also home to many kinds of fruit, with an output of
1.16 million tons of fruit last year, three times the nation's per
capita average. The Korla pear and Turfan grapes sell well both in
China and abroad.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's leading medical
academic called for a comprehensive measles vaccination program to
tackle an expected epidemic of the disease next year.
</P>
<P>
Associate Dean of Hong Kong University's Medical Faculty Lau
Yu-long said the outbreak could put 1.3 million children and
teenagers at risk while criticizing the government for lack of
action.
</P>
<P>
Director of Health Chan Fung Fu-chun has called an emergency
meeting of the policy-making Immunization Committee for next
Tuesday, as a 10-year cycle of the disease appears to be reaching
a peak.
</P>
<P>
Today's Hong Kong Standard reported that the last measles
epidemic hit Hong Kong in 1988, infecting 3,162 patients and
killing eight. From January to mid-May this year, 142 cases were
recorded, exceeding the 1996 total of 110 cases.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department's move follows a wave of criticism
against its failure to combat this year's epidemic of German
measles, or rubella, which had infected 2,111 mostly young people
by mid-May, more than double the 892 cases reported for the whole
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, rubella claimed its first life in Hong Kong
with the death of a 16-year-old schoolboy.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Privatize 61 State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
earmarked 61 state-owned enterprises for sale in a bid to speed up
the slow pace of privatization, according to official sources
here.
</P>
<P>
The government statistics showed that only 12 industries were
privatized in the last four year and not a single enterprise was
privatized in the last 11 months.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the newly-appointed Chairman of the
Privatization Board Kazi Zafarullah was dissatisfied with the slow
pace of privatization.
</P>
<P>
"The Privatization Board will act like a shop from now on," the
chairman was quoted by the sources while he was talking with a
group of businessmen recently.
</P>
<P>
The government is selling majority of its shares in nine public
limited companies through the stock market and the government will
get around 2.5 million U.S. dollars this year from the sale, said
Kazi Zafarullah, adding that the board now has the power to sell
industries worth upto 100 million taka (about 2.5 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the government cannot continue to sustain
an annual loss of about 2.5 billion taka (about 625 million
dollars) in the name of subsidy to the state-owned enterprises
(SOEs), said Zafarullah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SOEs are also responsible for the present acute
liquidity crisis in the banks because a lion's portion of bad debt
amounting to 130 billion taka (about 3.25 billion dollars) has
been caused by them, he added.

<P>
PARIS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The result of the second round of the French legislative
elections to be held on Sunday is hard to predict because of the
large number of voters who abstained in the first round and those
wavering between the center-right coalition and the National
Front, plus a close run in the first round between the left
parties and the center-right coalition in many constituencies.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia and Ukraine will sign a treaty of friendship today in
Kiev to mark a historic reconciliation between the two neighboring
countries. The treaty, which will put an end to the dispute
between Moscow and Kiev over the ownership of the Black Sea Fleet,
indicates the intention of President Boris Yeltsin to establish a
peaceful international environment for economic reform in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Two days before the holding of the second round of
legislative elections, all the personnel from the French
center-right coalition have warned voters against the danger of a
cohabitation, or sharing of power, between the right and the
left. They are counting on those who abstained in the first round
of the voting and those who voted for the National Front to
support the center-right coalition in the second round.
</P>
<P>
-- In Afghanistan, the Islamic extremist movement of Taliban
has suffered several setbacks from the troops of Commander Ahmed
Shah Massoud in one week. The soldiers of Massoud are now marching
toward Kabul, while former President Burhanuddin Rabbani has
returned to the country from exile.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Exports Increase Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's exports amounted
to 762 million US Dollars in 1996, an increase of 11.6 percent as
compared to 1995, Minister of State Nassoro Malocho said at the
Finance and Economic Affairs Committee meeting of parliament
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit greatly went down last year as a result of the
increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
He said that exports in 1996 were able to finance 56 percent
of the nation's import bill for that year. "This is an
improvement over the 1995 performance, when exports were able to
finance 49 percent of the nation's import bill," he added.
</P>
<P>
Malocho said in the past, the country's exports managed to
finance hardly a third of the nation's import bill.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a pre-budget briefing session of the committee,
Malocho said that the country registered a modest 4.2 percent
economic growth last year, which is a slight increase over the
1995 growth of 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Minister, however, said the 1996 growth rate is below the
target set at 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the agricultural sector, which accounted for
52.3 percent of the country's Gross domestic Product (GDP) in
1996, grew only 3.9 percent last year as against to 5.8 percent
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Recaptures Strategic Northern Afghan Town: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
claimed to have recaptured Jabul Siraj, a strategic town located
about 77 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Taliban troops led by Ahmad Shah Masood had taken Jabul
Siraj on Friday and were heading toward nearby Charikar, capital
of Parwan province, when the Taliban launched its counter
offensive.
</P>
<P>
The former defense chief in the Rabbani government, Ahmed Shah
Massood, is commanding the anti-Taliban troops, according to
reports reaching here today from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Taliban sources as saying that the student
militia repelled a massive attack by Massood in Jabul Siraj and
the northern Salang highway.
</P>
<P>
Both Massood's troops and the Taliban are reported to have
suffered heavy losses in the heavy fighting during the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban forces are also under heavy attack in
northern Afghanistan, where they are battling opposition forces
who had thrown them out of Mazar-e-Sharif last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Taliban soldiers have reportedly been taken
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday, just
five days after their troops entered the city without facing any
resistance. It was the first time the Taliban were forced out of a
city it had captured.

<P>
HANOI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is likely to record another
ample rice harvest if no abnormal weather affects the
winter-spring crop over the next few weeks, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development predicted
that an estimated 13 million tons of rice could be harvested,
about one million tons more than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is calling on provincial authorities in northern
Vietnam to help farmers gather in their crop grown in the
low-lying fields in time as more rainfalls have been forecast in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in southern Vietnam, who harvested an estimated seven
million tons of paddy from their 1.25 million hectares of
winter-spring crop, have already sown and transplanted more than
1.24 million hectares of summer-autumn rice, with the Mekong River
Delta making up one million hectares.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's 2-day Weekend Decision Creates Mixed Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government's
announcement granting a two-day weekly holiday on Friday and
Saturday has created mixed reactions in Bangladesh, mostly
negative in the business community.
</P>
<P>
The government on Thursday declared Friday and Saturday as
weekly holidays instead of only Friday, with the objective to
"increase efficiency and productivity, save expenditure on account
of fuel and check pollution."
</P>
<P>
However, major trade bodies were critical of the government
decision, claiming that a poor country like Bangladesh could not
economically afford a two-day weekly holiday.
</P>
<P>
"I find no rationality for a two-day weekly holiday in a
country like Bangladesh where productivity is the lowest and which
have a vast pool of unemployed people," said Samson Chowdhury,
president of the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(MCCI).
</P>
<P>
The MCCI president said that there was no consultation with his
chamber before the announcement. "It will be a problem for the
private sector since the number of public holiday in the country
is more than those in America."
</P>
<P>
Mahbub Jamil, president of the Foreign Investors Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (FICCI), shared a similar view. "With the
new decision, we'll be going backward, not forward. We can't
welcome it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The FICCI, which represents the multinational companies doing
business in Bangladesh, was demanding Sunday as weekly holiday as
the business community having international connections often miss
business links with their partners.
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen, including Chairman of the Bangladesh Jute
Association Abdur Razzak, demanded the government to re-fix weekly
holidays on Saturday and Sunday instead of Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In support of their demand, they said that Saturday and Sunday
are being observed as weekly holidays everywhere of the world.
</P>
<P>
"For running our business smoothly and improving our
communications with outside world, Saturday and Sunday should be
declared holidays," they added.

<HEADLINE> PNA Doubts Palestinian-Israeli Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat's advisor Ahmed Tibi said today a
Palestinian-Israeli summit is still in doubt as there is no
apparent progress from Egypt's peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arab radio, he
lauded the Sharm el-Sheikh summit held last Tuesday between
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But he downplayed the possibility of holding a meeting between
Arafat and Netanyahu, something Mubarak hoped to arrange in the
coming weeks after his three-hour talks with the Israeli leader
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tibi reaffirmed only a stop to the Israeli settlement can
kickstart the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We will never accept resumption of negotiations with the
Israelis before freezing settlement activities and bringing
confiscation of Palestinian lands to an end," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks broke down when Israel began
building Har Homa Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in
March. The Palestinians have made their return to the negotiating
table conditional on a halt of Israel's expansionary policy.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu has refused to stop the Har Homa
construction and instead proposed building a neighborhood for
Arabs near the Jewish housing project.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the severity of the two-month-old crisis, clashes
broke out Friday between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in the
West Bank town of Bethlehem. Two were wounded when some 500
hundred Palestinians marched to protest the death of a Palestinian
man in Israeli custody.

<HEADLINE> GCC to Hold Joint Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The six states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) are planning to hold a new round of
military exercises within the next three or four months to boost
their defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
All the GCC members will begin joint war games in August or
September, local daily Gulf News today quoted a senior Bahraini
defense official as saying, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvre follows on the heels of the joint air mock
battles by Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and the
United States which began on May 25.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the new GCC joint military exercises
are aimed at ensuring the defense preparedness and boosting
cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
"We are working closely to ensure peace and security in the
region through various ways such as holding joint military
exercises," the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, the GCC states, namely Bahrain, the
UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman, have sought ways to
strengthen their self-defense capabilities by purchasing advanced
arms, establishing joint armed forces and holding military
exercises to face claimed threats from Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the GCC is still heavily reliant on a large foreign
presence, particularly that of the U.S. and its western allies to
protect their security because of limited human resources.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: ASEAN FMs Unanimous on ASEAN Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today reached a
unanimous decision on the ASEAN expansion by admitting Cambodia,
Laos and Myanmar into the regional grouping in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The historic and unanimous decision by the ASEAN foreign
ministers at their special meeting held here today is turning into
reality the vision of a united Southeast Asia or ASEAN-10
comprising all the countries in the dynamic region. ASEAN
celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who chaired
the special meeting, told a news conference that "it is a
unanimous decision. There were no reservations on the part of any
ASEAN members."
</P>
<P>
It was in the interest of the region that the three countries
were accepted into the fold, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar will be formally admitted into the
regional grouping at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) to be
held here in July.
</P>
<P>
Presently, ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
All the seven members except Brunei were represented at the
special meeting by their foreign ministers while Brunei was
represented by its Ambassador-at-Large Princess Hajjah Masna.
ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided that Abdullah would visit the three
countries to inform them officially of the decision.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether ASEAN, by deciding to admit the three
countries in July, wanted to send a signal that it was not being
pressured, Abdullah said ASEAN had no intention of doing so.
</P>
<P>
"We signal to nobody. We just make a decision of what is good
for ASEAN and what is good for the region. We have no intention to
pass a message to anybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), Abdullah, who is the ASEAN
standing committee chairman, said the three incoming countries
would be given a ten-year period from January 1, 1998 to fulfill
requirements before acceding to it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas broke the
news of the admission date for the incoming ASEAN members to
waiting newsmen outside the meeting room before Abdullah's formal
news conference, saying that it was a good decision.
</P>
<P>
"By having all three enter and becoming part of us, we are
complete now," he said, adding this would place ASEAN in a better
position to contribute to regional peace and stability as well as
a larger East Asia region.

felt that it was better to have the three countries into ASEAN
now.

Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said the decision
to accept Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar in July was because of their
readiness and the fact that they have met the requirements.
</P>
<P>
He said the dream and vision of the ASEAN founding fathers will
be realized through the admission of the last three countries.

the decision was a consensus and Brunei looked forward to the

<HEADLINE> Beijing Education Authority Names 1,000 "Smoke-Free" Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- About one third of Beijing's
primary and middle schools have been designated as "Smoke-Free
Schools" because of their successful work to prevent teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
The number of such schools increased to 1,000 from 106 in the
past year with the implementation of a local regulation on banning
smoking in public places, an official of the Beijing Municipal
Education Commission said today.
</P>
<P>
Through various means, the schools have urged students not to
smoke, not to sell or buy cigarettes, to tell their families to
stop smoking or smoke less, and to discourage people from smoking
in public places, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese health experts and officials hold that tight control of
teenage smoking is vital to China's anti-tobacco campaign. As a
nation, China is a big tobacco producer and consumer with some 350
million smokers and more than 400 million passive smokers.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that without strict measures, there may be 200
million teenage smokers by the year 2000, and 50 million of them
may die from tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Chinese health departments are launching a national
anti-smoking drive today, the 10th World No-Tobacco Day.

<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) states yesterday
categorically denied a proposal by the U.N. general assembly to
have two categories of permanent members to the Security Council
-- some with veto powers and others without.
</P>
<P>
The ministers attending 66th session of OAU Council of
Ministers meeting here agreed to reccommend to the heads of state
and government meeting next week for the OAU summit to adopt a
Harare declaration which clearly spelt out Africa's position on
the proposed restructuring of the U.N. Security Council, said
chairman of the meeting and Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
The declaration would be a marriage of proposals the heads of
state agreed on in 1994 in Tunis and the position taken by the
African foreign ministers meeting just as that taken at the
Non-Aligned Movement meeting in New Delhi early this year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Africa wants the Security Council expanded to 26 and is
demanding two permanent seats in the council.
</P>
<P>
There was unanimous agreement that the OAU and the U.N. should

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Indonesia Sign Pact on Island Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Indonesia have
signed an agreement formally submitting an island dispute to the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague, the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here today by Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and his Indonesian counterpart Ali
Alatas who is here to attend a one-day special meeting of the
ASEAN foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said in a statement that this "represents a very
historic occasion in the bilateral relations between our two
countries" when the two sides agreed to refer to the ICJ their
claims over the islands of Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan in the
overlapping area of continental shelves that border the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said leaders of both countries have expressed the wish that
this issue should be resolved peacefully through negotiations so
as not to impede the existing "excellent bilateral relations".
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian foreign minister said in a separate statement on
the occasion that "it is to the mutual interest of our two
countries that the case of Pulau Sipadan and Ligitan be settled
peacefully through an adjudication process in the ICJ at the
earliest possible time."
</P>
<P>
The two ministers were of the view that the decision to submit
the case to the ICJ for a final settlement would prevent the issue
from becoming a burden to future generations of both countries
with an unresolved dispute.
</P>
<P>
They said that the two countries would accept the judgment that
will be delivered by the ICJ at the Hague, the Netherlands, as
final and binding.
</P>
<P>
Both of them also hoped that a final and lasting resolution of
the issue would be a major contribution towards the maintenance of
peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Indonesia agreed last October to take the case to
the Hague after years of talks failed to reach a bilateral
solution.

<HEADLINE> African States to Bust Security Council Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- African countries decided
to bust the U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed on Libya and
have mandated the secretary-general of the Organisation of
African Unity (OAU) to start preparing a plan of action to spare
the Libyan people from further suffering as a result of the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
The 66th session of the OAU Council of Ministers meeting
yesterday recommended that the OAU heads of state and government
adopt sanctions busting only if the Security Council did not
accept one of the proposals adopted jointly by the League of Arab
States and supported by the Non-Aligned Movedment.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said, ''This has become imperative more so as
the sanctions are having an increasing devastating effect on the
people of Libya, as well as on the country's economy.''
</P>
<P>
The ministers strongly deplored the fact that the U.S. and
Britain had shown indifference to the intiatives presented to
them with the views to obtain a just and equitable solution to
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers unanimously agreed that OAU heads of state and
government should make an appeal to the international community
and the Security Council to envisage as a prelude to the lifting
of the sanctions provisions for exempting from the embargo
flights for humanitarian and religious purposes.
</P>
<P>
Libya has suffered economically losing billions of dollars
because of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Bonn's Gold Revaluation Plan Raises Doubt About Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Germany's plan to revalue the
country's central bank's gold reserves has hit unprecedented
repercussions both at home and abroad and raised doubt about the
future of the single European currency only 18 months before its
scheduled launching.
</P>
<P>
Designed as a quick fund-raising measure to ease Germany's debt
burden and to help the nation to qualify for the planned single
currency, the Euro, the plan has been widely criticized as a
trickery which would eventually undermine the Euro.
</P>
<P>
For historical reasons, gold reserves of the German central
bank, the Bundesbank, have been undervalued.
</P>
<P>
Under the revaluation plan, Bonn wants the Bundesbank to boost
its reserves to 60 percent of market value instead of the current
25 percent, a move which would force the bank to pay more dividend
to the government and thus help bring Germany's public debts under
60 percent of the gross domestic product, a key requirement for
qualification for the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Controversies over the plan hit the headlines across Europe
after the Bundesbank issued a strongly-worded statement Wednesday,
saying that the revaluation infringed the central bank's
independence and violated the spirit of the European Union
Maastricht treaty.
</P>
<P>
The move would also risk "a loss in the trust of stability of
the future European currency," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Undaunted by the warning, Bonn still vows to press ahead with
its plan by passing a legislation in parliament to pave the way
for the revaluation.
</P>
<P>
The quarrel with the Bundesbank dramatized Germany's current
financial difficulties against a backdrop of nearly record
unemployment and an expected shortfall of 18 billion mark (about
10.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the budget for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Although it still boasts the most important economy and
strongest currency in Europe, Germany is now in the embarrassing
position of not being able to meet the stringent standards it
insisted that all participants in the Euro meet, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Germany has long opposed any quick-fix accounting solutions to
meet the Euro requirements, aiming most of its attacks at Italy
and France.
</P>
<P>
By announcing the plan to revalue the Bundesbank's reserves,
Germany was losing the authorities to police other EU nations'
fiscal policies in order to safeguard stability of the Euro,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, the open conflict between the government
and the Bundesbank also threatens to diminish acceptance of the
Euro among the German people.
</P>
<P>
For the Germans, the Bundesbank stands for reasonable banking
policy and therefore is the model for the planned European central
bank. The bank's independence is held by many Germans as their
ultimate defense against the nightmare of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The reason why a majority of German citizens remain mistrustful
of the Euro is that its creation would mean trading their
traditionally hard mark for an unpredictable Euro.
</P>
<P>
If the government fails to summon up enough confidence in the
Euro, it would face a hard test in the next general election
scheduled for autumn next year.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Official Criticises Aid Reduction to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- An official of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) said on Friday the agency is concerned
with the reduction in aid to Africa, a situation which is
compromising development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
UNDP Director of External Relations Edward Omotoso said despite
convictions by some sections of the international community, Africa
still needs support for its development.
</P>
<P>
''There is a dangerous trend to say that many of the things should
be given to the private sector, then economic growth will be
realised, Africa still needs development aid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Western donors have dictated that the continent should develop its
private sector which has been identified as the engine for growth.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP is allocating a third of its budget into projects
involving good governance.
</P>
<P>
''We want to encourage good governance, democracy, openness,
transparency and improvement of the civil service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable human development through poverty eradication,
economic growth and environmental regeneration are some of the
projects of the UNDP.

<HEADLINE> One Israeli Soldier Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was killed
late Friday in a mortar attack by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
forces in South Lebanon, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The soldier, whose name was not released for publication,
suffered serious injuries in the attack in the central sector of
the Israeli-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon. He died at
hospital later.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops retaliated by returning fire at Hezbollah
positions, and there was heavy exchange of fire in the area. No
Hezbollah casualties were reported, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah issued a statement claiming responsibility for the
Friday attack, but it strongly denied Israeli reports that two
Hezbollah gunmen were killed Thursday by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident signaled the continuation of recent wave
of fighting in the 1,100-square-kilometer zone, which was set up
by Israel in 1985 to protect its northern border from
cross-border attack by Hezbollah forces.
</P>
<P>
During the past weeks, there has been nearly daily exchange of
fires between Israeli troops and the Hezbollah forces.
</P>
<P>
On May 17, three Israeli soldiers and two Hezbollah gunmen
were killed in an ambush by Hezbollah forces in north of the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that Hezbollah leaders recently had met with
Iran's Ambassador to Lebanon to discuss the victory of moderate
cleric Mohammed Khatami in Iran's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli observers predicted that there would be little
effect of the Iran's elections on its continued support to
Hezbollah.

<P>
BEIRUT, May 31 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli officer was killed
Friday night in an attack by guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone" in south Lebanon, security sources said this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas announced that they launched the attack
at an Israeli foot patrol on the road between the villages of
Markaba and Rob Thalathin, "killing and wounding a number of
Israeli soldiers."
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman confirmed that one Israeli officer
died from serious wound inflicted in the guerrilla attack Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the Islamic Resistance, the
military wing of Hezbollah, said its fighters used machineguns and
rocket-propelled grenades in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas launched today another attack on the
Israeli position of Sujoud in the northern sector of the buffer
zone at 5:30 a.m. (0230 GMT), the Shiite militant organization
said in a second statement, noting more Israeli casualties were
caused.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the attack, Israeli artillery fire more
than 30 heavy shells at villages opposite the border strip
without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
However, security sources said that the fightings did not go
beyond daily trades of fire between Lebanese guerrillas and
Israeli occupation forces on the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Since this year, nine Israeli soldiers have been killed and
more than 40 others wounded in clashes with Hezbollah, which
spearheads a guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon to oust the
Israeli troops out of the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect northern
Israel from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Seeks More Textile, Garment Export Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 31 (xinhua) -- Vietnam's textile and garment
enterprises are searching for more non-quota export markets,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The export of textiles and garments under quota to the European
Union (EU) market is estimated to reach 250 million U.S. dollars
in the first half of this year, accounting for more than 50
percent of the yearly export plan.
</P>
<P>
The implementation export quotas increased by 1.5 times
compared with the same period last year, which means that
enterprises in the textile and garment industry will meet
difficulties in ensuring jobs for their staff in the second half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's production capacity has grown several times higher
than the annual increase of quota exports to the EU market while
the non-quota exports of textiles and garments to Japan and South
Korea have also reduced, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises, which are actively diversifying their
products, improving quality, and looking for non-quota markets,
have been warned to be careful when developing new investment
projects to keep production capacity in line with the market
demand, without solely relying on the EU market five-year export
quota agreement, which only provides an annual increase of 1 or
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The textile and garment firms also plan to boost production of
goods for domestic consumption ensuring jobs for their workers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OAU Committed to Stability, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Zongya)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The 33rd summit of the
Organization of African Unity to be held in Harare on June 2-4
will focus its discussions on political stability and the
pressing task of economic development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that Africa suffers from many ills and
misfortunes, ranging from poverty, underdevelopment to the
tragedies arising from natural and man-made disasters.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been compounded by various conflicts that
have torn apart many of African countries, bleeding African
people and undermining their efforts at socio-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Conscious of the fact that meaningful development of Africa
will remain elusive as long as instability and insecurity prevail
in the poor continent, the OAU has decided to address the scourge
of conflicts as a priority on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the 1990s, the OAU has concentrated its
efforts on promoting peace, security and stability in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
So far, the OAU has been involved directly or indirectly in
peace efforts aimed at resolving conflicts in many African
countries, such as Liberia, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Burundi,
Rwanda and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Central Organ of the Mechanism for Conflicts
Prevention, Management and Resolution, set up in 1993,
has been playing a major role in these peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The OAU's growing efforts to monitor and mediate disputes are
paying off. In recent years, the OAU's quiet diplomacy has helped
keep democracy on track in Congo and Comoros. It has broken
ground in sending military observers to Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The OAU has also managed to defuse the crisis which emerged in
the Comoros following the mercenary-led coup in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the OAU has tried its best to seek a negotiated
settlement to the Zaire conflict, which started in October last
year.
</P>
<P>
The OAU and the United Nations have jointly proposed a
five-point peace plan on the Zaire crisis and appointed a special
envoy, Mohamed Sahnoun, to mediate between the then Zairean
government of President Mobutu Sese Seko and the rebels led by
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the OAU central organ held in Lome,
capital of Togo, a special summit on the Zaire crisis, which for
the first time brought a face-to-face meeting between the two
sides of Zaire and opened channels for their direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides did not reach consensus at the summit,
the OAU's peace efforts have contributed a lot to avoiding a
bloodbath in Zaire's capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming OAU summit will also discuss the situation in
the Great Lakes region, especially in Zaire, which is now renamed
the Democratic Republic of Congo with Kabila as its president.

</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Ironically, millions of people in
Africa, one of the potentially richest continents in the world,
are living in the conditions of squalor and abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, economic development and integration of the African
continent also constitute a challenge and priority to the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Just as Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge put it on May
14 this year, "Pan-Africanism has triumphed, we have triumphed on
the political front and now we are on the economic war front."
</P>
<P>
In 1991, leaders of OAU member states held a meeting in Abuja
of Nigeria and adopted a treaty establishing the African Economic
Community.
</P>
<P>
The treaty provides for a framework for the gradual
establishment of the African Economic Community culminating in
the free movement of people and goods and the creation of
continental institutions such as the African Parliament and the
African Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
During the initial stage of implementation of the treaty, the
OAU has laid its emphasis on strengthening the regional economic
communities which constitute the building blocks of the African
Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Some regional economic groupings like the Southern African
Development Community and the Economic Community of West African
States have already made significant progress.
</P>
<P>
Parallel to the integration efforts, the OAU countries have
been conducting bold economic and structural reforms aimed at
improving the performance and efficiency of the African
economies.
</P>
<P>
As political stability has been gradually consolidated in most
of African states in recent years, their economic performance is
becoming better and better.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA), the continent's economy increased by
3.96 percent in 1996, the highest since the start of the current
decade.
</P>
<P>
On the general situation in Africa, there is no doubt that
Africa is moving on the right path, said OAU Secretary General
Salim Ahmed Salim in a statement on the occasion of the 34th
anniversary of the OAU Day which falls on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Though Africa continues to be faced with the scourge of
conflicts, poverty, illiteracy, diseases and a large number of
refugees, Salim stressed that the African people have the capacity,
the will and determination to forge ahead to an era of peace and
development.

<HEADLINE> Thai Police Step up Drug Crackdown in Border Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Thai police in the country's
northernmost province of Chiang Rai, part of the drug-producing
"golden triangle", have stepped up drug trafficking crackdown this
year.
</P>
<P>
To combat the spread of illicit drugs, 24 police checkpoints
have been set up this year to block the transit routes of drugs in
the province.
</P>
<P>
In addition, on-line computerized systems have also been
installed in every police station to provide information about
identities of suspected drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
As a result, in the first five months this year, police
arrested 326 drug suspects in districts along the border and
confiscated more than 600,000 amphetamine tablets, as compared
with the 413 arrests and 1.05 million tablets for the whole of
1996, according to local police.
</P>
<P>
Amphetamine production plants are mostly located along the
Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Laotian border areas, known as the "golden
triangle".
</P>
<P>
Police Maj.-Gen. Sunthorn Bunchiang, commander of Chiang Rai
Police, said rooting out drugs was not easy, as very often only
the local drivers of pick-up trucks and vans which were carrying
drugs were arrested. Major suppliers who hired the drivers are
hard to get.
</P>
<P>
Amphetamine tablets are in particular easy to be smuggled into
Thailand from Myanmar as the border river is very shallow.

<P>
SINTRA, Portugal, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Peace
Implementation Council (PIC) harshly criticized Bosnia's
three-person presidency here today, and called on it to fully
implement the Dayton Peace Accords.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that proper implementation was regarded as one
of the important conditions for getting international aid.
</P>
<P>
The help Bosnia will receive from the international community
will be dependent on the commitment it demonstrates to the peace
agreement, representatives attending PIC organized meeting said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting cited the failure to capture war criminals and help
refugees return to their homes, as among the tripartite's failures
to meet the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
The PIC has set specific target dates by which the Bosnians
will have to meet concrete objectives or face penalties.
</P>
<P>
The PIC announced that a donors' conference will be held on
June 24 in Brussels in hopes of raising l.4 billion U.S. dollars
for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also appointed Carlos Westendorp, Spain's
ambassador to the United Nations, as top civilian envoy in Bosnia
to replace former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who will
return to Sweden next month.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM: Nepal, Bhutan Should Talk Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral has reiterated his country's position that the Bhutanese
refugee problem in Nepal could only be sorted out bilaterally, the
local press here said today.
</P>
<P>
Gujral, while meeting with a visiting Nepali journalists
delegation in New Delhi Friday, said that both Nepal and Bhutan
are sovereign nations and they should solve the refugee problem
bilaterally.
</P>
<P>
"Third party intervention in any other's affairs is dangerous,"
the Indian prime minister reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has always refused Nepal's demand for its
mediation for the solution of the lingering Bhutanese refugee
problem in Nepal. India handles foreign and defense affairs for
Bhutan under a bilateral treaty.
</P>
<P>
Around 100,000 Bhutanese, mostly of Nepalese origin, have been
living in eight refugee camps in eastern Nepal since 1990 when
they fled to Nepal via Indian territory forcibly under Bhutanese
authorities' ethnic cleansing policy, Nepali officials said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, seven rounds of bilateral talks at the ministerial
level between the two Himalayan nations made no progress in the
settlement of the controversial issue as Bhutan maintained that
many of the refugees were not genuine Bhutanese citizens and
refused their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Gujral is expected to arrive here next
Thursday on a three-day goodwill visit to Nepal.

JAKARTA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- An election supervisory committee
official in East Java, Indonesia, said voting at 67 polling
stations in Sampang on the Island of Madura, would be repeated,
official Antara News agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The repeat voting will be done on June 4 or 5 as vote counting
has to be completed by June 6, Secretary of the East Java Election
Supervisory Committee Soerjadi Setiawan said Friday in Suarabaya,
the second largest city in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The repetition of the voting is done following riots in Sampang
 Thursday when the general election was held across the country.
The riots caused several ballot boxes missing from the Dedungdung
sub-district before the votes were counted.
</P>

He said reserved ballot boxes totaling some 3,000 in East Java
would be used for the repeat voting.
</P>

preliminary election results gave the ruling Golkar group an
overwhelming lead.
</P>
<P>
The worst incident occurred at 16:00 local time Thursday and
lasted until 18:00 on Madura Island, located off the north coast
of East Java, Antara said.

<P>
Thousands of angry residents in the capital of Sampang went on
the rampage, burning down two government offices, the local police
headquarters, the regional Golkar office, banks and shops, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The trouble started when locals demanded a recount after being
told of Golkar's huge lead over the United Development Party
(PPP).
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported in the incident, but police
admitted that scores were injured. Seven of them suffered shot
wounds.
</P>
<P>
Police said 24 people have been arrested for their alleged
involvement in the violence and investigation is still under way.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisional results, Golkar had won 74.16
percent of the votes counted up to 11:19 p.m. Friday, the PPP
gained 22.84 percent and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
clinched 3 percent of the 107,613,316 votes counted.
</P>
<P>
A total of 124,741,987 people were eligible to vote in
Thursday's election to elect 425 members of the 500-seat House of
Representatives, as well as members of provincial and
district/municipal councils.

a landslide victory will not be affected by the final result of
the counting which will be released later.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM to Visit Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
will fly to Tirana on Sunday for a round of political talks with
Albanian leaders and a visit to the Italian military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Italian officials here said that Prodi will meet Albanian
President Sali Berisha and Prime Minister Bashkim Fino, and
General Luciano Forlani, who commands the Italian-led
multinational protection force (MPF) in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, the major driving force of the MPF, decided to visit
Albania following a series of violent incidents in the troubled
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night the arrival of an Italian helicopter, which
came to evacuate a 14-year-old girl wounded in the head when she
and her brother were playing with a pistol, in the rebel-held
southern port of Vlore, provoked a massive outburst of automatic
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
But Vlore Salvation Committee deputy leader Dashmir Beja denied
today that the shooting was aimed at the Italian troops. He said
many people thought it was Berisha's forces trying to storm the
port, because it was the first time that a helicopter had arrived
at night.
</P>
<P>
In daytime on Thursday, armed men held up a group of Italian
election monitors trying to travel from Tirana to the town of
Gjirokaster to advise on election procedures. The monitors were
sent back at a road block.
</P>
<P>
General elections are due on June 29 in Albania, which was
gripped by violence following the failure of investment schemes in
March. The MPF has the role of trying to create a relatively
peaceful atmosphere for the poll.

<HEADLINE> Nations Target Rural Health Care in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan will further expand
co-operation on projects which combine rural family planning with
mother and child health care, parasite control and community
development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councillor Peng Peiyun yesterday expressed her
thanks to the Japanese Organization for International Co-operation
in Family Planning (JOICFP) which has supported Chinese family
planning work since 1984, and hoped this friendship and
co-operation will be developed further in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Peng, who is also minister in charge of the State Family
Planning Commission (SFPC), made the remarks yesterday afternoon
during her meeting with JOICFP leaders and experts at the
Diaoyutai State Guest House in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
JOICFP President Sawaki Masao also expressed readiness to
continue and expand co-operation with the Chinese Government and
non-governmental organizations in family planning.
</P>
<P>
JOICFP has consistently attached great significance to
Sino-Japanese co-operation in population, family planning and
health care, said the JOICFP leader, adding his organization will
contribute more for such collaborations.
</P>
<P>
China started its first JOICFP-supported program in 1984. So
far, more than two million rural residents in 26 counties of 22
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have been
involved, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Chinese technicians are being specially trained in
implementation methods. Special offices have been established in
each of the pilot counties and townships to supervise the work.
</P>
<P>
The so-called integrated projects helped mobilize the community
to improve environmental sanitation and establish safe drinking
water sources.
</P>
<P>
It also trained farmers in money-making activities such as
animal raising and vegetable growing. As a result, living
standards improved, the rates of parasitic infection declined and
the birth rate dropped in integrated project pilot areas.

<HEADLINE> "Sports Without Smoke" Campaign Launched in Uruguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The "Sports Without Smoke"
campaign was launched today in Uruguay on occasion of the World
Day Without Smoking.
</P>
<P>
The campaign exhorts people who practice sports to abandon the
tobacco habit, to give an example to the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was started by the Health Ministry, the
Panamerican Health Organization (OPS), and the Uruguayan
Anti-Smoking Commission (CATU), which will offer a free treatment
"to the most outstanding Uruguayan soccer players" who want to
abandon the habit.
</P>
<P>
A similar campaign was started a month ago when the same
organizations opened a registry for newsmen who wanted to take the
treatment.
</P>
<P>
OPS spokesman Dr. Ricardo Benedetti said "we cannot offer the
treatment free to all smokers because it would be very costly,"
but he explained that "we chose newsmen and now soccer players
because we thought they have to give the example to society."
</P>
<P>
Sports medicine specialist Maria Emilia Alvarez said that "the
modern concept of health is not only the psyco-physical and social
wellbeing, but also the full development of human potential, and
to achieve that health and sports go hand in hand."
</P>
<P>
Almost 35 percent of the Uruguayan population smoke, and from
this percentage 45 percent are women, almost twice the habitual
average of women who smoke in Western countries.

<HEADLINE> US Says Russia Won't Take Measures Against NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States believes that
Russia will not take any "countermeasures" against the expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a senior U.S.
defense official told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at the Pentagon, Assistant
Secretary of Defense Franklin D. Kramer said that he anticipated
the U.S.-Russian relations "will be good" despite differences
between them on NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"There were discussions by various individuals in Russia about
the motions of countermeasures, but the government has never
indicated to do that," Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
"And the reality is that what the Russian government has done
is that it signed the Founding Act," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member NATO and Russia signed the document in Paris
earlier this week for future cooperation. But Moscow is still
strongly opposed to the alliance's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"We don't anticipate any `countermeasures' (from Russia),"
Kramer noted. "What we do anticipate is to work closely with the
Russians on matters of mutual security."
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that neither NATO nor the U.S. sees Russia as
a potential enemy. Moscow insisted that NATO's enlargement will
bring the alliance's front-line to its doorstep, threatening its
national security.
</P>
<P>
"NATO enlargement is a part of an overall process of a
transformation of European security in the post-Cold War period,"
Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the enlargement, the process also includes issues like
the new Founding Act, NATO's own internal transformation and the
Partnership for Peace program involving 27 countries, Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
"Fundamental reasons for all these activities are to enhance,
reserve the stability and security in Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders will meet in July in Madrid to choose which
countries should be accepted in the first wave of expansion.
Kramer noted that the difficulty that is facing the alliance is to
choose whom.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. has not publicly stated which countries should
join first, U.S. officials said that the Clinton administration
favors a smaller group of countries, like Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
France and other southern European NATO members have indicated
that they would like to see Romania and Slovenia to be in the
first wave.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Mostly Up on European Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar overcame weakness
from an early stock-market selloff today, rising against most
European currencies.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled in New York at its highest weekly closing
level in four weeks against the mark and highest weekly close in
three weeks against the yen.
</P>
<P>
In New York, it settled at 1.7063 marks, up from 1.6966 marks

116.22 yen, down from 116.28 yen Thursday. The pound cost 1.6410
U.S. dollars, up from 1.6404 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Traders said news from the Commerce Department that the economy
grew at a 5.8 percent rate in the first quarter of the year,
higher than expectation, suggesting that interest rates in the
United States could rise. Higher rates would strengthen dollar.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Thursday:
1.4129 Swiss francs, up from 1.4103; 5.7595 French francs, up from
