EDITORIAL: BAD TAX CUTS INSIDE GOOD BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 12:
</P>
<P>
   Congress is trying to push through unfair, damaging tax
provisions by attaching them to two popular bills, one designed to
raise the minimum wage, the other to protect patients in managed
care. The bills have passed both Senate and House and are headed
for conference. None of the tax provisions deserve to survive.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the patients' bill of rights legislation for
managed-care plans, the Republicans attached a provision to create
a universal right to put tax-free money into medical savings
accounts. Individuals would first have to purchase a
high-deductible insurance policy that would cover medical bills
only after they exceed a large annual amount, say $3,000. The
tax-free medical savings account would cover the costs under
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because the accounts are expected to appeal to people who can
afford to make large tax-free deposits, the provision amounts to a
large tax cut for wealthy savers. Worse, medical savings accounts
that are available to everyone would also hurt the chronically ill.
Catastrophic policies attract people who do not expect to run up
many medical bills and therefore can expect the money they deposit
into the medical savings accounts to accumulate on a tax-free
basis. But that leaves less healthy people to buy ordinary medical
insurance, driving up the premiums for such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems afflict ill-designed tax provisions that were
attached to minimum-wage legislation. These would raise the amounts
that highly paid workers can put into tax-deductible pension
accounts, giving wealthy employees a big tax break.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bills, the maximum pension contribution would rise
from $30,000 to $40,000, a break that only the top tier of
executives could afford. The maximum payout from defined-benefit
plans upon retirement would rise from $135,000 to $160,000, another
break only the wealthy could tap. Current law permits companies to
provide tax-deductible pensions only if they extend comparable
percentage contributions to low-paid workers. But under the House
and Senate bills, these protections for low-income workers would be
weakened. Pension experts warn that the pension provisions taken in
their entirety could encourage companies to reduce the pension
payments they now make on behalf of low- and moderate-income
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The unfairness of the tax provisions would be reason enough to
reject them. The threat to insurance premiums and the pension
rights of low-paid workers makes them truly offensive.

THERE'S NO MAGIC LEFT IN STARS-OILERS SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Cary Grant would have put it, they've got to stop meeting
like this.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and the Edmonton Oilers have got to. They're no good
for one another.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, they break each other's heart. Invariably, one of
them walks away and sends the other one home.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have to be this way this time, though. The Stars and
Oilers, it has been roundly reported, figured they were finished
with one another. Splitsville. Nothing was going to be left but the
memories, the frequent-flier miles and a few R-rated Ron Low
quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton thought its NHL playoff destiny rested in St. Louis.
The Blues have the league's most imposing record, but what the hey
_ at least they weren't the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, on the other hand, once seemed resigned to the fact
that they would open their Stanley Cup playoff defense against the
worrisome San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Call it destiny. Call them cousins. Call me when it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there could have been more electric first-round
matchups. The typical Stars fan has only a vague recollection that
Edmonton was once the epicenter of the NHL universe. They have no
idea how passionate the kind people of Edmonton are about their
Oilers. They've never seen the giant banners _ the young Wayne
Gretzky, two stories tall _ hanging from the Edmonton rafters.
</P>
<P>
   The one flashpoint that could have really ignited the rivalry _
Bryan Marchment, the cowardly thug _ was traded away.
</P>
<P>
   You call this electricity? For the four meetings between the
teams this season, the Stars totaled nine goals and the Oilers
scored six, which means the average score was something like 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a reminder, we're talking hockey here, not curling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our hockey club comes out and plays the way we can play,''
said Oilers winger Todd Marchant, ``we're capable of beating the
Dallas Stars, and I think they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, whatever, but few teams over the past two postseasons have
been able to come out and dictate the script against coach Ken
Hitchcock's Stars. On the contrary, it's been the defending champs
who have shown a penchant for dragging the game down to their
level.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose would have confronted the Stars with somewhat younger
legs, combined with conspicuously less conscience. It loomed as a
much more physical series. And there would have been that
Marchment, watch-your-kneecaps factor.
</P>
<P>
   But lest anyone from Edmonton think that the Stars had written
them off, consider that general manager Bob Gainey himself scouted
the Oilers during the season's final week.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw was apparently a desperate hockey team, trying to
salvage a roller-coaster season, forced to earn its playoff ticket
on the road. The Oilers did so by winning a 5-4 overtime crapshoot
in Vancouver, knocking the Canucks out.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most confident I've felt in the time I've been in
Edmonton,'' center and team leader Doug Weight said. ``I feel
really confident with our game plan, with the coaching and with the
guys we're putting on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to give Dallas a good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there is some history here. Since Marchant muted the
Reunion Arena crowd with his series-deciding overtime goal three
years ago, the Oilers have beaten the Stars exactly two of 21
times.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton goaltender Tommy Salo, moreover, is 0-7-1 lifetime
against the Stars and a dank 0-4 against them in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if it comes down to the goalies _ and don't all NHL
playoff series, sooner or later, come down to the goalies? _ the
Stars and Ed Belfour figure to have a significant edge. Weight
dismissed that yesterday by suggesting that it was the other 18
guys who are going to have to outplay Belfour, not Salo.
</P>
<P>
   Well, whatever, but there is a feeling here that under new coach
Kevin Lowe and with their pulse-rousing finish, the Oilers might
have peaked emotionally one weekend too soon. The Stars, on the
other hand, have been waiting for this night, this first night of
the postseason, since October.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it looked as if it would never get here. How fitting
that the Oilers, who indirectly launched last year's magical Stars
run, are back to audition for the role again.
</P>
<P>
   You guys have got to stop meeting like this. Really.

Stars need Stanley Cup sequel equal to last year's production 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Yes, critics and audiences alike raved over the Stars'
first Stanley Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Everything fans could possibly want, Dallas' 23-game, eight-week
playoff pursuit of Lord Stanley's Cup provided. Action. Emotion.
Suspense. Controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, from the same people who brought you The Cup, comes The Cup
2: Return to Paradise. Bigger. Better. Bolder. And Uncut.
</P>
<P>
   And it's opening Wednesday at an arena near you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big fan of sequels,'' Stars leading man Joe
Nieuwendyk admitted. ``Do you ever think sequels are as good as the
original? Neither do I.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has Caddyshack II. Hockey has the 1996 New Jersey
Devils. Both sequels bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Seems creating a sequel worthy of the original is more difficult
than finding redeeming value in ``Major League II'' If Hollywood
finds it hard to produce a good sequel, imagine sports guys trying
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say a good sequel can't be done.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 Pittsburgh Penguins did it. So did the 1998 Detroit Red
Wings. Hey, lots of folks say ``The Godfather II'' was better than
``The Godfather''. So, it has been done. But, there are rules. It's
the Stars job to observe the rules of the sports sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1 _ The expectations are bigger, way bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock opened a door for a sequel in June
when he stood before a packed Reunion Arena crowd, Cup in tow,
saying: ``As long as we got one of these, why not make it two.
Hell, let's make it three.''
</P>
<P>
   Roll credits. End of season. Audience eagerly anticipates No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   So, for two short vacation months and one interminable regular
season, they waited for tonight. The premiere.
</P>
<P>
   While the original was about finally shaking the specter of
never having won a Stanley Cup, the sequel is about surviving the
expectations created when they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, you don't have: `You haven't done this or you
only got this far or you only did this,' '' Hitchcock said. ``We're
only carrying the expectations of wanting to win again.''
</P>
<P>
   Only trailers from this season have teased to a Stars bunch
riddled with injuries, steadied by sheer will, besieged by slumps
only to be buoyed by play from Derian Hatcher, Ed Belfour and Mike
Modano.
</P>
<P>
   And reviews have been equally mixed. Based on the regular-season
trailer, the Stars certainly aren't the favorite to do it again.
St. Louis, Detroit and Colorado all grabbed critics and audiences
attention _ the Blues by winning the Presidents' Trophy, the Red
Wings by being themselves and the Avalanche by bringing in
defenseman Ray Bourque and his power-play prowess from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems like we're not the favorite again this year
to win it,'' Stars forward Guy Carbonneau said. ``What we have to
guard against is \Rthe idea that\S because it went well last year,
we just have to show up and do it again. We have to start at
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Only their hard core audience expects the heroes to pick up
where they left off. You see the problem with the sequel isn't that
it isn't as good, but instead that it has something to be compared
to.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams in the last 12 seasons have been able to make a
sequel as good as the original.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars felt a Stanley-Cup-or-bust pressure last season
because of a Presidents' Trophy, home-ice advantage and signees
such as Brett Hull. They delivered. Now, they have to make a second
one as good as the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``However difficult it is, however successful it is,'' Stars
general manager Bob Gainey said, it will be different than last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 2 _ The games are always much more elaborate, much more
intense, with longer overtimes and more scoring. Your core audience
expects it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hull scored his Cup-clinching goal in not the first, not the
second but the third overtime in Game 6. Don't be surprised if it
takes them four overtimes and a Game 7 this time.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anybody who has actually been in a sports sequel, and
they'll tell you the second one is much harder to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the playoffs start, you are the favorite,'' Red Wings
defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom said. ``I found it pretty tough that
second time around, when the playoffs started. Once the playoffs
started, you knew that you were nearing the end of the line towards
winning the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we got past that first round, you're just eager to get
going and win some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the plot thickens right there. The Western Conference
lends itself to more elaborate scenes because there are so many
tough teams with not a lot separating them.
</P>
<P>
   The villain standing in the way of the Stars as they try to get
out of the first round is a familiar one, the Edmonton Oilers. The
Stars and Oilers have met in the playoffs for four consecutive
years, three of those meetings coming in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   And it only gets harder. The Stars have a likely second-round
date with Colorado. If the Stars get past the Avalanche, the Blues
or Red Wings are likely to be waiting in the Western Conference
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, there is two teams on one side better than any one team
on the other side,'' San Jose coach Darryl Sutter said. ``Dallas
and Detroit are two great hockey clubs, and, unfortunately, one is
not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 3 _ If you want your sequel to be a franchise, never, ever
repeat the same story. You have to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply is why most sequels aren't as good as the
originals, Stars winger Grant Marshall says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the excitement of the original,'' he said. ``Whenever you
see the sequel, you are going to get the same thing but different.
The first ``Austin Powers'' was awesome. No. 2 was great, but you
know it's the same comedy, same drama.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars can't expect anything to happen exactly like it did in
the original.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk isn't likely to score 11 goals. He could score less.
He could score more. Belfour isn't likely to have a personal-best
1.67 goals-against average. He could go lower. He could go higher.
</P>
<P>
   No, the feat of repeating isn't for your Nick-at-Night rerun
types.
</P>
<P>
   The repeaters need to break some new ground.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, Nieuwendyk and Belfour carrying the team to a Cup?
Forget it. That's been done.
</P>
<P>
   Who else do they have?
</P>
<P>
   The cast has grown to include a promising rookie, Brenden
Morrow, a winger in need of a second chance, Scott Thornton, and a
winger desperately craving another chance at a Cup, Kirk Muller.
They join audience favorites such as Nieuwendyk and Hull and Modano
and Belfour and Hatcher and ...
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, we've got a hell of a team,'' Morrow said. ``We're
going to make a good sequel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 4 _ Be sure to have a
``This-could-be-the-start-of-a-beautiful-friendship''-like
ending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``''Empire Strikes Back,'''' Stars captain Derian Hatcher
responded when asked to name a sequel that surpassed an original.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't worry about making it better,'' Hatcher continued.
``What's the difference, if you win? It should be just as good if
you win.''

RANGERS PLAYERS IRKED BY YANKEES' EARLY DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outfielder Gabe Kapler walked into the Rangers'
clubhouse here yesterday and said aloud what was on most of his
teammates' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have played today, real easy,'' Kapler said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't play yesterday because of the New York
Yankees' decision on Monday to postpone their home opener until
today. The Yankees were concerned about weather forecasts that
called for a 90 percent chance of rain and possible snow.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers weren't happy that the decision to postpone the game
was made Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is you should at least wait and see if it rains,''
pitcher Rick Helling said. ``I've never been a big fan of calling
it just because you think it's going to rain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' ire was reinforced when] it didn't rain much in the
Bronx yesterday. At game time _ 12:05 p.m. _ there was light rain
falling, but it stopped within minutes and never picked up again.
The temperature was in the 40s but with no wind. The Rangers'
pitchers were able to do their daily throwing in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was premature that they \Rcalled\S the game 18-22 hours
before, basing it all on a forecast,'' pitcher Tim Crabtree said.
``They could have easily waited until this morning to call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree, the Rangers' player representative, said the Players
Association tried on Monday to convince Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner to wait until yesterday before making a decision. But,
according to Crabtree, Steinbrenner told the union he was concerned
about fans traveling to the game in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why weather is a concern,'' Crabtree said.
``People have to travel to the Bronx every night. They should be
more concerned about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody was upset. Rangers manager Johnny Oates defended
Steinbrenner's decision to call the game early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough decision and somebody's got to make it,'' Oates
said. ``Some of us can't second-guess, we have to make decisions
beforehand. It's easy to say we could have played. Whether it's
just or not, the guy had to make a tough decision \R Monday\S.
You've got to make the call. You should have been in his shoes
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will be made up when the Rangers return to New York in
August. The Rangers and the Yankees have a day off on Monday, Aug.
21, before beginning a three-game series on Aug. 22. But the
Rangers must vote to approve playing on Aug. 21, because it would
mean they would have a stretch of 31 games without a day off. That
goes against the labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree said his recommendation would be to play a day-night
doubleheader on Aug. 22. Oates, who hates doubleheaders, wants to
play on the day off. The Yankees players, who would be returning
from a West Coast road trip, also must approve playing on August
21, and the issue was undecided yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro, however, said it will be better for the Rangers
playing an extra game in August rather than yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not, the weather will be nicer,'' Palmeiro said. ``The
weather will be nice and the team will be rolling by then. I think
it will be a positive for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The postponement prompted both managers to adjust their
rotations. Darren Oliver (today) and Kenny Rogers (tomorrow) are
scheduled to pitch for the Rangers. Esteban Loaiza, who had a touch
of the flu over the weekend, has been pushed back to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are planning to go with David Cone today and Orlando
Hernandez tomorrow. Andy Pettitte, originally scheduled to pitch
today, has been pushed back because of a bad back.

USC VS. BOSTON COLLEGE A POSSIBILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC is talking to Boston College about a proposed
home-and-home series for the 2001 and 2002 football seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have been looking for an opponent to fill two open
dates, and Kansas recently was unable to reach an agreement. USC
had also tried to schedule Kansas State, before Wildcats coach Bill
Snyder killed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Virginia backed out of a home-and-home agreement. USC
would like to play Boston College at the Coliseum on Sept. 12,
2001, and travel to Boston College on Sept. 19, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary shuffle: There's almost no way to tell who is starting
at safety for the Trojans, especially the free-safety position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have (a starter),'' secondary coach Dennis Thurman
said. ``If we had to start the season today, I don't know who it
would be.''
</P>
<P>
   The free safeties are Ife Ohalete, Kevin Arbet and Frank Strong.
DeShaun Hill, who played safety in last Saturday's scrimmage, is
moving to cornerback. At strong safety, the candidates are Ohalete,
Troy Polamalu and incoming freshman Matt Grootegoed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first game, don't be surprised if we have two totally
different units out there,'' Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   One decision has been made in the secondary. Kris Richard will
remain at cornerback. There was some debate about moving him to
free safety, but he will not have to make a position switch.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan out: Reserve free safety John Morgan suffered what is
believed to be a season-ending knee injury during Saturday's
scrimmage. Results of a magnetic-resonance imaging test should be
known by today.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly could run: Wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who is academically
ineligible for the remainder of spring practices, might run track
and compete in the Pac-10 and NCAA championships, because USC's
spring semester ends before those events take place.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker John Cousins is not ineligible but has missed more
than a week to concentrate on academics. He might return before
spring practice concludes Saturday.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided
Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a
meeting here, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In frantic last-minute negotiations, as the Justice Department
prepared to order the transfer on Thursday morning in Florida,
representatives of the Miami relatives and Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
Elian's father, agreed to a meeting in the Washington, D.C., area,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian will be accompanied by his great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
who has temporary custody of the child, and Lazaro's 21-year-old
daughter, Marisleysis Gonzalez. Until Tuesday, the family had
sought a meeting with the boy's father, but had demanded that it
occur in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, if it takes place as planned, would end the lengthy
custody battle with a peaceful transfer that Attorney General Janet
Reno had struggled to piece together.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Justice Department officials expressed
satisfaction that the end seemed to be in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Turning Elian over to his father basically settles the issue in
the view of immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've encouraged them to talk and tried to facilitate from the
start,'' one official said. ``We're happy that this appears to be
an an opportunity for a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The first indication that the long dispute might be close to a
conclusion came late Tuesday night from Miami where a spokeswoman
for the Cuban American National Foundation said that
representatives of the Miami relatives would meet with Elian's
father on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., had helped
arrange the meeting. Efforts to reach Torricelli on Tuesday night
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The development came after a hectic day in which Reno had first
considered and then canceled plans to visit Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has told aides at the Justice Department for several days
that she was convinced that her direct intervention could soothe
the fiery passions within the Cuban-American population of Miami,
where Reno grew up and where she served for 15 years as the elected
local prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Reno has spoken emotionally and emphatically at
news conferences and television interviews about her sympathy for
the many Cuban-Americans who vehemently oppose sending Elian back
to the homeland ruled by of Fidel Castro, whom Reno has said she
unequivocally opposes.
</P>
<P>
   But she has also said that international politics should not
block the reunion of father and son, an outcome that she said was
correct as a long-established matter of immigration law and family
values. Pediatric psychiatrists, she said, have recommended turning
over Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possibility of an angry confrontation over the boy
has haunted negotiations between the government and Elian's Florida
relatives ever since fishermen plucked him from the Atlantic Ocean
off Florida on Thanksgiving after his mother drowned in their
voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have said they would obey the law, including a
court order allowing the government to transfer custody to Elian's
father, but until Tuesday night, they had never agreed to turn the
child over to his father, repeatedly asking for further legal
review of whether the child should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seemed headed to a showdown when last week, Elian's
father arrived in the United States to retrieve his son from the
Miami relatives, who were granted temporary custody until federal
authorities ordered that the boy be reunited with his father.
Gonzalez has told authorities he intends to take his son back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the boy's relatives offered a proposal that was
officially ignored by the Justice Department. In a letter
distributed outside the Miami home of Lazaro Gonzalez, the
great-uncle with whom Elian has been living, the family said it
would be willing to meet Elian's father at any ``neutral place in
South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter added that the session would be followed immediately
by a second meeting with the father that would include Elian. The
relatives sought an assurance from the government that Elian would
not be forcibly taken from them at the proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who is staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat
in a Washington, D.C., suburb, had said he does not want to meet
the Miami relatives, but would fly to Florida if necessary to pick
up his son. Afterward, the father has said, the adult members of
the Gonzalez family might seek a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department Tuesday, two Miami area mayors, Alex
Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Joseph Carollo of Miami, met with
Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the immigration service,
and urged the attorney general to arrange a meeting between Elian's
father and the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Reno issued a statement saying that she
welcomed their suggestions. She added, ``The mayors have asked me
to speak with leaders of the Miami community and I have indicated
my willingness and desire to do so. We agreed to continue working
together to seek an outcome that allows Elian to be reunited with
his father in the best way possible for him, his family and for the
Miami community as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Juan Miguel Gonzalez has said he does not want to
defect to the United States, the House Republican leadership and
Cuban-American lawmakers Tuesday invited him to a private meeting
on Wednesday in the Capitol. The lawmakers said in a letter to
Elian's father, which was delivered by congressional aides, that
they wanted him ``to be sure that you are aware of all the options
available to you as you make your decision.''

JOHNSON GETS LONG-AWAITED CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM - Put yourself in the shoes of Angels' infielder Keith
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has played in 816 games in eight different cities
without ever receiving a promotion to a major league club.
</P>
<P>
   So after sitting out both ends of a Triple-A doubleheader in
Edmonton on Monday, Johnson picked up his ringing hotel room phone.
It was the call that all minor leaguers dream about, his call to
the big club.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson answered the phone, coupled with the fact he was a
non-performer in two games earlier that day, one might understand
his hesitation to believe the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 10 minutes to believe what they were saying,'' said
Johnson, who will turn 29 next week. ``It's funny. I was watching
Monday's game on television and I didn't even know (shortstop Gary)
DiSarcina was hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who spent seven years in the Dodgers' organization
before playing in the Arizona Diamondbacks system last season,
moved up when DiSarcina was placed on the disabled list with a
thumb injury.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia, familiar with the former Dodger
farmhand during his days as a coach in the organization, says
Johnson can play four positions, if need be - shortstop, second
base, third base, and left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a guy that fills a need right now,'' Scioscia said. ``We
needed a guy with experience playing shortstop. (And) everybody in
the organization was very confident that Keith was the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Double-A and Triple-A last season, Johnson hit .289 with
15 home runs and 61 in 124 games.
</P>
<P>
   While Toronto manager Jim Fregosi's name is quite familiar with
Angels' fans, so too are a number of his coaches. Longtime Angels'
base coach Bobby Knoop is coaching first base with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Three former big league managers - Terry Bevington (Chicago
White Sox), Cito Gaston (the Jays' most successful manager in team
history) and Lee Elia (Chicago Cubs), also make up part of
Fregosi's staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels close out their season-opening nine-game homestand
tonight when they take on the Blue Jays in the third game of the
series. Anaheim has gotten off to a decent start against the three
Eastern Division teams that have come through town (New York and
Boston being the other two). The Angels were 20-36 versus the East
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Was it that long ago?: Ten years ago Tuesday, Mark Langston and
Mike Witt combined to pitch a no-hitter against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's pitching matchup: The Angels will throw right-hander
Jason Dickson (1-0, 2.70 ERA) while Toronto will send out veteran
righty Frank Castillo (0-1, 15.00).
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS vs. TORONTO
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:05 p.m., Edison Field
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: No TV; KLAC-AM (570), XPRS-AM (1090)
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Right-hander Jason Dickson (1-0, 2.70 ERA) looks to
make his second consecutive solid start for the Angels. Toronto
will counter with right-hander Frank Castillo (0-1, 15.00). The
Angels entered Tuesday's game with their starting pitchers
(Dickson, Ken Hill, Kent Bottenfield, and Scott Schoeneweis)
leading the majors in earned-run average (3.02) and opponent
batting average (.210, 33 for 157). As a staff, Anaheim's ERA of
3.86 ranks No.4 in the majors and second in the American League.

STRICKEN WORKERS AT ATOMIC PLANTS MAY GET U.S. HELP
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page) 
(ATTN: Ky., Ohio) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House will announce a plan on Wednesday
for compensating workers who may have been made sick by exposure to
radiation and toxic chemicals in the nation's nuclear weapons
factories, administration officials said on Tuesday night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which has been under development for about a year and
must still be submitted to Congress, follows the acknowledgment by
the Energy Department earlier this year that workers involved in
building the nation's nuclear arsenal showed higher-than-normal
rates of several different kinds of cancer and other ailments,
based on a review of years of scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
   The concession opened the door for compensation. The plan could
cost $400 million over the first five years, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of the plan is ``giving workers the benefit of
the doubt,'' an Energy Department official said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through the cold war and beyond, the Energy Department and its
predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, denied that
workers had received harmful doses of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   And few if any of the workers qualified for workers'
compensation, the standard remedy, because that program was
designed for sudden injuries that clearly happened on the job, not
ailments developed by chronic exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department and its contractors routinely opposed such
payments for compensation based on supposed radiation exposure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the affected workers were or are employees of private
companies that operated government factories. Some are employees of
subcontractors who worked in private factories.
</P>
<P>
   New details of the plan for compensation were first reported in
The Washington Post on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the plan also said that it acknowledged
that most workers could not document their exposures, because
record-keeping was poor, and that even if they could, some were
suffering from diseases that were far from unique to people who
work with radiation, although they may occur more frequently among
that group.
</P>
<P>
   The plan gives the workers the benefit of the doubt in asserting
that certain illnesses are occupationally related. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is done fighting the workers and now we're
going to help them,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in a
statement. ``We're reversing the decades-old practice of opposing
worker claims.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In advance of congressional approval, however, the only action
that the Clinton administration can take is to acknowledge
responsibility, Energy Department officials said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plan's prospects in Congress are uncertain, but some members
of the House are pushing hard on behalf of workers in their
districts, notably uranium enrichment plants, the Portsmouth
Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion
Plant in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was drafted by the White House National Economic
Council, with help from experts from a dozen federal agencies. It
would offer some workers lump-sum payments of $100,000 or allow
them to negotiate reimbursement for medical costs and lost wages.
It does not contemplate punitive damages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is approved, the Energy Department will open a
special compensation office to handle the claims.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weapons complex has employed hundreds of thousands of
workers since 1944, many of whom died of the same kinds of
illnesses that afflict the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, suffer from diseases that are unusual outside the
weapons complex, notably berylliosis, a condition that comes from
exposure to beryllium dust. Beryllium is a metal for which the
weapons complex was the only consumer for several decades. The plan
also contemplates reimbursement for another lung ailment,
silicosis, and for ``radiogenic cancers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologic studies of workers around the complex have found
that as a whole, they are healthier than the general population but
that at 14 plants, there are 22 pockets of ``excess cancers'' or
other unusual diseases.  &QL;

ELECTRICITY OF CANDLESTICK IS MISSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO - The naughtiest, if not the only, Dodgers-Giants
moment of the Pacific Bell Park opener Tuesday happened 20 minutes
before the first pitch. Too bad it, like much of the afternoon,
came straight out of a script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' San Francisco Giants play-by-play man
Jon Miller, emceeing the pregame ceremonies in a tuxedo, said
momentously, ``let's have the very first Pac Bell Park welcome
for... the Los Angeles Dodgers!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd picked up the cue and delivered a half-minute of
hearty boos, then hooted again as Davey Johnson and his lineup
trotted one by one to the first-base line. But the boos died down
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, some upstairs fans tried to start a ``Beat L.A.''
chant. But it didn't take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to think of it, I didn't hear `Beat L.A.' as much as I
did at Candlestick,'' Giants first baseman J.T. Snow, an Orange
County kid, said after the Dodgers' 6-5 victory, in which he hit
one of the six home runs and, unbelievably, Kevin Elster hit three.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, the usual Dodgers-Giants flavor, the flavor
of hip-flask whiskey and cigarettes, was largely missing from the
game that made official the Giants' move from wintry Candlestick
Park to clever Pac Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the backstop sat a man in a Dodger-blue ``Nomo'' T-shirt,
and not far from him were a young couple in Dodgers jackets and
caps. They paid nary a price for their heresy, fielded not a single
insult, let alone an AA battery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wore Dodger gear at Candlestick, you'd get your a--
kicked,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros observed.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there in the sold-out stadium you'd spot a ``Clark''
jersey (Will, not Jack, presumably) or a flannel ``Marichal''
jersey, and black-and-orange Giants caps were plentiful. Yet you
found fewer fans in the colors of the home team among the 40,930 at
Pac Bell Tuesday than among the 9,000-odd customers at the
Cleveland-Oakland game the night before, where half the crowd
seemed to wear the gaudy green and gold of the diehard A's rooter.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the old Candlestick crowds?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they went the way of the cheap baseball ticket. The
average seat at Pac Bell costs 23 percent more than its counterpart
at Candlestick. Who did you think was going to pay the $319 million
it cost to build this?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they went the way of the sparse Giants crowd. The club has
sold 29,000 season tickets for 2000 and sold out 74 of its 81 home
games.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they went the way of the black-and-orange parka.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that Pac Bell is too comfortable, quaint and lovable
to bring out the werewolf in Giants fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you get more of a feeling of the city people, who live
in the city or work in the city, coming to the game,'' Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   People who couldn't get basketball tickets, perhaps. Or theater
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were still throwing those (Dodgers) home run balls back.
That was good to see,'' Snow said, finding some passion in the
``new'' crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, for those of us who liked the old Giants crowds,
is that it could be different the next two games, which will be
played under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell is constructed with its back to the wind, shielding the
field and stands from the worst San Francisco weather. But the wind
will still swirl.
</P>
<P>
   As I write this, at about first-pitch time for a night game,
trash is clattering through the left-field bleachers, the corners
of tarpaulins covering the bullpen mounds are lifting off the
ground, and sprinklers watering the outfield are blowing into the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   A moment before Kirk Rueter spun the game's first pitch past
Devon White - following a drawn-out and overproduced opening
ceremony - a sudden gust blew my scoresheet onto the press-box
floor. A Candlestick poltergeist gone downtown?
</P>
<P>
   There will never be another Candlestick, yet Pac Bell has enough
quirks to make any game interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint is best known for its 309-foot right-field line,
which gives left-handed power hitters a chance to lose balls in the
marina. But stranger than that is the 25-foot-high right-field
wall, which includes cut-out sections through which standing-room
fans can watch the action from a unique ground-floor perspective.
The upshot is that batted balls will ricochet off brick, metal,
padding or chain link, depending on the whims of the baseball gods.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds' first swing in the new park sent a Chan Ho Park
pitch into the corner Tuesday. Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green
played it tentatively and watched the ball nestle against the chain
link. Bonds ended up with a double, as he would have anyway, but
the play confirmed that tentative is the way to play a guessing
game like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adventure out there,'' Green said. ``You never know
how it's going to bounce out here. It adds a little extra character
to the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bit of character: The right-center-field wall angles
toward the water until it's 421 feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, a drive by Doug Mirabelli one-hopped the
421 sign. Before Dodgers center fielder Devon White could get the
ball back to the infield, the Giants catcher chugged all the way to
his first major-league triple.
</P>
<P>
   Character? The place has plenty. Unfortunately, not much of it
was in the stands. But what can you expect on the day someone wears
a tux to a ballgame?

U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS REPORT IS SAID TO CRITICIZE NEW YORK POLICING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN and JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The staff of the federal civil rights commission that
held hearings into New York City's policing practices plans to
offer a draft report of its findings that is sharply critical of
the Police Department, according to two people familiar with the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Civil Rights Commission began studying the city's
policing practices last year, after the police shooting of Amadou
Diallo and the torture of Abner Louima. It has been trying to
determine whether the aggressive policing that has been credited
with producing the city's steep drop in crime has also taken a toll
on the civil rights of minority New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The final report will not be binding, but its recommendations
will be passed on to the president, Congress and other federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   City officials associated with the administration of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said on Tuesday night that they had not seen the
draft, but they accused commission members of leaking some details
of it to give Democrats a political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, whose members are appointed by Congress and the
president, has five Democrats, one Republican and two independents.
</P>
<P>
   The city officials also questioned the validity of the report
because, they said, the commission had not approached the city with
any follow-up questions since holding a public hearing in New York
in May, in which dozens of black and Hispanic New Yorkers spoke of
routine harassment by the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to ask them what they did besides hold a hearing a
year ago,'' said a member of the Giuliani administration, speaking
on the condition of anonymity. ``There was no exchange of
information. There was one small phone call from them asking for a
piece of information, and the person who received the request asked
that it be submitted in a letter, and they never wrote. You've got
to ask yourself what took them so long if they didn't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration official also said that the report's
findings were likely to be determined more by the political makeup
of the panel's membership than by any research the commission did.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has often said that Hillary Rodham Clinton's
plans to run against him for the U.S. Senate have coincided with an
increase in federal investigations of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic members of the commission are Cruz Reynoso, a law
professor at the University of California at Los Angeles; Yvonne Y.
Lee, a consultant in San Francisco; Christopher Edley, a Harvard
professor and an adviser to President Clinton on racial issues;
Victoria Wilson, a senior editor at Alfred A. Knopf; and Elsie M.
Meeks, a Lakota Sioux Indian and a businesswoman who is the first
native American to serve on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican member is Carl A. Anderson, the dean of the North
American Campus of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for
Studies on Marriage and Family Law in Washington. The independent
members are Mary Frances Berry, the commission's chairwoman and a
professor of American social thought at the University of
Pennsylvania; and Russell G. Redenbaugh, a partner at a
Philadelphia money-management firm, Cooke &AMP; Bieler.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, which had been schedule for a vote on Friday, is not
ready, said an aide to Berry. The aide, who did not want to be
named, said that the commission might discuss the preliminary
conclusions of the report, but would reschedule the formal review
and vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the commission began its investigation,
three police shootings of unarmed black men, and the political
backlash from the shootings, have caused relations between the
police and minority residents of the city to deteriorate further.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Giuliani's harsh characterizations of Patrick M.
Dorismond, an off-duty security guard who was shot dead in a
scuffle with the police last month after a plain clothes officer
asked to buy marijuana from him, have appeared to drive a wedge
between the mayor's police force and city residents.

BULLS DEFEAT NEWS, 100-93 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman have
been gone for two seasons. Even Toni Kukoc has left the building.
No one of consequence from the Chicago Bulls' glorious championship
run continues to play home games at the United Center. Yet the New
Jersey Nets still cannot win here.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls defeated their downtrodden guests by 100-93. It was
the Nets' 12th straight loss at the United Center, where they
haven't won since Dec. 5, 1994, the night they played their first
game at the six-year-old arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets (31-47) also equaled their season high for consecutive
losses at seven. With Stephon Marbury, Kerry Kittles and Evan
Eschmeyer _ none of whom played on Tuesday night _ likely to miss
the rest of the season, the lifeless Nets could easily lose their
final four games.
</P>
<P>
   Such a finish would give the Nets a 2-14 record over the last
month of the season and place pathetic bookends on a season that
began with only two victories in the first 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll get back on the winning track sooner or later,''
said Kendall Gill, who scored 19 points. ``And it better be sooner
because we only have four games left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, whose lone standout player is Elton Brand (22 points,
15 rebounds, 7 assists, rookie of the year candidate), did not just
beat the Nets. They put on a performance for their
highlight-starved fans.
</P>
<P>
   In scoring 17 points, the former Net Chris Carr mimicked Jordan
by throwing down a thunderous windmill dunk over Keith Van Horn (15
points, 10 rebounds) and ferociously swatting a shot by Gill. A
character named Michael Ruffin, a rookie out of Tulsa, skied above
a collection of Nets to slam in a Bulls miss, and Matt Maloney (19
points) hit 3-pointers (5 of 6) as if he were shooting alone in his
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Defying its ignominious 17-60 record, Chicago, which outscored
the Nets by 57-45 over the second and third quarters to take
control, won the season series by 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   While Marbury and Kittles, who both will be examined by doctors
on Wednesday, could perhaps help the Nets grind out at least one
more victory, neither seems likely to return. Kittles (sore right
knee) was vague about his plans, but Marbury said he was probably
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I doubt if I come back,'' said Marbury, who sat
out their fourth straight game with tendinitis in his left knee.
``I'm just trying to get my knee healthy. The doctors have told me
that it's best to stay off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a magnetic resonance imaging exam last Thursday,
Marbury was told that he might be able to play in a week. That
would have enabled him to compete in the last three games of the
season. With Marbury's intense drive to play in as many games as
possible, it seemed likely that he would fight off anyone who might
try to keep him out of Friday's home game against Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets officials, none of whom want Marbury risk another
injury, have gotten their star point guard to consider his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the organization wants me to stay off of it,''
said Marbury, who averaged 22.2 points and 8.4 assists this season.
``I don't want to say it's not worth it because we're out of the
playoffs because it's always worth it to play basketball. But the
people in our organization know that next year is more important.
It makes me feel real good to know that they care about me for next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of too many performances like Tuesday night's, next year
is all that matters. &QL;

CITYWALK NEW LOOK ROCKS TO L.A. BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As if Universal CityWalk _ a virtual downtown
within an artificial city _ needed any more reality distortions.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty new venues open Thursday with such mind-bending
attractions as a virtual reality NASCAR speedway and a virtual
bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new attractions in CityWalk's second phase in a
sense distill the L.A. experience into its highlights: a Latin
dance club and surf-clothing shop; a skateboarding half-pipe and a
sci-fi movie memorabilia shop; a Mexican-food joint and a Tommy's
Hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   CityWalk architect Jon Jerde said he sees it as a model for
reviving downtowns in Los Angeles and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``CityWalk has become globally famous. We work all over the
globe and everywhere we go, people say, Let's CityWalk the place,''
Jerde said. ``People use it as a verb, which means bringing
vitality, light and excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new venues have opened already, and on Tuesday
tourists and locals strolled around gaping at the new sights and
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outstanding area. I think this thing is going to be
packed,'' said John Rice, 45, a firefighter visiting from
Oceanside, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 10 million people visit the Universal Studios/CityWalk
complex every year, and officials expect that number to shoot up
with the expansion, plus the June opening of the Red Line subway in
North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offering what is arguably the best full-day
entertainment experience in Southern California,'' boasted
Universal Studios Hollywood President Larry Kurzweil.
</P>
<P>
   Since CityWalk opened in 1993, it has not only complemented the
studio theme park, but filled a need for pedestrian-oriented
entertainment districts in a car-crazy city.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jerde, downtown Los Angeles especially is in need
of a pedestrian-oriented retail/restaurant zone and he has begun
talking to developers within the last month with that goal in mind.
</P>
<P>
   CityWalk's 93,000-square-foot expansion includes more than a
dozen new eateries, including a quick-service food court with menus
distilled from full-service restaurants throughout Los Angeles.
Jerry's Famous Deli and the Gaucho Grill, both full-service
restaurants in the San Fernando Valley, are opening quick-bite
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other venues are: the Rumba Room, a Latin dance club
with live salsa, merengue and Latin jazz; The Wound &AMP; Wound Toy
Co., featuring wind-up toys; Buca di Beppo Italian restaurant; Cafe
Tu Tu Tango, a Barcelona-style tapas bar; and a six-story IMAX
movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Jillian's Hi Life Lanes features a virtual bowling game called
Hyperbowl, which involves 10-foot-high video screens projecting
city scenes, such as a futuristic San Francisco. Using a stationary
bowling ball set up like a computer track ball, the player has to
maneuver the virtual ball around the city, dodging street cars,
pedestrians and then struggling uphill to knock down pins at the
end of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs at Jillian's, a real bowling alley features a nightclub
atmosphere with glow-in-the-dark balls and huge screens showing
music videos.
</P>
<P>
   Another CityWalk addition is a series of uniquely L.A.
billboards commissioned from local artists. One tongue-in-cheek
piece titled ``L.A. Angst'' depicts a comic strip-drawn woman
crying on a man's shoulder and exclaiming: ``Oh Andy ... The hot
tub overflowed and ruined my cell phone. Then the cappuccino maker
exploded and the top on the convertible is stuck shut ... Again!''

LINEBACKER FROM BYU PLAYS, LIVES AT FULL THROTTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brigham Young linebacker Rob Morris plays the game of life with
the same reckless abandon that he plays the game of football.
Morris has jumped out of a fifth-floor apartment into a swimming
pool, eaten out of a dog dish, done some car surfing, had his
picture taken with an alligator and painted his toenails.
</P>
<P>
   Has Morris had one too many blows to the head?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm crazy,'' he said. ``Maybe a
little free-spirited. I just enjoy having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, the NFL draft's top-rated inside linebacker, is a
throwback. His dogs are named Butkus and Bronko. His nickname is
``Freight Train.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A reporter asked me once what it was like hitting a
quarterback,'' Morris said. ``I said it was like a freight train
hitting a Yugo. They took off with that. Made all these
train-whistle sounds. I can't get rid of it. I like it. Freight
train is an old, reliable thing. It hits hard. Nobody wants to get
hit by a freight train.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, an Eagle Scout, spent 1994 and '95 on a Mormon mission
in Toronto. He redshirted in '96 before posting 333 tackles, 341/2
tackles for losses, one interception and 13 sacks over the past
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He will be a 25-year-old NFL rookie, but he doesn't promise to
grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who watches tapes of Chuck Bednarik, Sam Huff, Ray
Nitschke and Dick Butkus, plays the game like the alligator that
almost tamed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a slugger,'' Morris said. ``I pride myself on being the
old school-type linebacker. I've been known to snort and growl. If
you're a middle linebacker and you don't have some blood on your
elbows and snot running down your face, you're not a true middle
linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tait, a former BYU lineman who was a first-round choice of
the Kansas City Chiefs last season, enticed Morris to get within
four feet of the 7-foot alligator for a picture. Morris escaped
without becoming gator bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was misinformed about alligators, about how fast they could
travel on land,'' Morris said. ``When I finally found out the
truth, well, I guess it wasn't a smart decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who has been compared to his role model, Chris Spielman,
is rumored to bite the heads off chickens, too. He is an urban
legend before his pro career has started.

PHOENIX BOOM LEFT INDIGENT IN ITS DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On one side rises the shiny new cityscape of downtown Phoenix's
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   On the other looms the lustrous copper dome of the Arizona State
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In between _ squeezed ever smaller _ squats a dirty little
corner of hell.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly compressed mixture of mentally ill homeless and
criminal predators has turned the area between Seventh and 15th
avenues, Harrison to Jefferson streets into a ghetto of misery and
violence, city officials and homeless advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is so bad that Phoenix Police Chief Harold Hurtt
has urged the city to rectify ``years of neglect'' that have
allowed the area to slide into ``unchallenged disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo written last week, Hurtt recommended that his officers
step up their presence in the area to protect the homeless and
arrest those preying upon them.
</P>
<P>
   He and others say the crisis _ brewing for decades _ represents
the grim downside of Phoenix's celebrated renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a crisis in that area, but it's coming should be no
surprise,'' said Louisa Stark of the non-profit Community Housing
Partnership. ``Not so long ago, a lot of mentally ill people were
living in old hotels in the downtown,'' she said. ``Then we tore
them down for revitalization. The result was people lost their
housing and were pushed into the area where they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   An area that's evolved from merely seedy to downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminal element within the homeless population has taken
over the area, (which has) become a drug marketplace with high
criminal activity and neighborhood blight,'' Hurtt wrote in a
council report. ``Users from all over the city come to this area to
buy and sell illegal drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Negrete heartily agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real dangerous down here now, worse than before, since
everybody is all cracked-out,'' said Negrete, who with friend,
Arthur Magana, live there and collect cans and discarded clothing
in the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of mean, mean drug dealers, and the crazy people getting
ripped off and beat up and their disability money stolen from
them,'' he said. ``Bad. Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   About 400 people call the Central Area Shelter Services building
at 12th Avenue and Madison Street home. Another estimated 450 sleep
in nearby vacant lots and streets. &QL; 
_Changing nature of population More than half of them suffer from
mental problems, estimates CASS Director Mark Halloran.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of jobs out there now, and most of the homeless
who had the capacity to work are working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left are some very seriously ill people. And we have
about 900 of them right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Vincent de Paul Society serves a hot lunch to hundreds
of homeless people a block from CASS. Spokesman John Feit agreed
that ``well over half, maybe 70 percent of these folks, have mental
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many can't fend for themselves,'' Feit said. ``Most are in
pitiful shape. Hundreds need help and few are getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the area's homeless are people who were _ or would have
been _ treated in hospitals or other residential settings, Halloran
said. But court decisions and state laws have forced the nation's
mental hospitals to discharge many patients and admit far fewer
than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The CASS shelter, and the area around it, ``is being used as an
area to contain the mentally ill,'' Halloran said. ``The state
doesn't have the money, they say, to help these people.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, lawmakers and Gov. Jane Hull agreed to fund a new
mental hospital at 24th and Roosevelt streets. On the other hand,
state Sen. Sue Grace, R-north Phoenix, introduced a bill to
increase mental health spending by $33 million, but the bill is
stalled in the House. &QL; 
_Signs of progress? The shuffling of the indigent west of Central
Avenue began in the 1970s, when the old downtown ``Deuce'' area was
demolished and replaced by Phoenix Civic Plaza and Patriots Square.
With the Deuce went the many old hotels where the poor could stay
for as little as $1.50 a night.
</P>
<P>
   As downtown redevelopment progressed, the homeless have been
pushed westward from the downtown core and into a smaller and
smaller area. With the coming completion of Phoenix City Court at
Fifth Avenue, and the new federal court building at Sixth Avenue,
Seventh Avenue has become the line between downtown on the east and
the homeless area on the west.
</P>
<P>
   The State Capitol at 17th Avenue and government buildings that
extend to 15th Avenue mark the western boundary for the homeless, a
boundary bolstered by residential redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtt said special training will be given to officers who soon
will conduct stepped-up patrols in the area. Drug dealers and
muggers will be targeted, he said. But the mentally ill ``will be
another story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many mentally ill people to deal with, arrests can't
be the only answer,'' Hurtt said.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Emmett Quill of the South Mountain Precinct said
psychiatrist Glenn Lippman will train officers to assess people
with behavioral health problems. Quill said plans now call for
space being made available in a state mental health facility for
people involved in incidents in the area who also seem to be
suffering from mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   People who live and work in the area say they applaud police
efforts, but doubt anything short of drastic action will solve the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Bosse, president of the Capitol Mall Association, a
non-profit group revitalizing that area, agreed: ``There are
hundreds of hard-core mentally ill people in those few blocks,''
she said. ``Until they are dealt with, the problem won't be
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtt expressed no illusions that his officers alone could solve
it. ``When we are judged in the future on how we took care of the
weak and helpless among us,'' he said, ``I'm afraid that judgment
will be a harsh one.'' &QL;

NBA APPROVES CUBAN AS MAVERICKS OWNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Cuban arrived for his anointing as the
Mavericks' new owner dressed in black slacks, a black pullover
shirt, a black belt, black shoes, black socks, and a black leather
jacket adorned with the Mavericks logo. In essence, Mark Cuban was
being Mark Cuban _ nothing pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   After his bid to purchase a majority interest in the Mavericks
was approved yesterday by the NBA Board of Governors, Cuban said
his first order of business was to ``take a nap.'' He was fatigued
from dealing with lawyers and the sale transfer. He also made plans
to watch last night's Portland-Mavericks game on TV in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Today it's back to work for the man determined to turn the
Mavericks into a winner, and there's much work to be done. The
Mavericks have missed the playoffs for 10 consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone \R26-18\S since I first met the players,'' Cuban
said. ``Now the goal, the challenge, is to take that farther and
make sure that everybody realizes that we're a playoff team, and
work with the players to get them excited about working on their
skills and their game over the summer so we can hit the ground
running'' next season.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban has invigorated the Mavericks since signing a letter of
intent Jan. 3 to purchase controlling interest in the franchise
from Ross Perot Jr. for an NBA-record $280 million. He has created
a new buzz around the team, and also higher expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz has also hit the NBA, which is counting on Cuban and
his Internet connections to help a league with a $2.64 billion
television contract reach new revenue heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be proactive. And I don't think I've met anyone
who's more proactive than Mark, and that's very good,'' NBA
commissioner David Stern said. ``And he's going to stub his toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's better than just sort of sitting back and sort of
accepting status quo if you think you can make improvements. I
think that's what the fans want, and I think that's what we're
looking for from Mark now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban might have stubbed his toe by signing Dennis Rodman in
February, when the Mavericks appeared ready to make playoff run.
Cuban also acknowledged, when he released the 38-year-old power
forward March 9, that signing Rodman might have been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Cuban's efforts to improve the team earned the
admiration of players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's high maintenance but good, and I mean that sincerely. He
is in a class by himself, but that's good,'' Stern said. ``He's
young and enthusiastic. I think it's terrific. I think the owners
are looking forward to that kind of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the moves Cuban has made since taking over operations
from Perot, Cuban said he still held back. Now he plans to throw
his full energy and resources into reshaping the franchise,
starting with the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are approximately $6 million over the projected
salary cap for next season, which handcuffs Cuban in signing free
agents this summer. But Cuban said some owners don't want to pay
the NBA's new escrow tax, which kicks in if the average league
salary is over the tax threshold. Unlike some owners, the
Mavericks' billionaire owner said he wouldn't be discouraged from
signing a premier free agent to a big contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those \Rtaxes\S will have an impact on player decisions for
some organizations,'' Cuban said. ``So we'll try to take advantage
of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be really, really interesting to see how all of
the dynamics play out with the salary cap. We're going to be as
opportunistic as we possibly can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks also will have a lottery draft pick, assuming
coach/general manager Don Nelson doesn't trade it.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said yesterday he plans to hire a new coach. He wants
Nelson to return as general manager, and Nelson has said this will
be his final season as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban also said he's ``thrilled with the job'' by Terdema
Ussery, the Mavericks' president and chief executive officer, and
wants him back next season. He also said he plans no more changes
among his senior-level employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will dramatically expand our sales force in the ticket
end of the sponsorship area,'' Cuban said. ``We want to be able to
reach our season ticket goals, which I'm not going to tell you what
they are because I haven't even told the staff yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just leveraging up on the excitement that's building for
the Mavs in Dallas. The response has been great, and I just want to
take it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, 41, is the third owner in the Mavericks' 20-year history.
He also is the franchise's most flamboyant owner _ a guy willing to
sign Rodman, and also willing to hire a 10-man coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Stern acknowledges that Cuban has ``raised eyebrows'' among the
owners with some of his dealings, including two ugly shouting
matches directed at referee David Jones. But all was apparently
forgotten yesterday, as the 28 other NBA owners opened their
fraternity to the ambitious Pittsburgh native.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, we have had a number of owners over the years who
have done a lot,'' Stern said. ``Some well-documented and some not,
because we got to them fast and told them to cut it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think if you get to know \RCuban\S and talk to him, you
realize that he's exceedingly good-natured and very competitive and
very bright and hard working.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than saying ``little shackles'' have been removed from his
feet, Cuban said he doesn't feel any differently now that the
Mavericks are officially his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm looking for other franchises, or I'm looking
to build a sports empire,'' he said. ``I just love basketball, I
love Mavericks, and I love Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not just have fun with it? It doesn't have to be anything
beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; subheds:CUBAN'S TEAM  &LR; agatea:Mark Cuban officially became owner
of the Mavericks yesterday in New York, but he has been running the
franchise since Januray, when he made an offer to buy a controlling
interest of the team from Ross Perot Jr. The major moves Cuban has
made:
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 13: Fired Reunion Arena announcer Kevin McCarthy and
replaced him with radio personality ``Humble'' Billy Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 31: Hired Derek Harper as vice president of business
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 3: Signed forward Dennis Rodman to a contract for the
remainder of the season. Also leased his guest house to Rodman
until the NBA told Cuban that was a violation of the league's
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 21: Hired George Prokos as director of new revenue and
sales.
</P>
<P>
   March 9: Waived Rodman the day after Rodman criticized Cuban for
``hanging on the players'' and compared him to Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones.

BEN &AMP; JERRY'S HOMEMADE AGREES TO $256 MILLION TAKEOVER BY
UNILEVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to qualify lede graf)  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after saying it was considering a plan to be
taken private, Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade has appeared to have reached
an agreement to be sold to Unilever PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was described by people close to the
takeover talks, was apparently reached late Tuesday, during a
lengthy meeting of the Ben &AMP; Jerry's board in New York.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant to Ben &AMP; Jerry's chief financial officer, Frances
Rathke, would not comment Tuesday night. Unilever's spokesman and
the company's investment banker did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever has agreed to pay about $42 a share for Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
making the deal worth about $256 million, the people said. It is a
significant premium on Ben &AMP; Jerry's share price, which despite
rising to a 52-week high of $35.625 in Tuesday's trading, closed at
$34.9375.
</P>
<P>
   It is also about $4 more a share than the leveraged buyout plan
that Ben &AMP; Jerry's said it was considering on March 29. That plan
would have divided the company between one of its founders, Ben
Cohen; a venture-capital firm called Meadowbrook Lane Capital that
describes itself as socially responsible; and Unilever. Unilever
would have controlled about 28 percent of the company under that
plan, while Cohen and Meadowbrook Lane Capital would have held 36
percent apiece.
</P>
<P>
   As in the earlier plan, Jerry Greenfield, the other founder and
namesake of Ben &AMP; Jerry's, would relinquish his role in the
company. It was not clear Tuesday what led to the revised offer,
nor what Cohen's role would be once Unilever took control. Cohen
and Greenfield issued a statement last month saying that they
remained close friends.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief issues facing Ben &AMP; Jerry's is its distribution
system in the United States, where it sells most of its flavors
like Cherry Garcia and Wavy Gravy. Until 1998, most of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's ice cream was distributed by Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, an
Oakland, Calif.-based company that has a large share of the market.
Ben &AMP; Jerry's broke off the arrangement, which began in 1987, and
replaced with one that relied on Haagen-Dazs, another big
competitor, as well as Dreyer's and some company-owned
distributors. All in all, it was seen as a less-than-ideal solution
by many analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly not a negative for Unilever,'' said Jeffrey
G. Kanter, a food stocks analyst for Prudential Securities.
``Whether or not it becomes a home run remains to be seen. Unilever
is obviously looking at this for the long term. It's a fair price
for an asset with strong brand equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's, which had received takeover offers in the past,
issued an unusual statement in early December in which it said it
had received ``indications of interest'' and would be evaluating
them. The stock has risen since then from about $17 a share, and
people involved with the company, including several owners of
franchised ice-cream shops, said Ben &AMP; Jerry's appeared to be
taking the offers more seriously than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   A big concern of the franchise owners has been whether a new
owner would preserve the unusual aspects of Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
particularly its commitment to social causes like helping the
homeless and conserving the environment. Unilever maintains on its
corporate Web site that it is working to preserve clean water
resources and is involved with other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's made an offer of $31 a share in February, according to
a copy of documents submitted with the offer. Two days later,
Meadowbrook Lane Capital submitted an offer of $32 a share. Both
were lower than the $40 a share that Unilever bid around the same
time, said a person familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A Dreyer's spokesman had little comment when contacted Tuesday,
and refused to confirm reports that Dreyer's had raised its bid
this week to $38 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we would do on any kind of company would be on a
friendly basis, and we would only do things that are accretive to
our shareholders,'' said the spokesman, Tyler Johnston. ``Outside
of that, I can't comment on what's swirling out there.''

Ed Belfour ready if called on to carry Stars in playoffs (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mac Engel 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram Ed Belfour ready if called on to carry Stars in playoffs
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ The question invariably was going to come up with the
playoffs starting: How important is goalie Ed Belfour to the Stars'
repeating as Stanley Cup champions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid question,'' defenseman Richard Matvichuk said. ``What
was it? Four of the last five Stanley Cup champions had good
goaltending.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's think ... Martin Brodeur for New Jersey, Patrick Roy for
Colorado, Mike Vernon for Detroit and, most recently, Belfour for
the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It took him 11 seasons, but Belfour finally got the ring that
usually adorns the fingers of the NHL's top goalies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the last couple of years Eddie was trying to find
himself and maybe drop the monkey off his back,'' forward Guy
Carbonneau said. ``And I think he did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there a monkey?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Belfour said.
</P>
<P>
   With the weight of said primate on someone else's back (i.e.
Dominik Hasek), the player who often carried the Stars during the
regular-season now has the luxury of playing his first playoffs
minus the never-won-a-Cup pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure, instead, comes from himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I feel the same motivation,'' Belfour said, ``just
a little more relaxed. I don't think of it any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after a year in which Belfour posted the league's top save
percentage (.919) and was arguably the NHL's top goalie, players
like Roy, Roman Turek and Olaf Kolzig enjoyed most of the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   But Belfour played, and won, with nearly the same consistency as
the aforementioned trio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Eddie's had an antagonistic personality for most of
his career, other than the last couple of years, so people love to
hate him,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``For other teams and
other players, he's well respected. They know he can win games.''
</P>
<P>
   But Belfour winning games isn't extraordinary. This was his
third consecutive 30-win season. What's different is the way he's
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a hot-tempered guy in the past, but when it comes to
the big game, Eddie just stands still and he's the man,'' Edmonton
center Doug Weight said. ``We talked about him \Ron Monday\S, that
you've got to get him. He doesn't falter, he doesn't get rattled.''
</P>
<P>
   At no time this season could the Stars afford for him to be. In
a season where his teammates typically limped off or were carried
off the ice, Belfour's consistency was singular, not only because
he never got hurt, but because he made the saves that won games for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about \RMike\S Modano \Ras an MVP candidate\S, you
have to look at Eddie, too,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said.
``For a while there, Eddie was the only reason we were winning, to
be honest. He might be the biggest reason we won it last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But, there are no Master Card commercials. There wasn't even an
All-Star invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Does he care?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how people view me,'' Belfour said. ``I care
about how my teammates view me and how I think of myself. I don't
think that's changed. I know how I can play, I know what I have
done in the past, and it doesn't bother me. I think I have played
well my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is a guy who won game No. 300 of his career this
season, becoming only the 16th goalie in NHL history to hit that
mark. How did he do it? In a typical 2-1 fashion, this time against
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best season Belfour's ever had for us,'' Hitchcock
said. ``He's won us points, he's got us games as a team we didn't
deserve to get points from.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't last year's team where we outplayed teams and the
goalies' job was to not lose games. He's had to go out and win us
games, and he's done it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was riding a regular-season crest came his much-publicized
arrest after a hotel scuffle] March 8.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts began to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Was Belfour going to be the same?
</P>
<P>
   Was this going to be the same player that carried the Stars for
so much of the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't missed a beat,'' Hitchcock said. ``The time that he
spent away was hard on him and hard on us. If it did anything it
made him realize how important hockey is to his life and his
family. What that man's been through, this is all window dressing.
To me, coming back to our team was the easiest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything's a little easier when you've already won a Stanley
Cup.

ORTIZ KEEPS ANGELS ROLLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- To this point - and yes, it is still very, very early
- seemingly every question concerning the 2000 Angels has met with
a positive response.
</P>
<P>
   Our pitchers Ken Hill and Jason Dickson healthy? Check and
check. Is Scott Schoeneweis ready to become a big league starter?
Check. Can Darin Erstad rebound from a sub-par 1999? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to add pitcher Ramon Ortiz and backup shortstop Benji
Gil to the Angels' feel good check list.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who says his right shoulder is stronger than at any time
last season, did nothing to disprove his claim as he went five
quality innings as the Angels beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in
front of a Tuesday night crowd of only 15,229 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Gil, who is replacing injured shortstop Gary DiSarcina, had a
single and a double while hitting out of the No. 9 slot in the
order.
</P>
<P>
   Gil's second inning single with two outs proved to perhaps be
the most timely hit for the Angels. Catcher Bengie Molina, another
Angel off to solid start, walked prior to Gil's single.
</P>
<P>
   Gil's base hit and Molina's walk kept the inning alive for the
red-hot Erstad, who promptly followed his first inning infield
single with a three-run homer to right to give Anaheim a 4-0 lead.
Erstad's homer gave him 17 hits in his first 33 at bats to start
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson opened four-run second with a double, the 176th
of his career, tying him for No. 7 on the all-time Angels list with
Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus put the Angels up 1-0 when Toronto shortstop Alex
Gonzalez couldn't quite keep Glaus' ground ball up the middle from
slipping far enough into center to allow Anderson to slide home
ahead of center fielder Jose Cruz Jr.'s throw home.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went up 5-0 when cleanup hitter Mo Vaughn, with no
homers and three RBI when he stepped to the plate, hit a harmless
looking fly ball down the left field line that eventually landed in
the seats for a solo homer. Vaughn's 338-foot opposite field job
was hardly the kind fans are used to seeing from the team's
high-priced slugger.
</P>
<P>
   While Ortiz bobbed and weaved through troubled spots in the
third and fourth innings, Toronto finally seemed to solve the
Angels' 24-year-old right-hander in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who has a slight tear of his labrum (shoulder) went five
innings and gave up eight hits and four walks, but just two runs.
He also struck out four while throwing 83 pitches (43 strikes).
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz took a shutout into the fifth after striking out both Raul
Mondesi and Carlos Delgado, the third and fourth hitters in the
Blue Jays' lineup, with runners at second and third.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Ortiz, whose fastball was consistently clocked in
the low 90's, got Cruz Jr., to line softly to second base for an
inning-ending double play, Earlier in the inning, Vaughn fielded
Darrin Fletcher's soft ground ball and threw out Brad Fullmer at
home.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Toronto cut it to 5-2 when Mondesi, the former
Dodger who heard boos here and there, atoned for his earlier strike
out with a two-run homer to left, his first of the year and just
his second and third RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado followed with a double, but Ortiz was bailed out of the
fifth when Molina picked Delgado off of second base. Molina also
cut down leadoff man Shannon Stewart with a perfect throw to second
base on a first inning stolen base attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi scored on a Lou Pote wild pitch in the seventh inning
and Stewart's RBI single cashed in Cruz Jr., who opened the eighth
with a triple down the right field line.

DALLAS' LEADING MAN MIKE MODANO BOUNCES BACK FROM STRIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mike Modano's problems began with the greatest moment
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He had just won the Stanley Cup, giving him everything he
wanted. He had a six-year, $43.5 million contract, builders ready
to break ground on his dream house and, by summer's end, an
engagement to his high-school sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   So why then wasn't he happy? Modano asked himself that exact
same question as he lay by his pool last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of things going on, on my plate,'' Modano
admitted. ``Planning a house, planning a wedding and still having
to play hockey and concentrate on that. It just seemed to be too
much at one time. Yeah, I was buried by it.''
</P>
<P>
   He needed to simplify. By February, he had fired his agent,
called off his engagement, sold the land on which he was going to
build the house, and, somewhere along the way, he became arguably
the best player in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   He has 22 goals and 24 assists since Jan. 20 _ numbers that only
Colorado's Joe Sakic has bested _ turning a lackluster beginning
into a MVP-type season.
</P>
<P>
   And the season looks even better when you consider all the
changes in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what people on the outside forget a lot. We're human
just like everybody else, and we have personal problems,'' Stars
forward Guy Carbonneau said. ``Whether it's your mom or parents,
wife or kids, there are difficult things in our lives that for a
fan they don't see. For a human being, it's draining. This is the
stuff that is more important than the game.'' \Nsubheds:THE BIG
FALL Modano should've been happy. He was coming off maybe the best
hockey of his life.
</P>
<P>
   What he did in the Stanley Cup Finals, while not largely noticed
or noted, was be probably the Stars best player. Not only did he
once and for all shed his image as ``soft'' by taking injections so
he'd be able to play with a broken bone in his wrist, but he proved
himself worthy of Conn Smythe consideration as playoff MVP and
inclusion among the best players in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a thing that Mo was a changed player,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Yeah, but it's like `OK, you're a
changed player.' But when it is on the line, are you a changed
player? Or do you revert back to old form?
</P>
<P>
   ``And he was a changed player.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a player more committed to winning than to stats, more
about substance than style. If winning the Cup was his belated
coming-out party, this season was supposed to be his chance to
flaunt it. He began talking of possibly breaking the 100-point
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   He broke his nose instead. He was lucky the broken nose, a mild
concussion and strained neck ligaments were all he suffered after a
scary collision with the end boards. It was only the second game of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, on the same night that his engagement to longtime
girlfriend Kerri Nelson was announced on the Jumbotron, his life
seemed to be spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   It could've been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   As he was being wheeled from the ice on Oct. 2, he remembers
thinking it was. Would I walk again? Should I play again?
</P>
<P>
   He eventually decided yes, returning three games later. But this
wasn't the same Mike Modano as before the injury. The injury
combined with lethargy from a long playoff run caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as you want to say it doesn't effect you, it does,''
Stars winger Brett Hull said. ``I'm not going to blame anyone for
it, but I know for a fact that looking at him and playing with him
and him looking at me and him playing with me, that here's two guys
that just there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm at the start of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   You could see it on the ice. The Stars struggled. Modano
couldn't score.
</P>
<P>
   And Modano probably would've skated along in this funk all
season had it not been for Derian Hatcher's injury Dec. 17. Hatcher
would miss six to eight weeks. The Stars needed a new captain. With
Nieuwendyk hurt, too, Modano was the only choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably came at a good time,'' Modano said. ``Everything
was spinning out of control, and I think that kind of gave me a
little direction.'' \Nsubheds:THE HAPPY ENDING Of course, the
Hollywood version would have Modano's comeback beginning as soon as
he became captain. But he was consistent, not spectacular. So
Hitchcock sat him down in January and they talked.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard talk in which things were said that maybe people
don't want to hear. It was one of many hard discussions Modano has
had to have recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was figuring out what I should be doing and who I should be
with, building houses and getting rid of agents and getting rid of
investors. I'm not really one to upset people,'' Modano said. ``I
try to keep people happy all the time and please everybody, and
then it all of a sudden comes back to haunt me. I finally had to do
something. It was out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   His last, and probably hardest, talk was with Nelson. He had to
tell someone he cared very much about that he just wasn't ready to
get married.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't my time,'' Modano said. ``That's what we talked
about. I needed some time to think about if this is what I want to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the buildup to it, to get the nerve to say that or
mention what you are going to do, to explain it to somebody that
you don't want them to work for you anymore, you don't want to
spend your life with that somebody any more. It took me days to
build up the courage.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally did. He moved out of his house into a hotel in
Dallas. He's closed on a house in Highland Park. He's taken a
more-active role in the handling of his finances. He's simplified.
</P>
<P>
   And his happiness started to fall into place during the worst
season of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me 11 years to get the right people around me,''
Modano said. ``Everybody has a great idea. Everybody has a
bullet-proof plan as far as what to do with your money and how you
should run your life, but nobody can tell you. You have to figure
it out for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He has, too. Because for the first time in a long time, he can
honestly say he's happy.

KIDS GET LESSON ON THRIFTY HABITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some money-savvy fourth-graders learned a valuable
lesson Tuesday: Start saving part of their allowance now, and in 10
years they might get what they really want, including a car or
money for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start saving now, you will have a lot of money and will
find yourself in a much better place when you're 20,'' Jenny Brown,
a financial analyst with Citibank in suburban Encino, advised the
students at Sherman Oaks Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   To help encourage savings, Brown gave the pupils wallets,
chocolate money, pens, calendars and snow globes by Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   The program was part of National Teach Children to Save Day
activities in which bankers discussed money matters with students
at 2,500 schools across the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to the banking industry, average Americans spend $9.99
of every $10 they earn, which has plunged the nation's savings rate
to one of its lowest levels since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``While today's kids can surf the Internet or use a CD-ROM to do
their homework, some don't know the fundamentals of saving,''
Donald Ogilve, executive vice president of the American Bankers
Association, said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   At Sherman Oaks Elementary, many of the students' parents work
in the financial industry, and some kids are already very
interested in money management.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for children 8 through 10 ``to talk with someone
who works in a bank,'' said Lynnette Yick, a fourth-grade teacher
whose class participated in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run it's good to start saving young.''
</P>
<P>
   A discussion with a financial planner early in life ``is
planting a seed now to start saving money'' and learn ways to do
it, Yick said. Brown talked with the children about budgeting and
setting priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said kids need to be taught how to spend money and to
distinguish between needs, as for food, and desires for things such
as Pokemon cards now and someday a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need to figure out whether savings is a need,'' she said.
``Savings is absolutely a need. ... You can't survive without
savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown urged the 27 fourth-graders to save 10 percent of their
allowance or gift money before spending anything on Pokemon cards.
</P>

   With access to money and growing consumer clout, young people
need to develop good financial habits, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent KidSense Money Survey of 1,000 students 12
to 17, 50 percent said they had never been taught the facts of
money by their parents. One in two said they received no training
on the facts of money in school.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Youth and Money Survey found a majority of students 16
to 22 have never taken a class in personal finance. Conducted by
the Washington-based American Savings Education Council, the survey
also found that two-thirds admitted they could use more lessons on
money management.
</P>
<P>
   Without education on finance, most people are not prepared for
their elder years, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see clients who are 45 years old and have saved between
$100,000 (and) $145,000, thinking it's enough for retirement,''
said Brown. ``Well, it's not enough. People need to plan for the
long term.''

MAVERICKS' DEFENSE STUNS TRAIL BLAZERS

<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks' Mark Cuban era began triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban received the NBA's seal of approval yesterday in New York,
and the Mavericks rewarded their new owner by beating the NBA's
second-best team last night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks stunned the Portland Trail Blazers, 92-81, despite
being outrebounded, 59-37, and dazed general manager/coach Don
Nelson in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we're winning some of these games,'' Nelson
said after the Mavericks' fifth consecutive victory. ``How do you
get outrebounded by 20 in this league and win? I have no idea, but
we've done it all season long. It amazes me, but our defense was
strong enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' defensive effort stymied the Trail Blazers, who
entered the contest as the league's best-shooting team. The Trail
Blazers connected on 34.6 percent of their field-goal attempts
(28-of-81) and further hurt their cause by misfiring on 14 of their
33 free-throw attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' defensive improvement can be traced to the recent
hiring of Del Harris as their defensive coordinator, but ``a lot of
it was us deciding to work harder on the defensive end,'' point
guard Steve Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks center Shawn Bradley played a role in Portland's
offensive meltdown. The 7-foot-6 center blocked five shots and
altered many others during his 29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley played the second half with a tender left knee after
straining it with 1:22 remaining in the first half. Bradley
returned during the third period and made an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad he was able to play the second half,'' Nelson
said. ``The fact that he came back after his injury and played well
was a factor in a lot of their missed shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks began the third quarter with a four-point
advantage and extended it to 15 with 9:57 remaining. Portland's
Greg Anthony fouled Bradley on a layup, and the center completed
the 3-point play with the ensuing free throw that gave the
Mavericks a 71-56 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, though, answered with Bonzi Wells, who scored all 11
of his points during the final period. The Trail Blazers twice
pulled within six points, but the Mavericks' Michael Finley never
allowed the visitors closer.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who scored a game-high 24 points, nailed a 3-pointer
with 4:51 remaining, and his 20-foot jumper as the shot clock
expired with 2:35 remaining sealed the Trail Blazers' fate.
</P>
<P>
   Nash continued to serve as the Mavericks' catalyst. The 6-foot-3
guard scored all of his nine points during the second half and
finished with six assists and no turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Steve Nash's line, and it's not very impressive,''
Nelson said. ``Yet, he's the main reason we won. He made every
right play, defended and ran a great game. His line doesn't look
all that good, but he was the guy tonight. There's no question
about it.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly The Mavericks established a season
high with their fifth consecutive victory and remain unbeaten this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Trail Blazers center Rasheed Wallace earned his NBA-leading 36th
technical foul. Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki drew an offensive
foul from Wallace with 3:51 remaining in the third quarter.
Obviously, Wallace disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' 81 points marked the fewest scored against the
Mavericks this season. The Bulls scored 83 during the Mavericks'
12-point victory Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was the Blazers' first player to score in double figures
with his 10th and 11th points with 7:35 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' 36 victories matched the 1994-95 team's total for
the ninth-most in franchise history.

TECHNICOLOR BUYS CANADA'S ASTRALTECH

<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Technicolor Inc., the world's largest film
print, videocassette and DVD production and distribution company,
said Tuesday that it will buy AstralTech, Canada's second-largest
duplicator of videocassettes, for $17.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition helps Technicolor solidify its presence in the
growing Canadian market and gives the company increased capacity to
produce digital video discs, which are gaining popularity as a home
video format.
</P>
<P>
   ``AstralTech already has a well-established retail direct
distribution infrastructure,'' said Quentin Lilly, president of
Technicolor Video Media Services.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's video market is growing at a steady pace, Lilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Technicolor, a subsidiary of the British conglomerate Carlton
Communications, has a DVD plant in Camarillo with the capacity to
produce 18 million discs per year. That is expected to double by
the end of this year because of an expansion at the plant, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   The AstralTech acquisition gives Technicolor facilities in
Montreal and Toronto, into which Technicolor plans to consolidate
its own existing duplication and distribution operations.
</P>
<P>
   AstralTech will become part of Technicolor's Packaged Media
Group _ the company's largest division, comprised of video
manufacturing, optical manufacturing and distribution operations.
</P>
<P>
   All of AstralTech's 360-plus video duplication and distribution
employees are being offered positions with Technicolor, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Technicolor's Canadian operation will have the capacity to
produce more than 45 million videocassette units a year.
</P>
<P>
   The move also better positions Technicolor to become one of
Canada's leading DVD packaged media manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   AstralTech's regional strength in Canada should meld well with
Technicolor's global leadership, AstralTech General Manager Andre
Pagotto said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is geared mostly for videocassette production,
AstralTech's existing infrastructure can support expansion into
DVD, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has the capacity this year to produce in excess of
800 million videocassettes, 150 million DVDs and 500 million CDs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to video duplication and distribution, Technicolor
also processes film and produces release prints of films for
distribution. The company also is working on developing a digital
distribution system for movies.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided
Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a
meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night. But
later, the boy's great-uncle said in Miami that the meeting was
off.
</P>
<P>
   In frantic last-minute negotiations, as the Justice Department
prepared to order the transfer on Thursday morning in Florida,
representatives of the Miami relatives and Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
Elian's father, agreed to a meeting in the Washington, D.C., area,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before midnight, Lazaro Gonzales, the great-uncle
who has custody of the boy, emerged from his house in Miami and
said Elian did not want to go to Washington, so no one from the
Miami family would go, The Associated Press reported. A crowd
gathered there erupted with cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said early Wednesday morning that efforts
were still under way to try to arrange the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The officials had said that Elian would be accompanied by Lazaro
Gonzalez and Lazaro's 21-year-old daughter, Marisleysis Gonzalez.
Until Tuesday, the family had sought a meeting with the boy's
father, but had demanded that it occur in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, if it takes place as planned, would end the lengthy
custody battle with a peaceful transfer that Attorney General Janet
Reno had struggled to piece together. After the meeting was
announced, Justice Department officials expressed satisfaction that
the end seemed to be in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Turning Elian over to his father would settle the issue in the
view of immigration officials. Those officials said they would urge
Elian's father to remain in the United States until the courts
finally decide whether the boy should return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've encouraged them to talk and tried to facilitate from the
start,'' one official said. ``We're happy that this appears to be
an an opportunity for a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The first indication that the long dispute might be close to a
conclusion came late Tuesday night from Miami where a spokeswoman
for the Cuban American National Foundation said that
representatives of the Miami relatives would meet with Elian's
father on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., had helped
arrange the meeting. Efforts to reach Torricelli on Tuesday night
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The development came after a hectic day in which Reno had first
considered and then canceled plans to visit Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has told aides at the Justice Department for several days
that she was convinced that her direct intervention could soothe
the fiery passions within the Cuban-American population of Miami,
where Reno grew up and where she served for 15 years as the elected
local prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Reno has spoken emotionally and emphatically at
news conferences and television interviews about her sympathy for
the many Cuban-Americans who vehemently oppose sending Elian back
to the homeland ruled by of Fidel Castro, whom Reno has said she
unequivocally opposes.
</P>
<P>
   But she has also said that international politics should not
block the reunion of father and son, an outcome that she said was
correct as a long-established matter of immigration law and family
values. Pediatric psychiatrists, she said, have recommended turning
over Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possibility of an angry confrontation over the boy
has haunted negotiations between the government and Elian's Florida
relatives ever since fishermen plucked him from the Atlantic Ocean
off Florida on Thanksgiving after his mother drowned in their
voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have said they would obey the law, including a
court order allowing the government to transfer custody to Elian's
father, but until Tuesday night, they had never agreed to turn the
child over to his father, repeatedly asking for further legal
review of whether the child should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seemed headed to a showdown when last week, Elian's
father arrived in the United States to retrieve his son from the
Miami relatives, who were granted temporary custody until federal
authorities ordered that the boy be reunited with his father.
Gonzalez has told authorities he intends to take his son back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the boy's relatives offered a proposal that was
officially ignored by the Justice Department. In a letter
distributed outside the Miami home of Lazaro Gonzalez, the
great-uncle with whom Elian has been living, the family said it
would be willing to meet Elian's father at any ``neutral place in
South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter added that the session would be followed immediately
by a second meeting with the father that would include Elian. The
relatives sought an assurance from the government that Elian would
not be forcibly taken from them at the proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who is staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat
in a Washington, D.C., suburb, had said he does not want to meet
the Miami relatives, but would fly to Florida if necessary to pick
up his son. Afterward, the father has said, the adult members of
the Gonzalez family might seek a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department Tuesday, two Miami area mayors, Alex
Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Joseph Carollo of Miami, met with
Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the immigration service,
and urged the attorney general to arrange a meeting between Elian's
father and the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Reno issued a statement saying that she
welcomed their suggestions. She added, ``The mayors have asked me
to speak with leaders of the Miami community and I have indicated
my willingness and desire to do so. We agreed to continue working
together to seek an outcome that allows Elian to be reunited with
his father in the best way possible for him, his family and for the
Miami community as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Juan Miguel Gonzalez has said he does not want to
defect to the United States, the House Republican leadership and
Cuban-American lawmakers Tuesday invited him to a private meeting
on Wednesday in the Capitol. The lawmakers said in a letter to
Elian's father, which was delivered by congressional aides, that
they wanted him ``to be sure that you are aware of all the options
available to you as you make your decision.''

SUNS DISPOSE OF CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers double-dared the Sports Illustrated
jinx Tuesday by losing for the 63rd time in 77 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was their first public appearance since this week's magazine
cover declared Donald T. Sterling's franchise the worst in sports
history. But with six seasons of 60-plus defeats in the bank since
moving north from San Diego, the Clippers should be immune from the
historically bad karma invited by an SI cover.
</P>
<P>
   Jinx? Bring it on.
</P>
<P>
   So, with no fear of going even lower to deter them, the Clips
were beaten, 95-88, by the Phoenix Suns before 14,724 at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be approaching games not to be
embarrassed,'' said Clipper rookie Lamar Odom, who roared out of a
two-week funk by providing 26 points, 15 rebounds and 6 assists,
``but that's where we are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling was elsewhere Tuesday, and his was occupied by actor
George Segal, whose sitcom ``Just Shoot Me,'' was not inspired by
the Clipper owner.
</P>
<P>
   That title also had nothing to do with Phoenix management, which
is dealing with catastrophic injuries to Jason Kidd and Tom
Gugliotta. Cliff Robinson continued picking up the slack by scoring
22 points to lead the playoff-prepping Suns (50-27).
</P>
<P>
   Another celebrity to preview this Clipper fall was University of
Cincinnati forward Kenyon Martin, winner of the John Wooden Award
and lead suspect as the Clips' drive to earn the first pick in the
NBA Draft. The Clippers' 13th consecutive loss also included the
season's first recorded sighting of a paper bag hiding the face of
a Clipper fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious hits us in the face sometimes,'' said interim
coach Jim Todd, addressing his team's all-too-familiar story line
of solid start, rotten finish.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a 12-point effort from Derek Anderson, they led, 22-15,
after Tuesday's first quarter. Anderson, an aspiring free agent who
may think this situation is too bad to come back for an encore,
almost decided his back was too bad to compete vs. the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   But he mustered up enough grit to punch in 25 points. Anderson
fired in 18 of those by intermission, but a 28-18 second-quarter by
Phoenix had the Suns up, 43-40, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Odom had an equal split of 14 third-quarter points,
as the home team entered the fourth quarter tied at 65.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter was typically smelly for the Clips. Thirteen
seconds after a 19-foot jumper by Penny Hardaway gave Phoenix the
lead for good (74-72) at 7:36, Anderson retired with lower back
spasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs got week, so I shut it down,'' said Anderson, who
didn't make the trip to Salt Lake City for tonight's game with the
Utah Jazz and is expected to miss Friday's game at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Another question mark is forward Maurice Taylor, who aggravated
his left-ankle injury, while finishing with 8 points on 4-of-12
shooting. He also aggravated Todd with a couple of untimely shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like it's getting worse,'' said Taylor, presumably
referring to his bad wheel.

DECATHLON HIT BY LOCAL COACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL O'DONOGHUE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the eve of the prestigious National Academic
Decathlon competition, a coalition of decathlon coaches _ including
those from former U.S. champs El Camino Real and Moorpark high
schools _ accused the sponsor of plagiarism and inaccuracy in its
test materials.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page letter sent last month by 42 decathlon coaches from
the Los Angeles Unified School District says the test materials,
which help students prepare for the grueling annual competition in
10 subjects, are ``replete with errors, often plagiarized and are
sold for an exorbitant cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, a copy of which was obtained Tuesday by the Daily
News, demands an overhaul of the board's study preparation process,
as well as the tests and the competition itself. The coaches said
they are prepared to withdraw from of the national competition and
form their own contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not happy with the direction USAD is heading,''
said Jim Hatem, who has coached Los Angeles High School teams for
the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues will be addressed later this week, when the
national competition kicks off in San Antonio, Texas, with Simi
Valley High School representing California. The USAD board is
slated Friday to review the recommendations of a task force set up
to address the coaches' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview from San Antonio, USAD Executive Director
James Alvino refused to release the proposed recommendations.
However, he acknowledged that the study guides, which cost $495 per
set and contain booklets on seven of the 10 subjects, had many
errors.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the errors _ such as incorrect figures for the
population of China and the wrong dates for construction of the
Suez Canal _ on a contractor hired to write the study guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some of the materials this year, there were an inordinate
amount of errors,'' Alvino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired a contractor who let us down in a big way and we
didn't discover this until the materials were printed and
distributed. However, whenever we did get an allegation of a
mistake, we thoroughly assessed it ... and if we could verify it,
then all corrections were were posted on the Web site as errata and
sent it out to the (coaches).''
</P>
<P>
   Alvino emphasized that most of the errors occurred in the Social
Science book and said USAD will increase its reviews of future
study guides to detect errors.
</P>
<P>
   In response to coaches' complaints of widespread plagiarism in
the study guides, Alvino said material was used from other sources,
but was used legally and cited appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were materials ... lifted from other sources and, in
some cases, certain paragraphs in a row lifted verbally from other
sources and we were concerned about this. And we had our attorneys
look at this issue, and their opinion was that, given the
legitimacy of the sources from which the material was taken and the
small amount taken from the sources and put in our guides, we were
covered by the fair-use part of the copyright laws,'' said Alvino.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in San Antonio, Simi Valley Coach Ken Hibbitts said he,
too, had concerns about errors in the study materials, but had not
written or signed any letter of complaint. While he would like
improvements made, he said he wants to see the national program
continue intact.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Jones, the coach of last year's national champion
Moorpark High School team, and other coaches have sent letters of
complaint to USAD.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has taken issue with what he considers the exorbitant cost
of study guides and accused USAD of trying to make money despite
its nonprofit status.
</P>
<P>
   But Alvino rejected those arguments, saying that USAD offers
bulk discounts and is a nonprofit organization with no objectives
of making large amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Michelle Bergman, this year's Moorpark High coach and
an assistant coach of last year's national winners, also have
expressed similar concerns. Both also said they would join with the
Los Angeles coaches' threat to break away from USAD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would help anyone to get a grass-roots competition going,
and our students are aware of this, too,'' Bergman said. ``There
could be secession because we feel like they're really going away
from the students' education and it's kind of money-driven now is
the feeling we all have.''

ORTIZ KEEPS ANGELS ROLLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- To this point - and yes, it is still very, very early
- seemingly every question concerning the 2000 Angels has met with
a positive response.
</P>
<P>
   Our pitchers Ken Hill and Jason Dickson healthy? Check and
check. Is Scott Schoeneweis ready to become a big league starter?
Check. Can Darin Erstad rebound from a sub-par 1999? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to add pitcher Ramon Ortiz and backup shortstop Benji
Gil to the Angels' feel good check list.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who says his right shoulder is stronger now than at any
time last season, did nothing to disprove his claim as he went five
quality innings to pick up the win as the Angels defeated the
Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in front of a Tuesday night crowd of only
15,229 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Gil, who is replacing injured shortstop Gary DiSarcina, had a
single and a double while hitting out of the No. 9 slot in the
order.
</P>
<P>
   Gil's second inning single with two outs proved to perhaps be
the most timely hit for the Angels. Catcher Bengie Molina, another
Angel off to solid start, walked prior to Gil's single.
</P>
<P>
   Gil's base hit and Molina's walk kept the inning alive for the
red-hot Erstad, who promptly followed his first inning infield
single with a three-run homer to right to give Anaheim a 4-0 lead.
Erstad's homer gave him 17 hits in his first 33 at bats to start
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson opened four-run second with a double, the 167th
of his career, tying him for No. 7 on the all-time Angels list with
Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus' RBI single cashed in Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went up 5-0 when Mo Vaughn, with no homers and three
RBI when he stepped to the plate, hit a harmless looking fly ball
down the left field line that eventually landed in the seats for a
solo homer.
</P>
<P>
   While Ortiz bobbed and weaved through troubled spots in the
third and fourth innings, Toronto finally seemed to solve the
Angels' 24-year-old right-hander in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who has a slight tear of his labrum (shoulder) went five
innings and gave up seven hits and four walks, but just two runs.
He also struck out four while throwing 83 pitches -43 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased with his velocity and he still had good stuff
into the fifth,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``When push
came to shove, he made some tremendous pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz took a shutout into the fifth after striking out both Raul
Mondesi and Carlos Delgado with runners at second and third to end
the third.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Ortiz, whose fastball was consistently clocked in
the low 90's, got Jose Cruz Jr., to line softly to second base for
an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Toronto cut it to 5-2 when Mondesi, the former
Dodger who heard boos here and there, atoned for his earlier strike
out with a two-run homer to left, his first of the year and just
his second and third RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado followed with a double, but Ortiz was bailed out of the
fifth when Molina picked Delgado off of second base. Molina also
cut down leadoff man Shannon Stewart with a perfect throw to second
base on a first inning stolen base attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi scored on a Lou Pote wild pitch in the seventh inning
and Stewart's RBI single cashed in Cruz Jr., who opened the eighth
with a triple down the right field line.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Troy Percival blew the Blue Jays away in the ninth,
striking out the side the included Mondesi, Delgado (with a 97 mph
fastball), and Brad Fullmer to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy Percival definitely stepped it up a notch tonight,''
Scioscia said. ``He was throwing well before, but tonight was a
different story. That pitch he threw to Delgado was nasty.''

<P>
   SEOUL _ The immediate question surrounding the surprise
agreement for a June summit between the two Kims of the two Koreas
is what bearing it will have on the National Assembly elections in
the South on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, however, are the questions it raises about the
latest goals and tactics of the North.
</P>
<P>
   There never was any question that the South's president, Kim Dae
Jung, was prepared to go to some lengths to get a summit, though as
yet we know nothing of any conditions or agenda.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to show some apparent results from the ``sunshine''
policy towards the North. There is little real opposition to the
policy if only because there is scant alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Debate centers more around the cost of the carrots to be offered
to lure Pyongyang to what the South hopes is an ultimately
self-destructive opening to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   With the economic crisis now receding into history, Kim Dae Jung
was seen in danger of becoming a lame duck less than halfway
through his term if he could not make progress with the North.
</P>
<P>
   He also hankers after a Nobel Peace Prize and a name in the
history books, so he has to take risks.
</P>
<P>
   The summit announcement will have limited impact on the
election, which is dominated by domestic issues, regionalism,
corruption allegations and personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Though some may react against Kim's party if they perceive the
summit announcement as an electoral gimmick, the opposition fears
it could swing several marginal seats in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   The timing might suggest that Kim Jong Il wants to give his
opposite number an electoral boost because the North needs
``sunshine'' to provide money and as a bargaining chip in its
dealings with the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it is of no actual electoral value, the North's leader
will want to infer that Kim Dae Jung owes him a favor. The North is
now a real factor in South politics.
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, the summit breakthrough suggests that
Pyongyang has changed tacks in its triangular dealings with the
United States, Japan and Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Until now it has concentrated its hopes on improving relations
with the United States and Japan and ignored the South. It needs
U.S. recognition and Japanese money.
</P>
<P>
   But talks with Washington following William Perry's Pyongyang
trip have bogged down, mainly on the issue of missile sales.
Likewise, Japan is still smarting from missile tests across its
bows and is reluctant to be as generous as Pyongyang wants.
</P>
<P>
   So Kim Jong Il now sees the South as a better prospect for
raising cash and an escape from its over-expectations from its
dialogue with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il probably exaggerates the South's willingness to
spend money on the North especially now that the government has
deficits and the chaebol cannot count on reciprocal favors if they
do what the president wants.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, if anyone has any incentive to spend money on the
North, it is a South that retains some brotherly feelings and
respect for the power of money.
</P>
<P>
   The summit may well end up as a photogenic gesture that has
short-term political benefits for both leaders but makes no
progress on substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
   The North is sure to get some cash benefits. Where it leaves Kim
Dae Jung is another matter. He will need to show that this leads to
benefits for all Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   What does the summit say about domestic politics in the North?
It certainly gives Kim Jong Il a higher profile, suggests that he
is in charge and prepared to take a risk.
</P>
<P>
   If there were opposition, he could claim that he was just
following in the giant footsteps of his father, who died 1n 1994
days before he was due to meet South Korea's president, Kim Young
Sam. He will have been under pressure from China to be
conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kim Dae Jung has been conspicuously silent about the
election of fellow democrat and one-time dissident Chen Shui-bian
in Taiwan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recent signals from Pyongyang have been mixed. Foreign aid
agencies are leaving because of their inability to provide to those
really in need. Potential big investors such as Hyundai have been
treated as sources of quick cash. The food situation has improved a
little but is still abysmal.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Pyongyang diplomacy has been building new
links with Europe, starting with full relations with Italy, and
there are some slight signs of domestic change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to expect much out of the summit. But Korea
is full of unreason, and surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, Kim Il Sung and the military realize that
their situation is untenable and that a big deal with the South is
their only chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, any opening to the South, whether to Kim Dae Jung or
a few tourists, is one little step towards the day when North
Koreans realize how they have been oppressed.
</P>
<P>
   The only losers from a summit, other than the South's taxpayers
and opposition politicians, are those who fear eventual Korean
reunification. &QL;

prepared text before him, his words flow more freely than during
daylight. He talks of frivolous things (Pokemon cards and movie
plots) and serious matters (how he almost lost his job as
president). He abandons the cautious verbiage he uses from 9 to 5,
lashing out at political opponents as though he were still a
candidate. It is a side of Clinton that has been prominent at other
times, but in the twilight of his presidency, with fewer and fewer
big policy events and more and more fund-raisers, it is a side that
is becoming more dominant. By Marc Lacey.

   SPONSORS-MOTIVATE (Atlanta) _ When the Olympic Games open in
Australia this summer, about 30 athletes will represent Egypt.
Sixty will make up the contingent from Turkey. And nearly 100 will
make up the delegation from Home Depot. The company's orange logo
will not appear on the the Olympic athletes' uniforms, of course,
and television commentators probably won't even mention the giant
retailer's name. But in cities and towns around North America,
thousands of Home Depot employees will stay up late to root for the
athletes on TV and get up the next morning to devour the accounts
of their exploits in the sports pages. That, it turns out, is the
audience Home Depot executives are trying to reach. When a company
employs 210,000 people in an industry with one of the highest
turnover rates in the country _ in the midst of one of the tightest
job markets in more than three decades _ it does what it has to do
to hold onto every last one of them. By David Leonhardt.

   OPERATION-SMILE (Undated) _ Acknowledging for the first time
that its organization lacked proper oversight, Operation Smile
notified its chapters last week that it was enacting sweeping
reforms at the suggestion of an outside lawyer retained by the
organization to review its conduct. The reforms are aimed at
addressing serious criticism that arose last year, following two
articles published by the New York Times, over the charity's
management and the quality of its medical care. The charity, which
helps thousands of underprivileged children overseas obtain plastic
surgery but has had some patients die, said it would be stepping up
efforts to hire a new chief executive officer and adding the
position of chief medical officer. By Reed Abelson.

<P>
   RITEAID-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Rite Aid, having failed to find
buyers for its PCS Health Systems subsidiary, has announced a plan
to refinance its debt for more than two years, giving it access to
more than $640 million in additional funds. The deal came at a cost
of higher interest rates on some of its borrowings and substantial
dilution for its stockholders. Shares of Rite Aid rose $1.625, to
$7.3125. By Floyd Norris.
</P>
<P>
   SPONSORS-MOTIVATE (Atlanta) _ When the Olympic Games open in
Australia this year, 55 athletes will be representing Thailand.
Seventy-five will make up the contingent from Argentina. Ninety
will run, jump, swim, and play for France. And approximately 100
will make up the delegation from the Home Depot Corp. Of course,
Home Depot's orange logo won't appear on the Olympic athletes'
uniforms, and television viewers are unlikely to hear much about
their connection to the giant retailer. But in cities and towns
across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, thousands of the
company's employees will be staying up late to watch them on TV and
scanning the next morning's newspapers to root for them. That, Home
Depot's executives say, is precisely the reason the company has
spent several million dollars hiring dozens more Olympic athletes
than any other company. The Olympic program is part of a broader
effort to use traditional marketing strategies, like sponsorships,
as a management tool. By David Leonhardt.

WUSA'S PLAN MAKES LITTLE SENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) made a bold
announcement Monday, indicating that it plans to launch its new
league in April of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The plan of the WUSA to go head-to-head with Major League Soccer
doesn't make a lot of sense. Why not compete in a different season,
a shorter season, so that soccer fans aren't asked to choose
allegiances?
</P>
<P>
   There is room for both professional leagues, but competing
against each other, especially with pro soccer at such a sensitive
stage in its development in this country, isn't the smartest move
on the WUSA's part.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more complicated, the MLS recently submitted its
own plan to start a women's professional league, hoping to use
league resources, offices and stadiums to piggy-back the women's
game with the men's game.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. This will never happen. MLS submitted its plan hoping
to discourage the WUSA.
</P>
<P>
   At least Discovery Communications founder John Hendricks seems
to have a credible plan to get the WUSA off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of financial support and an ambitious television
package to challenge the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks announced that he has raised $40 million, mostly from
television, to start WUSA's league.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Cablevision, Cox Enterprises, Cox Communications and
Time Warner Cable agreed to a four-year cable contract with Time
Warner that calls for 22 games to be broadcast nationally by either
TNT of CNN/SI.
</P>
<P>
   The WUSA has named New York, Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, San
Diego, San Francisco, Washington D.C. and Orlando as the eight
cities that will have teams. The WUSA also has support from the
entire U.S. Women's National Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting all the elements together for a successful
league and we are very optimistic and confident we will not be
disadvantaged in any way,'' Hendricks said. ``Our investment group
is fully capable of getting this league going and running.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS commissioner Don Garber released a statement indicating that
MLS hasn't given up the idea of having its own women's league next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are great believers in women's soccer,'' Garber said. ``We
have the experience, resources and operational expertise to
effectively create and manage a professional women's soccer
league.''
</P>
<P>
   For the good of the game, the MLS and WUSA need to sit down and
work out a plan that benefits everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Temple City High and Stanford graduate Erin Martin is one
keeping close tabs on the new women's leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Martin set the CIF state career scoring record at Temple City
with 286 goals before graduating in 1993. After graduating from
Stanford, Martin played professionally in Japan with the Fujita
Mercury. She played professionally last season in Sweden. Last
week, she left for New Zealand to try yet another professional
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a great time, it's been awesome to live in
different parts of the world,'' said Martin. ``The level of soccer
could be better, but the experience of different cultures is
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who played for the U.S. Under 20 National Team, was
never called to the full U.S. National Team but has played with or
against nearly every member of the U.S. Women's World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of facing U.S. National Team players again, in the
U.S., and against some of the best female players in the world,
certainly interests her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing abroad, but I would probably play here if a pro
league works out,'' said Martin. ``Not because I feel I have
anything to prove; I'm happy with how my career worked out. But it
would be nice to play in front of family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy midfielders Sasha Victorine, Peter Vagenas and defender
Dan Califf were named to the final 18-player pool for CONCACAF'S
2000 Olympic qualifying in Hershey, Pa., later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Victorine, who is an early candidate for MLS rookie of the year,
was asked how he felt about his newfound stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, I still go out and nobody recognizes me,'' joked
Victorine. ``I deposited a check the other day and the bank teller
asked if I worked for Adidas since I had an Adidas sponsored check
to deposit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I play for the Galaxy.' The teller said, `Come on, I
don't recognize you, all you guys say you play pro soccer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's humbling.

<P>
   A month ago, a young and well-liked Australian swimmer named
Lori Munz was badly hurt in an automobile crash near Sydney. The
collision left her with a concussion, a shattered kneecap which
required reconstructive surgery and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, she returned to the pool with her right leg in
a brace and did a few cautious laps with every intention of
competing in the Australian Olympic swimming trials in May.
</P>
<P>
   It is an inspirational story: ``Promising athlete with a chance
of winning a medal in a relay in her hometown Olympics battles the
odds and the ticking clock to keep her dreams afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is so inspirational that when Munz returned to the
pool, she already had signed exclusive agreements to tell her tale
to an Australian TV network and the newspaper consortium News Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Good for her, most of us would instinctively say. The
unfortunate young woman deserves every scrap of support _ both
emotional and financial _ she can get.
</P>
<P>
   Though I have never met Munz, I would be inclined to agree. A
shattered kneecap is a painful thing, but there is a part of me
that does not like the way the sports business _ and it is ever
more a business _ is evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Deals like the one Munz has signed underscore the fact that
misfortune is now just another selling point, along with
nationality and personality and _ lest we overlook the point of
this whole sweaty endeavor _ athletic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   If I were an unscrupulous, attention-hungry athlete with every
hope of qualifying for the Olympics but little hope of actually
winning something, I would not resort to taking
performance-enhancing drugs. I would instead attempt to make myself
into a great story.
</P>
<P>
   Option One: Find an equally unscrupulous physician to act as
co-conspirator _ why not ask around in cycling circles? _ and feign
a serious injury or illness several months before the Games begin.
</P>
<P>
   The injury or illness should be unusual and preferably one that
cannot be easily distinguished by observers. How about sudden
blindness, or chronic fatigue syndrome? Several months would allow
plenty of time for a dramatic yet plausible recovery; plenty of
time for sponsorship deals and plenty of time for interviews with
the media to build public awareness and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of this option is that it is result-proof. All that
matters is making it to the Games. Even elimination in the heats
would be seen as a form of triumph and would also forestall too
many nosy follow-up questions.
</P>
<P>
   Option Two: Experience misfortune at the Games themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Redmond, a British runner, pulled up lame at the Barcelona
Olympics. After he began hopping toward the line, his father leaped
out of the stands and helped his tearful son finish his race and
become a fixture on highlight programs.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond was legitimately injured, but that need not be the case.
A big idea will be required, however. Remember, there are only 16
days and 32 American news cycles from opening ceremony to closing
ceremony (Americans are particularly susceptible to human interest
stories) and much of that time will be devoted to the actual medal
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Those who choose to exercise one of these options should be
aware that there are risks. The possibility of being found out and
humiliated is real, although being unmasked would certainly help
the plotter's name recognition more than finishing seventh in the
men's hurdles or women's individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   The other potential problem is that, however creative and
inventive the ruse, it risks being overshadowed by reality.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Some listing, lutzing soul might hire a hit man to
break a rival's leg. &QL;

winning something, I would not resort to taking
performance-enhancing drugs. I would instead attempt to make myself
into a great story.
</P>
<P>
   Option One: Find an equally unscrupulous physician to act as
co-conspirator _ why not ask around in cycling circles? _ and feign
a serious injury or illness several months before the Games begin.
</P>
<P>
   The injury or illness should be unusual and preferably one that
cannot be easily distinguished by observers. How about sudden
blindness, or chronic fatigue syndrome? Several months would allow
plenty of time for a dramatic yet plausible recovery; plenty of
time for sponsorship deals and plenty of time for interviews with
the media to build public awareness and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of this option is that it is result-proof. All that
matters is making it to the Games. Even elimination in the heats
would be seen as a form of triumph and would also forestall too
many nosy follow-up questions.
</P>
<P>
   Option Two: Experience misfortune at the Games themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Redmond, a British runner, pulled up lame at the Barcelona
Olympics. After he began hopping toward the line, his father leaped
out of the stands and helped his tearful son finish his race and
become a fixture on highlight programs.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond was legitimately injured, but that need not be the case.
A big idea will be required, however. Remember, there are only 16
days and 32 American news cycles from opening ceremony to closing
ceremony (Americans are particularly susceptible to human interest
stories) and much of that time will be devoted to the actual medal
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Those who choose to exercise one of these options should be
aware that there are risks. The possibility of being found out and
humiliated is real, although being unmasked would certainly help
the plotter's name recognition more than finishing seventh in the
men's hurdles or women's individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   The other potential problem is that, however creative and
inventive the ruse, it risks being overshadowed by reality.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Some listing, lutzing soul might hire a hit man to
break a rival's leg. &QL;

   ``If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all
others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking
power called an idea... No one possesses the less, because every
other possess the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me,
receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who
lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thomas Jefferson's inspiring vision, there are no barriers to
the acquisition of knowledge. Nobody owns it, everybody partakes of
it _ and the world becomes richer.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries later, when knowledge has taken over much of the
economy, Jefferson's words seem to take on a new power. After all,
capital has always been one of the main economic barriers to entry,
and these days ideas are capital.
</P>
<P>
   If getting hold of capital becomes as easy as getting a light,
barriers to entry everywhere ought to be tumbling. So farewell,
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But how is it, in that case, that in America, one of the biggest
antitrust cases in history reached judgment this week, causing
turmoil in financial markets? And how is it that new monopolies in
cyberspace are being created all the time?
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that ideas are not in practice the free currency
that Jefferson observed them to be in their natural state.
Governments award property rights over ideas, making them
vulnerable to monopolists if the system is abused.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case is in many ways an old-fashioned sort of
antitrust affair about a dominant firm bullying smaller rivals. But
behind it lies a systemic worry, about the wired world's natural
susceptibility to monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the value of any good (say, a computer operating
system) depends on the number of users; so a new entrant has little
hope against a widely used product (say, Windows).
</P>
<P>
   The American administration has rightly become more alert to
incipient network monopolies of this kind. Which makes its policy
on patents even odder.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are the strongest form of intellectual-property right,
since they give holders a claim over ideas encapsulated in a work,
and not just (as copyright does) on the work's particular form.
Their purpose is to reward inventors so as to encourage future
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Society is balancing the benefits of a free exchange of ideas
against future gains from further invention. And the means of
striking this balance is to award a legal monopoly to a
patent-holder for 20 years from the date of application.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are booming: last year, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office awarded 161,000, nearly twice as many as ten years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because the value of knowledge has grown relative
to other assets _ so companies naturally want more of it. But it is
also because new kinds of patents are being awarded, in areas that
might have been thought unpatentable, such as computer software,
genetic engineering and, increasingly, Internet business methods.
</P>
<P>
   In this last category, America's patent office has recently
handed out monopolies on such simple ideas as group buying,
matching professionals with those seeking advice, one-click
shopping and reverse auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The patent office says there is no reason not to issue such
patents: they fulfil the criteria that ideas embodied in a patent
application must be novel, useful and non-obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But that invites a big question: does the law, which has barely
been changed in two centuries, still work? The patent office
retorts that the system's durability is testimony to its success,
as are the waves of technological change it has fostered.
</P>
<P>
   History's great inventors armed themselves with sheaves of
patents _ Edison, still the record-holder, had 1,093. Without such
protection, they would not have bothered.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet casts doubt on the need for such strong protection
today. Until recently, it was a patent-free zone in which good
ideas travelled freely. Clever people and capital flooded in. They
did not, apparently, need the incentive that patent protection
would have provided.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with the law is that it does not differentiate
between the incentives needed to invest in different kinds of
technologies. It accords as much protection to an idea thought up
in the bath as to a drug that may have taken many years and
hundreds of millions of dollars to move from conception to
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jeff Bezos, founder of the Internet retailer Amazon and the
holder of several business-method patents, has suggested in an open
letter posted on the Internet that software and business-method
patents should have a shorter life than other patents _ say, three
to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Inventors still need some protection, but they are getting too
much. America needs to scrap its one-size-fits all system, and
replace it with one that responds to the investment that an
invention represents.
</P>
<P>
   Patents should come in different shapes and sizes, or the system
will go on producing absurdities. &QL;

   The American Supreme Court foresaw the danger in 1882, when
ruling on the matter of boat-propeller technology: ``Such an
indiscriminate creation of exclusive privileges tends rather to
obstruct than to stimulate invention. It creates a class of
speculative schemers who make it their business to watch the
advancing wave of improvement, and gather its foam in the form of
patented monopolies, which enable them to lay a heavy tax on the
industry of the country, without contributing anything to the real
advancement of the arts.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It may have come as a shock to the markets, but few others can
have been surprised that Microsoft was this week found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the antitrust case against the software firm ruled
that it was a monopoly that had demonstrated a pattern of abuse,
done ``violence to the competitive process'' and ``placed an
oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune, thereby
guaranteeing its continued dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the verdict suggests that hopes of a negotiated
settlement were always slim. Too often in the past, Bill Gates's
firm has staved off punishment by appearing to accept restraints on
its behavior, only to cock a snook at regulators and resume its
aggressive business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gates talks earnestly about having ``gone the last
mile'' to achieve a settlement, Microsoft's proposals were too
limited, vague and loophole-ridden to be enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the Justice Department, and the 19 states
that joined it in the action, regard Microsoft as a hardened
recidivist that cannot be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   As the courtroom drama moves on to consider remedies, that same
lack of trust is sure to lead the plaintiffs to demand penalties of
a severe and far-reaching nature. That will not, however, make the
judge's task any easier.
</P>
<P>
   The two main aims are easy to state, but hard to balance. The
first requirement is that the remedies should deal with the central
problem, which is Microsoft's systematic exploitation of its
Windows operating-system monopoly to foreclose potential
competition, stifle innovation and gouge consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The second requirement is that the remedies should not damage
Microsoft's own ability to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   A package of conduct remedies along the lines rejected by
Microsoft in the settlement talks might just about have met the
first aim.
</P>
<P>
   It included provisions to stop Microsoft pricing Windows to
reward PC makers who do its bidding while punishing others; to stop
it tying products to Windows by sales contract; to end exclusionary
contracts; and to stop driving sales up by raising the price of
older versions of Windows whenever a new release comes out.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would also have had to offer a version of Windows
without its Internet Explorer browser and to publish details of new
versions of its system as soon as they became available to its own
developers.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with all these proposals is that they are
essentially retrospective (``saving Netscape with hindsight''), and
they are unlikely to stimulate new competition. They would also
require permanent and intrusive policing.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, such conduct remedies would not meet the second
requirement, because they would not preserve what is good about
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   A future as a semi-regulated monopoly on never-ending probation
_ still highly profitable, but increasingly dull-witted and
unrewarding to work for _ would be a living death.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft hopes to avoid such a fate by betting on a more
sympathetic hearing on appeal. It may even get one, but it is
highly unlikely that the company will emerge unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no knowing which way the Supreme Court, which is where
this matter will ultimately be resolved, will swing, but it would
not be the first time in the course of this case that Microsoft has
miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the more extreme solution of breaking the firm up
into at least two Windows companies and an applications firm might
now be the best outcome, not only for the Justice Department but
also for Microsoft itself.
</P>
<P>
   It would bring the discipline of real competition to the
operating-system companies, and release a wave of pent-up
innovation from the firm's clever staff.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it would put an end to Microsoft's unhealthy
passion for vertical integration and proprietary standards.
</P>
<P>
   A bolder and more imaginative Gates would now consider
restructuring the company along these lines himself, as a better
and more creative alternative to the terrifying legal lottery that
he appears to have chosen. &QL;

WEST'S MACHIAVELLI IS NO BETTER THAN IRAQ'S HUSSEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowly, inexorably, a generation is being crushed in Iraq.
Thousands are dying, thousands more are leading stunted lives, and
storing up bitter hatreds for the future.
</P>
<P>
   No fair-minded person could doubt that the man ultimately
responsible is Saddam Hussein: he could return his country to
respectability tomorrow if he wished, and to relative prosperity
the day after.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein is guileful as well as guilty, and the tormentor of
Iraq has manipulated events so that the West, through its
insistence on the continuance of the United Nations' sanctions, has
become the instrument of his countrymen's torment.
</P>
<P>
   At some stage, the West must decide whether it is prepared to go
on being used in this way. This, a moment of relative calm,
presents an opportunity to reconsider a policy that is now almost
ten years old.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable success of the policy so far is that Hussein
has been forced to destroy most of his lethal armory and is
constrained in his ability to use the biological weapons he is
surely developing.
</P>
<P>
   Any relaxation of the sanctions regime will almost certainly
help him a bit, at least in his presumed ambitions to wage
biological war.
</P>
<P>
   Since his record amply justifies the belief that he would, if he
could, one day exploit any capability for belligerence, any gains
the West might make from a change in policy must be set against the
loss in letting him strengthen his armory.
</P>
<P>
   So is there scope for any relaxation at all? A complete lifting
of all sanctions and constraints is out of the question. The aim,
rather, should be to remove the burden of sanctions from Iraqis at
large and direct it as much as possible at Saddam and his henchmen.
</P>
<P>
   That is the intention behind the oil-for-food scheme, an
arrangement that lets Iraq sell some of its oil, under U.N.
supervision, in exchange for food and medicine. Unfortunately, it
does not work.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is shattered, Iraqis scrabble for an
ever-more-miserable living, hundreds of children die each week _
and Hussein is still in power.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he can go about most of his business, whether building
palaces or making missiles, without any of the prying by the U.N.'s
inspectors that did so much to destroy his weapons program in the
1990s; after a split in the Security Council in 1998, and before a
round of bombing, they pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   So, thanks to cheating and smuggling, Hussein is slowly
gathering his strength while his people languish and the West is
blamed. That is the nub of the case for change.
</P>
<P>
   One possible course of action would be to amend the oil-for-food
scheme, making it easier for Iraq to import innocuous items needed
to repair its infrastructure and oil industry, while trying to keep
out the really dangerous imports and monitoring the items that may
be used for benign or malign purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, though fine in theory, has already been tried,
without much success in practice. As long as the scheme exists,
Hussein can manipulate it to his ends.
</P>
<P>
   So let Iraq export its own oil freely but keep the ban on all
weapons-making wherewithal and check as many of Iraq's suspicious
imports as possible?
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with that idea is that, within Iraq's borders, the
monitors would at best be able to check on the use of approved
machinery; they could not insist on entering any laboratory or
other suspicious building at random.
</P>
<P>
   And checking imports before they entered Iraq would be
laborious, and certainly not entirely effective.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hussein could get his hands on more money, and
therefore on more components for missiles and weapons. He is,
however, getting those anyway, just as he is carrying on most of
his activities largely uninspected.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. monitors do oversee the distribution of food and medicine
and check that spare parts for the oil industry are properly used,
but Iraq shows no sign being willing to readmit weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Under a British-American plan, accepted by the Security Council
in December, a new inspection team is to present itself this month.
Unfortunately, however, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
has already condemned it as ``stillborn'' and ``unworkable.''
</P>
<P>
   If, against expectations, the plan succeeds, well and good. If
it fails, America and Britain should continue to press for as much
monitoring as possible but show themselves ready to abandon
sanctions on oil sales in favor of dual-use inspections and import
checks, coupled with an unequivocal warning that any evidence of
cheating, let alone any threatening activity, will bring down
prodigious retribution from the air.
</P>
<P>
   This would certainly not guarantee good behavior from Hussein.
It would, however, throw the responsibility for the suffering of
innocent Iraqis straight back at him.
</P>
<P>
   If, year in, year out, the U.N. were systematically killing
Iraqi children by air strikes, western governments would declare it
intolerable, no matter how noble the intention. They should find
their existing policy just as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   In democracies, the end does not justify the means. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is in crisis. The blame lies almost entirely with
President Robert Mugabe and his ZANU-PF, the party that has ruled
the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The economic manifestations of this calamity are a worthless
currency, roaring inflation, burgeoning foreign debt, acute gas
shortages and fearsome unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Its political manifestations are peaceful demonstrations broken
up by violent thugs, the illegal occupation of more than 700
white-owned farms and an acrimonious dispute with Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Zimbabwe's involvement in a pointless war in Congo and
the fact that a quarter of its people have AIDS, and it is easy to
see that the government has plenty to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to it, though, you would imagine that the top priority
is land reform. This is the issue that it is ruthlessly exploiting
in an effort to win next month's election.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something changes, disaster will surely ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Land-ownership is important in peasant societies, especially so
in Zimbabwe, where the pressure of an exploding population is
combined with a pattern of holdings not greatly changed from that
inherited at independence, and memories endure of the tracts that
were awarded by the colonial government to whites.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no economic case for land reform _ Zimbabwe's
commercial farmers are efficient and produce most of its
foreign-exchange earnings _ the political argument is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, therefore, having botched Zimbabwe's birth, should help
out, so long as any reform is fair and carried out according to
legal principles. And, it should be said, so long as Zimbabwe is
run as a democracy in which the government respects the judiciary
and honors the results of free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   Here perhaps are the makings of a deal. The omens, however, are
not good.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has had 20 years in which to carry out land reform, yet
many of the white-owned farms secured for redistribution have gone
not to landless peasants but to government officials and the
president's cronies.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he went to the voters to seek permission to bring
in a new constitution, which would have allowed, among other
things, the government to seize (mainly white-owned) farms. The
voters rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, the government has resorted to occupations, which
it calls ``peaceful and legitimate demonstrations,'' despite one
killing this week.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations are also a way of attacking the opposition. By
intimidating the farmers _ almost all of whom, black or white, are
Zimbabweans _ the government's supporters hope to deny its
opponents a source of financial support.
</P>
<P>
   This is in character for a regime that has ruined a potentially
dynamic country by mismanagement and corruption. Mugabe and ZANU-PF
behave as if they own Zimbabwe. They make no distinction between
party and government.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has always swung between emotion and reason. Conceivably,
reason may regain the upper hand and he will allow the election to
be free and fair. But some nudging will almost certainly be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Britain can, improbably, extract a promise that he will
now stop harassing his opponents and honor the outcome of the poll.
If not, it will fall to South Africa, Zimbabwe's neighbor and
biggest trading partner, to try.
</P>
<P>
   If Mugabe were to steal the election, Zimbabwe would find itself
even more friendless at donors' conferences. That prospect must
cause alarm in South Africa: the last thing it needs is a
collapsing society on its doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   For Zimbabweans, it would be nothing short of a tragedy. &QL;

   Ending child labor in Pakistan can have unexpected consequences.
In the mid-1990s, Pakistani soccer-ball manufacturers were under

children for 80-hour-a-week shifts, working for pennies in near
darkness. The industry hastily made profound changes and, three
years later, child labor in Sialkot's soccer industry is mostly
history. The effects, though, have been double-edged. Like soccer

deal with China. That French philosopher-king, Jacques Chirac,
sends poems each month to China's president, Jiang Zemin, who
responds with his own calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet defense planners in western capitals play their games on the
assumption that the next big war may be between American-led forces
and a rising China bent on trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In America, big business lobbies Congress to treat China as a
normal trading nation, while Congress urges the administration to
sell more weapons to Taiwan, as defense against Communist Chinese
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Golden economic prize or rising international menace? Is China
one or the other? Both or neither?
</P>
<P>
   If China is not the golden economic prize it is made out to be,
then the world at the very least risks wasting a fabulous amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
   If it is not really the rising international menace that Senator
Jesse Helms makes it out to be, then treating it as such could, at
worst, help turn it into one.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the West would lose what influence it may have had in
nudging China away from its many dissatisfactions and down more
democratic paths.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign interest in China's commercial promise typically follows
a roller-coaster course that starts in hope and ends in despair.
Hopes are rising again, with the prospect that China may be a
member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   This has long been the stuff of salesmen's dreams: 2.6 billion
armpits to deodorize.
</P>
<P>
   Added fervor comes from the Internet craze, with foreigners
falling over themselves to invest in Chinese dot.coms _ no matter
that government deems such investment illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Time to clear up a misunderstanding. China has never been the
prize that foreign businessmen have imagined _ foreigners earn an
average return on equity of just 3.3 percent _ and will not be for
a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the place is still miserably poor: average income per
person is less than $1,000 a year. Indeed, China probably should
not be buying many of the aircraft, power plants and capital goods,
not to mention the fighters, bombers and submarines, that outsiders
are selling it.
</P>
<P>
   Should the economy really take a tumble _ after an American
economic plunge, say, or a bout of self-inflicted regional
instability over Taiwan _ China would have trouble repaying loans.
Meanwhile, WTO membership will not mean a surge of foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
   Another misunderstanding, when the roller-coaster heads for
despair, is about the treatment of foreign companies in China. They
do not get a rawer deal than local ones. Rather, they are usually
sideswiped by restrictions that hit deserving domestic companies
harder.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, foreigners often have investment privileges denied to
locals. Yet it is these home-grown outfits that hold the key to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The real significance of China's WTO membership is not as a
bonanza for foreigners, but as a rod for the forces of reform to
beat back a still stifling state and to build up the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese state will no doubt continue to resist. China's
membership of the WTO will assuredly place strains on that
organization, as the socialist legacy of protectionism clashes with
international trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   There are risks here for the West. But is the WTO so weak an
organization that the clash will mortally harm it?
</P>
<P>
   China's trade with the rest of the world is still smaller than
the Netherlands'. And, even realistically imagined, the potential
prize of admitting China is still worth having: a
continental-sized, more liberal economy that promotes regional
stability where now it lends instability.
</P>
<P>
   What of China as a rising international menace? China's armed
forces, though capable of regional mischief over Taiwan or disputed
claims in the South China Sea, are still far from being the
fighting machine its generals seem to want outsiders to believe.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, China is slowly starting to conform to accepted
international practices. It has signed the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Under American pressure, it has started to curb military and
nuclear sales to unstable states, such as Iran and Pakistan. And it
takes part in regional talking clubs, albeit with a determination
to keep Taiwan either out or down.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that China wants its rightful place at the top
table of nations, and enjoys the back-slapping that comes with it.
Its leaders want economic prosperity too, since their rule rests
upon it, and membership of the WTO seems the only way to achieve
it.
</P>
<P>
   China may rant about American ``hegemony'' but, step by step, it
is surrendering to an international order that, while often
American-led, enjoys broad support.
</P>
<P>
   This is the levelheaded case for engaging China. But engagement
is not certain to transform it for the better. Capitalist economics
and communist politics cannot coexist forever: the risks of
instability will grow, as the demands for a liberalized economy
clash with an illiberal state.
</P>
<P>
   If China turns militaristic, even fascist, the West will have to
contain the threat that poses, as it has done before.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greater peril would be a collapse of central
authority under severe economic strain. Such an upheaval would not
necessarily bring democracy. It might intensify concerns about
weapons proliferation, illegal emigration and international crime.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the worry is about China's future strengths or
weaknesses, its uncertain future makes the pursuit of diplomacy
with it that much harder.
</P>
<P>
   Opting for illusion over reality, some western governments treat
China's weaknesses as strengths, overlooking the regime's disdain
for human rights and its intermittent bullying of its smaller
neighbors, in the hope of winning commercial favors from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Better to be clear about the international standards expected,
whether on trade, human rights or the use of force, and deal with
China on all fronts. For China is not a monolith. As it changes, so
the voices and interests that make up the country multiply. The
West would do well to engage them all. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sit down. Shut up,'' barks Rudolph Giuliani, shoving towards
an elderly man who has asked him if he has a bad temper.
</P>
<P>
   It is supposed to be a jokey tribute to Senator John McCain, who
has come to help the mayor on a campaign trip to Long Island to
boost his Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   During his presidential campaign, McCain had cleverly deflected
questions about his own bad temper by saying that they made him
``really mad.'' Done with McCain's sly chuckle, it worked a treat.
Done by Giuliani, it makes even a sympathetic Republican audience
jump before laughing.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when politicians seem able to ``emote'' anything,
Giuliani is a gloriously feeble actor. Assuming, that is, that
Hizzoner even bothers to try _ which he usually does not.
</P>
<P>
   Make a few sympathetic comments about unarmed men killed by
policemen? Not on your nelly. Accept New York's inconvenient city
charter? See you in court, Mister. Keep financing a museum that has
annoyed you? Fugeddabahdit. A few routine courtesies to your
opponent? Whodya think you are, lady?
</P>
<P>
   The boy who liked being the only Yankees' fan on a
Dodgers-ridden block in Brooklyn does not care.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's refusal to compromise _ particularly over the recent
shootings _ is widely seen as the reason why Hillary Rodham Clinton
has now drawn level in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has weighed in with some talk about the
mayor being a reactionary; the word ``fascist'' is bandied around
Greenwich Village. Talk has resurfaced about Rick Lazio, a
conservative congressman, challenging Giuliani for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Enlisting the support of McCain is a clever attempt to turn the
tide, on several levels. Although he lost New York's Republican
primary to George W. Bush (whom Giuliani endorsed), the Arizona
senator picked up plenty of Democratic support _ and Democrats
outnumber Republicans in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a reactionary, Giuliani belongs to the liberal
wing of his party; indeed, unlike McCain, he does not oppose
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper wisdom in bringing in McCain is that he is a glass
through which New York's skeptical voters can see Giuliani's
considerable virtues more clearly.
</P>
<P>
   According to this view, there are broadly speaking two sorts of
politician. The first, typified by the Clintons, takes an
ever-flexible ``feel your pain'' approach to issues, guided by
opinion polls rather than principle.
</P>
<P>
   The second, rarer, sort has strongly held opinions and speaks
them aloud, however unwelcome they may be to voters. Margaret
Thatcher comes to mind. So does McCain. And so does Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   If voters bothered to focus on anything so irrelevant as
achievements, then Giuliani should win by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   When he was elected mayor in 1993, New York City was veering
towards a state of ungovernability. Now its economy is booming and
crime has been cut to levels that once seemed unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   New York is now one of the safest large cities in America. Its
streets are cleaner and less cluttered with aggressive beggars.
Times Square has revived, and the sex shops and hookers have been
driven, if not out of business, at least to somewhere less visible.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of New York's schools, if not yet solved, is no
longer shrugged off.
</P>
<P>
   As with Mrs. Thatcher, another person famed neither for her
sense of humor nor for her compassion, there is a debate about how
much of this change is really Giuliani's doing.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors include a strong American economy, fewer young New
Yorkers on the streets and William Bratton, the mayor's innovative
first police commissioner. But without Giuliani's bloody-minded
leadership in the teeth of frequently intense opposition, the
change would have been nowhere near as dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   But do the talents that served him well in New York City now
equip him for the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   There is an understandable question-mark over Giuliani's ability
to work with others. Mrs. Clinton loses no opportunity to argue
that his ``autocratic style'' would be disastrous in Washington:
``My way or no way is not real leadership,'' she says (a comment a
lot of people around the White House will find particularly hard to
stomach).
</P>
<P>
   There are two responses to this. First, Giuliani is a better
diplomat than you might expect: he has hammered out deals _ albeit
grudging ones _ with unions, Democrats on the city council and even
his bete noire, the Republican governor, George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   But the second and stronger argument for Giuliani, made
forcefully by McCain, is that toughness is what the Senate needs:
he would have on America ``the same kind of profound effect as he
had on the city of New York,'' and would be a great ally for
campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we need tough guys around Washington, D.C., to get
tough jobs done, '' McCain said. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of ways in which you can knock this idea. On
a personal level, a man who mistakes a sneer for an interview is
never going to have the rapport with the press that McCain had.
(When McCain christened Giuliani's battle-bus the ``Straight Talk
Junior Express,'' one hack quickly renamed it the ``Hate Talk
Express.'')
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, having accepted ``soft money,'' is also a flawed
advocate for campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   A few of his schemes _ such as a new baseball stadium for the
Yankees _ are mistaken. On international issues, Mrs. Clinton can
trounce a man who sometimes appears to think that foreign policy
means New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a fear that his role-models are bad ones: Britons
eventually tired of Margaret Thatcher's absolutism; McCain's attack
on the religious right was electorally insane.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if statesmanship means anything, it should be a refusal to
pander. Even on the issue of the police shootings, Giuliani has a
legitimate point (a multiracial jury recently acquitted four
policemen whom Mrs. Clinton had deemed to be murderers).
</P>
<P>
   That does not excuse the stunningly insensitive way in which the
mayor has generally advanced his case. But then, with Giuliani, the
content has usually been more meaningful than the delivery. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked to say what he thought Giuliani should do, McCain replied:
``Run on his record.''
</P>
<P>
   The race will turn on whether voters want somebody to feel their
pain, or to start changing things. In the meantime, sit down and
shut up: I'm talking to you, lady... &QL;

PHOENIX: THE NEXT SILICON VALLEY?

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, ARIZ. _ To drive or fly across the mountains and
deserts of America's arid Southwest is to be reminded that the
earth is a planet. Their windswept grandeur seems to render the
human scale irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this baked, rocky land is attracting people faster than any
other part of America. Nevada and Arizona are the states with the
fastest-growing populations in America; Las Vegas and Phoenix are
its fastest-growing big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ask say the clerks at USAA, an insurance firm that is building a
new operations center which will eventually employ 15,000 people to
the north of the city, why they are among the 60,000 people moving
into greater Phoenix each year.
</P>
<P>
   Those mountains figure large in Phoenicians' views of what makes
their city special. ``Quality of life,'' which they cite again and
again as the appeal of the city, means access to the pleasures of
the outdoors, by mountain bike, four-wheel-drive vehicle, or
snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining that quality of life, while continuing to attract
the firms that will provide the jobs to sustain population growth
at almost three times the national rate, is a balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since air-conditioning came in after the Second World War,
allowing the city's population to rise from 50,000 then to today's
2.95 million, Phoenix has steadily eaten its way across the floor
f the valley in which it sits.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mountains are sometimes dimmed by smog, and the roads
that lead to them are clogged with traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Things may come to a head in November with a ballot initiative,
put forward by the Sierra Club, an environmental group, to ban any
new building in a ring around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Worried, the state's governor, Jane Hull, and local businesses
have set up a ``growing smarter'' commission to tackle the issue of
sprawl. But the debate is increasingly turning to what sort of
businesses the city wants.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's core business has been property _ putting up buildings
and praying people and companies want to use them. Since the early
1990s, there has been a slightly more organized attempt to build
clusters _ first aerospace, then tourism and optics.
</P>
<P>
   But, somewhat inevitably, attention is focusing on the Internet.
In part this is just the desire of a slightly gauche place to
appear hip. But an industry that doesn't need too much space, and
brings in a lot of money and not too many people, also seems like a
good prospect for a city that wants to slow down a bit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Arizona Software and Internet Association, the
number of Internet jobs in the region is growing 13 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe, a Phoenix suburb that is home to Arizona State
University, a few trendy cafes and a new wireless network, is the
center. Drew Cohen brought his web firm, NeoPlanet, to Tempe from
Silicon Valley after his interest was excited by a local programmer
whom he wanted to hire, but who wouldn't leave. Cohen realized that
office space was half the cost of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Is that enough? Alan Hald, another Tempe-based entrepreneur and
co-chairman of the Arizona Partnership for the New Economy, points
out that Phoenix lacks the venture capital that brings the whirr to
other high-tech hubs, such as Austin, Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Graunke, the chief executive of KnowledgeNet, boasts that 90
percent of his 250 staff are from around Phoenix; but he had to
bring his capital with him from Silicon Valley. Smart money in
Phoenix still tends to go into property deals.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is education. One Intel boss notes that Arizona
is a good place to build a new chip manufacturing plant, but the
technical skill available in the work force is not yet enough to
make it tempting to move Intel's design center out of California.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's universities are doing well, and its community
colleges, which provide two-year technical courses that are the
vital boost for lifting unskilled immigrants into higher job
brackets, are the country's best. Its schools, though, are weak.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has thrived because it has been for the rest of America
what America is for the world: a magnet for ambitious and restless
people.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has overcome weaknesses in its own education system by
using talent nurtured elsewhere. Although the average educational
level of native Arizonans is lower than in the country as a whole,
that of immigrants to the state is higher.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep attracting the ever more educated workers that the
new economy requires will mean maintaining that ``quality of life''
so prized by Phoenicians. That switches the debate back to the smog
and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But another factor could be just as important for growing
smartly: character. Look at many of Phoenix's rivals, where there
is slightly more to do in the evening than listen to the
air-conditioning or discuss the next subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Dot.com people certainly seem to like mountain biking, but the
knowledge economy needs more than purely physical exertion. On the
other hand, there is no reason to give up hope. Downtown Phoenix is
getting a little jazzier. And nobody thought that Palo Alto was
that exciting 20 years ago. &QL;

<P>
   George W. Bush said that ``all of us need to encourage people to

<P>
   BOSTON _ Even in an age of negative politics, there is something
a little extraordinary, even admirable, about Jack E. Robinson
III's run for the Senate seat that comes up for election in
Massachusetts this year.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few candidates have slid downwards so quickly in popular
estimation. And none has fought a bad press in Robinson's
remarkable way: by first revealing even more of his own flaws, and
now demanding that his notoriously inhibited opponent does the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Few local Republicans wanted to challenge Ted Kennedy's 38 years
in office and his $3.6 million war chest. So, when Robinson
appeared out of nowhere in March, the party adopted him quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A black conservative whose father ranked high in the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Robinson
holds degrees from Harvard and Brown Universities, worked as an
airline executive and had $1 million of his own to spend. He looked
fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor, Paul Cellucci, swiftly endorsed him.
Then came the accusations. In 1985, policemen found a martial-arts
weapon in Robinson's jacket pocket; he says a stranger must have
put it there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a federal judge said he had violated copyright laws in
a book; Robinson says he only meant to add historical context.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 restraining order, a former girlfriend alleged that he
had forced her to have sex. And another woman told the Boston Globe
that on a 1996 date he lathered her with so many unwanted kisses
that she called him ``Jack the Tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied both stories. Then Robinson issued the highly unusual
nine-page document he calls the ``Robinson Report.'' In
conversational prose, it outlines every skeleton remaining in his
closet, along with explanations, defenses and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Headings include ``Motor Vehicle Incident 1,'' ``Motor Vehicle
Incident 2,'' ``Copyright Case'' and ``Bar Exam.'' (He failed it
twice in New York and Texas, he concedes. ``But then again, I
didn't really study for them either.'')
</P>
<P>
   Robinson says he started preparing the report months before he
announced his candidacy, so that he could get the unpleasant side
of things out of the way before diving into the real issues. But,
by the time it was released, there was so much talk of sin that
nobody was interested in substance.
</P>
<P>
   Things did not improve when Robinson got into yet another car
accident, and was accused of trying to escape from the scene.
``Boy, everything is happening to me,'' he said. ``Cellucci is
withdrawing his support, and people are sliding across the highway
at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Robinson has replaced self-pity and openness with defiance
and (by his standards) secrecy. He is even more intent on running
now, he says, so that he can change the way campaigns operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've gone through the last two weeks, nobody else should
have to go through,'' he says. ``I don't think it should be the
goal to tear down the other opponent, or to hold up the opponent
for ridicule.''
</P>
<P>
   He intends to stay clear of Kennedy's (arguably far greater)
personal failings _ but he is not going to discuss his own problems
until the senator is willing to do the same. ``No more double
standards, no more unilateral disarmament,'' he announced on April
3.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has a point. Even the parts of the local press that are
not slavishly loyal to Kennedy have long since given up asking him
about Chappaquiddick, where that young lady drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Venting their frustration on Robinson has been cheap and easy.
It would be sad if a politician got punished for telling more than
he needed to tell.
</P>
<P>
   We wish Robinson well _ though he should probably let somebody
else drive. &QL;

JAPAN NEEDS A NEW PRIME MINISTER WITH A MANDATE, SOON

<TEXT>
<P>
   The departure of the head of government in most countries is
quite an event: it raises the possibility of change. Not in Japan,
though.
</P>
<P>
   After Keizo Obuchi's stroke last weekend, Japan has had to find
a new prime minister. No one, however, seems to be looking for any
other change; that, most Japanese seem to think, can wait until
after the general election, due sometime before the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new man may only serve as a stopgap. Then a
permanent replacement for Obuchi can be found, it is said, and he
can ponder some changes.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Japan cannot afford to be so relaxed. Not that Obuchi has
been a failure. On the contrary, although he once described himself
as ``very, very ordinary,'' he has done much to end Japan's worst
postwar recession.
</P>
<P>
   He had staked his reputation on delivering economic growth of at
least 0.6 percent for the financial year that ended in March and it
looks as though the official figures, when they are published in
the summer, will show he has achieved it.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of 0.6 percent may seem modest, but Japan is often like a
supertanker with the tiller locked. A change of course can be
achieved only with immense effort: indeed, if Obuchi has got any
growth at all, it will have taken a staggering Yen35 trillion ($325
billion) in public spending to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Japan cannot afford to go on running its economy
this way. A new leader is required, who could act to unleash the
country's enterprise and restore the confidence of its consumers.
And he should waste no time in securing a mandate from the voters
for the changes that are needed.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not seem to be the way that minds have been
working in the upper echelons of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's successor is to be Yoshiro Mori, the LDP's
secretary-general, an archetypal politician of the old school. No
one expects him to last beyond the election.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that some people in the LDP may be thinking of
bringing the election forward. Obuchi wanted it in the early
autumn, because it would then follow better economic news and all
the publicity that will attend the prime minister's role at the G8
meeting of the rich world's leaders, plus Russia, in Okinawa in
July.
</P>
<P>
   But some LDP leaders, worried about the party's dwindling
support and hoping no doubt for a sympathy vote, want the election
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   They are right, albeit for the wrong reasons. An early poll
would be good for Japan. Whatever the result, it would provide a
new government with a new term of office, instead of an interim one
muddling along for six months of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Muddling along is often the way of consensus-style government in
Japan. It may not always lead to disaster, but at present there is
work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Urgent economic issues and preparations for the summit are high
on the agenda. Mount Usu, a volcano on the island of Hokkaido, is
rumbling.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the aftermath of the political eruption caused
by Obuchi's rejection of the latest in a series of demands from one
of his coalition partners, Ichiro Ozawa, the Liberal leader. Ozawa
was forced out as a result, although some members of his party have
remained in the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In most other countries such events in a leaderless vacuum might
amount to a crisis. Not in Japan: the stock market hit its highest
level of the year this week and the yen rose.
</P>
<P>
   That was because Japan is so insulated against change that
everyone knows things will go on as expected: the legislative
agenda is already in place for the rest of the current session of
the Diet (parliament) and the important budget and tax-reform bills
have already been passed.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that not much is likely to happen about Japan's
long-postponed reforms either. With an election looming, there is
already pressure to ease off anything that might upset voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several advisory commissions appointed by Obuchi may never
report. They have been looking into new ideas about how to reform
all sorts of things, from the Diet to education, welfare and the
police.
</P>
<P>
   All of which adds up to one word: delay. The politicians will
keep up their factional infighting while the bureaucracy continues
to set policy.
</P>
<P>
   The real transition from such feudal ways may have to await
another generation. Unfortunately, that may also be the generation
that inherits all the problems being dodged today: the consequences
of a greying society, banks burdened with debts, companies
unrestructured and a public sector deep in deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Japan then will not be a job for a Mr. Ordinary. The time
to get on with it is now. &QL;

DOES DOLLARIZATION MAKE CENTS FOR EL SALVADOR?

Times Syndicate is for use by clients of The Economist.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR _ Will El Salvador be the next Latin American
country to adopt the dollar as its currency?
</P>
<P>
   Its conservative governments have long been enthusiastic about a
currency switch. Jose Luis Trigueros, the finance minister, argues
that dollarization would boost economic growth, by eliminating
currency risk and thus allowing interest rates to fall.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say dollarization would help a small group of
bankers, while hurting manufacturers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, El Salvador is a far more promising
candidate for dollarization than, say, Ecuador, which recently
adopted the greenback out of desperation with its own, sliding,
currency.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, El Salvador has maintained a fixed exchange rate
for a decade. It has enough hard-currency reserves to replace the
local currency. And its economic ties with the United States have
long been close.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does its giant neighbor take 60 percent of El
Salvador's exports, but the largest single source of hard currency
is the $1.3 billion sent home annually by Salvadoreans who live
there.
</P>
<P>
   After a promising spurt in the mid-1990s, El Salvador's economic
growth rate has since sagged. Farmers and manufacturers are
struggling. But, until recently, bankers have been thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Although prices fell last year, bank lending rates are running
at a stiff 15-22 percent. Such rates have encouraged El Salvador's
banks to borrow abroad, lending the funds on in local currency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now the bonanza threatens to stop. The banks' profits are
falling, and their clients are struggling to pay their debts. The
strongest five banks are now buying up the rest, and expanding
their business into other Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
   The economic slowdown has led to calls to float the exchange
rate. That is favored by exporters, including the clothing
factories which set up in El Salvador a decade ago, attracted by
tax breaks. They face stiff competition from similar maquiladora
factories in Mexico and elsewhere in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Dollarization is also opposed by the FMLN, the left-wing party
set up by former guerrillas. It made gains in a parliamentary
election last month, displacing the governing right-wing ARENA as
the largest party in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But devaluation would be costly for the banks, whose
hard-currency debts now stand at $500 million. To their critics,
the banks have enjoyed undue privileges. Though they are free to
set interest rates, competition is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign banks have been allowed unfettered access to El Salvador
only since last year. The banks charge high fees for processing
remittances, and pay a paltry 3-4 percent on most savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the banks were privatized at the end of El Salvador's
civil war of the 1980s. They were supposed to be sold to their
employees and the public, but in practice ended up in the hands of
a small group of the country's richest families, members of ARENA.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' close links with the authorities were underlined last
year when the central bank's president of more than a decade left
his post and soon joined the largest private bank.
</P>
<P>
   If it is to revive the economy, the government may have to
decide either to dollarize or to devalue. If it chooses the dollar,
the banks' record means that its decision may be unpopular, at
least among El Salvador's producers. &QL;

<P>
   SIALKOT, PAKISTAN _ Were it not for Indian guns that sometimes
fire shells into villages near the Kashmir border, the Sialkot
district would be one of Pakistan's most desirable. Unemployment is
low, literacy high and people are rich: income per head is about
$1,000, nearly twice the national average.
</P>
<P>
   In a country known for exporting cheap textiles and expensive
narcotics, Sialkot prospers by making musical and surgical
instruments, leather goods and, above all, sporting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Daska Road is the heart of the world's soccer-ball industry. In
the mid-1990s, Sialkot's soccer-ball magnates were under attack. It
was then that the western press discovered that they were employing
children and threatened to bury them in a landslide of bad
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of preparation could have lessened the shock and
revulsion I felt on entering a sporting-goods factory in the town
of Sialkot,'' wrote one journalist, who in 1996 described children
toiling 80 hours a week to make soccer balls in near darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The industry hastily made changes. In February 1997 Sialkot's
chamber of commerce signed the ``Atlanta Agreement,'' under which
manufacturers volunteered to stop child labor and let international
monitors check up on them. Various agencies teamed up to shepherd
the liberated youngsters into schools.
</P>
<P>
   Three years on, child labor in Sialkot's soccer industry is
mostly history. The chamber of commerce says that 66 manufacturers,
representing 90 percent of the district's exports, have submitted
to inspection by the International Labour Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Child Employed is a Future Destroyed'' reads a sticker
pasted up at the chamber of commerce building, and manufacturers
seem to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Even where the ILO is not monitoring, says Amena Hasan, project
manager for Save the Children, a charity, there is ``almost zero
child labor.'' That has meant changes far beyond replacing little
hands with big ones, and not all of them for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Atlanta Agreement, making soccer balls was largely a
cottage industry. Much of the work _ cutting and printing laminates
that make the shell of the ball _ was done in factories, but
stitching, the most labor-intensive process, was usually outsourced
to families in villages around Sialkot.
</P>
<P>
   Families could earn about 25 rupees (50 cents) for each ball.
But the ILO cannot inspect every house. So manufacturers have had
to shift stitching into centers _ often, little more than sheds on
a rutted village road _ that the ILO's 14 monitors know about and
can visit at will. Pay is still by the piece, but the industry's
informal character is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The effects have been double-edged. Almost all firms have seen
costs go up. Capital Sports, a biggish manufacturer, has invested
some 3.6 million rupees ($67,000) to build three stitching centers.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, extra expenses, such as transporting workers to
and from the centers, have raised the cost of stitching one ball
from 25 rupees to 40 rupees or more, reckons the firm's boss,
Khawaja Zakauddin. Other firms say their costs have risen more.
</P>
<P>
   That adds relatively little to the cost of making top-quality
balls, which manufacturers sell to brand-name companies such as
Adidas and Puma for $10 or so. But at the low end of the market,
which includes $2 ``promotional'' (free publicity) balls, the extra
costs hurt.
</P>
<P>
   This is where competitors such as China, which makes
machine-stitched balls, and India have gained ground at Sialkot's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's share of the American soccer-ball market by volume
dropped from 65 percent to 45 percent between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Machine stitching is becoming good enough to produce
better-quality balls, threatening Pakistan's industry at its
strongest point.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers are being squeezed between higher costs and
penny-pinching customers. Zia Urrahman Choudhry, chief executive of
Fox &AMP; Associates, a medium-sized manufacturer, says buyers of his
promotional balls want certification of their adult-only
workmanship but are unwilling to pay extra for it.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Sports has resisted pressure from customers to cut
prices, and seen sales drop from more than 1 million balls in 1998,
a World Cup year, to 400,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Agreement has been a spur as well as a brake,
helping some manufacturers become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Because kits are now distributed to fewer centers and every ball
is coded (so that inspectors can trace strays), manufacturers have
better control of production.
</P>
<P>
   Before Atlanta, Fox got information once a week on which balls
were in which stages of production; now it comes every second day.
That has enabled it to reduce its stocks. Its record of on-time
delivery to customers has improved from 50 percent to 70-80
percent. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   The biggest manufacturers seem to revel in the child-free
regime. Saga Sports, which makes 4 million-5 million balls a year
for Nike and other brands, pampers its 9,000 employees and their
families with free medical care and subsidized shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Its lavish Daska Road headquarters, Saga City, has a tiny
football ground and a giant one for cricket, which is far more
popular. Although part-timers help out during peak periods, the
bulk of Saga's stitching is done by full-timers, paid a salary
rather than by the piece.
</P>
<P>
   High fixed costs should be a handicap in an industry with sharp
fluctuations in demand, but Saga is unworried. It reckons that its
big stitching centers have the double virtue of impressing
ethically-anxious customers and ensuring quality.
</P>
<P>
   Saga's Faiz Shah says that it has cut by half the time needed to
produce a ball. Saga's research and development laboratory invents
new designs and materials, helping to keep prices up.
</P>
<P>
   Saga barely noticed last year's slump in demand. Saga has
nonetheless started a (child-free) operation in China to take
advantage of better transport.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of other firms depends on a host of factors besides
child labor, from the level of world demand to the strength of the
rupee.
</P>
<P>
   India's recent move to a monitoring program may raise
competitors' costs, though too late for some firms. According to
the local chamber of commerce, some of the smallest producers have
already gone out of business. &QL;

<P>
   Has all this upheaval made Sialkoters better off? Maybe. Some
6,000 children are in schools run by ``partner'' charities in the
Atlanta program; local state schools are being upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   But many families have paid a high price. Many have lost the
wages not only of their children but of their women, who are
constrained by custom and religion from working at stitching
centers. Though some people are stitching more regularly in the
centers, overall family incomes have fallen by roughly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who thinks of child labor as an unmitigated evil, this
price looks worth paying. Others are less categorical.
</P>
<P>
   Save the Children, which supports Atlanta, makes a distinction
between child labor and ``child work,'' which can give children
income, skills and self-confidence without damaging their
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   In the soccer-ball industry, two-thirds of child workers were
part-timers working at home, and 80-90 percent of those went to
school, says Save the Children's Hasan.
</P>
<P>
   The satanic conditions described by shocked journalists are far
more prevalent in hazardous industries like brick-making and
surgical instruments. &QL;

<P>
   Even the pillars of Atlanta agree that the soccer-ball
industry's glamour, more than its sins, made it the target of
reformers, and that reform ``started in a rush,'' as Jacques van
der Pols, the ILO's chief technical adviser in Sialkot, puts it.
</P>
<P>
   They are correcting their earlier mistakes. To lure women back
into the work force, the ILO now monitors mini-centers where as few
as three women work, restoring some of the industry's cottage
character. Another group makes small-business loans to affected
families. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta supporters argue that the program's main benefit will be
to serve as a ``gateway'' to improving conditions in lower-profile,
more hazardous industries throughout Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   A move is afoot to extend monitoring to all industries in
Sialkot. The ILO would also like stitching centers to introduce a
minimum wage and amenities such as toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The big firms, many of which have already upgraded their
facilities, will welcome higher standards. Harder-pressed firms
will resist.
</P>
<P>
   Like soccer itself, getting rid of child labor is not a win-win
game. &QL;

<P>
   Who has not banged out an angry reply to an apparently brusque
e-mail message, hit the send button _ and then regretted it?
</P>
<P>
   Surely no technology has led to so many rifts and fractured
friendships (not to mention subpoenas) as electronic mail. But
nowhere is e-mail more perilous than in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments by Michael Morris, an academic at Stanford Business
School, and a group of colleagues have now demonstrated what many
people instinctively suspect: negotiations are more likely to go
well if they are conducted, at least in part, face to face, rather
than between strangers armed with keyboards and screens.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is not invariably a bad way to negotiate, but the
research suggests that it needs to be used carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg Graduate Business
School at Northwestern University, and several other academics,
Morris studied mock negotiations that used only e-mail and compared
them with ones preceded by a brief getting-to-know-you telephone
call.
</P>
<P>
   The second type went more smoothly. Other experiments found that
electronic negotiations were easier when the negotiators began by
swapping photographs and personal details; or when they already
knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   Why is e-mail such a snare? Heidi Roizen, a Silicon Valley
veteran who now works for Softbank Venture Capital, thinks that
part of the problem is that ``most people are lousy typists _ and
they don't think about the fact that an e-mail lasts forever.''
</P>
<P>
   She has two rare advantages: she is an English major, and a
90-words-a-minute typist. She finds the durability of e-mail is one
of its main advantages _ it allows her to keep track of her
dealings with the eight different companies on whose boards she
sits: ``It's instant record-keeping.''
</P>
<P>
   But she scrupulously follows two rules to avoid
misunderstanding: ``Re-read each piece of mail before you send it,
from the point of view of the recipient; and when in doubt, leave
it overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   As every Victorian letter-writer learned, a night's sleep is the
best filter to apply to a furious note.
</P>
<P>
   John Kay, a British economist, goes further. After having to
calm a succession of weeping secretaries, he instituted a rule at
London Economics, a consultancy that he founded, that e-mails
should contain only information and never emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite its pitfalls, e-mail is increasingly likely to be
used for negotiation. Richard Hill, an IT manager and mediator with
Hill &AMP; Associates in Geneva, worked with the University of
Massachusetts on the establishment of an electronic mediation
service called the Online Ombuds Office.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that mediation by telephone is generally simpler and
faster: a three-minute telephone call contains far more information
than a typical brisk e-mail. But, because online mediation can be
done at a time that is convenient for the parties involved, it
tends to be less costly.
</P>
<P>
   Just think a moment before you hit that send button, though. &QL;

   FORREST CITY, ARK. _ More than a century after their
organization was founded, members of the Ku Klux Klan still gather
on Saturday afternoons in various parts of the South, preaching
their message of white pride.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing white robes and hoods, a small group of men stand on an
abandoned parking lot near the St. Francis County Courthouse here
in Forrest City, screaming out their view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only a railway track and a collection of policemen with guns on
their hips separate them from their target, a group of blacks who
hurl back counter-abuse. A few, having used particularly strong
language, are taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   As one sheriff's deputy says of the Klan's rally, it's like
waving a red flag in front of a bull.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow deputies, along with local and state policemen,
outnumber the watching journalists. A few men in overalls sit on a
wooden bench on the lawn of the courthouse, listening to the Klan's
rambling message.
</P>
<P>
   A woman and her two children walk as close as they can to the
Klansmen, until the police tell them that they cannot cross an
imaginary line which segregates the Klan from the rest of the
townsfolk. The woman snaps a photograph before turning away.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, mouths agape, hold their children's hands and try to
explain the purpose of these men in robes. Many are angry that such
a thing is allowed in Forrest City.
</P>
<P>
   What few of them realize is that the founders of Forrest City, a
small, poor farming town most of whose people are now blacks, named
it in honor of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the father of the Ku Klux
Klan.
</P>
<P>
   That was back in the late 19th century, when the Klan was trying
to reassert the identity of the South after its defeat in the Civil
War of 1861-65. Perhaps those who demonstrate against the
Confederate flag that still flutters across the South should also
protest about the name of this east Arkansas town.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century or so ago, the Klan was remembered for its
nocturnal cross burnings, its bombing of black churches, its
occasional murders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a new century, it has picked up the trappings of
modernity. It has an Internet address for the ``Invisible Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   It puts out propaganda against the return of Elian Gonzalez to
Cuba, and a rich selection of attacks on the government, as well as
the racialism it spouts through bullhorns. It leaves its rallies in
minibuses, not on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Chester Quarles, a professor at the University of Mississippi,
says the Klan has transformed itself in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, its national headquarters is in Harrison, up in the
Ozark Mountains, a part of Arkansas from which blacks vanished
almost entirely in the early 1900s, and to which few have returned.
</P>
<P>
   But Klansmen, he says, are no longer transfixed by the single
issue of race. They have also enlisted themselves in the campaign
against powerful government, especially the government in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They are flexible in their operations: one weekend a member may
wear the hood of a Klansman, the next the insignia of the (equally
racialist) Aryan Nations. Or, quite often, they will gather for a
``meet and eat'' potluck meal, to chat about politics and religion
on a Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   If you knew the addresses of Klansmen, Quarles reckons, you
would find quite a few who are the neighbors of liberal
suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan says that its aim is to build a ``nationwide
grass-roots movement of white Christian men, women and children who
support a return of white Christians to government.''
</P>
<P>
   Its platform is not unlike that of far-right Christian
conservatives _ an insistence that America was founded as a
Christian nation, a call for America's withdrawal from the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the military sealing of America's borders
against illegal immigrants, the end of anti-gun laws, drug tests
for people on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   It has even embraced environmentalism, supporting events like
Earth Day by sending out its unwanted troops to clean up litter and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as the Klan extends its agenda, it still evokes
deep-seated images of midnight rides and the shouting of hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The Klansmen at the rally in Forrest City said that they just
wanted to exercise their First Amendment right, to say what they
thought about immigration, taxes _ and keeping minorities in their
place.
</P>
<P>
   They did so for more than an hour. Then, after putting their
Confederate flags and white hoods in their vans, they drove away.
Blacks jotted down license-plate numbers on scraps of paper.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon air felt sultrier than ever, and the policeman
said a long night loomed ahead. &QL;

<P>
   NAPLES _ Seeing how much we know about Roman licentiousness, it
is not surprising that a great deal of erotic material was found in
the patrician villas, taverns, baths and brothels of the cities of
Pompeii and Herculaneum, where life stopped at lunchtime on a hot
August day in 79 AD as Vesuvius exploded and buried them under
ashes and volcanic rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half centuries after the Bourbon kings ordered the dig
which brought the cities to light, a collection of those ``obscene
objects,'' long kept behind closed doors, is about to be opened
again to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bourbon restoration in 1815 they were among the works
in the new museum opened in the grounds of the royal palace at
Portici on the outskirts of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Duke of Calabria, the future Francis I, took his
wife and young daughter to see the collection, he was shocked by
what was put before the ladies' eyes and decided that henceforth
the objects considered obscene would be kept under lock in il
Gabinetto segreto (generally known as ``the secret rooms'').
</P>
<P>
   Only privileged persons were to be admitted. Even Stendhal and
Donizetti had to make written applications.
</P>
<P>
   During the prudish but revolutionary 19th century, access was a
token of either status or liberty. Not surprisingly, Garibaldi had
the doors thrown open when he arrived in post-Bourbon Naples but
they were soon closed again when a new period of puritanism set in.
</P>
<P>
   During the 20th century access has been subject to various
vicissitudes, again according to the degrees of permissiveness in
vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was reopened after the Second World War, the
Gabinetto, which is housed in the National Archeological Museum in
Naples, has been closed since 1971, ostensibly for restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms have now been restored and when the new display is
ready, hopefully before Easter (though this is still to be
confirmed), they will be open to groups of 20 at a time with no
extra charge on the entrance ticket.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no official inauguration (it is Holy Year after
all), nor any restrictions on children and teenagers whose entry
will be left to the discretion of their parents or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of the ``obscene'' objects reveals more than anything
that they are far above the standards _ as art as well as
entertainment _ of what passes for porn nowadays. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Erotica here followed the taste of the Greek traditions, even if
there is surprisingly little Attic pottery in Naples though plenty
in other museums of Magna Graecia.
</P>
<P>
   The first myth to be debunked is that Pompeii was a sister city
to Sodom and Gommorah. Among the sophisticated classes but also
among the less affluent and even among slaves, excess was the only
reproach made in sexual matters. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In important provincial cities like Pompeii, sexual promiscuity
was normal but, as these objects reveal, discreetly organized.
Certainly the women depicted in the orgies were real prostitutes
not the ladies of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The phallus is the object most on display; in marble, stone and
bronze, with all its uses, both practical and allegorical.
</P>
<P>
   In the prudish centuries the moral castigators preached that
Pompeii must indeed have been a most immoral city because the
phallus was everywhere. Yet, as in most of the ancient world it was
a propitious symbol; a talisman rather than a dirty joke.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of Priapus, its erect form greeted the visitor at
the entrance to the home, the tavern or the bakery. It was the
handle on which bells were hung which would be rattled to scare
away evil spirits.
</P>
<P>
   It not only provided the outlet from which the water sprouted
from the statue in the villa's garden but could even be found, in
more miniature form, inside bowls from which you drank your water
or wine at table.
</P>
<P>
   There is an intriguing lamp in which a gladiator is locked in
combat with his phallus which has been transformed into a ferocious
beast. As for other interpretations of the practical uses of the
phallus in Ancient Rome, the Gabinetto tells us much about sexual
mores.
</P>
<P>
   According to Antonio Varone, an archaeologist and author of
``Eroticism in Pompeii,'' there is evidence of striptease and of
the equivalent of porn films, with slaves performing erotic scenes
as an ancient Viagra substitute. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some items will inevitably prompt giggles, such as the
classic-style marble statue from Herculaneum of ``Pan and the
Goat'' _ which was probably always meant to amuse, judging by the
knowing smirks exchanged between the languorous goat and its
seducer.
</P>
<P>
   In another statue, also clearly of Greek origin, a mature Pan is
teaching a youthful Daphni (male version of Daphne) to play the
flute in a clear sexual metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Ovid and Martial, among others, always taught that the Romans,
even if coarser than the Greeks, knew a lot about the Ars amatoria.
The aura of scandal which has surrounded for so long these
illustrations of how they performed will now perhaps diminish. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic, as the museum's director, Professor Stefano De
Caro, explained recently while guiding visitors around the
Gabinetto, that over the centuries most European courts, when
embarrassed by objects they considered obscene in their
collections, would consign them to Naples. To them, the Gabinetto
was evidently considered a depository of pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the museums in the world have their own secret rooms _
probably even the Vatican. Perhaps it is time to open all the
doors. Naples is setting an example. &QL;

   What Tiger Woods does for the game of golf, invigorating and
broadening the appeal of ``a nice walk in the woods, spoiled (Mark
Twain),'' Sony does with its video game version of a day on the
links. Decidedly cartoonish characters bang around fictional golf
courses with simple but clever caricature animations making the art
of the duff forgiving and fun. As a sequel, Hot Shots Golf 2 ($40;
www.playstation.com; for the PSX) offers little more than a few
tweaks to its predecessor, with new characters, modes, sounds, etc.
Nevertheless, this version of the stuffy greenery game is riddled
with engaging features such as optionally quick and easy play,
where a good many tasks are automated; spectacular replay features
that give a high-tech, arcade feel to an otherwise somber sport,
plus equipment upgrades and long-term tourneys for the avid fan.
Great appeal to both golfers and gamers who wouldn't otherwise be
golfers.

<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   South Park Rally ($40; www.acclaim.com; for the PC) offers
nothing new to the pip-squeak, chortling-fathead, fantasy-racer
genre that Plumberboy built, save for the fact that it is
emphatically crass, rude, foul and dirty, punctuated by projectile
vomit and incessant wet-fart noises. Presented as an intentionally
simplistic game of low-grade cardboard-cut-out graphics, Rally
actually moves along crisply and cleanly. A sparse number of maps
are greatly augmented by numerous race &AMP; chase variants, from
simple check-pointed circuits to tag/capture-the-flag
free-for-alls. Overly indulgent, indiscriminate voiced-over curses
and toilet bowl comments from some 27 South Park characters round
out the charmingly foul experience. Also available on the PSX,
which is horrible, and the N64, which is good for a rental or
purchase by die-hard South Park fans.

 &HT;    Sidewinder's a bit slippery
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Another entry in the battle to replace the mouse
and keyboard as the preferred interface device for First Person
Shooters (FPSs) while remaining a competent, general use
controller, the Sidewinder Dual Strike ($40; www.microsoft.com) is
an ambitious gamepad/mouse emulator hybrid. Held with both hands
and with hat switches, triggers and buttons for nearly every finger
and thumb, the innovative feature of the Dual Strike is its double
axis ball &AMP; socket rotator separating the two sides, which controls
the free look/aim function. The unit almost affords gamers a
second-skin, intuitive controller with great swivel and pivot
proffered by a limber wrist. Yet it manages to stymie that elusive
``instinctive feel,'' as a solid grip on the gizmo is impossible.
Held more like a sandwich being proffered to one's monitor, the
Dual Strike demands too much finesse while splaying the various
buttons just out of reach. A real handful, this Dual Strike
sandwich can be effective with a great deal of practice and
adaptation to its faults and unique attributes, but one has to
wonder, why bother?
</P>
<P>
   ADD SOME BITE TO YOUR GAMING
</P>
<P>
   Easily the best game pad you're going to find for your PC gaming
experience is InterAct's Hammerhead FX ($40; www.interact-acc.com).
Similar to the Dual Shock Analogue Controller of PlayStation
console fame, the Hammerhead's intelligent, ergonomic design offers
an exquisite second-skin feel. Symmetrical with two analogue thumb
sticks, four shoulder triggers, it also has a d-pad on the left and
six nicely splayed buttons on the right. A rock-solid device that's
perfectly functional with any gamepad-friendly game be it racer,
adventure, fighter or space marauder. More than that, the
Hammerhead FX does an adequate job with flight simulators, though
it can't, admittedly, better the multi-faceted, force feedback
functionality of a high-end joystick. It also does a moderately
fair job with First Person Shooters, but thumbstick free-look/aim
is too sluggish to really compete with a quick mouse. Nonetheless,
with stereo tactile (''rumble'') feedback and its overall hearty
design, this is a gamer's game pad doing everything a game pad
should do, perfectly. The search is over.

 &HT;    Speaker of the house

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jay and Marla Hiller sit next to each other on
chairs opposite the man who will help control the music they will
hear and the entertainment they will watch for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   On the table in front of them are blueprints of the dream home
they are building. It will be completed in November barring the
crises that such a large job always seems to entail. But months
before the Hillers and their two toddlers move in, Dale Johnson and
a team of workers from High Fidelity Inc. will go in and wire the
place, put speakers in unobtrusive places, install the new
high-definition TV set and put panels near the doors to control it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Their home will be automated, Internet-friendly, able to access
the family's CD collection from next to the pool or up in the media
room.
</P>
<P>
   It is an 8,600-square-foot dream home, but even dreamers wake up
to sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hiller leans forward, eyeing a comprehensive list with many
dollar signs assigned to a list of maybe hundreds of components,
wires, operating panels and remote controls. Johnson presents a
``not-to-exceed number,'' the high-end estimate of what the
equipment, installation, design and labor will cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many commas are in that not-to-exceed number?'' Jay asks.
</P>
<P>
   THE DREAMING HOME
</P>
<P>
   When Jay and Marla decided to build a house, they knew they
wanted to do it right. After spending time in Puerto Rico for Jay's
job as a consultant with Empowered Solutions Corp. of Georgia, they
were coming back to the place where they'd been born and bred. Both
University of Texas at Austin graduates, Marla (a retired high
school teacher) and Jay wanted a home free of complications, for
themselves and their kids.
</P>
<P>
   In the consultation with Johnson, who specializes in designing
and installing high-end audio and video systems in people's homes,
the couple says they want to rid themselves of the frustrations
they have in their current, temporary, home. Jay, a high-tech
junkie, has a system so convoluted that the in-laws have trouble
figuring out how to turn on the TV. It is this increasingly common
labyrinth of remote controls, wiring and set-top boxes that the
Hillers say they want to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't bother with it,'' Marla says. ``I want to be able to
push one button and have the music come on.''
</P>
<P>
   The system Johnson is designing will put controls for the home
in most of the rooms, allowing anyone in the house to access music,
movies or TV and satellite signals. It will also simplify their
home, bringing incredibly complex technologies down to the level
that a non-technophile can understand. Showing them a controller
that looks like an amazingly complicated keyboard, Johnson tells
the couple, ``This is the great simplifier.''
</P>
<P>
   They want to believe it will be. Like many, they put their faith
in gadgets, praying they will save time instead of creating
frustrations. They want to believe.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Johnson, a manager at High Fidelity, has been
working with families on systems like this for 15 years and has the
easy, accessible friendliness _ not of a salesman, but of a guy who
loves to play with these toys, and who also has a wife who won't
abide the complications they add to life. He reassures the couple
that this system, installed by engineers and geeks who can tell the
difference in quality between an S-Video and a composite signal,
will be simple.
</P>
<P>
   After going through the list, crossing a few things out and
discussing some changes in the plan, the Hillers leave the small
office and go into the showroom, eyeing HDTV sets, one of which
will end up in their main living room. ``We never get to go to the
movies, so we might as well bring the theater to us,'' Marla says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part,'' Jay adds, ``is writing the check.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of the job will decrease as they decide what they want
vs. what they really need. It won't really cost this much. But
right now, the estimate for the entire audio/video improvements to
their new dream home is $61,000.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW HI-FI
</P>
<P>
   The truth is this: These things are complicated. They require
special wiring, and sometimes holes are drilled into walls, and
even after all that work, ``Matlock'' may end up looking a little
fuzzy. But even though the Best Buy revolution has brought into the
home gadgets and equipment only dreamed about 10 years ago (the
digital receivers, the digital TV, the DVD players, the CD
recorders), there is still always the question: How does it all
work and who's going to set it up? Not so that it looks shabby, all
piled up on flat wooden boards in a rack system next to the TV like
some electronics mausoleum. How do you get it to look elegant, work
right and get rid of those godawful wires?
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, where high tech meets a particularly fierce love of
music and entertainment, local companies like Wizer Home Systems,
Audio by Design and Custom Systems Technologies Inc. are building
business on custom installations, multi-room systems and home
automation.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that used to focus on sales now place much more
emphasis on custom work and service as the demands of customers
have grown beyond the showroom. In the time Dale Johnson has been
at High Fidelity, the business has gone from being primarily a
consumer electronics store to a place that specializes in custom
installations. That can include everything from interfacing
computer equipment with the home entertainment system to installing
complex lighting systems that dim on command when the projection
screen comes down for a viewing of ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Home audio and video has gone from vacuum tubes and speaker
grills to touch pads, Internet-enabled CD catalogs and a newfound
sense of style. The speakers can go in the walls now, unobtrusive
and practically invisible. The stereo components can go anywhere,
away from the inquisitive, jelly-stained hands of toddlers and into
a nook where only the remote controller will find it.
</P>
<P>
   But, we'll say it again. It's complicated getting all this stuff
to work, getting equipment pieces to talk to each other and signals
to travel the right way. That's why people who can afford it call
on someone like Johnson to do it for them. ``We do business with a
lot of people who don't have time to mess with this stuff, but they
want it done right,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, even the high-tech elite need help installing
these systems, which can involve thousands of feet of wiring and
careful, computer-assisted planning and design. Customers,
especially techies, may know how to do some of this, but that
doesn't mean they want the grunt work. ``Someone like me has to be
really knowledgable. Especially in this town, you're faced with
people who know more than you do,'' Johnson says. ``You may have
somebody who designed the chip inside the component you're trying
to sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE CALLS
</P>
<P>
   The Hillers said they were referred to Johnson by their builder,
and when they started asking around, they found lots of their
friends had worked with Johnson. ``Everybody knows Dale,'' Marla
says breezily.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who's worked with Michael Dell and the late Tom Landry
on home systems, drives around in a little red convertible,
checking the progress on this job or that, making house calls for
clients, in between bids and desk work. On a sunny Thursday, he
stops by Origin co-founder Richard Garriott's mini-castle to check
on a blown subwoofer and the installation of a flat-screen plasma
TV set Garriott received in exchange for frequent flyer miles.
</P>
<P>
   At Garriott's house, in a purple velvet-adorned entertainment
room, Johnson helps two installers who are struggling with a CD
catalog system and the reception on the flat screen TV. Amid ornate
crystal balls and mounted medieval weapons (and just upstairs from
the suit of armor gracing the entryway), they make calls on their
cell phones, ordering new equipment and calling in the converters
and wiring they need to finish a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard, this is Dale. I'm over at your house,'' Johnson says
into his cell phone. A few minutes later, Garriott has agreed to
ordering a new subwoofer and an S-Video VCR. ``We'll fix it for
you. Talk to you later.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the road, Johnson says Garriott is like a lot of
customers who care more about the end result of an installation
than the details of the work. ``He'll say to me, 'Dale, whatever I
need.' They trust us to take care of it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Garriott is entrusting Johnson to work on a future project,
helping to wire an enormous new castle that will take about three
years to build. That house will include voice automation and will
be one of the biggest projects Johnson has ever taken on.
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, High Fidelity has dozens or projects in the
pipeline at various stages of completion. The Hillers are at the
bid stage. Another client down the road is a former Dell executive
who wants automatic lighting controlled by specialized fixtures and
switches. That job is well under way. At another site, a Round Rock
family is adding a home theater room to their house, bringing in a
retractable movie screen, Italian speakers and other high-end
equipment. As it stands now, spools of wires sit in a wood frame,
waiting like empty arteries for a signal to transmit.
</P>
<P>
   THE FINAL PRODUCT
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson started, a stereo for many people meant two
speakers. Now, with consumers getting increasingly savvy about home
theater, DVD and surround sound, Johnson's job has become more
difficult. He and his staff go through near-constant training,
attending conferences and reading voraciously about the latest and
greatest, before their customers learn more than they do.
</P>
<P>
   They've had to become jacks-of-all-trades, understanding not
only TVs and stereos but also Internet devices, lighting and
Firewire, the technology many say will simplify home wiring by
putting all of a home's components on one interface and one kind of
wire. Johnson and the staff also use existing blueprints of a home
to overlay their own designs and plans for installation. It's not
just about good sound and video anymore; it's about incorporating
the technology into a family's lifestyle and the look of a house.
Many times, the company works alongside the builder, making sure
the final product is exactly what the family wants.
</P>
<P>
   High Fidelity, which has a waiting list of about four weeks
because of the 50 to 60 jobs it is currently handling, isn't
lacking customers. And they still do small jobs alongside the more
massive design work.
</P>
<P>
   It can be expensive, but the results, which Johnson said help to
incorporate music, entertainment and functionality into people's
homes and lives, are often just the thing the customers wanted, but
didn't know they needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We design a system to make someone really happy when they walk
into their house,'' Johnson said.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ OK, so Pep the pup is no Jeff Gordon. Then
again, NASCAR legends don't get to navigate talking, purple cartoon
speedsters. The car in question is none other than Putt-Putt,
returning in another Humongous Entertainment adventure, Putt-Putt
Enters the Race ($30; Windows/Macintosh). Back from his previous
outing on the moon (try that, Dale Earnhardt!) Putt-Putt longs to
enter the Cartown 500 but Redline Rick, the sleek racecar who owns
the Cartown Raceway, sends our hero on a scavenger hunt first. To
enter the race, Putt-Putt needs to collect four items (including,
in a conscientious nod on Humongous' part, a safety helmet) hidden
in Cartown. Luckily for gamers, the items are hidden in different
locations and require different strategies to obtain with each
play. Characters encountered throughout the game help Putt-Putt and
Pep on their quest and all of the action is controlled with buttons
and switches on the car's dashboard. All this fun, and a race at
the end, too. Jeff Gordon never had it so good.
</P>
<P>
   PURR-FECTLY CHARMING
</P>
<P>
   Not sure if this game's appeal lies in its cute and cuddly
mascot character or the fact that game play is childishly simple.
Either way, Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy ($30; www.newkidco.com)
offers a good reason to wrest the GameBoy Color from the older
sibling and give someone else a try. Basically a childish version
of Tetris, where rudimentary domino-flavored block shapes fall
agonizingly slowly from the sky hoping to snuggle up with similar
blocks. The only interaction offered by Hello Kitty herself is that
fact that she'll inadvertently get in the way as she meanders back
and forth across the bottom of the screen. Still, a good lesson in
strategy, foresight and motor skills for the wee one and a good way
to teach the older sibling about ``sharing'' the GBC.

 &HT;    Sidewinder's a bit slippery
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Another entry in the battle to replace the mouse
and keyboard as the preferred interface device for First Person
Shooters (FPSs) while remaining a competent, general use
controller, the Sidewinder Dual Strike ($40; www.microsoft.com) is
an ambitious gamepad/mouse emulator hybrid. Held with both hands
and with hat switches, triggers and buttons for nearly every finger
and thumb, the innovative feature of the Dual Strike is its double
axis ball &AMP; socket rotator separating the two sides, which controls
the free look/aim function. The unit almost affords gamers a
second-skin, intuitive controller with great swivel and pivot
proffered by a limber wrist. Yet it manages to stymie that elusive
``instinctive feel,'' as a solid grip on the gizmo is impossible.
Held more like a sandwich being proffered to one's monitor, the
Dual Strike demands too much finesse while splaying the various
buttons just out of reach. A real handful, this Dual Strike
sandwich can be effective with a great deal of practice and
adaptation to its faults and unique attributes, but one has to
wonder, why bother?
</P>
<P>
   ADD SOME BITE TO YOUR GAMING
</P>
<P>
   Easily the best game pad you're going to find for your PC gaming
experience is InterAct's Hammerhead FX ($40; www.interact-acc.com).
Similar to the Dual Shock Analogue Controller of PlayStation
console fame, the Hammerhead's intelligent, ergonomic design offers
an exquisite second-skin feel. Symmetrical with two analogue thumb
sticks, four shoulder triggers, it also has a d-pad on the left and
six nicely splayed buttons on the right. A rock-solid device that's
perfectly functional with any gamepad-friendly game be it racer,
adventure, fighter or space marauder. More than that, the
Hammerhead FX does an adequate job with flight simulators, though
it can't, admittedly, better the multi-faceted, force feedback
functionality of a high-end joystick. It also does a moderately
fair job with First Person Shooters, but thumbstick free-look/aim
is too sluggish to really compete with a quick mouse. Nonetheless,
with stereo tactile (''rumble'') feedback and its overall hearty
design, this is a gamer's game pad doing everything a game pad
should do, perfectly. The search is over.

   ANDERSONVILLE, Ga. _ Angelo Spinelli never shot a single German
soldier, but he was decorated for shooting many of his friends.
With a camera.
</P>
<P>
   The only U.S. prisoner of war known to have taken photographs
while in captivity, Spinelli, 83, has donated more than 400
negatives he shot in German stalags to the National Prisoner of War
Museum in Andersonville. He was honored this month when the museum
opened an exhibit of 92 of his little-seen pictures, taken in three
German POW camps between 1943 and 1945, each at the risk of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Sanchez, the museum's chief curator, maintains that
Spinelli deserves the Medal of Honor, because every time he took
one of 1,200 pictures, ``he was performing way beyond the call of
duty.'' Sanchez is spearheading a campaign by the National Park
Service to convince the Pentagon that Spinelli deserves the
nation's highest award for heroism and valor.
</P>
<P>
   The negatives were sought by museums around the country.
Spinelli says he decided ``Andersonville should get them because
it's the one place that honors all POWs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big coup for us,'' Sanchez says. ``It's
unbelievable.'' According to the museum, no other American prisoner
in any war has managed to take photographs inside a prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is timed to coincide with the second anniversary of
the POW museum, erected to honor all U.S. war prisoners. After
Memorial Day, the exhibit will be sent to the 8th Air Force Museum
near Savannah, then to the Fort Benning National Infantry Museum
and, next January, to the state Capitol in Atlanta. Museums across
the country already are lining up to get it after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told these negatives are priceless,'' says Spinelli,
who owned a jewelry store in New York before retiring to
Hallandale, Fla., in 1989. ``But money you could spend and forget
about it. I want the collection to be available to all Americans,
so they will know what POWs and all soldiers endure. I told my son,
`Money doesn't do nothing. Let's donate them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spinelli's pictures capture both the grim realities of POW life
_ a Russian prisoner shot dead reaching for a cigarette, Americans
sleeping outdoors to escape their lice-infested barracks _ and the
sometimes humorous ways the soldiers learned to cope _ GIs clowning
as women, playing baseball or just goofing around. One baseball
picture shows Mickey Grasso, who made the major leagues after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Other images show the mundane side of camp life: men carrying
water, walking away from the latrine, dividing food parcels from
the International Red Cross, cooking over small stoves or standing
near dreary barracks in deep snow. One photo shows Spinelli himself
_ he'd handed his camera to a friend _ reading a letter from home
beside a Christmas tree loaded with homemade decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted into the Army in 1941, Spinelli was assigned to a combat
photography training unit because he had taken pictures in high
school and loved cameras. Rising to the rank of sergeant, he was
told to photograph whatever reflected GI life.
</P>
<P>
   After he landed in North Africa, for several months the only
action he saw was awards ceremonies. But on Valentine's Day 1943,
Spinelli and a dozen other men were assigned to take some German
POWs to the rear. They got lost, and ``all of a sudden we were
right in the middle of the Battle of Kasserine Pass,'' he says.
``In no time we were surrounded by Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a prisoner of the men who had been his prisoners.
``Prior to being caught, I spoke with the Germans and gave them
cigarettes and chocolates,'' he says. ``That paid off. I thought
they were going to kill us, but they treated us fine. They took us
out of our locked room for breakfast, lunch and dinner at a place
overlooking the Mediterranean.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, he was put on a plane for Sicily, then to Naples,
Italy. There, he boarded a reeking boxcar to Stalag III-B, near
Furstenburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   About six months later, the prisoners in Spinelli's camp began
receiving Red Cross parcels, which contained cigarettes. Some GIs
traded cigarettes to German soldiers, so he approached an older man
who claimed not to be a Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   They struck up a kind of quasi-friendship, and Spinelli offered
the German cigarettes in exchange for a camera and film.
Surprisingly, the German agreed, and soon handed over a compact
Voightlander Besser 20mm folding bellows camera. (Spinelli is also
donating the camera to the Andersonville museum.)
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Spinelli was trading cigarettes regularly for film,
and even a tripod. The German even took the film to a nearby town
and had prints made, which Spinelli carefully hid.
</P>
<P>
   ``My orders were to take pictures of anything that would be of
interest to us, so I took the chance and took them,'' Spinelli
says. ``If they'd have caught me, I'd have been a dead man. Cameras
were strictly verboten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told we were going to die anyway,'' he adds. ``At that
age, I didn't have any fear. If I'm gonna die later, so I die
sooner, and at least I have left evidence behind; they will know
how Americans lived in a POW camp.''
</P>
<P>
   To take the pictures, he attached a strap to the camera that
allowed it to hang down to waist level and concealed it in baggy
paratrooper pants. ``The guys would watch out for me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Spinelli kept taking pictures after he was moved to Stalag
III-A, just south of Berlin, in January 1945. Somehow, the guards
who searched the prisoners overlooked his camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``God was with me. If they'd have found it, I wouldn't be here
now.''
</P>
<P>
   By spring, Russian troops were closing in. One morning, all the
Germans were gone. Spinelli, who had lost 35 pounds to 115 during
his imprisonment, hitched a ride to the American lines. He arrived
in New York in June.
</P>
<P>
   He showed his pictures around, and got them published in a YMCA
pamphlet. But when he contacted Time-Life Books, he was turned
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editor had them on his desk for four weeks,'' Spinelli
recalls. ``Being young, I got disgusted and said, `You don't want
to publish them, give 'em back.' I put them in my closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight years later, Time-Life editors stumbled onto the
YMCA pamphlet at the Library of Congress, contacted Spinelli and
published several of his photos in a book, ``Prisoners of World War
II.'' Later, in 1988, when President Reagan went to Moscow, CBS
News did a piece on Russian and American POWs, and Spinelli had a
few minutes of fame, along with several of his pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only a few have been published. When he tried to strike a
deal with Yale University _ his negatives in return for tuition for
his three grandchildren _ he was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Now a widower bowed by a severe case of osteoporosis, Spinelli
remains feisty when recalling his years as a POW. ``I almost died
several times,'' he says. ``One time I got shot through the pants,
just below the groin, when I went over the warning fence for a
baseball. Two holes in there. Guess it's good I'm bowlegged.''
</P>
<P>
   He credits his faith for his survival, but also a determination
to do his duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told to take pictures,'' he says, ``and I did.''

 &HT;    Home, home on the waves with houseboats
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Three months ago, Jeff Walker and his cats, Razz
and Tazz, traded in their 2-bedroom North Austin apartment for a
floating neighborhood _ a seaworthy subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and his two felines now share a $250,000, four-bedroom
houseboat on Lake Travis, complete with a 450-gallon hot tub,
central air and heat and three stereo systems.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who owns a medical imaging business, originally bought
the houseboat to entertain clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out it was so much fun that I just decided to live out
here,'' said Walker. ``And I have a much bigger swimming pool
now.''
</P>
<P>
   With the robust economy, houseboat sales are soaring _ from
$25,000 entry-level used boats to high-end models in the mid-six
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has a direct impact on the houseboat industry,''
said Steve Smede, editor of Houseboat Magazine, who has seen
subscriptions to his publications double during the past five
years. ``People have money to spend and they're buying nicer
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales at Harborside Boats and Yachts, one of the largest brokers
of houseboats in the Austin area, have risen 10 percent to 15
percent a year for the past four years, fueled largely by the
high-tech boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there's an IPO or a stock split, there's a flurry
of activity,'' said Al Marweg, owner of Harborside, which has sold
63 new houseboats over the years. ``Sales have increased
dramatically over the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to local boat dealers, the only factor limiting
houseboat sales is a shortage of available slips, thanks to a
moratorium placed on new slips by the Lower Colorado River
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price isn't the issue _ parking is the issue,'' said Grant
Eriksen, owner of Eriksen Marina in Austin, which sells Sumerset
houseboats that can cost up to half a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although houseboats didn't always appreciate in value, that has
changed recently because of several factors. Because of the hot
economy, demand for houseboats nationwide is at an all-time high
and houseboat manufacturers are working at capacity. Most have long
waiting lists for new boats, driving up the value of existing
houseboats. And with the limited availability of marina space in
the Austin area, used houseboats with a slip sell for a premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past two years, the houseboats we have on the lake
have gained value,'' Eriksen said, adding that he recently sold a
2-year-old houseboat for $20,000 more than it sold for less than a
year ago. The sale was dependent on the slip.
</P>
<P>
   There are approximately 120,000 houseboats in North America and
Europe and production has grown threefold since 1990, according to
Houseboat Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Harborside has been selling 10 to 12 new boats a year, priced
from $160,000 to $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Just as homes seem to get more grandiose each year, houseboats
get larger and fancier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants something a little bigger, a little nicer,''
Marweg said.
</P>
<P>
   Boats these days are outfitted with fireplaces and Italian
marble, crystal chandeliers and dumbwaiters, wine coolers and
saunas.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of buyers are opting for custom-made boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like building a custom home,'' Eriksen said.
</P>
<P>
   When customers buy a boat from Eriksen Marina, they are flown
out to Sumerset's Kentucky manufacturing plant to pick out the
materials _ from the carpeting and cabinets to appliances and
window treatments. They spend a day with a staff interior decorator
and can even design their own floor plan.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksen said some of his customers, who include techies and Wall
Street speculators, are opting for such high-dollar doodads as
Subzero refrigerators, flat-screen TVs and Bose home theater
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a travel trailer on pontoons,'' Marweg said of
the new-generation houseboat. ``It's like building your own
high-dollar condominium on the lake. Anything you can get in a home
is adaptable for a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   And the boats seem to grow by the day _ as wide as 22 feet, in
some cases, Smede said. Some are pushing 100 feet and longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One I saw had more square footage than my two-story house,''
Smede said.
</P>
<P>
   Houseboats attract several kinds of buyers, Smede said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people buy ranches for weekend getaways on the range.
Others prefer the surf-side beauty of a beach house. And some
prefer houseboats.
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Lou Gardner's second home is docked at Lake Travis.
Almost every weekend, the Gardners leave their house in North
Austin and climb aboard ``Memories'' _ a $200,000 houseboat that
sleeps six and is packed with all the comforts of home. After a day
on the lake, they return to their dock and cook up huge meals for
friends on neighboring houseboats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a small town,'' Lou Gardner said of Lake
Travis Marina, where rows of gleaming houseboats are anchored.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Spillar and his family also use their houseboat as a
second home. Spillar said his 5-year-old houseboat works double
duty. It serves as a boat to get around the lake. And when it's
docked in the marina, it's a comfortable, four-bedroom,
two-bathroom weekend abode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people buy a house with a view of the lake and a boat to
get around the lake,'' said Spillar, a real estate investor. ``Our
houseboat is right on the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   There also are ``liveaboards'' who reside full time on their
houseboat. These range from blue-collar workers making a modest
income to people of means _ people like Deborah Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Reid started building a home in the hills, tired of the rapidly
escalating property taxes for the waterfront property. But eight
months into the project, she decided she missed life on the water.
</P>
<P>
   After spending time on a company houseboat, the restaurateur and
financial analyst decided to buy one for herself. Her
2,700-square-foot, $400,000 houseboat was delivered in August.
</P>
<P>
   The three-bedroom, three-bathroom houseboat, which she helped
design from the hull up, includes such extras as a fireplace,
Jacuzzi and wine chiller. One of the bedrooms has been transformed
into a dressing room, with floor-to-ceiling mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all the luxuries of a regular house and then some,''
Reid said. ``And if I get tired of my view, I just move it.''
</P>
<P>
   What's one of the best thing about living on her houseboat?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no property taxes,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes aside, houseboating isn't cheap in most cases. In addition
to the price of the boat and fuel and maintenance expenses, it
costs $10 to $14 a foot a month to dock a boat on Lake Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who made a down payment of $25,000 on his houseboat,
pays $2,200 a month on his boat loan, which has a 9 percent
interest rate. In addition, he pays $1,100 for his slip. And it
costs him $700 to fill the three 90-gallon gas tanks. That doesn't
include the cost of utilities and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cost, Walker said it can be inconvenient to
live on the water. The closest grocery store is 9 miles away and he
has a long commute to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to plan everything you do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these drawbacks, Walker has no plans to move back on
land anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a very interesting summer,'' said the 44-year-old
bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   CALCULATING THE COST OF LIVING ABOARD
</P>
<P>
   1. Boat loan payments
</P>
<P>
   2. Docking cost, calculated by the month
</P>
<P>
   3. Electric, phone, etc.
</P>
<P>
   4. Insurance _ boat and personal
</P>
<P>
   5. Food
</P>
<P>
   6. Entertainment
</P>
<P>
   7. Maintenance fund
</P>
<P>
   8. Fuel for travel

 &HT;    How Do You Spend $5 Million?: Whatever Floats Your Boat
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It cost nothing to think like a rich
man.
</P>
<P>
   So I had to ask yacht salesman Charles Amante the crucial
question:
</P>
<P>
   If a guy's got 5 million bucks to spend on a boat, where will he
and his Elizabeth Shue-look-alike be doing their nude sunbathing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right this way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled. At the high-end of a mega-boat show, it's all
about sex.
</P>
<P>
   And the 100-foot Tarrab, a drop-dead opulent yacht, is sexy. The
Tarrab was among 1,000 boats on display at the 15th annual Palm
Beach Boat Show this spring.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before the boat show began, or ``fluff and buff''
day, Amante took me to the ``sunpads'' atop the on-deck Jacuzzi _
the perfect spot for a tan. He showed off the handmade walnut
cabinets, the second Jacuzzi in the ``King's Cabin,'' twin Detroit
Diesel engines _ 1,450 horsepower each _ full-marble bath in the
No. 2 stateroom, cedar-lined walk-in closet, the eucalyptus wood
vanities, the black granite galley floor, the CD stereo system and
two Sub-zero freezers.
</P>
<P>
   For fish you'd catch?
</P>
<P>
   Amante offered a sympathetic you-poor-middle-class-fool smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, probably for caviar,'' he said. ``This yacht is built for
very opulent entertaining and long-distance cruising.''
</P>
<P>
   It took German and Italian craftsmen in Buenos Aires more than a
year to build the 25-foot-wide yacht, which is made with all U.S.
parts. Roughly the equivalent of a floating four-bedroom condo, it
has six sleeping rooms, seven bathrooms, a pilot house, main galley
and crew galley. There is also an outdoor wet bar and a salon at
the stern, which features couch, chairs and a wide-screen TV in a
remote control cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The yacht also has two of everything _ two freshwater pumps, two
generators, two engines _ just in case you break down in the middle
of your cruise to France.
</P>
<P>
   You and seven of your friends and family, plus crew, could
luxuriously cross the Atlantic to Europe in about 10 days. The
yacht can cruise at a comfortable 10 knots (12 mph), or a hurried
20 knots (25 mph).
</P>
<P>
   But that cruise will cost. For $40,000 to $50,000, a service
will deliver the yacht, or you can fill the 11 gas tanks with
diesel and sail yourself.
</P>
<P>
   A fill-up for the Tarrab costs about $4,000, and it burns about
20 gallons an hour. And don't forget maintenance. Upkeep will cost
you $150,000 to $200,000 a year, including your year- round
captain's salary ($60,000 to $80,000) and one mate ($20,000 to
$30,000).
</P>
<P>
   You could offset those costs by renting out the yacht for
$35,000 a week, but Amante says buyers at this level can afford to
not have strangers sleeping in their nautical bed.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of buyers. New-boat sales, according to the
National Marine Manufacturers Association, jumped 20 percent over
1998 to $23 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Amante says his inventory is limited because yachts are
custom-made, but he sells four to six luxury jobs each year,
starting at $1.5 million. About 90 percent of his buyers pay cash _
``no stock market whizzes lately. It's been tried and true money.''
</P>
<P>
   Amante has no doubts the Tarrab will sell. A Philadelphia man
rich from the e-commerce biz flew down recently in his private jet
for a test cruise. He said he'd get back to Amante. And what if
someone walks up and buys it this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   ``You snooze, you lose,'' says the salesman, with his finest
ain't-this- a-great-country smile.
</P>
<P>
   THOSE 80-FOOT SUPERYACHTS ARE `IN'
</P>
<P>
   _ New boat buyers on average are 48 years old and earn $50,000
per household; 27 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sale of superyachts _ 80 feet or longer _ has doubled the
past five years from 2,700 to more than 5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _ It costs $1 million a year to maintain a $10 million yacht.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 325-foot Christina O, where Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier
celebrated their wedding and Aristotle Onassis wooed Jackie, sleeps
36 and is available for charter. The price was $2.8 million for the
recent Millennium New Year's. The Talitha, owned by Paul Getty,
sleeps 12 and rents for $393,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Netscape-Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark has placed an
order for the largest privately owned yacht, a 300-foot job that
will take four years to build in the Netherlands.

   SMUGGLING-CHILDREN (Mexico City) _ Veronica Negrete Sanchez, 27,
is one of hundreds of mothers in Mexico who claim their children
were stolen or kidnapped, never to be seen again. They suspect
their children were sold for illegal adoptions, prostitution or

better cooperation in tracking American children abducted during
custody fights to other countries, including Mexico, the issue of
missing Mexican children gets barely a mention. By SUSANA HAYWARD.

 &HT;    Arts foundation should take over monument to junk
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Today I'm starting the movement to save the
Cathedral of Junk.
</P>
<P>
   We need a wealthy yard art patron to step up with a large wad of
cash to preserve this significant South Austin work of art. Michael
Dell, where are you when we need you? I want to see a picture in
the newspaper showing a bunch of guys in suits holding up one of
those 3-by-5-foot cardboard checks. Let's start Friends of Junk.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Hannemann, 37, who rents a small house, created the
Cathedral of Junk in his Bubbaland back yard. It's three towers of
stacked junk wired together, the tallest tower standing 32 feet
tall. Vince carefully crafted each pile. ``It's all stuff one
person could pick up and find,'' he said. ``All you need is a
burrito and a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Vince is tired of dealing with it, so he's
taking it down piece by piece and selling it a chunk at a time.
Vince begs you to please not come by and visit the cathedral. ``I
feel like a dung beetle sometimes, rolling this big ball of
(provide your own noun here) around,'' Vince said. He began
disassembling the Cathedral of Junk a week ago Friday, and he hopes
to have it completely gone within a year.
</P>
<P>
   This monument to recycling should be maintained. It took Vince
11 years to build it. The work looks like what you'd get if you
picked up everything set on the curb in South Austin on bulky trash
day and piled it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have over 700 bikes and I have over 200 TVs in it, and
everybody underestimates those two things by a factor of 10,''
Vince said. Also in there, according to the text on Vince's
Cathedral of Junk T-shirt, are McDonald's Happy Meal toys, ``a few
G.I. Joes,'' rear-view mirrors, pinball machines, a plastic Jesus,
vacuum cleaners, crutches, urinals, coffee makers, Weedeaters,
blenders, shopping carts, typewriters, sewing machines and riding
mowers. As the pile grew, folks would come by and dump their junk
in Vince's driveway for him to use. So the cathedral was also a
public service, since it meant people didn't have to drive to the
dump.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork is so enormous that you can climb up to the top of
the tallest tower through a tunnel of junk on a series of stone
steps and stepladders. I struggled up there and sat on lawn
furniture at the top, and it seemed sturdy. ``There's no place for
anything to fall,'' said Vince, whose day job is doing stucco.
``The thing is like a Chinese puzzle. It's all interlocking.''
People will stand in line for two hours to climb the tower, Vince
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize I was building a tourist attraction when I
started this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem. Vince isn't much of a people person, and
he's fed up with dealing with the media and the public coming by to
see his masterpiece. (He doesn't charge admission, but he takes
donations.) The questions annoy him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me why,'' Vince said. ``Why ask? I was just having
fun. And now I'm through playing with my toys. I'm going to put
them up. It's rude to leave your toys lying around. So I'm going to
put them up and move someplace else. There's more toys where this
came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince said he wants to move to a small town and build an even
bigger pile of junk.
</P>
<P>
   I think we could talk Vince into letting us preserve the
Cathedral of Junk with the right amount of money, and if we made it
so he doesn't have to deal with the crowds. This is South Austin's
version of The Orange Show, a collection of discarded materials put
together by a Houston postman that now has its own arts foundation.
Shouldn't Vince's trash get the same recognition? Somebody with
some bucks needs to fund Vince's work before he takes it completely
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get an arts foundation together to give tours. Vince could
continue to live in the rent house out front, while little old
ladies in tennis shoes give tours of the junk and do the talking
for him.
</P>
<P>
   The work started out small before Vince started to add on. ``It
was just hubcaps along the fence, and it got carried away,'' he
said. Then the curiosity seekers started coming in droves. Vince
said his place is overrun by visitors Fridays through Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Vince has had enough of them. ``It's a huge headache for me, and
that's part of the reason I'm closing it down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Let's pay him for his work and save the cathedral before it's
too late.

   WACO, Texas _ In a few days it will be a full seven years since
a startled nation watched in horror as a boiling fire consumed the
Branch Davidian compound that held scores of men, women and
children a few miles east of here.
</P>
<P>
   The April 19, 1993, fire appeared to start in an upwind corner
of the compound where a government tank had battered a hole in the
building while injecting massive quantities of disabling military
CS tear gas into the structure.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Mount Carmel building was on the point of collapse
due to a prolonged tank and gas assault on Davidian leader David
Koresh and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the government was through tormenting the Davidians
with psychological warfare tactics. There would be no more
negotiations. The 51-day siege of the religious sect was over.
</P>
<P>
   Every viewer of the live satellite feeds beamed from the scene
knew that the decision had been made to launch a final assault.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation approaches the seventh anniversary of the
fire, it is clear that the government failed to achieve the
finality it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this failure was how the event inflamed thousands
of Americans already distrustful of the government.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly dangerous anti-government malcontent exploded a
truck bomb outside a federal office building in Oklahoma City on
April 19, 1995, the second anniversary of the final assault. The
explosion killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
   The government attempted to put the Mount Carmel incident to
rest by producing a three-volume, 1,000-page report filled with
self-praise and no blame. The Justice Department investigation of
itself and the FBI was an obvious whitewash despite Attorney
General Janet Reno's response to criticism of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should get blamed if they did something wrong,'' she
said. The idea that no one did anything wrong in an obviously
botched undertaking grated on the nerves of many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the recovery of 76 charred bodies, including 21
children, was a clear indication that a great deal went wrong in
the attempt to take Koresh and others into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had to be wrong when Reno and FBI tactical agents
decided to launch a final assault on the compound over the vigorous
objections of FBI behavioral experts and negotiators who warned
that the action could end in tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The whitewash report meant the government blew another chance to
close the books on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was discovered that the FBI lied about its actions
during the final tragic assault on the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, FBI and Justice Department officials steadfastly
argued that agents did not fire pyrotechnic devices during the
final assault, right up to the discovery of evidence recovered from
the compound that contradicted government claims that agents did
not use incendiary devices during assault.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape was discovered with a soundtrack that contains
discussions among FBI Hostage Rescue Team members in which
permission was granted to fire incendiary tear gas cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the American people had been misled, and, once
again, any hope of putting closure to the tragedy was dashed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new investigation by a special counsel has run up a tab
exceeding $11 million as it attempts to find out who did what and
why seven years ago just east of here.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, some of the surviving Branch Davidians are
preparing to go to trial to settle their lawsuit against the
government over what happened seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The April 19 anniversary date will be remembered for years to
come.

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   FILE 1 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Q: For years I've heard Queen Elizabeth referred to as the
richest woman in the world. But a recent article said she was only
the eighth-richest British woman, worth $400 million. Can you
explain? If she isn't the world's richest woman, who is?
</P>
<P>
   A: Estimating the queen's wealth is difficult. For example, are
castles included? What about paintings and statuary?
</P>
<P>
   As the earlier article explained, Business Age magazine
published a report in 1995 saying that Queen Elizabeth's wealth
would amount to $3.4 billion if her art collection were added,
along with her properties, such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor
Castle. That figure, by the way, prompted a complaint by Buckingham
Palace to Britain's Press Complaints Commission, resulting in an
admission by the magazine that it might be legally difficult for
her to sell Buckingham.
</P>
<P>
   An even wealthier royal in Europe is Queen Beatrix of Holland,
with a net worth of $5.2 million, according to Guinness World
Records 2000. But even she isn't as well off as America's own Helen
and Alice Walton, widow and daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam
Walton. Forbes estimates that each are worth $16 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the names of the lawyers and/or law firms
representing plaintiffs in the race discrimination case against
Coca-Cola? How may they be contacted?
</P>
<P>
   A: The plaintiffs' attorneys include Cyrus Mehri of Mehri,
Malkin &AMP; Ross (202-822-5100) and Lamar Mixson of Bondurant, Mixson
&AMP; Elmore (404-881-4100).
</P>
<P>
   Q: When approaching a city on any Interstate highway, we see
signs such as ``Atlanta 42 miles.'' Where is ground zero for the
cities?
</P>
<P>
   A: In large cities, the mileage is given to the center of the
city, if at all possible. In smaller cities in more rural areas,
where the Interstate highway passes near but not through the city
limits, and where there are many different routes going into the
city, the mileage given is the best estimate of the average
distance to the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have seen several references saying the 13 stars on the
Confederate flag represent the 13 Confederate states. But every Web
site I go to for a list of the states shows only 11. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's correct to say there were 11 Confederate states, but the
two additional stars can be explained. The 11: Texas, Louisiana,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South
Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Even though they stayed in
the Union, Kentucky and Missouri are the other two, because
secessionist groups in each set up separate state governments and
sent delegates to the Confederate Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the current salary for U.S. senators and
representatives? What fringe benefits, such as insurance, health
care, travel expense accounts, retirement, office and housing
expenses, do they receive?
</P>
<P>
   A: The salary is $141,200 a year, automatically rising with the
cost of living unless Congress specifically votes down the
cost-of-living increase.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Taxpayers Union, major fringe benefits
include allowances for such things as offices, staff salaries,
travel between Washington and home states, and communications with
constituents, which for House members averages $800,000-$1 million
a year, and for Senate members $2 million-$3 million a year; the
use, for a small fee, of the Capitol Hill Office of the Attending
Physician; a $3,000-a-year federal income tax deduction for the
necessity of maintaining two residences; and priority care at
Walter Reed Army Hospital and Bethesda Naval Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   They also are eligible to participate in a 401(k) retirement
plan with the government matching contributions dollar-for-dollar
up to 10 percent of their salary; and an inflation-protected
pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   Minor perks include free parking at Capitol Hill; reserved and
free parking at National and Dulles airports; free firewood
delivery if they have fireplace in their office; free plants and
reproduction prints from the National Gallery to decorate the
offices; and, for the Senate, a taxpayer-subsidized barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayers Union points out that some perks from previous
years have been eliminated, such as free car washes and daily
delivery of ice to their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What determines the date thatEaster Sunday falls each year?
</P>
<P>
   A: The moon and mathematics determine the date of Easter each
year. Easter is the Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon, which
limits the dates it can occur from March 22 through April 25.
Orthodox Christians calculate differently, and Orthodox Easter can
occur as late as early May.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325, Easter wasn't always
celebrated on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The system that became the basis of the Gregorian calendar and
the table used to determine the date of Easter for most Christians
was formed in the 16th century. All algorithms used to date Easter
since then are based on these early tables.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many calendars written through the ages that set
the dates for Easter, but ``Carter's Algorithm,'' which settled the
dates from 1900 until 2099, used a simpler method.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was very surprised that the Methodist Church paid for one
of the lawyers for Elian Gonzalez's father, Juan Gonzalez, to go to
Cuba. Can you print the names of the Methodist officials who made
this decision?
</P>
<P>
   A: The decision was made by a denominational agency of the
United Methodist Church, the General Board of Church and Society,
in Washington. That group established a voluntary fund for
contributions to send Washington attorney Gregory B. Craig to Cuba
in early March.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thom White Wolf Fassett, top staff executive of the
Board of Church and Society, said no United Methodist Church
dollars are being used for the fund paying the lawyer, and that the
effort is supported only by outside contributions. Fassett said
Craig's visit included a three-hour meeting with Juan Gonzalez and
other family members.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said the fund is not unusual, because the board has a
history of working in the area of child advocacy. He also said the
United Methodist Church is a leading advocate for abolishing the
U.S. embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley. He's been in
the news lately concerning the Confederate flag controversy. Where
was he born and raised?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Democratic mayor of Charleston, S.C., was born and raised
in Charleston. He is a 1964 graduate of The Citadel and received
his law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Riley organized a 120-mile march from Charleston to Columbia
that began April 2 to protest the flying of the Confederate flag
over the state Capital.

</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Rudy Ruettiger, the Notre Dame football
bench-warmer who inspired the movie ``Rudy''? He is married? Does
he have children?
</P>
<P>
   A: Daniel ``Rudy'' Ruettiger has written three books and is
semi-retired from the motivational talk and public speaking
circuit. Ruettiger, portrayed by Sean Astin in the 1993 film,
decided to devote more time to his wife and daughter. The family
moved from Chicago to Henderson, Nev., and since 1994 his talks
have been limited to occasional appearances before church groups.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I can't find any Massachusetts quarters. I hear they pulled
them because the anti-gun groups didn't like the Minute Man with a
musket in his hand. Are the coins out of circulation ?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Massachusetts quarters, over a billion of them, are in
circulation, says Michael White with the U.S. Mint. The first set
of the series of quarters for each state came out a year ago.
Citizen groups in each state, directed by each state's governor's
office, design the specialty quarters. White said there haven't
been any problems with the designs, and that and the Massachusetts
quarter will remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did Andres Galarraga get the nickname of ``the big cat''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Galarraga, 38, got the name early in his career because of
his quickness and cat-like reactions, says Atlanta Braves spokesman
Glen Serra. The first baseman signed with the Atlanta Braves from
the Colorado Rockies three years ago, but was out last season for
treatment of cancer in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many different ways are there to qualify for the Masters
?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are 17 specific qualifications or lists of golf
tournaments that golfers must have won, or rankings they must have
achieved, to be invited to the Masters. But the committee also can
invite international players not otherwise qualified.
</P>
<P>
   The list of invitees includes U.S. Open champions, British Open
champions, the current U.S. Amateur champion, PGA champions, the
first 16 players in the previous year's Masters and the first eight
players in the previous years' U.S. Open Masters Tournament
champions are on the list, as are the three leaders on the current
year's official PGA Tour money list.
</P>
<P>
   Making it to the Masters is only the first hurdle. At the end of
36 holes of play, the field is reduced to the best 44 scores and
ties, plus those within 10 strokes of the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Millions of us watched Warren Beatty win the Irving Thalberg
Award during this year's Oscars ceremonies March 26. Who is
Thalberg, and why is the award presented in his name ?
</P>
<P>
   A: Warren Beatty was the 36th Hollywood producer to receive the
Irving Thalberg Award since 1937. The award for a body of work is
voted by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' Board of
Governors, and is not always given every year.
</P>
<P>
   Thalberg died at age 37 in 1936 of pneumonia after a short but
illustrious career. He became a producer at the Universal Film
Manufacturing Co. at 20, and three years later became vice
president and head of production for Louis B. Mayer. After Mayer's
studio became part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Thalberg was vice
president and supervisor of production until his death eight years
later.
</P>
<P>
   The award is a solid bronze head of Thalberg on a black base. It
is 9 inches tall and weighs just over 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the president dies, is the first lady entitled to a
pension? Is there a widow's clause ? What if the they get divorced?
</P>
<P>
   A: A former first lady is entitled to $20,000 a year for the
rest of her life if her husband dies. According to the White House
press office, she isn't entitled to the pension if there is a
divorce. Presidents receive $151,000 a year after they leave
office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a report that 41,375 people were killed on U.S.
highways last year. How does that compare with gun deaths?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most recent statistics for deaths from firearms in the
United States lists 32,436 in 1997, according to the National
Center for Health Statistics. That includes all types of firearm
incidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lists
41,471 highway deaths in 1998. Preliminary figures for 1999 are
41,345.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was Elian Gonzalez brought back to shore by the fisherman who
discovered him or by the Coast Guard?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 6-year-old was rescued by two fishermen, Sam Ciancio and
his cousin Donato Dalrympler. They found him clinging to an inner
tube 3 miles off Fort Lauderdale, Fla., last Thanksgiving Day.
Elian's mother died along with 10 other Cubans when their boat
broke apart off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend said a homeless man tried to sell him a blanket that
he said was given as an incentive for completing the census form.
Are the homeless filling out more than one form to get these
incentives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lance Robertson with the U.S. Census Bureau said that they
are increasing efforts to get the homeless to fill out forms, but
they aren't giving out blankets or anything else. He said the only
thing census workers are allowed to give is advice. He also said
that in the past, the homeless population was undercounted, and
they are increasing efforts to get information and to prevent
duplication. Robertson said to call 1-800-471-9424 with any census
questions or concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the breakdown of oil imports from the OPEC nations,
and how does this compare with U.S. domestic oil production?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries produces
about 40 percent of the world's crude oil and 14 percent of its
natural gas. At the end of 1996 (the most recent figures
available), OPEC had 76.6 per cent of the world's total proven oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1996 report, the United States was the No. 3 oil
producer. Saudi Arabia was No. 1, producing 8.1 million barrels per
day. Countries of the former Soviet Union were No. 2, at 6.9
million bpd. The United States produced 6.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After reading about the production of oil, I am wondering:
How many gallons are there in a barrel of oil?
</P>
<P>
   A: A barrel contains 42 gallons of oil.

U.S. embargo against Cuba.

   Q: I'm interested in Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley. He's been in
the news lately concerning the Confederate flag controversy. Where
was he born and raised?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Democratic mayor of Charleston, S.C., was born and raised
in Charleston. He is a 1964 graduate of The Citadel and received
his law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1967.

   Q: Whatever happened to Rudy Ruettiger, the Notre Dame football
bench-warmer who inspired the movie ``Rudy''? He is married? Does
he have children?
</P>
<P>
   A: Daniel ``Rudy'' Ruettiger has written three books and is
semi-retired from the motivational talk and public speaking
circuit. Ruettiger, portrayed by Sean Astin in the 1993 film,
decided to devote more time to his wife and daughter. The family
moved from Chicago to Henderson, Nev., and since 1994 his talks
have been limited to occasional appearances before church groups.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I can't find any Massachusetts quarters. I hear they pulled
them because the anti-gun groups didn't like the Minute Man with a
musket in his hand. Are the coins out of circulation ?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Massachusetts quarters, over a billion of them, are in
circulation, says Michael White with the U.S. Mint. The first set
of the series of quarters for each state came out a year ago.
Citizen groups in each state, directed by each state's governor's
office, design the specialty quarters. White said there haven't
been any problems with the designs, and that and the Massachusetts
quarter will remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did Andres Galarraga get the nickname of ``the big cat''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Galarraga, 38, got the name early in his career because of
his quickness and cat-like reactions, says Atlanta Braves spokesman
Glen Serra. The first baseman signed with the Atlanta Braves from
the Colorado Rockies three years ago, but was out last season for
treatment of cancer in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many different ways are there to qualify for the Masters
?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are 17 specific qualifications or lists of golf
tournaments that golfers must have won, or rankings they must have
achieved, to be invited to the Masters. But the committee also can
invite international players not otherwise qualified.
</P>
<P>
   The list of invitees includes U.S. Open champions, British Open
champions, the current U.S. Amateur champion, PGA champions, the
first 16 players in the previous year's Masters and the first eight
players in the previous years' U.S. Open Masters Tournament
champions are on the list, as are the three leaders on the current
year's official PGA Tour money list.
</P>
<P>
   Making it to the Masters is only the first hurdle. At the end of
36 holes of play, the field is reduced to the best 44 scores and
ties, plus those within 10 strokes of the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Millions of us watched Warren Beatty win the Irving Thalberg
Award during this year's Oscars ceremonies March 26. Who is
Thalberg, and why is the award presented in his name ?
</P>
<P>
   A: Warren Beatty was the 36th Hollywood producer to receive the
Irving Thalberg Award since 1937. The award for a body of work is
voted by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' Board of
Governors, and is not always given every year.
</P>
<P>
   Thalberg died at age 37 in 1936 of pneumonia after a short but
illustrious career. He became a producer at the Universal Film
Manufacturing Co. at 20, and three years later became vice
president and head of production for Louis B. Mayer. After Mayer's
studio became part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Thalberg was vice
president and supervisor of production until his death eight years
later.
</P>
<P>
   The award is a solid bronze head of Thalberg on a black base. It
is 9 inches tall and weighs just over 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the president dies, is the first lady entitled to a
pension? Is there a widow's clause ? What if the they get divorced?
</P>
<P>
   A: A former first lady is entitled to $20,000 a year for the
rest of her life if her husband dies. According to the White House
press office, she isn't entitled to the pension if there is a
divorce. Presidents receive $151,000 a year after they leave
office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a report that 41,375 people were killed on U.S.
highways last year. How does that compare with gun deaths?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most recent statistics for deaths from firearms in the
United States lists 32,436 in 1997, according to the National
Center for Health Statistics. That includes all types of firearm
incidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lists
41,471 highway deaths in 1998. Preliminary figures for 1999 are
41,345.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was Elian Gonzalez brought back to shore by the fisherman who
discovered him or by the Coast Guard?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 6-year-old was rescued by two fishermen, Sam Ciancio and
his cousin Donato Dalrympler. They found him clinging to an inner
tube 3 miles off Fort Lauderdale, Fla., last Thanksgiving Day.
Elian's mother died along with 10 other Cubans when their boat
broke apart off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend said a homeless man tried to sell him a blanket that
he said was given as an incentive for completing the census form.
Are the homeless filling out more than one form to get these
incentives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lance Robertson with the U.S. Census Bureau said that they
are increasing efforts to get the homeless to fill out forms, but
they aren't giving out blankets or anything else. He said the only
thing census workers are allowed to give is advice. He also said
that in the past, the homeless population was undercounted, and
they are increasing efforts to get information and to prevent
duplication. Robertson said to call 1-800-471-9424 with any census
questions or concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the breakdown of oil imports from the OPEC nations,
and how does this compare with U.S. domestic oil production?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries produces
about 40 percent of the world's crude oil and 14 percent of its
natural gas. At the end of 1996 (the most recent figures
available), OPEC had 76.6 per cent of the world's total proven oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1996 report, the United States was the No. 3 oil
producer. Saudi Arabia was No. 1, producing 8.1 million barrels per
day. Countries of the former Soviet Union were No. 2, at 6.9
million bpd. The United States produced 6.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After reading about the production of oil, I am wondering:
How many gallons are there in a barrel of oil?
</P>
<P>
   A: A barrel contains 42 gallons of oil.
</P>

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Singer Sting and his wife, Trudie
Styler, live in the Lake House, a 16th-century country manor in
England. Styler and their chef, Joseph Sponzo, wrote ``The Lake
House Cookbook, which includes the recipe for sea bass with sauteed
wild mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   SEA BASS WITH SAUTEED WILD MUSHROOMS
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons grapeseed oil, plus extra for brushing
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons finely chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces fresh chanterelle mushrooms (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces fresh black trumpet mushrooms (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 sea bass (about 2 pound each, filleted)
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs tarragon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 lemon, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh peas
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs mint
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a medium frying pan over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon
of the butter and 1 teaspoon of the oil. When the butter starts to
foam, add half the shallots and cook for 30 seconds before adding
the chanterelles. Cook for 1 1/4 to 2 1/2 minutes, stirring
frequently. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Remove from heat,
transfer to a baking dish and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe the frying pan with a paper towel. Add another tablespoon
of butter and 1 teaspoon of oil and repeat the cooking process with
the remaining mushrooms. Transfer them to the baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to a very low setting (200 degrees). Place
mushrooms in oven to keep warm until ready to assemble the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large steamer pot with water and add tarragon and lemon
to the water. Bring to a boil. Season the sea bass on both sides
with salt and pepper. Brush the bottom of a bamboo steamer with
oil. Just before serving, place the steamer over the boiling water,
sit the bass in the steamer skin-side up, cover and steam for 4 to
5 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, place the peas, 4 tablespoons of
water, 1/2 tablespoon of butter, the mint and some salt and pepper.
Heat gently until just warm then discard the mint.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, place sea bass skin side up on plate. Arrange a
quarter of the chanterelles on each plate and scatter the black
trumpets on the other. Place a pile of peas next to each type of
mushroom.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings.

   GRANDMA VANASCO'S APPLE-AND-CHEDDAR STUFFED PORK CHOPS
</P>
<P>
   4 12-ounce center-cut pork chops, cut about 1-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1 Golden Delicious apple, peeled, cored and cut into 12 slices
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Using a sharp knife, cut a deep pocket into the center of each
chop. Stuff each pocket with 3 apple slices and 2 tablespoons
cheese. Brush the chops with oil and season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Build a charcoal fire in an outdoor grill, and let burn until
covered with white ask. In a gas grill grill, preheat to high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the coals heaped in a mound in the center of the grill. Do
not spread them out. Lightly oil the cooking grate. Place the chops
over the coals and cover. Grill, turning once, until seared on both
sides, about 5 minutes. Move the chops to the cooler, outside
perimeter of the grill. In a gas grill, grill on high until seared
on both sides, about 5 minutes, then adjust heat to medium.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into
the center of the meat of the pork chop reads 155 degrees, about 10
to 15 minutes. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.

Book'' by Joseph T. Bonannno, Jr., Broadway Books, 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   STUFFED ZUCCHINI WITH VEAL OR CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   7 large zucchini (about 4 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium onion, chopped ( 1/2 cup)
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ground veal or chicken
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons grated imported Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plain dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   Trim ends of zucchini, then cut 6 of them into thirds. Using a
melon baller, scoop out and discard the centers of the zucchini
pieces. Set aside. Chop remaining zucchini and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over
medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes, stirring
frequently. Add chopped zucchini, garlic, and thyme and cook,

</P>
<P>
   Transfer mixture to a bowl and set aside. In the same pan, heat
the remaining oil over medium-high heat. Add the veal or chicken
and cook, stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the wine
and bring to a boil. Return the onion mixture to the pan, cover,
reduce heat and cook for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncover the pan and continue to cook for 2 minutes to reduce the
liquid. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and pulse for
about 10 seconds, or until finely chopped. Add the cream and
Parmesan and process 5 seconds longer, just to blend. Season with
salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the inside of the zucchini pieces with salt and pepper.
Fill the zucchini pieces with the veal mixture, piling it about 1/2
inch over the top. Arrange the stuffed zucchini pieces in a baking
dish and sprinkle them with bread crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 25 minutes or until zucchini are tender.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings.

 &HT;    Celebs add spice to cookbooks
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Well, gawwwwly! Aunt Bee's gone and
written another cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   No, wait. It's Ken Beck and Jim Clark, authors of ``Aunt Bee's
Mealtime in Mayberry'' (Rutledge Hill Press, 1999) who've penned
the recipes in their second volume representing the doddering
sweetheart who fed Andy, Opie and the gang in the TV town of
Mayberry, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Their first book, ``Aunt Bee's Delightful Desserts,'' was
followed by another one cashing in on the name of another fictional
cook: Mary Ann, one of the castaways on Gilligan's Island (``Mary
Ann's Gilligan's Island Cookbook,'' out of print).
</P>
<P>
   Beck and Clark tapped all their friends for recipes to fill the
books _ they admit they're not cooks. The dishes represent foods
they say would have been served in the circumstances of the sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes are home-style and simplistic. The books focus on the TV
show dialogue, still shots from the shows and plot themes spelled
out for the fans; foods are secondary.
</P>
<P>
   But today, everyone's writing a cookbook. Celebrities, caterers
to celebs, and wannabes are publishing recipes with varying degrees
of sophistication and success.
</P>
<P>
   TV shows of the past have inspired a number of quasi-cookbooks.
``The Bewitched Cookbook, Magic in the Kitchen'' and ``Secrets of
the M.A.S.H. Mess: The Lost Recipes of Private Igor'' are examples.
Elinor Donahue of ``Father Knows Best'' added her recipes to ``In
the Kitchen with Elinor Donahue: Favorite Memories and Recipes from
a Life in Hollywood'' (1998, Cumberland Publishing).
</P>
<P>
   There's Suzanne Somers, whose weight-loss and fitness plans
often show up on infomercials. She wrote ``Get Skinny on Fabulous
Food'' (1999, Crown) with her dietitian, Diane Schwarzbein. It's a
low-carb, low-fat diet that Somers claims has kept her trim. The
recipes work, however; there's culinary backbone to support them.
</P>
<P>
   Another trio, John D. Crisafulli, Sean Fisher and Teresa Villa,
cook for the rock stars and their band members, and they've penned
``Backstage Pass,'' (Cumberland House Books, 1998). They dish
morsels of gossip about Billy Joel, Aerosmith and Elton John, among
others, while giving out the recipes for achiote chicken or Tuscan
pasta salad. Their catering recipes also are legit, and most sound
as though most of the aging stars are watching their diets.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Schwartz, a former Tequesta caterer, takes us to the
tables of movie stars in his book, ``Chef Harry and Friends:
Sharing the Joys of the Table,'' (Sourcebooks, 1997). He gives us a
glimpse of entertaining in celebrity settings, as does Colin Cowie
(``For the Bride: A Guide to Style and Gracious Living,'' Delacorte
Press, 2000), who has his own upscale entertaining show on the
Romance Network. Both have written comprehensive cookbooks with
tips on presenting beautiful foods at beautiful parties to the
beautiful people.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the beautiful people write their own cookbooks. Singer
Sting and his family moved into a huge country house and made it
into an organic farm on 60 acres. Sting's spouse, Trudie Styler,
got with her chef to write ``The Lake House Cookbook'' (Clarkson
Potter, 1999), a feast of recipes focusing on the organic produce
from their gardens. The recipes are articulate, and Styler's story
about restoration of the house and gardens, and her views on
organic foods are interesting reading on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's singer Jane Siberry's manager _ Bob Blumer. Food
Network TV fans will recognize him as the Surreal Gourmet. But he
started out as a guy who cooked for friends and family and who
decided to write a cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrities of their own making are entering the cookbook
market as well. There's Dr. Andrew Weil, who has earned a following
with his specials on PBS. The best-selling author now has a
cookbook to follow his health plan, ``Eating Well for Optimum
Health'' (Knopf, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   New York firefighter Joseph T. Bonanno Jr. is a celebrity among
his peers and has been featured on cooking shows as well. His
latest book, ``The Firehouse Grilling Cookbook'' (Broadway Books,
1998), gives the professional's take on cooking with fire. He
tapped firefighters from around the country to contribute recipes,
and the book is down to earth and doable for the backyard griller.
</P>
<P>
   And Florida's largest celeb, Mickey Mouse, has his own cookbook,
too (``Cooking With Mickey,'' Vol. II). Fortunately, he allowed the
chefs who work for him to contribute the recipes. Another of
Mickey's cookbooks, ``Mickey's Gourmet Cookbook: The Most Popular
Recipes from Walt Disney World and Disneyland,'' edited by Victoria
Stasio, has just been released in paperback.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Elian, Microsoft and flag-burning
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Three things either I'm too dumb to understand
or their proponents are too dumb to explain to me:
</P>
<P>
   Sending Elian back to Cuba:
</P>
<P>
   Suppose this same sort of incident had occurred at the height of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose it involved East and West Berlin instead of Havana and
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A mother is fleeing East Berlin with her son. She dies trying,
but the boy survives. His family in West Berlin takes him into
their home.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine the child being sent back to East Berlin by the
West German government? I can't imagine sending any innocent
person, especially a child, back to a communist country, even if
it's to his father.
</P>
<P>
   What am I missing?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling against Microsoft:
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is good at what it does. What it does it does better
than anybody else. As a result the government is punishing
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of who succeeds in business is made by the buying
public. What is the court doing in this?
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood grocery stores put individual shops out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets put grocery stores out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Warehouse discount centers are putting all sorts of big stores
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping on the Internet may well put everybody else out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to the concept of free enterprise? What has
happened to the concept of competition in the market? What has
happened to the idea that success succeeds?
</P>
<P>
   What am I missing?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Opposing laws against burning the American flag:
</P>
<P>
   No one says they're in favor of burning the flag.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of folks are saying they're not in favor of laws
against flag burning.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of free speech, they say.
</P>
<P>
   An American burning the American flag is an obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, obscenities are protected by freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, obscenities aren't allowed in public places.
</P>
<P>
   I say burn the flag if you want to. But do it in the privacy of
your own home. Do it naked if you want to. I couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   But in a public place, it's a provocative act that has the
potential of starting a riot _ not unlike yelling ``Fire!'' in a
crowded theater.
</P>
<P>
   You want to make a speech about burning the flag? Make a speech.
I don't know what's stopping you.
</P>
<P>
   What am I missing?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Not that the above little speech is likely to make any
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions:
</P>
<P>
   Elian will go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, to some extent, will be broken up by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   No law will be passed against burning the flag.
</P>
<P>
   And a majority of Americans will never know what they've been
missing.

 &HT;    Destiny's Child gone wild
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ All-female R&AMP;B quartet Destiny's Child,
currently riding near the top of the Billboard charts with its
jilted-lover single ``Say My Name,'' recently underwent a lineup
transplant two months ago that still has many fans confused.
</P>
<P>
   Original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson were
themselves jilted _ or else they quit, depending on who you believe
_ and were hastily replaced by two members who fit the same
profile: 18 to 19 years old, African-American, shapely and
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the same characteristics of Beyonce Knowles and Kelly
Rowland, the other two founding members who remain in Destiny's
Child. Beyonce is the daughter of the group's manager, Mathew
Knowles, and Rowland is under Mathew's legal guardianship.
</P>
<P>
   Things turned especially sour last month when the two former
members filed a lawsuit against the manager and remaining two
members, alleging that they ``went on a rampage to destroy (our)
careers.'' The lawsuit, filed in Harris County District Court,
describes Mathew Knowles as greedy and domineering, a man who went
so far as to dictate the diets of the girls and demand they keep
their virginity. It also details how Luckett and Roberson were kept
in the dark about recent appearances at the Soul Train and Grammy
awards shows so the new members could perform there.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call to Luckett's home in Houston was not returned. A
man who answered said Luckett and Roberson had been advised by
lawyers not to talk to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, neither the lawsuit nor the quick switcheroo of
members appears to have hurt Destiny's Child, which formed in 1996
and debuted with a minor track on the ``Men in Black'' soundtrack
two years later. ``Say My Name,'' off the group's triple-platinum
second album ``The Writing's on the Wall,'' (released last year,
before the membership meltdown) is its biggest hit yet. It follows
such past singles such as ``Bills, Bills, Bills'' and ``No, No, No
(Part II).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Say My Name'' was released to radio immediately following the
group's two Grammy nominations. The video, with nary a sign of
Luckett or Roberson, was shot last-minute to include new members
Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. It's now in heavy rotation
on MTV and BET's music shows.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, one of the originals left in Destiny's Child, credited
the group's flourishing success amid all the controversy to ``the
grace of God'' and ``the strong family unit'' between her, Beyonce
and Mathew Knowles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my sister, and he is truly like a father to me, so it's
going to take a lot more than something like this to break that
up,'' Rowland said, calling from Houston last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been bad vibes brewing for a long time, a lot longer
than anyone knew about outside of the group. This new situation is
just full of good karma and positive energy, and we've been so
blessed. In a month our record sales have tripled, and the fans
have stood by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said she and Beyonce did about 85 percent of the singing
on the group's albums. Indisputably, too, the pair had always been
the primary singers in concert. Rowland said that all might change
with the addition of Franklin and Williams, ``because they're both
extremely gifted and have a lot to offer to the vocals.'' Franklin
had been a dancer in one of the group's previous videos, and
Williams was a back-up singer for Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lawsuit, Rowland couldn't go into specifics of
the split with Luckett and Roberson. Before the interview, Mathew
Knowles said ``it's a legal issue, but it's also a dead issue,''
emphasizing the group is already looking past the controversy to
its future.
</P>
<P>
   The next few months could be especially vital for Destiny's
Child. The group is planning American tour dates with 'N Sync and
Britney Spears, plus its own tour of Europe, where ``The Writing's
on the Wall'' is enjoying even greater success. England,
especially, has embraced Destiny's Child as the new Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was telling us `Say My Name' would be the big hit off
the record, which was why we waited to release it as the third
single,'' Rowland said. ``I think people like the fact that it's
such a true-to-life song. Everyone goes through their own
heartbreak now and then. Our fans like to know that we go through
the same things they do.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems especially true in recent months. Said Rowland,
``It's been hard, personally, going through this. But we've been
praying, and we've stuck together, and I think we're already past
it.''

than 400 negatives he shot in German stalags to the National

   HOUSEBOATS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Three months ago, Jeff Walker and
his cats, Razz and Tazz, traded in their 2-bedroom North Austin
apartment for a floating neighborhood _ a seaworthy subdivision.
Walker and his two felines now share a $250,000, four-bedroom
houseboat on Lake Travis, complete with a 450-gallon hot tub,
central air and heat and three stereo systems. Walker, who owns a
medical imaging business, originally bought the houseboat to
entertain clients. ``I found out it was so much fun that I just
decided to live out here,'' said Walker. ``And I have a much bigger
swimming pool now.'' With the robust economy, houseboat sales are
soaring _ from $25,000 entry-level used boats to high-end models in
the mid-six figures. ``The economy has a direct impact on the
houseboat industry,'' said Steve Smede, editor of Houseboat
Magazine, who has seen subscriptions to his publications double
during the past five years. ``People have money to spend and
they're buying nicer things.'' Sales at Harborside Boats and
Yachts, one of the largest brokers of houseboats in the Austin
area, have risen 10 percent to 15 percent a year for the past four
years, fueled largely by the high-tech boom. (Breyer, Austin

   LUXURY-BOAT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It cost nothing to think

crucial question:

   If a guy's got 5 million bucks to spend on a boat, where will he
and his Elizabeth Shue-look-alike be doing their nude sunbathing?
``Right this way,'' he said. Don't be fooled. At the high-end of a
mega-boat show, it's all about sex. And the 100-foot Tarrab, a
drop-dead opulent yacht, is sexy. The Tarrab was among 1,000 boats
on display at the 15th annual Palm Beach Boat Show this spring. On
the day before the boat show began, or ``fluff and buff'' day,
Amante took me to the ``sunpads'' atop the on-deck Jacuzzi _ the
perfect spot for a tan. He showed off the handmade walnut cabinets,
the second Jacuzzi in the ``King's Cabin,'' twin Detroit Diesel
engines _ 1,450 horsepower each _ full-marble bath in the No. 2
stateroom, cedar-lined walk-in closet, the eucalyptus wood
vanities, the black granite galley floor, the CD stereo system and

 &HT;    Newsboys working out the bugs with bring-your-own arenas
 &HT;    By James Lloyd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The big hook. That is what characterizes a
Newsboys' live performance as well as the group's pop-rock sound.
We're not talking about an implement that comes out of stage right
and yanks an off-key singer out of sight. Rather, it is that live
image or recorded bit that stays in the mind long after the show or
song is over.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, that hook might have been a spaceship that
delivered the Christian pop-rock band on stage, a giant microphone
that descended from the ceiling or a rotating drum kit.
</P>
<P>
   Well, fasten your seatbelt. This time the big hook is the venue
itself, an inflatable arena that seats 2,500 people, with standing
room for another 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's been the talk of the Christian music tour scene this year,
because it's never been tried in the States. And bass player Phil
Joel admitted, ``We had a few `teething' problems at the beginning
(such as trying to set up in 60-mph winds in San Antonio, Texas),
but it makes sense. No one's ever done this before. We're making it
up as we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   The bugs should be worked out by tonight, when the tour with
Sonicflood and Beanbag hits Xenia, which is more than half-way
through the band's 65-city tour.
</P>
<P>
   Two arenas are used, with one being set up in the next city
while the other is used for a show. A crew of about 50 assembles
the dome, and the traveling entourage includes seven trucks, four
tour buses and trailers carrying merchandise, caterers and so
forth. One of the trucks contains 24 bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The ``blow-up air domes'' have their own generators for climate
control and power, according to tour information, and a
tractor-trailer is converted into a 40-by-40-foot, in-the-round
stage that is flanked by two video walls. A million watts of
lighting is available, as well as 150,000 watts of sound.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff, Joel says, is that no one is farther than about 70
feet from the stage, so ``you can have eye contact with just about
everyone in the venue, which is really nice.'' Being in the same
place every night also reduces the variables, such as sound
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Newsboys' Joel said the interest in the show and the venue
has been worth the adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every man and his dog has turned out to see this crazy thing
...,'' he said. ``Obviously, all the bands in the Christian realm
have come to check it out, and a lot of different secular promoters
and management and booking agents have come to see it because this
thing, this whole concept of taking out your venue could change the
face of touring.''

With a camera. The only U.S. prisoner of war known to have taken

than 400 negatives he shot in German stalags to the National

   HOUSEBOATS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Three months ago, Jeff Walker and
his cats, Razz and Tazz, traded in their 2-bedroom North Austin
apartment for a floating neighborhood _ a seaworthy subdivision.
Walker and his two felines now share a $250,000, four-bedroom
houseboat on Lake Travis, complete with a 450-gallon hot tub,
central air and heat and three stereo systems. Walker, who owns a
medical imaging business, originally bought the houseboat to
entertain clients. ``I found out it was so much fun that I just
decided to live out here,'' said Walker. ``And I have a much bigger
swimming pool now.'' With the robust economy, houseboat sales are
soaring _ from $25,000 entry-level used boats to high-end models in
the mid-six figures. ``The economy has a direct impact on the
houseboat industry,'' said Steve Smede, editor of Houseboat
Magazine, who has seen subscriptions to his publications double
during the past five years. ``People have money to spend and
they're buying nicer things.'' Sales at Harborside Boats and
Yachts, one of the largest brokers of houseboats in the Austin
area, have risen 10 percent to 15 percent a year for the past four
years, fueled largely by the high-tech boom. (Breyer, Austin

   LUXURY-BOAT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It cost nothing to think

   If a guy's got 5 million bucks to spend on a boat, where will he
and his Elizabeth Shue-look-alike be doing their nude sunbathing?
``Right this way,'' he said. Don't be fooled. At the high-end of a
mega-boat show, it's all about sex. And the 100-foot Tarrab, a
drop-dead opulent yacht, is sexy. The Tarrab was among 1,000 boats
on display at the 15th annual Palm Beach Boat Show this spring. On
the day before the boat show began, or ``fluff and buff'' day,
Amante took me to the ``sunpads'' atop the on-deck Jacuzzi _ the
perfect spot for a tan. He showed off the handmade walnut cabinets,
the second Jacuzzi in the ``King's Cabin,'' twin Detroit Diesel
engines _ 1,450 horsepower each _ full-marble bath in the No. 2
stateroom, cedar-lined walk-in closet, the eucalyptus wood

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am installing a chair rail molding along the walls in my
dining room and a long adjoining hall.
</P>
<P>
   Since some walls are longer than any single length of available
molding, I will have to join some lengths end-to-end in several
places.
</P>
<P>
   However, this poses a problem for me because in the past, even
if I made a neat looking butt joint that was almost invisible at
first, after a time the molding shrank and a slight gap became
noticeable, even though the gap was filled with a crack filler of
some kind.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a better way to make such joints working with ordinary
hand tools?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simplest way to splice lengths of baseboard or chair rail
molding is to form a scarf joint where the lengths meet, rather
than a simple butt joint.
</P>
<P>
   Scarf joints are much less noticeable than butt joints and even
if the molding does shrink, they show little or no gap.
</P>
<P>
   To make a scarf joint you simply cut off the end of each piece
of molding at a 45-degree angle so that the two ends will overlap
when assembled (as shown in the illustration).
</P>
<P>
   Coat the beveled ends with a little glue before assembling and
secure the joint with one or two small finishing nails or brads.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had a new front door installed and it does not fit into its
frame properly.
</P>
<P>
   The top corner along the hinge edge rubs against the jamb or
frame when the door is opened or closed and the whole door seems
slightly canted, or tilted at a slight angle, when fully closed.
</P>
<P>
   There is a gap of almost a quarter inch at the bottom between
the door and its frame along the hinge edge, and another gap at the
top along the opposite edge of the door.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be corrected without removing the door?
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds as though the door really needs to be taken off and
then re-hung properly.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the hinge edge where the door tends to stick or
rub, it is probably because the hinge leaf is set too deeply into
the edge of the door, or into the door jamb.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes simply shimming the hinge leaf out from the frame (or
the edge of the door) by inserting a piece of cardboard behind the
hinge leaf will do the trick, but there is also the possibility
that the hinge leaf at the bottom of the door was not set deep
enough into the wood.
</P>
<P>
   A carpenter should be able to straighten this out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The walls in our bedroom and hall were recently painted after
we had quite a bit of peeling.
</P>
<P>
   The peeling areas were scraped and sanded, then primed before
repainting, but now after only a year and a half the paint is
peeling again.
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell us what may be the likely cause of this peeling?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are so many different reasons why paint peels that it
would be impossible to list them all here _ and unfortunately there
is no answer that will hold true in every case.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that in your case there was something on the walls
that caused the paint to peel in the first place and apparently it
is still there _ causing the new paint to peel.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that you bring some large samples of the peeling paint
to a local paint store that sells the brand you have been using and
ask them to send these in to the paint manufacturer for analyzing.
</P>
<P>
   If this is not possible your best bet would be to scrape all the
peeling paint off again, then prime with a stain-killing sealer
before applying a new coat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In one of your books you wrote about a method for preventing
the growth of moss on roof shingles by installing a series of heavy
copper wires horizontally across the roof, spacing them from the
ridge down to the eaves.
</P>
<P>
   If I do this, will this make the house more susceptible to
lightning strikes?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. It is only a high vertical structure that will tend to
``attract'' lightning _ such as a tall tree, mast, chimney, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The wires are placed on the roof simply for their copper content
_ as they oxidize, the run-off discourages the growth of moss.
</P>
<P>
   You could also use strips of copper, or even copper tubing; it's
just that wires would be less noticeable.
</P>
<P>

 By MATTHEW ESTEVEZ, with PETER HUDSON and HEATHER BRILEY in Buenos
Aires, Argentina and ANDREW DOWNIE in Sao Paulo, Brazil 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ After receiving an engineering degree from Buenos Aires
University, Leonardo Gannio found his first job fixing heavy
machinery for local companies. ``My hands were always greasy and I
wasn't making much money,'' says the young Argentine who ditched
his industrial career and claimed a sales cubicle at the local
offices of a multinational.
 &HT;    There he would remain today, if Silicon Valley software-maker
Informix had not decided to expand into Latin America. It tapped
him about three years ago to run its Southern Cone operations at
the tender age of 32, largely due to his knowledge of new
technology.
 &HT;    For decades in Latin America, being young and being in charge
has been a rare combination. Not any more.
 &HT;    The all-powerful Internet, computers and communications are
lifting mere students and lowly young managers into the top spots
at start-ups and subsidiaries of important international companies.
Less than 40 years old and fired up, these mighty young chief
executive officers, or CEOs, are bent on changing the region's
business landscape.
 &HT;    ``We have the souls of pioneers,'' says CEO Gannio. ``The older
generation (of executives) is scared of us.''
 &HT;    Not without reason. From Venezuelan Ric Fulop, 24, at technology
start-up Into Networks in Boston, to Brent Willis, Coca-Cola's
youngest subsidiary president ever at 39 in Caracas, these young
turks are cosmopolitan, techno savvy graduates of the finest
universities in the world. What is more, the best and brightest are
immensely impatient.
 &HT;    Emilio Romano, 34, ditched his big executive job at Mexico's
Televisa to found sports website SportsYA.com. He says that working
for the world's largest Spanish-language media company meant he
couldn't be his own boss and often he couldn't simply do what he
wanted because of corporate politics. ``Many times, the soccer
teams and the television stations are owned by the same people,''
he says.
 &HT;    With about US$15 million from investors led by Chase Capital,
his Miami Beach-based SportsYA! covers everything from Spanish
bullfighting to U.S. football, and best of all, Romano doesn't have
to get permission from anybody.
 &HT;    Business is quickly going digital across the region, opening a
hole for vibrant risk-takers like Romano. There are no rules on how
to run a business online and young people often have the least to
lose by taking the plunge. The combination of youthful naivete and
the ability to get others to pay for those dreams seems to be the
key to getting ahead.
 &HT;    Just ask 33-year-old Antonio Bonchristiano of e-commerce
start-up Submarino.com in Sao Paulo. He embodies the perfect
combination of visionary and fund-raiser. The Oxford-educated
banker spotted an opportunity to turn around a failing supermarket
chain in northeastern Brazil. Within two years he made the company
profitable and sold it. He went back to work at local investment
bank GP Investimentos, but Bonchristiano kept seeing start-ups roll
through the office and finally decided to jump in.
 &HT;    Ultimately, it was the clean slate of the Internet that proved
irresistible. He and some colleagues launched Submarino.com, which
sells books, CDs and toys online. He has since raised almost $90
million in less than a year.
 &HT;    While the Internet itself is new, the opportunities that these
young CEOs are exploiting often are not. Instead, they are
transforming existing businesses.
 &HT;    When 30-year-old Gloria Constantini, for example, decided to
form a web start-up company in Argentina, she sought a niche market
that would ``allow me to compete with other domestic companies and
not internationally well-established firms.''
 &HT;    An economist from a wealthy family of bankers, she had
previously worked for her family's Banco Quilmes and at an
international financial institution where she had heard tales of
lucrative web ventures and opportunities to be had in Argentina's
nascent e-commerce industry.
 &HT;    When she read a market research study that showed Argentines
searching to buy a home worth between $150,000-$200,000 typically
looked at 30 properties, she knew that she had found her niche --
online real estate.
 &HT;    ``Property has been bought and sold or rented in the same
traditional way since my grandparents and great-grandparents
days,'' she says. But by taking the business online, she could
catapult to the forefront of the industry.
 &HT;    In late 1999, she launched hogardigital.com with just a few
property listings in the Greater Buenos Aires area.
 &HT;    Today, hogardigital.com has 400 real estate listings, which are
provided for a flat fee. She also plans to add information on home
loans, plumbing, painting, furniture and even suggestions on how to
put up wallpaper.
 &HT;    Constantini, who says she will eventually invest $4 million in
her web venture, plans to take her idea to other Latin American
nations, beginning with neighboring Uruguay.
 &HT;    In this way she is like many of her contemporaries: the new
breed of young CEOs is much more inclined to launch into
international operations than their older predecessors. That has a
lot to do with the Internet but it also reflects the fact that many
of these executives already run in international circles.
 &HT;    Last summer in New York City, for example, Brazilian Stelleo
Tolda bumped into Marcos Galperin and Hernan Kazah, two Argentine
college buddies from Stanford University business school who had
come to Lehman Brothers' New York office in search of venture
capital.
 &HT;    As the brokerage house's new mergers and acquisitions executive,
Tolda was asked to sit in on a meeting with his former classmates
to discuss the creation of an online auction site in Latin America.
 &HT;    ``It (the meeting) sparked something inside me,'' recalls the
32-year old Tolda. Two weeks later, he dumped his job security and
comfortable salary to accept his ex-classmates' offer to return to
Brazil to become the nationwide manager of mercadolivre.com.
 &HT;    ``The decision was partially a function of what we in the MBA
program called the Internet bug,'' explains the Sao Paulo-based
executive. Since August, the Stanford grads have set up websites in
Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.
 &HT;    Most of the young CEOs are U.S.-trained and well versed in the
economic theories of free markets and competition. Those not from
Harvard and Stanford and other top institutions in the North come
from Latin American business schools heavily saturated with a U.S.
curriculum.
 &HT;    One of the region's top business schools, Instituto de Estudios
Superiores de Administracion (IESA), in Caracas, has joint programs
with U.S. schools and prides itself as being of the U.S. strain.
``Our competition is with the U.S. institutions, but not everyone
here can go to Harvard,'' says Paul Esqueda, the Venezuelan
university's dean. ``We use the American model while preparing our
students to be the country's business leaders of tomorrow.''
 &HT;    One of Esqueda's former students and toy maker Mattel's man in
Venezuela, Gabriel Zalzman, says that the key to being a good CEO
has little to do with what school you go to but rather what kind of
attitude you bring to the table. ``The aim (for young CEOs) is to
learn from the older ones,'' says Zalzman.
 &HT;    But relations between the older generation of executives and the
mighty, young CEOs are not always so congenial. According to
recruiting agencies, the young executives are taking charge not
only because they are so spectacularly qualified, but also because
they are cheaper. ``The push for youth by multinational firms has
an economic motivation,'' says Thomas Casey, head of Grupo Catho, a
Brazilian executive search firm. ``As executives get older, they
make much more.''
 &HT;    Many multinationals companies are banking on the productivity of
younger CEOs to save their companies a bundle of cash as well as
adapt their strategies to the new business environment. The
shifting requirements seem particularly acute in consumer-product
companies where new technology is producing great changes in
marketing and advertising. Nestle gave Eugenio Minvielle, 35, the
top spot at its Venezuelan subsidiary and Revlon put Francisco
Camacho, 35, in charge of its operations in Brazil and Chile.
 &HT;    ``I am an advertising executive at heart,'' says Juan Carlos
Ortiz, the 32-year-old head of the Colombian division of
advertising firm Leo Burnett. But he recognizes the growing
importance of the Internet on his work. ``The Internet is just one
more outlet for advertising.''
 &HT;    In many cases, the mighty, young CEOs are taking charge of small
ventures and less important offices of the multinational companies
than their older colleagues. However, the enterprises' size often
belies the fact that the young executives increasingly wield power
in the fastest growing business segments. Nowhere is this quite so
quantifiably clear as the Internet start-ups with stratospheric
market valuations that seem to reflect the takeover of a new
generation. In 1996, Fernando Espuelas was chief executive officer
of a lowly start-up called StarMedia. Today, the Internet company
is worth more $3.7 billion.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly then, the offices at DeRemate.com, an online
auction house, are nearly standing room only these days. Visitors
huddle inside the main door ducking the steady stream of employees.
CEO Alec Oxenford is talking about moving to bigger quarters for
the second time in four months.
 &HT;    The bustle at DeRemate.com is testimony to the pace of the
start-up's sizzling growth since its web debut in August 1999.
Since then, the company has launched sites in Brazil, Mexico,
Venezuela, Colombia, Chile and Uruguay.
 &HT;    Much of the web company's initial success is due to the
leadership of Oxenford. The 30-year-old Argentine of Scottish
ancestry certainly believes in moving fast. Before making his last
presentation for the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), he launched
DeRemate.com earlier that morning. ``They (his former BCG
employees) understood that in the Internet each week is like a
year. I told them the opportunity was now,'' he says.
 &HT;    In any case, BCG managers shouldn't have been surprised. In the
past year, the U.S. consulting firm had seen scores of its
employees join Argentine Internet start-ups.
 &HT;    The concept of a Latin American online auction originated at a
1997 meeting in a 24-hour hamburger joint in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Oxenford and four Latin classmates at Harvard
Business School decided they wanted to go into business together.
``It wasn't difficult to decide on the Internet,'' he explains.
``We knew it was possible to enter without much capital.''
 &HT;    Two years later, the partners secured $12 million from a group
of investors led by Merrill Lynch and Citigroup.
 &HT;    None too soon because, as Oxenford says, speed is everything.
``In auctions, two or three months is the difference between
existing and not existing,'' he says.
 &HT;    Currently, DeRemate.com has some 16 competitors, including
www.mercadolibre.com and subasta.com. But for now, it remains the
market leader, with some 80,000 customers registered throughout
Latin America. ``The market has room for only one or two of us,''
Oxenford predicts.
 &HT;    In the meantime, the Harvard grad is seeking more venture
capital this year to expand operations to three more Latin American
nations, which he won't identify for fear of tipping off the
competition.
 &HT;    ``This company could soon be worth several billion dollars,'' he
says.

 &HT;    SCHOOLS ADOPTED LOW-KEY RESPONSE TO LITTLETON
 &HT;    1050&AMP;add. For release Sunday, April 16.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six years ago, a trench-coated classmate with a
deer rifle and two handguns opened fire in Natalie Hintz's
middle-school math class in Moses Lake, Wash. Hintz was wounded,
and two other students and the teacher were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's similar shootings in Littleton, Colo., that left
15 people dead led to few improvements in security at her high
school, according to Hintz, now an 18-year-old senior.
</P>
<P>
   Her school system's low-key response to the shootings at
Littleton's Columbine High School on April 20 reflects a national
pattern, according to students, school officials, researchers and
safety advocates interviewed in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think new policies were made, but they're not being
vigorously enforced,'' Hintz said.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer is stationed in her school and most entrances
are locked during the school day, so that outsiders would have to
use the main doors. ``But when kids bang on the door, anyone walks
over to let them in, or like prop the door open,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, we also have a really strict policy that you're not
supposed to walk down a hallway without a pass,'' Hintz said.
``That's not enforced at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sign that a new emphasis on reporting suspicious activity
can pay off, a girl at her school notified the principal in January
that a boy told her he had a hit list. The boy was expelled, but
Hintz and other survivors of the 1994 shootings didn't learn about
that until a story appeared in the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   While school systems located close to Littleton reacted
strongly, most of those who experienced the event only through TV
retreated from a sharp first reaction, gradually returning to
previous practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had effects, but they dwindled down among those who weren't
directly concerned,'' said Sgt. James Stewart of the Atlanta police
department, who supervises officers assigned to the city's schools.
``We were far more concerned a few years ago when we had to arrange
to assess and get some psychological attention for some kids from
the Atlanta schools who were in a local mall when some guy came
through and shot it up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the week right after Columbine, the call volume to us
increased tremendously,'' said Jim Jones, vice president of
Security Voice, Inc. His firm in Columbus, Ohio, accepts anonymous
tips on a toll-free ``Safe School Helpline'' it operates for 4,000
of the nation's 15,000 school districts. But he said the tips this
year have been back at their usual level, as low as one per
district per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see evidence that much has changed,'' said Lawrence
Sherman, director of the Fels(cq) Center of Government at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``This is a country in which most gun
violence is concentrated in the inner cities, where it isn't
newsworthy, and it looks like the window of opportunity (that news
coverage of Littleton provided) for improving national gun control
policy may have closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, after a flurry of meetings at which experts and
victims offered suggestions, President Clinton and the bipartisan
House leadership separately appointed working groups on school
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups issued long lists of virtually identical suggestions
for new ways _ other than gun control _ that students, parents,
schools and communities can work together to detect, prevent or
cope with school violence.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the suggestions that require new federal laws have
been adopted, because each side believes that this might weaken its
leverage in the election-year negotiations over controversial new
regulations for guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next year, we'll have more luck,'' said Rep. Martin
Frost of Texas, Democratic co-chair of the House task force. ``Or
some people may try to add one or two of our recommendations as
amendments to appropriations bills moving through Congress this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican co-chair, Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, said,
``I suspect we might be able to get some put into the Juvenile
Justice bill. After that, maybe there could be a second phase for
the task force, where we would make specific recommendations to
appropriations committees and then follow through on that over the
next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Education and Justice departments have given away more than
500,000 copies of ``Early Warning, Timely Response,'' a guide
prepared by experts in 1998. Most copies have been distributed
since the Littleton shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The guide tells school officials, parents and citizens how to
prepare an action plan for detecting, preventing and responding to
threats and crises in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are looking at it,'' said Kevin Dwyer,
president of the National Association of School Psychologists, a
co-author of the guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there is no record-keeping of the effect, so we
have no idea how many schools and communities sat down, put some
plans together and implemented them,'' Dwyer said. He also helped
prepare ``Action Guide for Safe Schools,'' a follow-up booklet that
Education Secretary Richard Riley and Attorney General Janet Reno
are issuing this month.
</P>
<P>
   Solid information on how schools reacted to Littleton should
emerge from a school survey on crime and safety that was mailed to
a sample of 3,000 school principals last month, said the survey's
director, Kathryn Chandler of the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the results are released in December, Ken Trump, a
Cleveland-based school security consultant, will view them
skeptically. ``Based on my 15 years of working with school
officials on school safety, I know for a fact that crimes are
grossly underreported by school officials,'' Trump told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even without hard data, some school security experts and
students said that since the Littleton shootings, they have
observed several useful trends on the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have phased in innovations that range from more visible
security procedures and creation of more local chapters of SAVE
(Students Against Violence Everywhere) to a more efficient use of
school psychologists and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   The beefed-up security procedures include surveillance cameras,
metal detectors, see-through bookbags, id cards for all students
and teachers, and crisis-reaction drills.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional adds follow)
</P>
<P>
   ``A drill for a bomb threat is just like a fire drill, only it
takes longer,'' said Kelly Boyd, a high school junior in Montgomery
County, Md. ``But if someone fires a gun in school, I don't think
most people are going to remember which exit they are supposed to
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher federal subsidies have increased the number of police
working for or assigned to schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we've got the resources made available to us that
let us do the positive, proactive programs. That includes providing
kids with more positive inter-action with adults through
after-school programs that are a combination of tutorial and
recreational programs,'' said Jim Kelly, police chief of the school
district of Palm Beach County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern as crime statistics go down is that, as more
people realize that school are the safest place for your child to
be, the government powers that be might decide they've solved that
problem and turn to another one,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of school psychologists and counselors may have
increased slightly, according to their national associations.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Gallagher of San Antonio, president of the American School
Counselors Association, said, ``More importantly, I have counselors
telling me they are getting to do more of the mental health work
that they are trained to do, rather than to be used primarily as
test administrators and clerical workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I don't hear that at all,'' said Scott Poland
of Cypress, Texas, author of ``Coping with Crisis'' and a school
psychologist who has been part of teams dealing with multiple
shootings in several states. ``There are still too many cases where
kids know there is a gun on campus, or that a student shows signs
of being homicidal or suicidal, but the kids won't come forward and
tell an adult.''

BRILEY en Buenos Aires, Argentina y ANDREW DOWNIE en Sao Paulo,

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ Despues de graduarse de ingenieria en la Universidad de
Buenos Aires, Leonardo Gannio comenzo a reparar maquinaria pesada.
``Siempre tenia las manos sucias y no ganaba mucho,'' recuerda el
joven argentino, que despues se dedico a las ventas en una
multinacional.
 &HT;    Todavia estaria alli de no ser porque Informix, fabricante de
software de Silicon Valley, decidio extenderse a Latinoamerica.
Hace unos anos, la empresa informatica lo contrato para hacerse
cargo de las operaciones en el Cono Sur aunque solo tenia 32 anos,
debido sobre todo a sus conocimientos de la nueva tecnologia.
 &HT;    En America Latina, durante muchas decadas ser joven y ser jefe
casi eran antonimos. Ya no es asi.
 &HT;    La todopoderosa Internet, las computadoras y las comunicaciones
elevan a estudiantes y gerentes jovenes de bajo nivel a los puestos
mas altos de las empresas. Con menos de 40 anos y mucho impulso,
estos jovenes presidentes se han lanzado a cambiar el panorama
comercial de la region.
 &HT;    ``Tenemos alma de pioneros,'' dice el presidente ejecutivo
Gannio. ``La vieja generacion (de ejecutivos) nos teme.''
 &HT;    Y con razon. Estos rebeldes, como el venezolano Ric Fulop, de 24
anos, de la firma tecnologica Into Networks en Boston, y Brent
Willis, de 39 anos y el presidente mas joven que ha tenido la
filial de Coca-Cola en Caracas, son cosmopolitas, expertos en
tecnologia y graduados de las mejores universidades del mundo. Lo
que es mas, los mejores y mas brillantes son muy impacientes.
 &HT;    Emilio Romano, de 34 anos, dejo su puesto de alto ejecutivo en
la mexicana Televisa para fundar el website de deportes
SportsYA.com. Dice que trabajar para la mayor compania de medios en
espanol del mundo implicaba que siempre tendria un jefe y que
muchas veces no podia hacer lo que queria. ``Muchas veces los
equipos de futbol y las estaciones de television pertenecen a la
misma persona,'' apunta.
 &HT;    Con unos US$15 millones de inversionistas encabezados por Chase
Capital, su website SportsYA!, radicado en Miami Beach, abarca un
sinfin de deportes y, lo mejor de todo, Romano no tiene que pedirle
permiso a nadie.
 &HT;    En toda la region crece el comercio electronico, lo que abre
puertas a gente arriesgada como Romano. Los jovenes muchas veces
son los que menos tienen que perder al saltar al mundo digital. La
combinacion de ingenuidad juvenil y la habilidad para lograr que
otros costeen esos suenos parece ser la clave para salir adelante.
 &HT;    Antonio Bonchristiano, de 33 anos y presidente de la empresa de
comercio electronico Submarino.com en Sao Paulo, es el
visionario/recaudador de fondos ejemplar. Graduado de Oxford y
especialista en banca, vio la oportunidad de salvar de la ruina a
una cadena brasilena de supermercados. A los dos anos la cadena
comenzo a ganar dinero y la vendio. Volvio al banco de inversion GP
Investimentos, pero decidio dar el salto a la Internet.
 &HT;    Bonchristiano y otros colegas crearon Submarino.com, que vende
libros, discos compactos y juguetes. Ha recaudado casi US$90
millones en inversion en menos de un ano. Aunque la Internet es muy
nueva, las oportunidades que estos jovenes presidentes explotan
muchas veces no lo son. A menudo lo que hacen es transformar
negocios inventados hace tiempo.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo, cuando Gloria Constantini, de 30 anos, decidio
formar una compania de Internet en Argentina, busco un mercado
especifico que le permitiera ``competir con otras firmas nacionales
y no internacionalmente con empresas establecidas.''
 &HT;    Constantini trabajo para Banco Quilmes, propiedad de su familia,
y en una institucion financiera internacional donde escucho relatos
de lucrativas empresas en la Web y de las oportunidades en el
incipiente sector del comercio electronico de Argentina.
 &HT;    Cuando la economista conocio un informe segun el cual los
argentinos que quieren comprar una casa de entre US$150.000 y
US$200.000 suelen visitar 30 propiedades, supo que su futuro eran
los bienes raices en linea.
 &HT;    ``Las propiedades se compran, se venden o se alquilan igual que
cuando mis abuelos y bisabuelos,'' dice. Pero sacar el negocio en
linea significar estar a la vanguardia.
 &HT;    A fines de 1999, Constantini establecio hogardigital.com con una
lista de pocas propiedades en el Gran Buenos Aires.
 &HT;    Hoy, hogardigital.com tiene una lista de 400 propiedades, cuya
informacion se vende a los agentes inmobiliarios. Constantini
planea anadir informacion sobre prestamos hipotecarios, plomeria,
pintura, mobiliario y hasta sugerencias para empapelar paredes.
 &HT;    La empresaria dice que llegara a invertir US$4 millones en su
empresa y planea llevar su concepto a otros paises
latinoamericanos, comenzando por el vecino Uruguay.
 &HT;    En este sentido es muy parecida a muchos de sus colegas. Esta
nueva generacion de directivos es mas propensa que sus antecesores
a iniciar operaciones internacionales. Eso se debe en gran medida a
la Internet pero tambien refleja el que muchos ya funcionan en
circulos internacionales.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo, el brasileno Stelleo Tolda se tropezo el ano pasado
en Nueva York con Marcos Galperin y Hernan Kazah, dos amigos
argentinos graduados de la Universidad de Stanford que habian ido a
la oficina neoyorquina de Lehman Brothers en busca de capital de
riesgo.
 &HT;    A Tolda, como nuevo ejecutivo de fusiones y adquisiciones de la
casa de corretaje, le pidieron que se reuniera con sus viejos
companeros para discutir la creacion de un website de subastas en
America Latina.
 &HT;    ``(La reunion) desperto algo en mi interior,'' recuerda el
ejecutivo de 32 anos. Dos semanas mas tarde, dejo la seguridad de
su puesto y su comodo salario para aceptar la oferta de sus
companeros de regresar a Brasil en calidad de gerente nacional de
mercadolivre.com.
 &HT;    ``La decision se debio en parte a lo que en el programa de
Maestria en Administracion de Empresas llamabamos el bicho de la
Internet,'' explica Tolda, que esta radicado en Sao Paulo. Desde
agosto, los graduados de Stanford han creado websites en Argentina,
Brasil y Mexico.
 &HT;    La mayor parte de los jovenes presidentes ejecutivos han
estudiado en Estados Unidos y tienen un conocimiento solido de las
teorias economicas del libre mercado y la competencia. Los que no
provienen de Harvard y Stanford y de otras prestigiosas
instituciones de Norteamerica son graduados de escuelas de comercio
latinoamericanas con un fuerte curriculo norteamericano.
 &HT;    Una de las principales escuelas de negocios de la region, el
Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administracion (IESA) de
Caracas, tiene programas conjuntos con escuelas norteamericanas y
se enorgullece de pertenecer a la corriente estadounidense.
``Competimos con instituciones norteamericanas, pero no todos los
de aqui pueden ir a Harvard,'' dice Paul Esqueda, decano venezolano
de la universidad. ``Usamos el modelo norteamericano al preparar a
nuestros estudiantes para que sean los lideres comerciales del
futuro.''
 &HT;    Uno de los ex alumnos de Esqueda, Gabriel Zalzman, es el hombre
del fabricante de juguetes Mattel en Venezuela. Zalzman dice que la
clave para ser un buen presidente ejecutivo tiene poco que ver con
la escuela a la que uno haya ido sino mas bien con la clase de
actitud que uno adopta. ``El objetivo (de los jovenes presidentes)
es aprender de los mayores,'' senala.
 &HT;    Pero las relaciones entre ambas generaciones de ejecutivos no
siempre son agradables. Segun agencias de captacion de talentos, a
los ejecutivos jovenes los ponen al timon no solo por su alto nivel
de estudios, sino tambien porque salen mas baratos. ``La busqueda
de ejecutivos jovenes por parte de las multinacionales tiene una
motivacion economica,'' afirma Thomas Casey, presidente del Grupo
Catho, una firma brasilena de busqueda de ejecutivos. ``Los
ejecutivos, mientras mas edad tienen, ganan mas.''
 &HT;    Muchas multinacionales aprovechan la productividad de
presidentes ejecutivos mas jovenes para ahorrar una gran suma y
tambien para adaptar sus estrategias al nuevo entorno comercial.
Los cambios en los requerimientos parecen mas radicales en las
companias de productos del consumidor, donde la nueva tecnologia
causa grandes cambios en mercadeo y publicidad. Nestle le dio a
Eugenio Minvielle, de 35 anos, el puesto mas alto en su filial
venezolana y Revlon coloco a Francisco Camacho, de 35, al frente de
las operaciones en Brasil y Chile.
 &HT;    ``Soy un ejecutivo de publicidad de corazon,'' dice Juan Carlos
Ortiz, a los 32 anos presidente de la division colombiana de la
firma publicitaria Leo Burnett. Pero reconoce la gran importancia
de la Internet en su trabajo. ``La Internet es otro canal para la
publicidad.''
 &HT;    En muchos casos, los jovenes presidentes se ponen al frente de
empresas menores y de oficinas menos importantes de multinacionales
que en el caso de sus colegas de mas edad. Sin embargo, el tamano
de las empresas muchas veces oculta el hecho de que los jovenes
ejecutivos ganan cada vez mas poder en los segmentos comerciales de
crecimiento rapido. En ningun lugar este hecho se puede medir con
tanta claridad como en las nuevas empresas de Internet cuyo
astronomico valor en el mercado parece reflejar la llegada al poder
de una nueva generacion. En 1996, Fernando Espuelas era presidente
ejecutivo de una humilde empresa de Internet llamada StarMedia.
Hoy, esa compania vale mas de US$3.700 millones.
 &HT;    Por eso no es extrano que las oficinas de DeRemate.com, una casa
de subastas en linea, esten congestionadas. Los visitantes tienen
que abrirse paso en la puerta principal entre el constante trasiego
de empleados. El presidente ejecutivo Alec Oxenford ya esta
considerando mudarse a una oficina mas grande por segunda vez en
cuatro meses.
 &HT;    El ajetreo en DeRemate.com testimonia el dinamico crecimiento de
la empresa desde su estreno en la Web en agosto de 1999. Desde
entonces, la compania ha lanzado websites en Brasil, Mexico,
Venezuela, Colombia, Chile y Uruguay.
 &HT;    Gran parte del exito inicial de la compania se debe al liderazgo
de Oxenford. Este argentino de 30 anos, descendiente de escoceses,
es un aficionado a la rapidez. El mismo dia de su ultima
presentacion para Boston Consulting Group (BCG), lanzo
DeRemate.com. ``(Sus ex empleados de BCG) entendieron que en la
Internet cada semana es como un ano. Les dije que la oportunidad
era ahora,'' relata.
 &HT;    En cualquier caso, los gerentes de BCG no debieron sorprenderse.
En 1999 muchos empleados de BCG se pasaron a companias argentinas
de Internet.
 &HT;    El concepto de un centro latinoamericano de subastas en linea
surgio en 1997, durante una reunion en una cafeteria en Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Oxenford y cuatro latinoamericanos de la Facultad de
Negocios de Harvard decidieron establecer un negocio. ``No fue
dificil decidirnos por la Internet,'' explica. ``Sabiamos que era
posible poner negocio sin mucho capital.''
 &HT;    Dos anos despues, los socios consiguieron US$12 millones de un
grupo de inversionistas encabezados por Merrill Lynch y Citigroup,
justo cuatro meses despues de lanzar el website.
 &HT;    Nunca es demasiado pronto porque, como dice Oxenford, la
velocidad es fundamental. ``En las subastas, dos o tres meses puede
ser la diferencia entre existir y no existir,'' afirma.
 &HT;    DeRemate.com tiene 16 competidores, entre ellos
www.mercadolibre.com y subasta.com, pero marcha de lider con unos
80.000 clientes en toda Latinoamerica. ``El mercado solo tiene
cabida para uno o dos de nosotros,'' pronostica Oxenford.
 &HT;    Entretanto, Oxenford busca mas capital para ampliar las
operaciones a tres paises latinoamericanos mas. ``Muy pronto esta
compania quiza valga varios miles de millones de dolares,'' dice.

casi eran antonimos. Ya no es asi.
 &HT;    La todopoderosa Internet, las computadoras y las comunicaciones
elevan a estudiantes y gerentes jovenes de bajo nivel a los puestos
mas altos de las empresas. Con menos de 40 anos y mucho impulso,
estos jovenes presidentes se han lanzado a cambiar el panorama
comercial de la region.
 &HT;    ``Tenemos alma de pioneros,'' dice el presidente ejecutivo
Gannio. ``La vieja generacion (de ejecutivos) nos teme.''
 &HT;    Y con razon. Estos rebeldes, como el venezolano Ric Fulop, de 24
anos, de la firma tecnologica Into Networks en Boston, y Brent
Willis, de 39 anos y el presidente mas joven que ha tenido la
filial de Coca-Cola en Caracas, son cosmopolitas, expertos en
tecnologia y graduados de las mejores universidades del mundo. Lo
que es mas, los mejores y mas brillantes son muy impacientes.
 &HT;    Emilio Romano, de 34 anos, dejo su puesto de alto ejecutivo en
la mexicana Televisa para fundar el website de deportes
SportsYA.com. Dice que trabajar para la mayor compania de medios en
espanol del mundo implicaba que siempre tendria un jefe y que
muchas veces no podia hacer lo que queria. ``Muchas veces los
equipos de futbol y las estaciones de television pertenecen a la
misma persona,'' apunta.
 &HT;    Con unos US$15 millones de inversionistas encabezados por Chase
Capital, su website SportsYA!, radicado en Miami Beach, abarca un
sinfin de deportes y, lo mejor de todo, Romano no tiene que pedirle
permiso a nadie.
 &HT;    En toda la region crece el comercio electronico, lo que abre
puertas a gente arriesgada como Romano. Los jovenes muchas veces
son los que menos tienen que perder al saltar al mundo digital. La
combinacion de ingenuidad juvenil y la habilidad para lograr que
otros costeen esos suenos parece ser la clave para salir adelante.
 &HT;    Antonio Bonchristiano, de 33 anos y presidente de la empresa de
comercio electronico Submarino.com en Sao Paulo, es el
visionario/recaudador de fondos ejemplar. Graduado de Oxford y
especialista en banca, vio la oportunidad de salvar de la ruina a
una cadena brasilena de supermercados. A los dos anos la cadena
comenzo a ganar dinero y la vendio. Volvio al banco de inversion GP
Investimentos, pero decidio dar el salto a la Internet.
 &HT;    Bonchristiano y otros colegas crearon Submarino.com, que vende
libros, discos compactos y juguetes. Ha recaudado casi US$90
millones en inversion en menos de un ano. Aunque la Internet es muy
nueva, las oportunidades que estos jovenes presidentes explotan
muchas veces no lo son. A menudo lo que hacen es transformar
negocios inventados hace tiempo.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo, cuando Gloria Constantini, de 30 anos, decidio
formar una compania de Internet en Argentina, busco un mercado
especifico que le permitiera ``competir con otras firmas nacionales
y no internacionalmente con empresas establecidas.''
 &HT;    Constantini trabajo para Banco Quilmes, propiedad de su familia,
y en una institucion financiera internacional donde escucho relatos
de lucrativas empresas en la Web y de las oportunidades en el
incipiente sector del comercio electronico de Argentina.
 &HT;    Cuando la economista conocio un informe segun el cual los
argentinos que quieren comprar una casa de entre US$150.000 y
US$200.000 suelen visitar 30 propiedades, supo que su futuro eran
los bienes raices en linea.
 &HT;    ``Las propiedades se compran, se venden o se alquilan igual que
cuando mis abuelos y bisabuelos,'' dice. Pero sacar el negocio en
linea significar estar a la vanguardia.
 &HT;    A fines de 1999, Constantini establecio hogardigital.com con una
lista de pocas propiedades en el Gran Buenos Aires.
 &HT;    Hoy, hogardigital.com tiene una lista de 400 propiedades, cuya
informacion se vende a los agentes inmobiliarios. Constantini
planea anadir informacion sobre prestamos hipotecarios, plomeria,
pintura, mobiliario y hasta sugerencias para empapelar paredes.
 &HT;    La empresaria dice que llegara a invertir US$4 millones en su
empresa y planea llevar su concepto a otros paises
latinoamericanos, comenzando por el vecino Uruguay.
 &HT;    En este sentido es muy parecida a muchos de sus colegas. Esta
nueva generacion de directivos es mas propensa que sus antecesores
a iniciar operaciones internacionales. Eso se debe en gran medida a
la Internet pero tambien refleja el que muchos ya funcionan en
circulos internacionales.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo, el brasileno Stelleo Tolda se tropezo el ano pasado
en Nueva York con Marcos Galperin y Hernan Kazah, dos amigos
argentinos graduados de la Universidad de Stanford que habian ido a
la oficina neoyorquina de Lehman Brothers en busca de capital de
riesgo.
 &HT;    A Tolda, como nuevo ejecutivo de fusiones y adquisiciones de la
casa de corretaje, le pidieron que se reuniera con sus viejos
companeros para discutir la creacion de un website de subastas en
America Latina.
 &HT;    ``(La reunion) desperto algo en mi interior,'' recuerda el
ejecutivo de 32 anos. Dos semanas mas tarde, dejo la seguridad de
su puesto y su comodo salario para aceptar la oferta de sus
companeros de regresar a Brasil en calidad de gerente nacional de
mercadolivre.com.
 &HT;    ``La decision se debio en parte a lo que en el programa de
Maestria en Administracion de Empresas llamabamos el bicho de la
Internet,'' explica Tolda, que esta radicado en Sao Paulo. Desde
agosto, los graduados de Stanford han creado websites en Argentina,
Brasil y Mexico.
 &HT;    La mayor parte de los jovenes presidentes ejecutivos han
estudiado en Estados Unidos y tienen un conocimiento solido de las
teorias economicas del libre mercado y la competencia. Los que no
provienen de Harvard y Stanford y de otras prestigiosas
instituciones de Norteamerica son graduados de escuelas de comercio
latinoamericanas con un fuerte curriculo norteamericano.
 &HT;    Una de las principales escuelas de negocios de la region, el
Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administracion (IESA) de
Caracas, tiene programas conjuntos con escuelas norteamericanas y
se enorgullece de pertenecer a la corriente estadounidense.
``Competimos con instituciones norteamericanas, pero no todos los
de aqui pueden ir a Harvard,'' dice Paul Esqueda, decano venezolano
de la universidad. ``Usamos el modelo norteamericano al preparar a
nuestros estudiantes para que sean los lideres comerciales del
futuro.''
 &HT;    Uno de los ex alumnos de Esqueda, Gabriel Zalzman, es el hombre
del fabricante de juguetes Mattel en Venezuela. Zalzman dice que la
clave para ser un buen presidente ejecutivo tiene poco que ver con
la escuela a la que uno haya ido sino mas bien con la clase de
actitud que uno adopta. ``El objetivo (de los jovenes presidentes)
es aprender de los mayores,'' senala.
 &HT;    Pero las relaciones entre ambas generaciones de ejecutivos no
siempre son agradables. Segun agencias de captacion de talentos, a
los ejecutivos jovenes los ponen al timon no solo por su alto nivel
de estudios, sino tambien porque salen mas baratos. ``La busqueda
de ejecutivos jovenes por parte de las multinacionales tiene una
motivacion economica,'' afirma Thomas Casey, presidente del Grupo
Catho, una firma brasilena de busqueda de ejecutivos. ``Los
ejecutivos, mientras mas edad tienen, ganan mas.''
 &HT;    Muchas multinacionales aprovechan la productividad de
presidentes ejecutivos mas jovenes para ahorrar una gran suma y
tambien para adaptar sus estrategias al nuevo entorno comercial.
Los cambios en los requerimientos parecen mas radicales en las
companias de productos del consumidor, donde la nueva tecnologia
causa grandes cambios en mercadeo y publicidad. Nestle le dio a
Eugenio Minvielle, de 35 anos, el puesto mas alto en su filial
venezolana y Revlon coloco a Francisco Camacho, de 35, al frente de
las operaciones en Brasil y Chile.
 &HT;    ``Soy un ejecutivo de publicidad de corazon,'' dice Juan Carlos
Ortiz, a los 32 anos presidente de la division colombiana de la
firma publicitaria Leo Burnett. Pero reconoce la gran importancia
de la Internet en su trabajo. ``La Internet es otro canal para la
publicidad.''
 &HT;    En muchos casos, los jovenes presidentes se ponen al frente de
empresas menores y de oficinas menos importantes de multinacionales
que en el caso de sus colegas de mas edad. Sin embargo, el tamano
de las empresas muchas veces oculta el hecho de que los jovenes
ejecutivos ganan cada vez mas poder en los segmentos comerciales de
crecimiento rapido. En ningun lugar este hecho se puede medir con
tanta claridad como en las nuevas empresas de Internet cuyo
astronomico valor en el mercado parece reflejar la llegada al poder
de una nueva generacion. En 1996, Fernando Espuelas era presidente
ejecutivo de una humilde empresa de Internet llamada StarMedia.
Hoy, esa compania vale mas de US$3.700 millones.
 &HT;    Por eso no es extrano que las oficinas de DeRemate.com, una casa
de subastas en linea, esten congestionadas. Los visitantes tienen
que abrirse paso en la puerta principal entre el constante trasiego
de empleados. El presidente ejecutivo Alec Oxenford ya esta
considerando mudarse a una oficina mas grande por segunda vez en
cuatro meses.
 &HT;    El ajetreo en DeRemate.com testimonia el dinamico crecimiento de
la empresa desde su estreno en la Web en agosto de 1999. Desde
entonces, la compania ha lanzado websites en Brasil, Mexico,
Venezuela, Colombia, Chile y Uruguay.
 &HT;    Gran parte del exito inicial de la compania se debe al liderazgo
de Oxenford. Este argentino de 30 anos, descendiente de escoceses,
es un aficionado a la rapidez. El mismo dia de su ultima
presentacion para Boston Consulting Group (BCG), lanzo
DeRemate.com. ``(Sus ex empleados de BCG) entendieron que en la
Internet cada semana es como un ano. Les dije que la oportunidad
era ahora,'' relata.
 &HT;    En cualquier caso, los gerentes de BCG no debieron sorprenderse.
En 1999 muchos empleados de BCG se pasaron a companias argentinas
de Internet.
 &HT;    El concepto de un centro latinoamericano de subastas en linea
surgio en 1997, durante una reunion en una cafeteria en Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Oxenford y cuatro latinoamericanos de la Facultad de
Negocios de Harvard decidieron establecer un negocio. ``No fue
dificil decidirnos por la Internet,'' explica. ``Sabiamos que era
posible poner negocio sin mucho capital.''
 &HT;    Dos anos despues, los socios consiguieron US$12 millones de un
grupo de inversionistas encabezados por Merrill Lynch y Citigroup,
justo cuatro meses despues de lanzar el website.
 &HT;    Nunca es demasiado pronto porque, como dice Oxenford, la
velocidad es fundamental. ``En las subastas, dos o tres meses puede
ser la diferencia entre existir y no existir,'' afirma.
 &HT;    DeRemate.com tiene 16 competidores, entre ellos
www.mercadolibre.com y subasta.com, pero marcha de lider con unos
80.000 clientes en toda Latinoamerica. ``El mercado solo tiene
cabida para uno o dos de nosotros,'' pronostica Oxenford.
 &HT;    Entretanto, Oxenford busca mas capital para ampliar las
operaciones a tres paises latinoamericanos mas. ``Muy pronto esta
compania quiza valga varios miles de millones de dolares,'' dice.

FROM CLINTON TO CUBA TO RENO TO RAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CLINTON: Recent polls show the president's wife pulling
ahead of Rudy Giuliani in New York's U.S. Senate race; the
pro-Clinton forces in the media are already tossing dirt onto
Rudy's political grave. As a friend of mine in Illinois used to
say: Wait once!
</P>
<P>
   Because Giuliani is mayor of New York City, he is constantly
being critiqued by voters, pundits and political activists of every
persuasion. It stands to reason that his popularity will rise and
fall in reaction to the city's good days and bad days.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, New Yorkers will surely decide that they'd
rather be represented in Washington by a controversial mayor with a
brilliant record of accomplishment than by a controversial first
lady whose major claim to fame is her association with one of the
least trusted presidents in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   RUDY GIULIANI: On the other hand, Giuliani desperately needs to
re-evaluate his penchant for saying exactly what's on his mind.
Hasn't this guy ever heard of the phrase ``No comment''?
</P>
<P>
   JANET RENO: The U.S. attorney general seems to be gearing up for
a resolution of the Elian Gonzalez mess. It's about time. Reno
should have demanded that the 6-year-old Cuban boy's Miami
relatives send him back to his father months ago.
</P>
<P>
   All this malarkey about little Elian bonding with these people
who arbitrarily took possession of him after his mother drowned and
he was fished out of the Atlantic Ocean in November could have been
avoided if Reno hadn't let the turmoil drag on and on. The kid
should have been sent back to Cuba before politicians and activists
in Cuba and the United States turned his plight into one of the
most breathtaking examples of child exploitation the world has ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE: It was bad enough that the vice president changed his
position on the Elian controversy in a transparent attempt to
appease Cuban-American voters in Florida. But even worse than his
flip-flop _ from supporting Elian's return to Cuba to backing the
Elian-must-stay-in-America crowd _ was Gore's mind-boggling
insistence that he had not switched sides.
</P>
<P>
   Can there be any doubt that Gore studied the art of
prevarication at the right hand of the master? It must have made
Bill Clinton burst with pride to see his protege unleash such a
blatant falsehood without so much as a hint of embarrassment. Only
the great ones can lie with such aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN MCCAIN: Would somebody please inform the senator from
Arizona that he ``lost'' the Republican presidential race? McCain
doesn't seem to understand that the losers in such a contest are
supposed to offer the winner their unqualified and enthusiastic
support _ or, at the very least, ride off into the sunset and keep
their mouths shut until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's flash-in-the-pan success in GOP primaries was hailed by
an adoring media as the second coming of Ronald Reagan, but it was
nothing of the sort. The worshipful news coverage and McCain's
knack for passing himself off as more than he is combined to create
the illusion that his campaign was a big deal _ and McCain is doing
his best to perpetuate the scam.
</P>
<P>
   You can't help but feel sorry for him, though. Limelight
withdrawal can be an extremely painful ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT RAY: Robert who?
</P>
<P>
   You know _ Robert Ray, the guy who replaced Ken Starr as the
independent counsel responsible for investigating Clinton's sex
life, among other things. Even though Starr threw in the towel _
and even though the federal law providing for the appointment of
independent counsels has expired and is in no danger of being
revived _ Ray says he's thinking about indicting Clinton after the
president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Will this never end? Can't we just let this crumb Clinton
slither back to Arkansas or New York or wherever he plans to go
when his seemingly interminable second term finally ends?
</P>
<P>
   Starr left because he grudgingly accepted reality: Clinton beat
the rap.
</P>
<P>
   Ray should let it go at that.

<P>
   It's been a quiet morning at Aggieland Supertravel in College
Station, Texas. The phones aren't ringing, and there has been only
the slightest smattering of foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   To keep busy, the five travel agents on duty have been printing
backlogged airline tickets and making small talk.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Claudia Walker, 28, is with a customer, a middle-aged,
mustached man who has come to Aggieland Supertravel with hopes of
sending his son to New York City cheaply ... and the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see what I can do,'' the travel agent says doubtfully.
But when she finishes checking everything available in Worldspan,
the agency's computerized reservation system, her expression has
not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Walker says. ``The best I can do is nearly
$2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Her customer is shocked. ``Can't you go on Priceline and try to
get a better price?'' he demands.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause as Walker considers his question. He's
suggesting that she log on to the Internet and bid for a ticket,
bypassing the agency entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do that,'' Walker finally answers. ``If you'd like to
go home and try out Priceline, you certainly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later he's gone. The agents roll their eyes and laugh. A
cheap ticket to New York, the day before the flight? Who's be
kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Yet their laughter masks a very real concern. For, however naive
that customer may have been, there's a good chance they just lost
his fare to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet Age unfolds, few of us can rest easy, knowing
that our professions will be secure throughout the millennium _ or
even throughout our own lifetime. Like the Industrial Revolution
before it, the Information Revolution promises drastic and dramatic
change.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, it is still too early to say for sure how our
own businesses will be affected and how we will react. But that's
not so for travel agents: Theirs is among the first businesses to
face the threat of obsolescence head-on.
</P>
<P>
   With airline tickets, hotel reservations and travel information
readily available over the Internet, it's getting harder and harder
for travel agents to justify their existence.
</P>
<P>
   Online travel sales reached $4.2 billion in 1999, a number
that's expected to quadruple in the next three years, according to
Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm. (How does that
compare with travel agencies? Smaller firms like Aggieland
Supertravel _ agencies that take in less than $1 million in revenue
a year _ collectively had $4.3 billion in revenue in '97, the last
year for which Calmers Travel Group has data.)
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with the reduced commissions agents now get from
airlines and it's no wonder many agencies are simply going out of
business. In 1995, there were 33,000 independent agencies in the
United States. Now there are 13 percent fewer, according to the
American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for travelers _ or at least for those who prefer
the personal touch of a real, live human. A great agent can be a
true lifesaver for the harried traveler, offering not only
expertise but advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   The news is much worse for agencies and their owners. Running a
travel agency was once a nice way to make a decent, if modest,
living. Plus there were great travel benefits. But that's all
changed _ and it's reflected in the value of travel agencies
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the selling price of the average
small agency has dropped by 60 percent, to around $96,000, says Bob
Sweeney, president of Innovative Travel Acquisitions, a firm that
specializes in the sale of travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be fun,'' Sweeney says of the travel-agency
business. ``Now it's a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggieland Supertravel, a typical small-town agency, shows just
how mismatched the battle is. Operating from a storefront office in
a strip mall just a few yards up Texas Avenue from Texas A&AMP;M
University, the privately owned firm is going head-to-head with
some of the world's deepest pockets _ from American Express (whose
American Express Corporate Services is the dominant corporate
travel firm) to Microsoft (whose Expedia is one of the most popular
travel Web sites).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got over 500 customer-service agents, and we're open 24
hours a day every day of the year,'' boasts Terrell Jones,
president and CEO of the Web site Travelocity. ``Most of our
competitors in the physical world can't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   Agent Heather Blakey joined Aggieland Super travel three years
ago. Then a fresh-faced 21-year-old, she came straight from the
Southland Institute, a Houston-based travel school, and was looking
forward to the free travel, to the familiarization (or ``fam'')
trips, to the great discounts and to the steady income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was glamorous,'' she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Today the best Blakey can do is stare wistfully at the
Continental Vacations brochures on the agency's walls. The reduced
and free fares have stopped coming from most of the airlines and,
while Hayes will encourage the agents to go on the occasional fam
trip (Blakey once took Princess cruise), she remains deskbound.
</P>
<P>
   During slow hours, she checks her stock online or flips idly
through Travel &AMP; Leisure.
</P>
<P>
   As for that stable income? Well, she worries about it. Blakey
keeps a manila folder in her desk, where she scrawls down every
commission that she earns each week. Only a small portion of those
commissions will go to Blakey; the bulk goes to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But she breathes a little easier when she finds that she has
earned that week's salary, that Aggieland Supertravel is not losing
money by continuing to employ her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten really depressing, '' she says. ``It is just so
slow. We just don't have the business that we used to.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than depressing for 57-year-old Linda Fisher, whose
salary is her only source of income. (The agents earn an average of
$18,000 to $20,000 annually, according to Hayes.) Her precarious
future in the travel-agency business is downright scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really try not to think about it,'' she says. ``Especially
at my age, I don't know who would hire me if I didn't work for the
travel agency anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to keep their clients out of the Internet's clutches, all
the Aggieland Supertravel agents are pushing themselves harder and
harder to ``go the extra mile'' for their customers. It's gotten to
the point that they'll do just about anything for them.
</P>
<P>
   Glenna Laffey recently heard from a favorite client who'd moved
to Nebraska but still calls Aggieland Supertravel to plan his
trips. This time he was coming to town for a business meeting and
then planned to meet up with a friend afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As he made his reservations, Laffey, 56, could hear the customer
talking to himself _ he'd have to hire a cab to get to the meeting,
and then again to get to his friend's house. That would be costly
and inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pick you up!'' Laffey offered. She did more than that.
Laffey met her client at the airport, drove him downtown for his
meeting, waited in her Honda Accord for 20 minutes while he made
his presentation, then drove him to a department store where he
needed to pick up some supplies. Finally, she drove him to his
friend's house. It was, she insists, ``no biggie.'' Her colleagues
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a client, you have to treat them with kid
gloves,'' Connie Lara says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet travel agents' advantages are being constantly chipped away
by the airlines and online companies, which lately have begun to
offer special Internet fares, cheaper even than those a travel
agent gets.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Lara estimates that she receives 10 to 15 calls a week
from potential customers who have found a fare on the Internet and
wonder if the agents can beat the price. Lara says she can beat or
match the fare 70 or 80 percent of the time, but she finds it
frustrating to always be playing catch-up to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that the Internet is out to get us, and the airlines
are out to get us,'' Lara says. ``We're going to be without jobs.
That's what's going to happen, unless something miraculous happens.

<P>
   It's been a quiet morning at Aggieland Supertravel in College
Station, Texas. The phones aren't ringing, and there has been only
the slightest smattering of foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   To keep busy, the five travel agents on duty have been printing
backlogged airline tickets and making small talk.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Claudia Walker, 28, is with a customer, a middle-aged,
mustached man who has come to Aggieland Supertravel with hopes of
sending his son to New York City cheaply ... and the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see what I can do,'' the travel agent says doubtfully.
But when she finishes checking everything available in Worldspan,
the agency's computerized reservation system, her expression has
not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Walker says. ``The best I can do is nearly
$2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Her customer is shocked. ``Can't you go on Priceline and try to
get a better price?'' he demands.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause as Walker considers his question. He's
suggesting that she log on to the Internet and bid for a ticket,
bypassing the agency entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do that,'' Walker finally answers. ``If you'd like to
go home and try out Priceline, you certainly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later he's gone. The agents roll their eyes and laugh. A
cheap ticket to New York, the day before the flight? Who's be
kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Yet their laughter masks a very real concern. For, however naive
that customer may have been, there's a good chance they just lost
his fare to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet Age unfolds, few of us can rest easy, knowing
that our professions will be secure throughout the millennium _ or
even throughout our own lifetime. Like the Industrial Revolution
before it, the Information Revolution promises drastic and dramatic
change.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, it is still too early to say for sure how our
own businesses will be affected and how we will react. But that's
not so for travel agents: Theirs is among the first businesses to
face the threat of obsolescence head-on.
</P>
<P>
   With airline tickets, hotel reservations and travel information
readily available over the Internet, it's getting harder and harder
for travel agents to justify their existence.
</P>
<P>
   Online travel sales reached $4.2 billion in 1999, a number
that's expected to quadruple in the next three years, according to
Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm. (How does that
compare with travel agencies? Smaller firms like Aggieland
Supertravel _ agencies that take in less than $1 million in revenue
a year _ collectively had $4.3 billion in revenue in '97, the last
year for which Calmers Travel Group has data.)
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with the reduced commissions agents now get from
airlines and it's no wonder many agencies are simply going out of
business. In 1995, there were 33,000 independent agencies in the
United States. Now there are 13 percent fewer, according to the
American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for travelers _ or at least for those who prefer
the personal touch of a real, live human. A great agent can be a
true lifesaver for the harried traveler, offering not only
expertise but advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   The news is much worse for agencies and their owners. Running a
travel agency was once a nice way to make a decent, if modest,
living. Plus there were great travel benefits. But that's all
changed _ and it's reflected in the value of travel agencies
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the selling price of the average
small agency has dropped by 60 percent, to around $96,000, says Bob
Sweeney, president of Innovative Travel Acquisitions, a firm that
specializes in the sale of travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be fun,'' Sweeney says of the travel-agency
business. ``Now it's a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggieland Supertravel, a typical small-town agency, shows just
how mismatched the battle is. Operating from a storefront office in
a strip mall just a few yards up Texas Avenue from Texas A&AMP;M
University, the privately owned firm is going head-to-head with
some of the world's deepest pockets _ from American Express (whose
American Express Corporate Services is the dominant corporate
travel firm) to Microsoft (whose Expedia is one of the most popular
travel Web sites).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got over 500 customer-service agents, and we're open 24
hours a day every day of the year,'' boasts Terrell Jones,
president and CEO of the Web site Travelocity. ``Most of our
competitors in the physical world can't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   Agent Heather Blakey joined Aggieland Super travel three years
ago. Then a fresh-faced 21-year-old, she came straight from the
Southland Institute, a Houston-based travel school, and was looking
forward to the free travel, to the familiarization (or ``fam'')
trips, to the great discounts and to the steady income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was glamorous,'' she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Today the best Blakey can do is stare wistfully at the
Continental Vacations brochures on the agency's walls. The reduced
and free fares have stopped coming from most of the airlines and,
while Hayes will encourage the agents to go on the occasional fam
trip (Blakey once took Princess cruise), she remains deskbound.
</P>
<P>
   During slow hours, she checks her stock online or flips idly
through Travel &AMP; Leisure.
</P>
<P>
   As for that stable income? Well, she worries about it. Blakey
keeps a manila folder in her desk, where she scrawls down every
commission that she earns each week. Only a small portion of those
commissions will go to Blakey; the bulk goes to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But she breathes a little easier when she finds that she has
earned that week's salary, that Aggieland Supertravel is not losing
money by continuing to employ her.

mustached man who has come to Aggieland Supertravel with hopes of
sending his son to New York City cheaply ... and the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see what I can do,'' the travel agent says doubtfully.
But when she finishes checking everything available in Worldspan,
the agency's computerized reservation system, her expression has
not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Walker says. ``The best I can do is nearly
$2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Her customer is shocked. ``Can't you go on Priceline and try to
get a better price?'' he demands.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause as Walker considers his question. He's
suggesting that she log on to the Internet and bid for a ticket,
bypassing the agency entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do that,'' Walker finally answers. ``If you'd like to
go home and try out Priceline, you certainly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later he's gone. The agents roll their eyes and laugh. A
cheap ticket to New York, the day before the flight? Who's be
kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Yet their laughter masks a very real concern. For, however naive
that customer may have been, there's a good chance they just lost
his fare to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet Age unfolds, few of us can rest easy, knowing
that our professions will be secure throughout the millennium _ or
even throughout our own lifetime. Like the Industrial Revolution
before it, the Information Revolution promises drastic and dramatic
change.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, it is still too early to say for sure how our
own businesses will be affected and how we will react. But that's
not so for travel agents: Theirs is among the first businesses to
face the threat of obsolescence head-on.
</P>
<P>
   With airline tickets, hotel reservations and travel information
readily available over the Internet, it's getting harder and harder
for travel agents to justify their existence.
</P>
<P>
   Online travel sales reached $4.2 billion in 1999, a number
that's expected to quadruple in the next three years, according to
Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm. (How does that
compare with travel agencies? Smaller firms like Aggieland
Supertravel _ agencies that take in less than $1 million in revenue
a year _ collectively had $4.3 billion in revenue in '97, the last
year for which Calmers Travel Group has data.)
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with the reduced commissions agents now get from
airlines and it's no wonder many agencies are simply going out of
business. In 1995, there were 33,000 independent agencies in the
United States. Now there are 13 percent fewer, according to the
American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for travelers _ or at least for those who prefer
the personal touch of a real, live human. A great agent can be a
true lifesaver for the harried traveler, offering not only
expertise but advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   The news is much worse for agencies and their owners. Running a
travel agency was once a nice way to make a decent, if modest,
living. Plus there were great travel benefits. But that's all
changed _ and it's reflected in the value of travel agencies
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the selling price of the average
small agency has dropped by 60 percent, to around $96,000, says Bob
Sweeney, president of Innovative Travel Acquisitions, a firm that
specializes in the sale of travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be fun,'' Sweeney says of the travel-agency
business. ``Now it's a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggieland Supertravel, a typical small-town agency, shows just
how mismatched the battle is. Operating from a storefront office in
a strip mall just a few yards up Texas Avenue from Texas A&AMP;M
University, the privately owned firm is going head-to-head with
some of the world's deepest pockets _ from American Express (whose
American Express Corporate Services is the dominant corporate
travel firm) to Microsoft (whose Expedia is one of the most popular
travel Web sites).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got over 500 customer-service agents, and we're open 24
hours a day every day of the year,'' boasts Terrell Jones,
president and CEO of the Web site Travelocity. ``Most of our
competitors in the physical world can't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   Agent Heather Blakey joined Aggieland Super travel three years
ago. Then a fresh-faced 21-year-old, she came straight from the
Southland Institute, a Houston-based travel school, and was looking
forward to the free travel, to the familiarization (or ``fam'')
trips, to the great discounts and to the steady income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was glamorous,'' she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Today the best Blakey can do is stare wistfully at the
Continental Vacations brochures on the agency's walls. The reduced
and free fares have stopped coming from most of the airlines and,
while Hayes will encourage the agents to go on the occasional fam
trip (Blakey once took Princess cruise), she remains deskbound.
</P>
<P>
   During slow hours, she checks her stock online or flips idly
through Travel &AMP; Leisure.
</P>
<P>
   As for that stable income? Well, she worries about it. Blakey
keeps a manila folder in her desk, where she scrawls down every
commission that she earns each week. Only a small portion of those
commissions will go to Blakey; the bulk goes to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But she breathes a little easier when she finds that she has
earned that week's salary, that Aggieland Supertravel is not losing
money by continuing to employ her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten really depressing, '' she says. ``It is just so
slow. We just don't have the business that we used to.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than depressing for 57-year-old Linda Fisher, whose
salary is her only source of income. (The agents earn an average of
$18,000 to $20,000 annually, according to Hayes.) Her precarious
future in the travel-agency business is downright scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really try not to think about it,'' she says. ``Especially
at my age, I don't know who would hire me if I didn't work for the
travel agency anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to keep their clients out of the Internet's clutches, all
the Aggieland Supertravel agents are pushing themselves harder and
harder to ``go the extra mile'' for their customers. It's gotten to
the point that they'll do just about anything for them.
</P>
<P>
   Glenna Laffey recently heard from a favorite client who'd moved
to Nebraska but still calls Aggieland Supertravel to plan his
trips. This time he was coming to town for a business meeting and
then planned to meet up with a friend afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As he made his reservations, Laffey, 56, could hear the customer
talking to himself _ he'd have to hire a cab to get to the meeting,
and then again to get to his friend's house. That would be costly
and inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pick you up!'' Laffey offered. She did more than that.
Laffey met her client at the airport, drove him downtown for his
meeting, waited in her Honda Accord for 20 minutes while he made
his presentation, then drove him to a department store where he
needed to pick up some supplies. Finally, she drove him to his
friend's house. It was, she insists, ``no biggie.'' Her colleagues
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a client, you have to treat them with kid
gloves,'' Connie Lara says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet travel agents' advantages are being constantly chipped away
by the airlines and online companies, which lately have begun to
offer special Internet fares, cheaper even than those a travel
agent gets.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Lara estimates that she receives 10 to 15 calls a week
from potential customers who have found a fare on the Internet and
wonder if the agents can beat the price. Lara says she can beat or
match the fare 70 or 80 percent of the time, but she finds it
frustrating to always be playing catch-up to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that the Internet is out to get us, and the airlines
are out to get us,'' Lara says. ``We're going to be without jobs.
That's what's going to happen, unless something miraculous happens.
It's scary.'' &QL;

secrets for making it a success. Tips and recipe follow in optional

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Tapas-Style Dishes Are Tops at Zibibbo   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Few preparations of asparagus are as delicious as
this recipe from Zibibbo.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spears are sauteed with leeks and seasoned with thyme,
garlic and chiles. Then the vegetables are doused in dry sherry and
red wine vinegar, and the liquid is quickly reduced to form a
glaze.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Jody Denton, who also is the mastermind behind LuLu and
Azie in San Francisco, suggests serving this dish with slices of
crusty bread.
</P>
<P>
   This is only one of the many tapas-style dishes that has become
the hallmark of this Mediterranean restaurant in Palo Alto. The
menu includes some excellent rotisserie specialties and some great
dishes, including whole fish and pizza out of the wood-burning
oven.
</P>
<P>
   The tapas offer the greatest variety with creations from
Morocco, Italy, Spain and other Mediterranean destinations.
</P>
<P>
   From the exterior, Zibibbo looks like a quaint Victorian, but
the interior, designed by Cass Calder Smith, has the open look of
an urban loft. In addition, there's an impressive patio that takes
advantage of the pleasant Peninsula weather.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Zibibbo, 430 Kipling St. (between University Avenue and Lytton &LR; 
 &LR; Street), Palo Alto; (650) 328-6722. Lunch and dinner daily. &LR; 
 &LR; Brunch Saturday and Sunday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Adding the sherry and vinegar. &LR;  These elements not only add
flavor, but they ``pickle'' the asparagus, keeping the spears
slightly crisp.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Cooking the asparagus and oil together. &LR;  Letting the two
ingredients heat up together makes for an evenly tender spear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ASPARAGUS &AMP; LEEK ESCABECHE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches medium-size asparagus spears, trimmed to about 4
inches in length
</P>
<P>
   1 small leek (white part only), well washed and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons thinly sliced garlic (preferably spring garlic, if
available)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   8 whole small dried red chiles
</P>
<P>
   Leaves from 4 fresh thyme sprigs, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil and asparagus in a large saute pan over low
heat, rolling the asparagus around as the pan heats up. Once the
asparagus begin to sizzle slightly, add the leek and garlic. Season
with salt and pepper. Continue to gently stir until the leek begins
to soften, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chiles and thyme and
increase the heat to high.
</P>
<P>
   When the pan is sizzling, add the sherry and vinegar and boil
until only a few tablespoons of liquid remain, about 5 to 7
minutes. Stir in the parsley and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6.

 Cooks Have a New Source for Chefs' Secrets  &HT;       
 By Miriam Morgan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; For several months, The Chronicle's weekly Secrets
of Success column has told Food section readers how to replicate
some of Bay Area's best restaurant dishes. Now, the recipes _ and
the secrets behind them _ are all in one place: ``The Secrets of
Success Cookbook,'' by Chronicle food editor and restaurant critic
Michael Bauer.
<P>
   The book includes more than 200 recipes, each accompanied by the
chef's tricks or tips. Those little hints _ ranging from how to
choose, salt and prepare the meat for Zuni Cafe's hamburger, rated
the best in town, to how to brown the sugar for the Grand Cafe's
signature Banana Cream Tart _ not only distinguish the recipe but
let the home cook in on how some of the country's best food is
created.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes, which go from breakfast to cocktails, desserts and
everything in between, have been thoroughly tested for home use _ a
huge plus since chef's recipes can sometimes be minefields for all
but the most experienced professional.
</P>
<P>
   Like the columns, each recipe also comes with descriptions of
the restaurant and chef _ sort of abbreviated restaurant reviews.
And the index includes basic information about each restaurant for
those who want to dine at the source.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers Weekly calls the book ``the ultimate tour of the Bay
Area restaurant scene,'' with ``clearly written'' recipes perfect
for ``those who enjoy cooking and want to better understand the
process _ without investing a lifetime in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't put away your clipping scissors just yet. Although
several of the recipes in the book have already appeared in The
Chronicle, the weekly Food section column features restaurants that
weren't open when the recipes were compiled, as well as new dishes
created by up-and-coming and well-established chefs.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Kosher Catches Up to Premium Brands 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Gerald D. Boyd &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Leo Rosten, in his humorous and informative book
about language, ``The Joys of Yiddish,'' provides this definition
for kosher: ``As a Hebrew-Yiddish word, kosher generally means only
one thing: fit to eat, ritually clean according to the dietary
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosten goes on to explain that ``rabbis said that eating and
drinking are religious acts, for during them man partakes of God's
bounty.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the ``fit to eat'' requirement is as often applied to
drink, especially wine, as it is to food. And for many Jews and
others familiar with kosher wine, that means sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Many older observant Jews remember the days of sweet kosher
wines that tasted like Concord grape juice with alcohol. With the
'90s, the character and style of kosher wine began to change, as
Passover meals and celebrations of other Jewish holidays, called
for dry varietal wines with all the class and character of
nonkosher wines.
</P>
<P>
   The misconception is that kosher means inferior. Today's kosher
winemakers want you to know that is not true. So, what is a kosher
wine?
</P>
<P>
   Modern rules for making kosher wine include setting aside
equipment exclusively for the making of those wines. Further, only
certified kosher products, like yeasts and fining agents used in
winemaking, can be used in the production of kosher wines.
</P>
<P>
   An extra step used today with many popular kosher wines is
making the wine  &LR; yayin mevushal &LR; , or universally kosher. A mevushal
wine is where the grapes must be handled only by observant Jews.
The mevushal process is a flash pasteurization before fermentation,
which allows the wine to be handled by the general public and still
remain kosher. Kosher wine labels will carry the letter ``U''
circled to signify the wine was approved by the Union of Orthodox
Jewish Congregations and certified kosher for Passover with the
letter ``p'' on the label.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest suppliers of upscale kosher wines is the
Royal Wine Company, whose main brand is Baron Herzog, a line of
California varietal wines, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay,
Zinfandel and Sauvignon Blanc, in the $6 to $12 range. Herzog also
produces a super-premium line of three select varietal wines,
priced from $22 to $42.
</P>
<P>
   The other major California producer of kosher wines is Hagafen
of Napa Valley. Until 1996, Napa Valley's St. Supery made kosher
wines under the Mt. Maroma label, some of which might still be
available in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Wine Company also has a growing portfolio of imported
kosher wines, including Teal Lake, Australia; Alfasi, Chile;
Chateau Yon Figeac, Cotes du Rhone, France; Bartenura, Italy; and
the Gamla and Yarden wines of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Fortant de France, the popularly priced varietal wines from the
south of France, has three kosher varietal wines, priced at $10,
including Chardonnay, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular producer of wines from the south of France is
Reserve St. Martin, produced by Les Vignerons du Val d'Orbieu. For
Passover, Reserve St. Martin has released 1999 kosher varietals
including Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Chardonnay, priced under
$10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; European Wine Treasures &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Christie's Los Angeles will be auctioning 1,400 lots of
Bordeaux, Burgundy, California and Italian wines from the private
collection of Henry E. Singleton, the founder and former CEO of
Teledyne, Inc. The two-day sale, April 14 and 15, will be held at
Christie's in Beverly Hills. A special presale wine tasting,
featuring 70 of the wines from the Singleton collection, will be
held on April 13, from 7-8 p.m. with a cost of $80 per person. For
more information, call Christie's Wine Department, at (310)
385-2603. To request a $30 catalog, call (800) 395-6300.

<P>
   _ Ricardo Sander of Los Angeles was disappointed that Truchard
Vineyards was not mentioned in a recent Potpourri article on
Carneros Pinot Noir.
</P>
<P>
   The omission of Truchard certainly was not intentional... their
wines, especially Pinot Noir, Merlot and Syrah, are among my
favorites. But then, it's not possible to list or mention all of
the wineries that make good wine from Carneros grapes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gretchen Edgren, contributing editor, Playboy Magazine, is
interested in the piece that appeared on this page about Jim
Fetzer's biodynamic vineyard in Mendocino and was wondering how to
contact Fetzer.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fetzer, of the noted winemaking Fetzer family of Mendocino,
operates Ceago Vinegarden, on McNab Ranch Road in Ukiah. You can
contact Ceago at (707) 468-0377 or e-mail at  &LR; www.ceago.com &LR; .

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute Main
Dish takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast &AMP; Fresh
gives you dinner in about 20 minutes. 
 
 THE WORKING COOK: Far-Away Places Call the Adventurous Cook  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Depending on their ripeness, plantains can be as
filling and starchy as potatoes or as tender and sweet as bananas.
<P>
   I like them when they're somewhere in between green and
completely black. At this stage, they're tender enough to saute
quickly but not too sweet for dinner. Just be careful when sauteing
the plantain slices in this recipe, as the starchy fruit can burn
before you know it.
</P>
<P>
   The avocado cream is quite rich, a nice foil for the crisp-fried
plantains and spicy marinated fish. Add as much water as necessary
to get a desired saucy consistency, or replace the creme fraiche
with plain yogurt if you'd like a lighter dish.
</P>
<P>
   A note on swordfish: Although conscientious cooks tend to avoid
it because of dwindling stocks, the endangered fish are Atlantic
swordfish. If you are concerned about overfishing, make sure your
swordfish is from West Coast waters.
</P>
<P>
   For the 30-Minute Main Dish, we turned to Food Section intern
Noel Advincula for his Filipino Chicken Adobo recipe. The
combination of soy sauce and vinegar provides the traditional tangy
edge to the sauce, while coconut milk adds richness and complexity.
It's so good and easy you'll probably turn back to it again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   This week's weekend make-ahead recipe is based on the
meatloaf-and-potatoes of blue plate specials in days gone by. The
difference is that the potatoes go on top of the meat to form a
crust, sort of like a shepherd's pie, and they are spiked with
horseradish for extra flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Use a flat casserole dish instead of the standard loaf pan, or
each serving will get only a disappointingly dinky ration of
mashers.

   ROAST SWORDFISH WITH PLANTAINS &AMP; AVOCADO CREAM
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon pepper + pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons lime juice
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   11/2 to 2 pounds swordfish steaks
</P>
<P>
   3 ripe plantains
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons honey
</P>
<P>
   2 ripe avocados
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon creme fraiche or sour cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   Lime wedges
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together the salt, pepper, cayenne, 1 tablespoon lime
juice and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Brush this mixture on both
sides of the fish. Place fish on a baking sheet lined with aluminum
foil.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the plantains and remove all tough fibers, using a paring
knife to make long slits through the skin if necessary. Cut
diagonally into 1/4-inch slices.
</P>
<P>
   Place the fish in the oven and roast until cooked through, about
10 to 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and the butter in a large
skillet over medium heat. (You may have to do this in batches.)
When the mixture foams, add the plantains and sprinkle with
cinnamon and a little salt. Saute until golden-brown on one side,
about 5 minutes, watching carefully so they don't burn. Flip the
slices, season with salt, drizzle with the honey and brown another
5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pit and peel the avocados, then mash to a pulp. Add 2
tablespoons lime juice, the creme fraiche and water to thin to a
smooth and saucelike consistency. Season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the plantains alongside the fish and spoon the sauce on
top. Garnish with lime wedges.

   MEAT LOAF WITH HORSERADISH MASHED POTATO CRUST
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups panko breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>

   6 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   Leaves from 3 rosemary sprigs, minced
</P>
<P>
   21/4 pounds ground veal
</P>
<P>
   21/4 pounds ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 cup crushed tomatoes
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   Horseradish Mashed Potato Crust
</P>
<P>
   9 russet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons prepared horseradish
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the wine and
breadcrumbs; set aside to soften.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Add the onions, garlic and
rosemary and saute until the flavors combine, about 4 minutes.
Transfer to a bowl and let cool briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Add the veal, beef, tomatoes, salt, pepper and Worcestershire to
the breadcrumb mixture and mix with your hands to combine. When the
onions are cool, stir them into the mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the meat mixture between two 3-quart baking pans or
casseroles. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the Horseradish Potato Crust:  &LR; Peel and quarter the
potatoes and place in a saucepan. Cover with water and bring to a
boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender
when pierced with a knife, about 12 minutes. Drain and return to
the saucepan.

   After the meat loaf has finished cooking, increase the oven
temperature to broil. Discard some of the fat that has collected on
top of the loaves, and pour off some of the juices so the dish
doesn't overflow. Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the top of
both meat loaves and broil for 5 to 10 minutes, until brown on top.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Taste Panel Unwinds the Best Spiral-Cut Ham for 
 Your Holiday Table   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For some people, it's spring lambs, but for many,
Easter dinner is synonymous with ham.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spiral-sliced ham has become particularly popular at holiday
times because it makes the meal so easy on the cook. The meat not
only is fully-cooked, but presliced. It comes in sizes large enough
to serve family-size groups, usually with leftovers for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   But you pay a premium for some brands _ almost $5 per pound in
some cases. That's as much as $40 for a half-ham, enough to serve
eight to 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted six brands of fully-cooked spiral-sliced
hams. In addition, four of our panelists shared some of their
favorite side dishes to go with ham to round out your Easter meal
(see recipes, this page).
</P>
<P>
   All of the hams were tasted as they are packaged. We did not use
any of the optional glazes that came with some brands. The hams
were tasted at cool-room temperature, not heated.
</P>
<P>
   The panel had two overwhelming favorites. The others came in
dramatically lower. In many cases, panelists felt the hams tasted
more of smoke or were too sweet. They also disliked the texture of
some hams.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors went to  &UR; Ashley &LR;   &UR; Farms &LR;  ($2.98 per pound, at
Safeway). Panelists commented on the good balance of salty and
sweet flavors, though one noted that it was saltier than some of
the other hams. Panelists also liked the texture. All would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cook's &LR;  ($4.99 per pound at Andronico's) came in a close
second. Three panelists detected an artificial smoke flavor, but
two others thought it had the best ham flavor of all the hams.
Three would buy it; two might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Honeybaked &LR;  ($5.09 per pound at Honeybaked stores) came in
third. Panelists found the sweetness to be overwhelming, obscuring
the ham flavor. One panelist liked the smokiness, but another
thought the smoke tasted artificial. None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dietz &AMP; Watson &LR;  ($4.99 per pound at Andronico's) came in
fourth. Panelists thought this ham was dry and bland. One found it
to be too salty. Others detected an artificial flavor. Some also
complained about the dry texture. None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Draeger's and Safeway hams, but they
scored too low to rate.

POTATO, LEEK &AMP; CARROT CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Donna Katzl, chef-owner of Cafe for All Seasons in San
Francisco, serves this savory vegetable pancake to her family with
ham for Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 large leek, cleaned, thinly sliced (white and pale green parts
only)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound white potatoes, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the leek
and saute until soft, about 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a food processor fitted with a large shredding disk, shred
the potatoes and carrot. Roll the potato-carrot mixture in several
layers of paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible.
Transfer to a large bowl. Add the sauteed leek. Season generously
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat,
tilting the pan so the oil covers the bottom evenly. Add the potato
mixture to the pan and pat down firmly and evenly. Cover and cook
until the bottom is golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Uncover
and invert a large plate over the skillet. Carefully flip the
skillet over onto the plate, letting the cake fall onto the plate.
Slide the cake back into the skillet, browned side up. Cover and
cook until golden brown, about 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Slide the cake onto a platter. Cut into wedges. Sprinkle with
chives. Serve hot or warm.

 AT THE SOURCE: Pearls of Wisdom: Rich, pure water key to plump 
 Hog Island oysters   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  As animals go, oysters seem rather placid.
Actually, says Michael Watchorn, they are competitive creatures. If
if you don't separate the fast growers from the slow ones, the
little guys will be starved out by their voracious bigger brethren.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He should know. Watchorn has been growing oysters for nearly 20
years. He hadn't planned on that career, but right out of the
University of California at Berkeley, he found a job at an oyster
company in Monterey, and he got hooked on oysters.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years, he and fellow marine biologist John Finger
purchased a former general store built in the 1860s in West Marin,
obtained leases and set up the Hog Island Oyster Co., named for a
small island in the bay. The company, now co-owned by Terry Sawyer,
who previously worked at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, is the biggest
of five oyster farms on Tomales Bay and specializes in growing
oysters to be sold and consumed fresh. (Marin's biggest oyster
farm, the huge Johnson's Oyster Co., is located on Drakes Estero
and primarily raises oysters to be shucked and put up in jars.)
</P>
<P>
   Hog Island expects to sell about five million oysters this year,
all raised on wooden trestles anchored on 170 acres of the bay,
obtained from the California Department of Fish and Game under a
25-year renewable lease. Most of the acreage is on the north end of
the bay, within a quarter mile of the open sea. The water there is
richer in plankton, the oysters' food source, then it is further
south, and winter temperatures tend to hover around an ideal 40
degrees. Watchorn explains that even a few more degrees of warmth
can make the oysters grow fatter, which is not desirable: Plump is
good, fat is not.
</P>
<P>
   The Hog Island farmers employ the French growing method, first
putting the tiny seed oysters purchased from hatcheries in Maine
and on Puget Sound in nursery cages of extruded plastic mesh
anchored to the trestles. The constant movement of the tidal waters
keeps the small creatures rolling continuously, which produces a
deep cup and a plump oyster. Oysters that are raised in static
condition get long and ``snaky,'' Watchorn explains.
</P>
<P>
   Three times during the eight months the oysters spend in the
nursery, the cages get hoisted onto a barge and the fast growers
get sorted out to go into the second stage of their two-year
journey to the table, the grow-out period, during which they are
also housed in mesh cages, but in far smaller numbers than the
5,000 that go into the nursery cages.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Hog Island shipped the bulk of its production to
distributors. Now, almost half the crop is sold direct from the
farm in the small town of Marshall. There are also direct
deliveries to Buckeye Roadhouse in Mill Valley; Sam's Anchor Cafe
in Tiburon; and in the wine country, John Ash, Bistro Don Giovanni,
the Restaurant at Greystone and Gordon's in Yountville.
</P>
<P>
   Hog Island, rather than cultivating only one variety, gives its
customer four choices: the large, salty and slightly smoky
sweetwater (``which pays the bills,'' Watchorn says); the
button-small (seldom over two inches) sweet-tasting Kumamoto; the
medium-sized Atlantic, which displays assertive saltiness, and the
European flat or belon, which grows to about four inches and has a
slightly metallic, steely taste that ``people either love or
hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvesting at the right age is important. Age, not size,
determines taste and texture, Watchorn says. And, of course, purity
of water is essential. He and his partners have had to become
politically active, persuading responsible agencies to be more
vigilant in monitoring septic tanks on properties along the
shoreline and install more toilet facilities for kayakers and other
recreational users of the area. Being in a national marine
sanctuary helps, he says, but as filter feeders, oysters are so
sensitive to pollution that even one boater dumping sewage near
oyster beds can cause enormous damage.
</P>
<P>
   The oyster farmer puts his mouth where his money is: ``I love
oysters, clams and mussels (which they also grow) and abalone,'' he
declares, admitting that he sometimes forgets his wife, graphic
designer Marina Andriola's request to bring oysters home to
Sebastopol. When he does remember the oysters, they eat them raw on
the half shell, barbecued or fried.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite way of frying them is to coat them lightly in rice
flour seasoned with salt and cayenne, dip them in beaten egg, then
fry them quickly in peanut oil. For barbecuing, he prefers to shuck
the oysters, return them to a half shell, then top each one with a
teaspoon of sauce (garlic sauteed in olive oil, mixed with lemon
juice and a little butter for richness), then pop them on a covered
grill for a few minutes, adding chopped Italian parsley in the last
minute of cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   The Hog Island crew keeps a little sauce handy for eating
oysters at work _ a combination of rice wine vinegar, shallots,
lemon juice, a little pepper and cilantro. ``We call it hogwash,''
Watchorn says.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Hog Island Oyster Co., 20215 Highway 1, Marshall (about 10 &LR; 
 &LR; miles north of Point Reyes Station; (415) 663-9218. Open to the &LR; 
 &LR; public 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Wednesday to Sunday. Picnic area with &LR; 
 &LR; covered grills available; shucking knives, trays and gloves are &LR; 
 &LR; provided, but customers need to bring charcoal, beverages and &LR; 
 &LR; other supplies. Oysters are $7-$9 per dozen, depending on &LR; 
 &LR; variety. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Simple Preparations Let Bivalves Shine &QL;  &LR; 
Oysters are perishable, but they can be safely kept for a few days,
provided they are fresh when you purchase them and they are handled
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The Hog Island Oyster Farm operators in Marshall recommend you
pack oysters cup-side down in a bowl and cover them completely with
a damp cloth or towel, making sure the cloth fits snugly against
the sides of the bowl and that it stays moist at all times.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the oysters you buy in a store haven't been around too
long, you could ask to see the harvest tag, which is attached to
each shipment and lists all the facts _ place of origin, the
harvest date, etc.  &UR; This must be kept on file for 90 days by &LR; 
 &UR; restaurants and stores under state regulations, and while &LR; 
 &UR; retailers are not required to make this document available to &LR; 
 &UR; consumers, many will do so if asked. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A simple way to determine freshness is to check that no oysters
have opened. You also can pick up two oysters and knock them
against each other. They should sound almost like rocks. If the
sound produced is at all hollow, reject the oysters.

HISTORIAN DETAILS UGLY CHAPTER OF RACISM AND INNOCENT YOUNG
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY MOIVING IN THE ``E'' AND ``L'' CATEGORIES.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades before political scandals cast a shadow over Arizona at
the end of the 20th century, a series of events in Clifton-Morenci
wrote an ugly chapter of state's history at the beginning of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chapter full of racism, anti-Catholic bigotry and
orphans dickered over like dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1980s and 1990s saw a governor deposed, a governor
indicted and stat legislators drawing up plans to secede from the
Union, no less shameful was the nasty tug of war that ensued over
40 homeless children sent west from New York in hopes of finding
new families.
</P>
<P>
   To officials of the New York Foundling Hospital, their plan
seemed simple: Place orphans with good Catholic families in the
wide-open spaces of the Arizon territory.
</P>
<P>
   How naive.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice and politics proved insurmountable barriers between
the fair-skinned Irish foundlings and their would-be foster
parents, all of whom happened to be Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the territory's quest for statehood was
driving citizens to prove their American patriotism and resist
efforts to form one large state with the territory of New Mexico,
which had a higher percentage of Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors converged in an episode that still causes
pain in the adjoining mining communities of Clifton and Morenci in
southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   University of Wisconsin historian Linda Gordon has chronicled
these events in a her book, ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction''
(Harvard University Press, 1999), a work rich in detail about the
town and the scandal that pitted Anglo residents against their
Mexican-American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Principal players were two nuns and a placement officer from the
New York orphanage, representatives of the local Catholic diocese,
Mexican families eage to adopt the orphans, White residents of
Clifton and Morenci bent on halting the adoptions and officials of
the Phelps Dodge Corp., whose economic caste system helped to
reinforce the notion that Mexican workers were inferior to Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   The story in ``Orphan Abduction'' is played out against the
backdrop of racial bia often tolerated in turn-of-the-century
America. Race meant not only Black and White, but also Irish,
German, Italian, Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we call such divisions ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon opens her story on a night in October 1904 as a posse
arrives at the home of Margarita Chacon to demand the return of two
fair-haired orphans recently placed with Senora Chacon and her
husband, Cornelio.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, the Chacons would be only one of
many couples forced to surrender children promised to them by the
New York orphanage and their own parish priest, Constant Mandin.
</P>
<P>
   Father Mandin saw his Mexican parishioners as good Catholics
willing to take in foundlings. Anglos saw them as brown-skinned
kidnappers unfit to raise White children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AN EASTERN SOLUTION  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children had come west on one of the celebrated orphan
trains operating in Eastern cities concerned with a growing
population of homeless children and street urchins.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, some children found loving new families. Some
found themselves valued only as unpaid farm labor.
</P>
<P>
   In Clifton-Morenci, a handful found homes, and a few were given
away as ``gifts,'' but the social climate prevented a generally
positive outcome. Most of the New York orphans reboarded their
train and were sent back for re-distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by a strike and a devastating flood in 1905 _ events
coincidenta lly repeated in 1983 _ the residents of Clifton-Morenci
were left with wounds slow to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose academic specialty is women, families and labor
issues, discovered the orphan saga while reading histories of labor
disputes, in which the actions of Phelps Dodge are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there were kids in this piqued my interest,''
Gordon said while vacationing in Portland., Ore., and on leave from
UW to teach at New York University. ``I came to understand the
story more and more as I went along ... I thought it was an amazing
story.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was intrigued by the racial aspect of a story that
involved not Blacks and Whites but ``Anglos,'' as she calls them in
the book, and ``Mexicans,'' as Mexican-Americans were known at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began her research in 1994 and finished the book in 1998.
She made three trips to Clifton-Morenci during that time to
interview elderly residents and glean a sense of what the
communities were like 90 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Not all residents welcomed her inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Festering wounds had reopened during the strike of 1983, when
the communities once again split along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The strike destroyed once-thriving Clifton, Gordon said. Phelps
Dodge fired its protesters and replaced them with strike-breakers.
The town's young people moved away. Senior workers retired. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ANGRY COMMUNITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when Gordon arrived with pen in hand, some
residents refused to be interviewed. Even when she explained that
her interest was the 1905 orphan incident, conversations invariably
returned to the 1983 strike and the pain it had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some people opened up. One of Gordon's best sources was
the venerable Al Fernandez, a former mayor of Clifton and renowned
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to talk and had great stories,'' Gordon said of the
man who died in December at age 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, Catholic Church officials, eager to expose what they
believed had been an episode of anti-Catholic bigotry, made church
archives readily available.
</P>
<P>
   And in Phoenix, Gordon found a historian's pot of gold: complete
transcripts from a state Supreme Court trial whose verdict had
upheld taking the orphans from their Mexican foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, even the attorneys for the Foundling Hospital
had ``concede'' that Mexican homes were inferior to those of Anglos
and probably unsuitable for White children.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexicans had been called as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Gordon pieced together the strange story. When the
train from New York pulled into the Clifton station on the evening
of Oct. 1, 1904, and unloaded its cargo of 40 weary children, Anglo
residents took notice.
</P>
<P>
   Where had these children come from, and where were they going?
</P>
<P>
   To their dismay, they discovered that the youngsters were
heading for their new homes. Mexican homes.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated both by prejudice and a sincere sense of concern for
motherless children, a group of Anglos, mostly women, began to
protest the placeme nt of the orphans. They and their husbands,
many armed with rifles, threatened Father Mandin, the sisters, the
placement officer, the bishop from Tucson and Mexican parents who
had the audacity to take the children into their homes and hearts.
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HUMAN MERCHANDISE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anglos demanded that they be given the ``babies''as they fought
over the human merchandise like bargains at a rummage sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me,'' Gordon said of that chapter in her
research.
</P>
<P>
   With courts as high as the U.S. Supreme Court siding with the
vigilantes, the nuns eventually were forced to back down. One rainy
night, the Mexican families were ordered to turn over the children
to waiting Anglos. Fifteen of the orphans went to Anglo homes in
Clifton and Morenci. One child was sent to a Los Angeles family as
a ``gift'' from one of the law-enforcement officers. The rest were
returned to New York and found homes in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexican family was allowed to keep a child.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said she believes that Phelps Dodge helped foster the
prejudice that divided Mexicans from Anglos. Looking at blueprints
of company housing, she found that ``Americans'' had been assigned
homes with running water and flushing toilets, while the Mexicans'
accommodations were more primitive. The copper company rationalized
the disparity, she said, by asserting that Mexicans were used to
such conditions and aspired to nothing more. In truth, Mexicans
were upwardly mobile and sought parity with their Anglo neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Subjugating the Mexicans became a self-fulfilling prophecy as
poverty equated with inferiority and, in the case of the orphans,
immorality. Anglos hurled slurs at the foster parents, accusing
them of keeping dirty homes (untrue), being prostitutes (untrue)
and being prone to drink (Anglos ran the saloons).
</P>
<P>
   Although bigotry against minority laborers reared its head in
other pa rts of the country - Chinese workers often were vilified
on the West Coast - ``it became more deeply entrenched'' in
Clifton-Morenci, Gordon said.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MISGUIDED INTENTIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is not entirely unsympathetic to the Anglo women who took
back the orphans. Given the tenor of the times, they truly believed
that Anglo children belonged in Anglo homes and needed to be
``rescued '' from the clutches of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't always know their own motives,'' Gordon
speculates.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the officials of the New York Foundling Hospital
might not have fully understood the racial implications of their
proposal or exactly what the term ``Mexican'' meant. They knew the
Southwesterners as ``Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Gordon fault the nuns who buckled at the threat of
a well -aimed Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect them to be heroes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction'' could be used in
high school and university history courses, its target audience is
a broad one, Gordon said. Anyone interested in history or in the
``true crime'' genre will find it absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said her book, already in its second printing, has
received good reviews from critics, and she finds that rewarding,
but she added that her favo rite reviews have come from former
residents of Clifton-Morenci.
</P>
<P>
   In their letters, she said, they tell her, ``You got it just
right.'' &QL;

   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.

   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, governments and busi nesses should pressure the
Taliban the way they pressured South Africa to end racial
apartheid, said Deb Ellis, author of the soon-to-be-pub lished book
``Women of the Afghan War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate, who asks to be identified only as Sajeda, is
angry at the U.S. government for getting involved during the Soviet
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Afghan people fought the British (gaining its independence
in 1919). Afghanistan could have de feated the Russians without the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   She also feels betrayed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N. can send peacekeepers to East Timor to pave the
way for ademocratic election, why can't they do it in Afghanistan?
They say, `We must be invited by the government,' but since there
is no government in Afghanistan, that's just an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hassina Sherjan-Samad, founder of Children's Voice,
traveled to Kabul, where, escorted by the Taliban, she visited
classrooms, filled only with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person with me asked one of the boys if there were any
differences between men and women. This boy, about 12 or 15, said,
`Women have 9 million brain cells, and men have 15 million brain
cells.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked, `How do you know?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Physics proved it.' This is what they teach.'' Reach

</P>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Susan Merrell (HarperCollins, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel is built on a provocative idea but suffers in the
execution. Chris and Deborah Latham and their 3-year-old daughter
are the perfect family when they adopt an orphaned toddler from
Romania, but their dreams of a happy foursome are destroyed by
troubles from their new son's past. Because he was neglected as a
baby, Michael grows into a brutal boy _ his adoptive father calls
him ``amoral,'' incapable of love or socialization. By the time he
starts kindergarten, he is a danger to his classmates. Deborah's
efforts to help him and her determination to keep him in the family
even as he chips away a t her marriage are heart-rending.
Unfortunately, our sympathy for Michael is strained _ at times, he
is nothing less than demonic. Merrell also adds a distra cting
subplot about Chris Latham's past that culminates in a long scene
during which he and Deborah seem to forget that they've left
Michael at home, attacking his tutor. The book could do with less
plot and a defter touch with the lit tle boy at its heart.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BEREFT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jane Bernstein (North Point, $24) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One evening in 1966, an Arizona State University student named
Laura Bernstein was stabbed six times as she was locking up her
bicycle behind the Casa Loma Hotel in Tempe. Later the same night,
17-year-old Jane Bernstein was in ed in her family's house in New
Jersey when she heard the telephone ring in her parents' bedroom.
Like a voyeur, she sneaked to their door and pressed her ear to it.
``Are you sure? Are you positive?'' she heard her mother say. Then
her mother hung up and said, ``Our baby is dead.'' In 1989, Jane
Bernstein came to Phoenix to see the place where her sister was
murdered for no reason, and for the next five years, she thought of
little else. This is her memoir, the story of a woman's troubled
life in the shadow of her sister's death, equal parts obsession and
avoidance. She writes of the murderer, a man named David Mumbaugh,
who died in prison in 1993. She was sad for him, she says _ ``not
sorry for him, but sad at the way this had turned out for all of
us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``FAIR BALL'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Bob Costas (Broadway, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The oft-quoted Jacques Barzun line goes, ``Whoever wants to know
the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball.'' Bob
Costas is not convinced. ``All I can say, really, is that Jacques
Barzun scares me a little bit,'' he writes. Costas is not the
baseball romantic he's often made out to be. He's a Bull Durham guy
who never liked that other Kevin Costner movie about the gam e. And
he's here to remind you that on Opening Day 2000, the sport began
its seventh season as a dysfunctional operation, that fans were
``gamely hanging on out of loyalty, memory and sheer faith, long
after baseball itself had ceased to care much about any of that.''
He offers a cogent analysis of what went wrong and what might make
it right, and he hopes people have the will to read it. As he
points out, if Bobby Thomson's home run happened today, here's how
Russ Hodges would call it: ``The Giants win the pennant!! The
Giants win the pennant!! The Dodgers get the wild card!! The
Dodgers get the wild card!!''Isn't that exciting? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``AMERICAN POETRY: THE TWENTIETH CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Library of America, $35 each) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is Dorothy Parker on Alfred Lord Tennyson: ``Should heaven
send me any son,/ I hope he's not like tennyson./ I'd rather have
him play a fiddle/ Than rise and bow and speak an idyll.'' We never
miss a chance to quote her, even when she's among more quotable
company. We also were happy to find Don Marquis here with archy and
mehitabel _ every collection of poetry needs a cockroach in it,
just to keep it honest. These are the first two volumes in a
four-volume set and include work written by poets born before 1914.
Organized by the poets' birth dates, there are multiple
contributions from the big guns _ Robert Frost, William Carlos
Williams, Carl Sandburg, Ezra Pound, e.e. cummings _ and surprise
showings by people such as Joe Hill, Ma Rainey, Cole Porter, Edith
Wharton, Bessie Smith and Tennessee Williams. They begin with Henry
Adams and end with May Swenson, and it's a long, pleasant journey
between.  &QL;

taken over the years, many wit strong historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   From the main site, click on Photo Gallery, and you'll reach a
screen with `Greatest Hits'' and `New York Noir.'' The Greatest
Hits section includes a number of notable Daily News photos,
including the well-known Charles Hoff picture of the Hindenburg
zeppelin ablaze after exploding at Lakehurst, N.J., i 1937, plus
the obligatory duck-and-cover photo from a 1960s atomic bomb drill
and a portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono. There is also a Rosie

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying to drag your kids away from those dreaded Pok mon cards?
Want to trick them into learning something? Then Dig, a bi-monthly
published by the Archaeological Institute of America, is for you.
It's archaeology for kids, chock full of interesting articles,
games, puzzles and cartoons, all based on ancient cultures and
discovery. Written in a straightforward, accessible style, the
magazine actually tries to make learning fun. Don't let the board
of education hear about this. Lead story, about the great pyramids
of Egypt, does a fine job explaining why the pyramids are such an
amazing feat of engineering (no slide rules, pocket protectors or
the Internet back in those days). Of course, it goes a little over
the top in quoting Napoleon, in the original French, remarking on
the pyramids. There is another good piece on how archaeologists
date artifacts, explaining how different items are found on
different levels of a dig, and how carbon-14 dating is used.
Another interesting piece trie s to determine whether Hercules
really lived, or is just a creation of Greek mythology and Michael
Eisner. Can you dig it?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BIOGRAPHY'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's cover story profiles Paul Newman, salad dressing
entrepreneur and part-time actor. Naturally, the story is a fawning
piece of fluff, but the pictures are cool, stretching from Newman's
high school yearbook photo to studio shots of him in Cool Hand
Luke, The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Color
of Money, for which he won an Oscar. The story starts out talking
about how amusing Newman is, but none of the jokes he tells are
very funny. But he does, the author slyly notes, still have those
same blue eyes. Let's hope so. In the way of actual history, there
is a decent piece on John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil,
the mammoth monopoly that was broken up by a trust-busting Teddy
Roosevelt and turned into most of the gas stations you see on
corners today. The story also notes that Rockefeller turned
philanthropist in his later years, giving millions to education,
health care, churches and orphanages. Bully. In the Masters of the
Stunningly Obvious section, there's a story noting that movie star
Cameron Diaz is quite fetching. Bully, bully. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lead story examines the hullabaloo around the Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP for short), a NASA project that will catalog
microwave photons to answer the largest questions of the universe:
how old it is, how it will end, whether space is really infinite
and where exactly did I leave my car keys? The mission is a
follow-up to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) that found the
faint afterglow of the Big Bang. If it survives its testing, and
launch, MAP will use its sophisticated equipment to recreate ``the
universe's baby picture.'' Another article notes that chimpanzees
speak in dialects, invent odd grooming styles and drum better than
most kids in marching bands, meaning they are closer to humans than
previously thought. And their TV shows are better than prime time,
too. In the category of Tediously Pointless Pursuits, a group of
climbers clambered up Mount Everest to stick a global positioning
device on top, to finally, once and for all, get its exact
elevation. And they got it. Plus or minus 7 feet. Doh!  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ROLLING STONE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cover story checks in on the Red Hot Chili Peppers, noting that
Flea and the boys are back on their game with the release of
``Californication,'' which the mag calls ``their finest sustained
work ever.'' Piece holds that the Chili Peppers have evolved from
half-naked out-of-control young turks to half-naked elder
statesmen, after 17 years and seven albums. Article's funniest line
points out that the Chili Peppers ``have had so many guitarists _
seven _ they could hold a reunion barbecue for them every summer.''
There is also a well-written piece on Levon Helm, drummer for The
Band (``The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,'' ``Up On Cripple
Creek''), who is recovering from throat cancer and revisiting the
Delta blues and daughter Amy. In a Q&AMP;A, Latino heartthrob Marc
Anthony admits that he used to get sick to his stomach at the idea
of performing. Now he's engaged to a former Miss Universe. Go
figure. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For nearly five years, Veronica Negrete Sanchez
has searched almost every corner of Mexico and parts of the United
States, looking for the baby stolen from her by two women dressed
as social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Negrete has even visited morgues and cradled dead babies,
including one she said was mutilated, searching softly with her
fingers for the distinctive mark that separates her child from
others.
</P>
<P>
   But she has never found that special spot on her baby's chest,
and DNA tests taken from her and the small bodies have confirmed
her doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Ivan Esquivel Negrete will be 5 years old May 26,
assuming he is alive. But the young mother with dark, sad eyes and
long black hair has not given up her search.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting tears, her chin quivering and mouth puckering, Negrete
whispers that it would be better to find out her baby, her
first-born, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray to God he will help me find out what happened. In the
best of circumstances, a good family has him, but I just don't
know,'' said Negrete, 27. ``I didn't stop crying until I got
pregnant again. The doctor said it was bad for my pregnancy. Before
that, I wanted to kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She is one of hundreds of mothers in Mexico who claim their
children were stolen or kidnapped from homes, schools, streets,
parks or malls, never to be seen again. They suspect their children
were sold for illegal adoptions, prostitution, child pornography,
forced labor and even for the trafficking of organs.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the U.S. Congress has called for better
cooperation in tracking American children abducted during custody
fights and taken to other countries, including Mexico, the issue of
missing Mexican children gets barely a mention.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where political and drug crimes get all the
publicity, where children are coddled and spoiled, it is Mexico's
dark secret: Babies, infants and teen-agers are disappearing. Some
accounts put the rate at one per day; others say it's much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Not much is being done about it, although legislation before the
Senate would increase jail time to a minimum of 60 years for a
kidnapper of a child under 12 years of age. The measure also calls
for the creation of a special agency, overseen by the federal
attorney general, to investigate crimes against children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mexico has no national database with the names and
numbers of disappeared children and no single government agency
dedicated to finding them.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office oversees such cases, and since
1990 Mexico City's attorney general has operated the Center of
Support for Missing Persons, but it does not investigate
disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is among 28 countries that signed The Hague Convention on
Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Inter Country
Adoption. Under the agreement, it is required to name authorities
responsible for controlling the trafficking of children.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion has been under way to create such a special agency,
but it has yet to develop. Mexican officials have been in contact
with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in
Alexandria, Va., to join forces. But it has yet happened.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no official figures, there is no way to know
how many children run away, how many are taken in divorce or
separation disputes, how many are kidnapped for ransom, how many
are used in illegal adoptions or how many are used for prostitution
or child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   A special report published in 1998 by the United Nations Human
Rights Commission chastised Mexican officials for a ``hermetic and
defensive attitude still in a denial stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also lambasted Mexico's child legislation for not
being up to ``pertinent international standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common and visible sexual commercial exploitation of
minors in Mexico is prostitution,'' the report said. ``Children who
live in border states are more susceptible because these zones are
preferred in the production of child pornography for easy transport
to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a hidden crime known only to the affected: the mothers,
friends and relatives of a missing child.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people rob a bank, there are cameras. But if you steal a
child in circumstances no one sees, we are talking about an
invisible enemy,'' said Guillermo Gutierrez, who runs one of the
largest private organizations in Mexico dedicated to finding
missing children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a trace of anything,'' said Gutierrez, who heads
the National Foundation of Investigations of Stolen and Disappeared
Children and has been trying to establish links with the Center for
Missing and Exploited Children in Virginia. ``In the United States,
you have help from the government, from the FBI, from private
corporations. In Mexico we are on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez's organization is one of dozens of such private groups
throughout Mexico. In interviews in Mexico City with five
organizations, each reported to be working on an average of between
80 and 100 unresolved disappearances of children, many of them the
same cases.

   This week's cover story profiles Paul Newman, salad dressing
entrepreneur and part-time actor. Naturally, the story is a fawning
piece of fluff, but the pictures are cool, stretching from Newman's
high school yearbook photo to studio shots of him in Cool Hand
Luke, The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Color
of Money, for which he won an Oscar. The story starts out talking
about how amusing Newman is, but none of the jokes he tells are
very funny. But he does, the author slyly notes, still have those
same blue eyes. Let's hope so. In the way of actual history, there
is a decent piece on John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil,
the mammoth monopoly that was broken up by a trust-busting Teddy
Roosevelt and turned into most of the gas stations you see on
corners today. The story also notes that Rockefeller turned
philanthropist in his later years, giving millions to education,
health care, churches and orphanages. Bully. In the Masters of the
Stunningly Obvious section, there's a story noting that movie star
Cameron Diaz is quite fetching. Bully, bully. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lead story examines the hullabaloo around the Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP for short), a NASA project that will catalog
microwave photons to answer the largest questions of the universe:
how old it is, how it will end, whether space is really infinite
and where exactly did I leave my car keys? The mission is a
follow-up to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) that found the
faint afterglow of the Big Bang. If it survives its testing, and
launch, MAP will use its sophisticated equipment to recreate ``the
universe's baby picture.'' Another article notes that chimpanzees
speak in dialects, invent odd grooming styles and drum better than
most kids in marching bands, meaning they are closer to humans than
previously thought. And their TV shows are better than prime time,
too. In the category of Tediously Pointless Pursuits, a group of
climbers clambered up Mount Everest to stick a global positioning
device on top, to finally, once and for all, get its exact
elevation. And they got it. Plus or minus 7 feet. Doh!  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ROLLING STONE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cover story checks in on the Red Hot Chili Peppers, noting that
Flea and the boys are back on their game with the release of
``Californication,'' which the mag calls ``their finest sustained
work ever.'' Piece holds that the Chili Peppers have evolved from
half-naked out-of-control young turks to half-naked elder
statesmen, after 17 years and seven albums. Article's funniest line
points out that the Chili Peppers ``have had so many guitarists _
seven _ they could hold a reunion barbecue for them every summer.''
There is also a well-written piece on Levon Helm, drummer for The
Band (``The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,'' ``Up On Cripple
Creek''), who is recovering from throat cancer and revisiting the
Delta blues and daughter Amy. In a Q&AMP;A, Latino heartthrob Marc
Anthony admits that he used to get sick to his stomach at the idea
of performing. Now he's engaged to a former Miss Universe. Go
figure. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Susan Merrell (HarperCollins, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel is built on a provocative idea but suffers in the
execution. Chris and Deborah Latham and their 3-year-old daughter
are the perfect family when they adopt an orphaned toddler from
Romania, but their dreams of a happy foursome are destroyed by
troubles from their new son's past. Because he was neglected as a
baby, Michael grows into a brutal boy _ his adoptive father calls
him ``amoral,'' incapable of love or socialization. By the time he
starts kindergarten, he is a danger to his classmates. Deborah's
efforts to help him and her determination to keep him in the family
even as he chips away a t her marriage are heart-rending.
Unfortunately, our sympathy for Michael is strained _ at times, he
is nothing less than demonic. Merrell also adds a distra cting
subplot about Chris Latham's past that culminates in a long scene
during which he and Deborah seem to forget that they've left
Michael at home, attacking his tutor. The book could do with less
plot and a defter touch with the lit tle boy at its heart.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BEREFT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jane Bernstein (North Point, $24) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One evening in 1966, an Arizona State University student named
Laura Bernstein was stabbed six times as she was locking up her
bicycle behind the Casa Loma Hotel in Tempe. Later the same night,
17-year-old Jane Bernstein was in ed in her family's house in New
Jersey when she heard the telephone ring in her parents' bedroom.
Like a voyeur, she sneaked to their door and pressed her ear to it.
``Are you sure? Are you positive?'' she heard her mother say. Then
her mother hung up and said, ``Our baby is dead.'' In 1989, Jane
Bernstein came to Phoenix to see the place where her sister was
murdered for no reason, and for the next five years, she thought of
little else. This is her memoir, the story of a woman's troubled
life in the shadow of her sister's death, equal parts obsession and
avoidance. She writes of the murderer, a man named David Mumbaugh,
who died in prison in 1993. She was sad for him, she says _ ``not
sorry for him, but sad at the way this had turned out for all of
us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``FAIR BALL'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Bob Costas (Broadway, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The oft-quoted Jacques Barzun line goes, ``Whoever wants to know
the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball.'' Bob
Costas is not convinced. ``All I can say, really, is that Jacques
Barzun scares me a little bit,'' he writes. Costas is not the
baseball romantic he's often made out to be. He's a Bull Durham guy
who never liked that other Kevin Costner movie about the gam e. And
he's here to remind you that on Opening Day 2000, the sport began
its seventh season as a dysfunctional operation, that fans were
``gamely hanging on out of loyalty, memory and sheer faith, long
after baseball itself had ceased to care much about any of that.''
He offers a cogent analysis of what went wrong and what might make
it right, and he hopes people have the will to read it. As he
points out, if Bobby Thomson's home run happened today, here's how
Russ Hodges would call it: ``The Giants win the pennant!! The
Giants win the pennant!! The Dodgers get the wild card!! The
Dodgers get the wild card!!''Isn't that exciting? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``AMERICAN POETRY: THE TWENTIETH CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Library of America, $35 each) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is Dorothy Parker on Alfred Lord Tennyson: ``Should heaven
send me any son,/ I hope he's not like tennyson./ I'd rather have
him play a fiddle/ Than rise and bow and speak an idyll.'' We never
miss a chance to quote her, even when she's among more quotable
company. We also were happy to find Don Marquis here with archy and
mehitabel _ every collection of poetry needs a cockroach in it,
just to keep it honest. These are the first two volumes in a
four-volume set and include work written by poets born before 1914.
Organized by the poets' birth dates, there are multiple
contributions from the big guns _ Robert Frost, William Carlos
Williams, Carl Sandburg, Ezra Pound, e.e. cummings _ and surprise
showings by people such as Joe Hill, Ma Rainey, Cole Porter, Edith
Wharton, Bessie Smith and Tennessee Williams. They begin with Henry
Adams and end with May Swenson, and it's a long, pleasant journey
between.  &QL;

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, governments and busi nesses should pressure the
Taliban the way they pressured South Africa to end racial
apartheid, said Deb Ellis, author of the soon-to-be-pub lished book
``Women of the Afghan War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate, who asks to be identified only as Sajeda, is
angry at the U.S. government for getting involved during the Soviet
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Afghan people fought the British (gaining its independence
in 1919). Afghanistan could have de feated the Russians without the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   She also feels betrayed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N. can send peacekeepers to East Timor to pave the
way for ademocratic election, why can't they do it in Afghanistan?
They say, `We must be invited by the government,' but since there
is no government in Afghanistan, that's just an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hassina Sherjan-Samad, founder of Children's Voice,
traveled to Kabul, where, escorted by the Taliban, she visited
classrooms, filled only with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person with me asked one of the boys if there were any
differences between men and women. This boy, about 12 or 15, said,
`Women have 9 million brain cells, and men have 15 million brain
cells.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked, `How do you know?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Physics proved it.' This is what they teach.'' Reach

&HT;     ILLICIT ADOPTIONS STRIKE A SENSITIVE NERVE IN MEXICO

<P>
   PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Mexico _ Returning from a day trip to Mexico
early last month, sisters Beatriz and Elizabeth Rodriguez of
Austin, Texas, were intercepted by Mexican immigration agents just
before reaching the international bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stopped me before I even paid the toll. They said we were
all detained,'' said Beatriz, who was traveling with three small
children in a late-model car with Texas plates.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the children were Elizabeth's. The third was not.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Mexican authorities soon determined, the 18-month-old
blond girl was not related to either Rodriguez and had no
documentation to establish her identity or citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy interrogation, the sisters told the Mexican
agents they had been paid $1,000 to take the baby, known to them
only as ``Blanca,'' to Austin, where they would receive
instructions by phone on where to deliver her.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they had taken a dozen or more Mexican infants
into the United States before Blanca. Although the sisters later
retracted these admissions, portions of their videotaped statements
were shown on Mexican national television.
</P>
<P>
   The case hit a sensitive nerve in Mexico, a country of wrenching
material poverty, but, in its children, great familial riches.
Although some impoverished Mexican mothers gladly sell their
children, ostensibly for a better life on the other side, a great
many more say their babies are stolen or kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy right now what they are saying. They say we're with
the big Mafia and that we steal kids,'' Beatriz said in a recent
jailhouse interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked us, `Do you know what they use these kids are for?
People are selling them over there,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican federal police, the PFP, say the sisters are part of
a people-smuggling ring operating from Oaxaca to the northern
border. They say the ring is involved in child pornography and
prostitution. According to the PFP, the March 9 arrests of the
women came after a three-month investigation of child smuggling in
Piedras Negras in which the Rodriguez sisters were implicated by
unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they didn't do anything more than take them across
the border,'' said Claudia Martinez, a PFP spokeswoman in Mexico
City. ``They said they would deliver the children to a house in
Austin, and their job would end. But what happened after they
turned over the children?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in Eagle
Pass, Texas, where 10,000 vehicles and hundreds of pedestrians
arrive daily from Mexico, said they routinely encounter people
trying to bring small children into the country without adequate
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican babies are part of the immutable illicit commerce of
the international border: Drugs and humans come north, guns and
cash go south.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been encountering two or three minors a day, and most of
the time they are trying to smuggle them in because of desperate
conditions in Mexico,'' said Roger Morin, the INS port director in
Eagle Pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodriguez sisters are charged with people smuggling, a crime
punishable in Mexico by six to 12 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The women now say they were pressured by the Mexican police into
making admissions about smuggling babies into the United States.
They deny taking any children before Blanca, whom they say they
were trying to reunite with her mother in Austin as a favor to a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that we said it, but it was for their benefit,''
Beatriz said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth said she told the police what they wanted to hear
because of concern for her two children, who she said were left
alone and neglected during the lengthy interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The women say they were not paid, even though they acknowledge
they had $600 in cash with them when the police detained them. They
scoff at police statements that they are part of a large smuggling
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although arrests in the smuggling ring have been made in other
parts of the country, PFP agents are still searching for Guadalupe
Salazar, the woman in Piedras Negras who allegedly gave the
Rodriguez sisters the baby.
</P>
<P>
   After spending six days with a Mexican social agency, the blond
baby was returned to her parents in the interior of Mexico.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety about irregular or illicit adoptions in Mexico is not
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the visa section at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City
caught an American couple trying to get a 10-day-old infant out of
the country after paying $2,500. Also in January, another woman was
stopped from getting a visa for an 18-month-old child that she had
bought for 10,000 pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing was a well-publicized case last year in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the ``Two Arlenes'' added credence to Mexican
suspicions that childless, wealthy Americans are willing to pay
tens of thousands of dollars, and ask few questions, to adopt a
child.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Arlene Lieberman and Arlene Reingold, neighbors on Long
Island who ran a small adoption consulting agency, and Mario Reyes,
a lawyer from Douglas, Ariz., were accused by federal authorities
of running a baby-smuggling ring from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   According to the authorities, the Long Island women contacted
American couples, desperate for a baby, with promises of safe, easy
and legal adoption. They say at least 17 Mexican babies were placed
in American homes before the authorities stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Some families paid $20,000 or more for adoptions of the
children, some of whom had serious health problems, and none of
whom had proper documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, a lawyer with dual Mexican and American citizenship,
admitted to paying Mexican mothers for the children, to hiring
smugglers to get the babies into the United States and to document
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth person, Margarita Soto de Smith, a resident of the
Mexican border town of Agua Prieta, across the border from Reyes'
home in Arizona, also was arrested by Mexican authorities on
charges that she was part of the smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said she described how Reyes found struggling
Mexican mothers willing to part with their newborns for money and
promises of a better life. The investigators also say Soto told the
police she helped house the babies obtained by Reyes and took them
into the United States using false documents while posing as their
mother.
</P>
<P>
   In July, both Long Island housewives pleaded guilty to federal
charges of conspiring to transport undocumented immigrants. Reyes
later pleaded guilty to similar charges and agreed to make
restitution to the parents.
</P>
<P>
   The case illustrates the great Mexican paradox. Mexico is a
country of nearly 100 million people, a third of whom are under age
15. Many Mexican children live in impoverished households, more
than 10,000 children live in orphanages, and even more are
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of the lengthy and complicated adoption process, an
average of 100 Mexican children are adopted each year by Americans.
It is a reflection of what some see as a strong Mexican bias
against losing children to foreign cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paperwork and red tape is extreme,'' said Victor Negron, a
prominent San Antonio adoption lawyer. ``The Mexican authorities
make it almost impossible to cross a baby into the United States.
There seems to be a cultural bias against allowing babies to come
over to the North American side.''

   &UR; MEXICO CITY: x x x the same cases. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only organization with a breakdown of the percentage of
cases is the Association for the Recovery of Lost Children, run by
accountant Israel Betanzos.
</P>
<P>
   He said about 60 percent of the cases he handles are custodial.
That is, a husband or wife took the child. But he said between 30
percent and 40 percent are stolen or kidnapped. Other organizations
agree on the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police don't help us. When we call them, they want money,''
said Betanzos, who wants to establish an alliance with the Heidi
Search Center for Missing Children of San Antonio. ``But all the
victims are poor. They barely have enough to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The way these organizations work is through footwork and with
the help of volunteers. From tips, they go where they believe a
child might be held. Scrounging bus fare, they scour the nation and
often cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch for days, quietly without being seen. Once we confirm
it is the child we are looking for, we go to the police,'' Betanzos
said. ``Only then will authorities make an arrest.''

   Betanzos said if a child is under 3 years of age, the chance of
recovery is virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
   Negrete's son was so young, the family had yet to take his
photo. All she has is a crude drawing printed on pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   It was 8:30 a.m. on July 5, 1995 in the state of Mexico, a
mostly rural state on the outskirts of Mexico City. Her son had
been born a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Negrete was rushing to get the baby ready to go out and get his
birth certificate at the national registry. He was ready to go,
diaper bag nearby.
</P>
<P>
   She said there were two women. One claimed to be a social
worker, and the other was clad in a nurse's uniform, a stethoscope
around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Negrete was not suspicious because she met one of them two days
earlier outside the hospital where she had taken Ivan to be
examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stopped me on the street and said they were taking a
census. I gave them my address, my name and Ivan's name, and that
was it,'' she said. `` I didn't see them again until they came to
my door two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they wanted to corroborate my address and to find
out if I lived alone and if it was my first baby,'' Negrete said.
``They wanted to know if the baby was healthy. They made small
talk. I told them I had to go out and to wait while I went to the
bathroom to get dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes later, when Negrete stepped out of the
bathroom in her street clothes, the women were gone. So was her
baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started screaming `My baby was stolen!' I ran to the street
like a madwoman, yelling `My baby was stolen!''' she said, sobbing
at the recollection.
</P>
<P>
   The police came. Negrete gave a description of the women. One of
them, the one dressed as a nurse, was caught. She is serving a
27-year sentence for accessory to a crime. But she has never
discussed the case, not to the authorities, not to Negrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begged her to please tell me where my baby was,'' Negrete
said. ``But all she ever said was that she didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted so much publicity that Negrete began getting
anonymous telephone calls with people claiming they knew where Ivan
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled all over the country. I've been to Guatemala, to
Miami. I answer all the calls because you never know,'' she said.
``Sometimes I get calls and there is a baby crying at the other
end. I want to die when that happens. There are mean people in this
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Negrete ties her new daughter to her wrist when they go
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at me as if I'm crazy,'' she said. ``But they are
the crazy ones if they think their child is safe. I don't care what
they think.''

   WASHINGTON _ Maria's voice is a whisper, but her lurid tale of
being taken from Mexico and sold as a sex slave in Florida is a
damning indictment of the growing problem of the international
trafficking of women and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, at age 18, she was moved from one mobile home
to another in rural Florida, where she was forced to service up to
35 men per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weekends were worse,'' Maria said. ``Our bodies were utterly
sore and swollen.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew how many men she had been with from counting the
wrappers of condoms the migrant farm workers purchased for $25 _
``tickets'' that were exchanged for intimate time with the young
woman. ``I could not believe this was happening to me,'' Maria
said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who is now receiving counseling in the United States,
testified before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee earlier
this month, describing her ordeal before a packed hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never ever have done this work. No one I know would
have done this work,'' she said through an interpreter, Virginia
Coto, a lawyer with the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center.
</P>
<P>
   Coto said the sex trafficking ring that snared Maria also preyed
on Mexican girls as young as 14, like Rosa, a child from Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put it behind me. I still feel shame. I was a decent
girl in Mexico. I used to go to church with my family,'' Rosa said
in a statement submitted to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and other federal agencies estimate that
about 1 million women and children are held against their will,
raped, beaten and sold to the highest bidder each year worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 are brought to the United States from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about slavery,'' said William Yeomans, chief of
staff for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ``This is
as barbaric as the trade that brought African-Americans to this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has asked Congress to strengthen laws
against those who traffic in humans for sex, labor and other
purposes. The House and Senate are weighing separate bills to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, lawmakers are considering measures that include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing the penalty for involuntary servitude from 10 years
to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making it easier to prosecute acts of coercion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving victims of the crime permanent status in the United
States to receive medical care and to assist law enforcement
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the cruelest human rights abuses. Moreover,
it's a growing wave, which has increased dramatically over the last
10 years,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., the chairman of the
committee hearing the testimony.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Maria, the events began innocently enough.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a maroon dress, a scarf and sunglasses, she told
lawmakers that her illegal immigration into the United States
quickly plummeted into a living hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in fear for my life now more than ever,'' she told
lawmakers who listened intently to her story from the ornate,
fourth-floor room of the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, she held a job in a general retail store and worked
as a domestic helper in Veracruz, Mexico. She was not married, but
she had a daughter and worked two jobs to feed and clothe her
family.
</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance approached her about jobs available in the
United States, in restaurants and bars that paid more money. Maria
jumped at the opportunity, and a ``coyote,'' or smuggler, took her
across the Rio Grande, near Matamoros, to Texas, where she was kept
in a safe house until she was smuggled to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   There, she testified, a man named Abel Cadena informed her that
she would be working at a brothel as a prostitute to work off her
$2,200 debt for being smuggled into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The woman testified that she was given ``tight clothes to wear''
and taken to a mobile home brothel to work with other girls in
similar straits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armed men were selling tickets to customers in the trailer.
Tickets were condoms,'' Maria said. ``At the end of the night, I
turned in the condom wrappers. Each wrapper represented a supposed
deduction to my smuggling fee. We tried to keep our own records,
but the bosses would destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never sure what we owed.''
</P>
<P>
   Each brothel had four girls and armed guards. The trailers were
located in rural and isolated areas. ``We were transported every 15
days to another trailer in a nearby city,'' she said. ``This was to
give customers a variety of girls, and so we never knew where we
were in case we tried to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who escaped and were caught were severely punished with
beatings and rape, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could do is stand there and watch,'' she said. ``I was
too afraid to try to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria's servitude ended in 1998 when federal and state law
enforcement officers broke up the prostitution ring that catered to
Hispanic migrant farm workers throughout central Florida. ``The
women and girls were forced to engage in sexual acts with as many
as 130 men a week. They were beaten and assaulted, and some were
forced to have abortions when they became pregnant,'' Yeomans said.
``We prosecuted the case and obtained seven guilty pleas.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, Mexican authorities arrested Abel Cadena Sosa in
Veracruz on a U.S. extradition warrant alleging he participated in
a prostitution ring using underage Mexican women.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held in Mexico City's Southern Penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   Coto, of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, said other men
involved in the prostitution ring who were prosecuted in the United
States received as few as two years in jail. ``Eight defendants are
still at large,'' she told the senators, adding that ``these
survivors cannot return to the same neighborhoods where their
(former) captors live, and would surely retaliate against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities first detained the victims of the Cadena
ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not receive medical or psychological treatment. They
did not have adequate legal assistance,'' Coto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not understand what happened to them and what was
going to happen,'' she said. ``What they did know is that they were
terrified and needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center won their release
to Safespace, a battered women's shelter in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are illegal immigrants, they are not eligible for
public benefits in the United States. Community groups have
provided psychological counseling, medical care, food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Maria said the experience still haunts her. She is afraid of
people, and she suffers from ``flashbacks.'' Maria urged the
senators to help other young women ``so that they will not suffer
as we did in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tricked into coming here,'' she said. ``Please help
me. Please help us. Please do not let this happen to anyone else.''

   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, governments and busi nesses should pressure the
Taliban the way they pressured South Africa to end racial
apartheid, said Deb Ellis, author of the soon-to-be-pub lished book
``Women of the Afghan War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate, who asks to be identified only as Sajeda, is
angry at the U.S. government for getting involved during the Soviet
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Afghan people fought the British (gaining its independence
in 1919). Afghanistan could have de feated the Russians without the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   She also feels betrayed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N. can send peacekeepers to East Timor to pave the
way for ademocratic election, why can't they do it in Afghanistan?
They say, `We must be invited by the government,' but since there
is no government in Afghanistan, that's just an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hassina Sherjan-Samad, founder of Children's Voice,
traveled to Kabul, where, escorted by the Taliban, she visited
classrooms, filled only with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person with me asked one of the boys if there were any
differences between men and women. This boy, about 12 or 15, said,
`Women have 9 million brain cells, and men have 15 million brain
cells.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked, `How do you know?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Physics proved it.' This is what they teach.'' Reach

HISTORIAN DETAILS UGLY CHAPTER OF RACISM AND INNOCENT YOUNG
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY MOIVING IN THE ``E'' AND ``L'' CATEGORIES.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades before political scandals cast a shadow over Arizona at
the end of the 20th century, a series of events in Clifton-Morenci
wrote an ugly chapter of state's history at the beginning of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chapter full of racism, anti-Catholic bigotry and
orphans dickered over like dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1980s and 1990s saw a governor deposed, a governor
indicted and stat legislators drawing up plans to secede from the
Union, no less shameful was the nasty tug of war that ensued over
40 homeless children sent west from New York in hopes of finding
new families.
</P>
<P>
   To officials of the New York Foundling Hospital, their plan
seemed simple: Place orphans with good Catholic families in the
wide-open spaces of the Arizon territory.
</P>
<P>
   How naive.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice and politics proved insurmountable barriers between
the fair-skinned Irish foundlings and their would-be foster
parents, all of whom happened to be Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the territory's quest for statehood was
driving citizens to prove their American patriotism and resist
efforts to form one large state with the territory of New Mexico,
which had a higher percentage of Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors converged in an episode that still causes
pain in the adjoining mining communities of Clifton and Morenci in
southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   University of Wisconsin historian Linda Gordon has chronicled
these events in a her book, ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction''
(Harvard University Press, 1999), a work rich in detail about the
town and the scandal that pitted Anglo residents against their
Mexican-American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Principal players were two nuns and a placement officer from the
New York orphanage, representatives of the local Catholic diocese,
Mexican families eage to adopt the orphans, White residents of
Clifton and Morenci bent on halting the adoptions and officials of
the Phelps Dodge Corp., whose economic caste system helped to
reinforce the notion that Mexican workers were inferior to Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   The story in ``Orphan Abduction'' is played out against the
backdrop of racial bia often tolerated in turn-of-the-century
America. Race meant not only Black and White, but also Irish,
German, Italian, Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we call such divisions ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon opens her story on a night in October 1904 as a posse
arrives at the home of Margarita Chacon to demand the return of two
fair-haired orphans recently placed with Senora Chacon and her
husband, Cornelio.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, the Chacons would be only one of
many couples forced to surrender children promised to them by the
New York orphanage and their own parish priest, Constant Mandin.
</P>
<P>
   Father Mandin saw his Mexican parishioners as good Catholics
willing to take in foundlings. Anglos saw them as brown-skinned
kidnappers unfit to raise White children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AN EASTERN SOLUTION  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children had come west on one of the celebrated orphan
trains operating in Eastern cities concerned with a growing
population of homeless children and street urchins.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, some children found loving new families. Some
found themselves valued only as unpaid farm labor.
</P>
<P>
   In Clifton-Morenci, a handful found homes, and a few were given
away as ``gifts,'' but the social climate prevented a generally
positive outcome. Most of the New York orphans reboarded their
train and were sent back for re-distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by a strike and a devastating flood in 1905 _ events
coincidenta lly repeated in 1983 _ the residents of Clifton-Morenci
were left with wounds slow to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose academic specialty is women, families and labor
issues, discovered the orphan saga while reading histories of labor
disputes, in which the actions of Phelps Dodge are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there were kids in this piqued my interest,''
Gordon said while vacationing in Portland., Ore., and on leave from
UW to teach at New York University. ``I came to understand the
story more and more as I went along ... I thought it was an amazing
story.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was intrigued by the racial aspect of a story that
involved not Blacks and Whites but ``Anglos,'' as she calls them in
the book, and ``Mexicans,'' as Mexican-Americans were known at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began her research in 1994 and finished the book in 1998.
She made three trips to Clifton-Morenci during that time to
interview elderly residents and glean a sense of what the
communities were like 90 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Not all residents welcomed her inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Festering wounds had reopened during the strike of 1983, when
the communities once again split along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The strike destroyed once-thriving Clifton, Gordon said. Phelps
Dodge fired its protesters and replaced them with strike-breakers.
The town's young people moved away. Senior workers retired. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ANGRY COMMUNITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when Gordon arrived with pen in hand, some
residents refused to be interviewed. Even when she explained that
her interest was the 1905 orphan incident, conversations invariably
returned to the 1983 strike and the pain it had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some people opened up. One of Gordon's best sources was
the venerable Al Fernandez, a former mayor of Clifton and renowned
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to talk and had great stories,'' Gordon said of the
man who died in December at age 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, Catholic Church officials, eager to expose what they
believed had been an episode of anti-Catholic bigotry, made church
archives readily available.
</P>
<P>
   And in Phoenix, Gordon found a historian's pot of gold: complete
transcripts from a state Supreme Court trial whose verdict had
upheld taking the orphans from their Mexican foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, even the attorneys for the Foundling Hospital
had ``concede'' that Mexican homes were inferior to those of Anglos
and probably unsuitable for White children.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexicans had been called as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Gordon pieced together the strange story. When the
train from New York pulled into the Clifton station on the evening
of Oct. 1, 1904, and unloaded its cargo of 40 weary children, Anglo
residents took notice.
</P>
<P>
   Where had these children come from, and where were they going?
</P>
<P>
   To their dismay, they discovered that the youngsters were
heading for their new homes. Mexican homes.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated both by prejudice and a sincere sense of concern for
motherless children, a group of Anglos, mostly women, began to
protest the placeme nt of the orphans. They and their husbands,
many armed with rifles, threatened Father Mandin, the sisters, the
placement officer, the bishop from Tucson and Mexican parents who
had the audacity to take the children into their homes and hearts.
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HUMAN MERCHANDISE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anglos demanded that they be given the ``babies''as they fought
over the human merchandise like bargains at a rummage sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me,'' Gordon said of that chapter in her
research.
</P>
<P>
   With courts as high as the U.S. Supreme Court siding with the
vigilantes, the nuns eventually were forced to back down. One rainy
night, the Mexican families were ordered to turn over the children
to waiting Anglos. Fifteen of the orphans went to Anglo homes in
Clifton and Morenci. One child was sent to a Los Angeles family as
a ``gift'' from one of the law-enforcement officers. The rest were
returned to New York and found homes in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexican family was allowed to keep a child.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said she believes that Phelps Dodge helped foster the
prejudice that divided Mexicans from Anglos. Looking at blueprints
of company housing, she found that ``Americans'' had been assigned
homes with running water and flushing toilets, while the Mexicans'
accommodations were more primitive. The copper company rationalized
the disparity, she said, by asserting that Mexicans were used to
such conditions and aspired to nothing more. In truth, Mexicans
were upwardly mobile and sought parity with their Anglo neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Subjugating the Mexicans became a self-fulfilling prophecy as
poverty equated with inferiority and, in the case of the orphans,
immorality. Anglos hurled slurs at the foster parents, accusing
them of keeping dirty homes (untrue), being prostitutes (untrue)
and being prone to drink (Anglos ran the saloons).
</P>
<P>
   Although bigotry against minority laborers reared its head in
other pa rts of the country - Chinese workers often were vilified
on the West Coast - ``it became more deeply entrenched'' in
Clifton-Morenci, Gordon said.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MISGUIDED INTENTIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is not entirely unsympathetic to the Anglo women who took
back the orphans. Given the tenor of the times, they truly believed
that Anglo children belonged in Anglo homes and needed to be
``rescued '' from the clutches of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't always know their own motives,'' Gordon
speculates.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the officials of the New York Foundling Hospital
might not have fully understood the racial implications of their
proposal or exactly what the term ``Mexican'' meant. They knew the
Southwesterners as ``Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Gordon fault the nuns who buckled at the threat of
a well -aimed Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect them to be heroes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction'' could be used in
high school and university history courses, its target audience is
a broad one, Gordon said. Anyone interested in history or in the
``true crime'' genre will find it absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said her book, already in its second printing, has
received good reviews from critics, and she finds that rewarding,
but she added that her favo rite reviews have come from former
residents of Clifton-Morenci.
</P>
<P>
   In their letters, she said, they tell her, ``You got it just
right.'' &QL;

HISTORIAN DETAILS UGLY CHAPTER OF RACISM AND INNOCENT YOUNG
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY MOIVING IN THE ``E'' AND ``L'' CATEGORIES.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades before political scandals cast a shadow over Arizona at
the end of the 20th century, a series of events in Clifton-Morenci
wrote an ugly chapter of state's history at the beginning of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chapter full of racism, anti-Catholic bigotry and
orphans dickered over like dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1980s and 1990s saw a governor deposed, a governor
indicted and stat legislators drawing up plans to secede from the
Union, no less shameful was the nasty tug of war that ensued over
40 homeless children sent west from New York in hopes of finding
new families.
</P>
<P>
   To officials of the New York Foundling Hospital, their plan
seemed simple: Place orphans with good Catholic families in the
wide-open spaces of the Arizon territory.
</P>
<P>
   How naive.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice and politics proved insurmountable barriers between
the fair-skinned Irish foundlings and their would-be foster
parents, all of whom happened to be Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the territory's quest for statehood was
driving citizens to prove their American patriotism and resist
efforts to form one large state with the territory of New Mexico,
which had a higher percentage of Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors converged in an episode that still causes
pain in the adjoining mining communities of Clifton and Morenci in
southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   University of Wisconsin historian Linda Gordon has chronicled
these events in a her book, ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction''
(Harvard University Press, 1999), a work rich in detail about the
town and the scandal that pitted Anglo residents against their
Mexican-American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Principal players were two nuns and a placement officer from the
New York orphanage, representatives of the local Catholic diocese,
Mexican families eage to adopt the orphans, White residents of
Clifton and Morenci bent on halting the adoptions and officials of
the Phelps Dodge Corp., whose economic caste system helped to
reinforce the notion that Mexican workers were inferior to Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   The story in ``Orphan Abduction'' is played out against the
backdrop of racial bia often tolerated in turn-of-the-century
America. Race meant not only Black and White, but also Irish,
German, Italian, Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we call such divisions ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon opens her story on a night in October 1904 as a posse
arrives at the home of Margarita Chacon to demand the return of two
fair-haired orphans recently placed with Senora Chacon and her
husband, Cornelio.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, the Chacons would be only one of
many couples forced to surrender children promised to them by the
New York orphanage and their own parish priest, Constant Mandin.
</P>
<P>
   Father Mandin saw his Mexican parishioners as good Catholics
willing to take in foundlings. Anglos saw them as brown-skinned
kidnappers unfit to raise White children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AN EASTERN SOLUTION  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children had come west on one of the celebrated orphan
trains operating in Eastern cities concerned with a growing
population of homeless children and street urchins.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, some children found loving new families. Some
found themselves valued only as unpaid farm labor.
</P>
<P>
   In Clifton-Morenci, a handful found homes, and a few were given
away as ``gifts,'' but the social climate prevented a generally
positive outcome. Most of the New York orphans reboarded their
train and were sent back for re-distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by a strike and a devastating flood in 1905 _ events
coincidenta lly repeated in 1983 _ the residents of Clifton-Morenci
were left with wounds slow to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose academic specialty is women, families and labor
issues, discovered the orphan saga while reading histories of labor
disputes, in which the actions of Phelps Dodge are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there were kids in this piqued my interest,''
Gordon said while vacationing in Portland., Ore., and on leave from
UW to teach at New York University. ``I came to understand the
story more and more as I went along ... I thought it was an amazing
story.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was intrigued by the racial aspect of a story that
involved not Blacks and Whites but ``Anglos,'' as she calls them in
the book, and ``Mexicans,'' as Mexican-Americans were known at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began her research in 1994 and finished the book in 1998.
She made three trips to Clifton-Morenci during that time to
interview elderly residents and glean a sense of what the
communities were like 90 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Not all residents welcomed her inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Festering wounds had reopened during the strike of 1983, when
the communities once again split along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The strike destroyed once-thriving Clifton, Gordon said. Phelps
Dodge fired its protesters and replaced them with strike-breakers.
The town's young people moved away. Senior workers retired. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ANGRY COMMUNITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when Gordon arrived with pen in hand, some
residents refused to be interviewed. Even when she explained that
her interest was the 1905 orphan incident, conversations invariably
returned to the 1983 strike and the pain it had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some people opened up. One of Gordon's best sources was
the venerable Al Fernandez, a former mayor of Clifton and renowned
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to talk and had great stories,'' Gordon said of the
man who died in December at age 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, Catholic Church officials, eager to expose what they
believed had been an episode of anti-Catholic bigotry, made church
archives readily available.
</P>
<P>
   And in Phoenix, Gordon found a historian's pot of gold: complete
transcripts from a state Supreme Court trial whose verdict had
upheld taking the orphans from their Mexican foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, even the attorneys for the Foundling Hospital
had ``concede'' that Mexican homes were inferior to those of Anglos
and probably unsuitable for White children.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexicans had been called as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Gordon pieced together the strange story. When the
train from New York pulled into the Clifton station on the evening
of Oct. 1, 1904, and unloaded its cargo of 40 weary children, Anglo

ISRAELI COURT RULES THAT LEBANESE PRISONERS MUST BE RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG with CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Reversing a previous decision, the Israeli Supreme
Court ruled Wednesday that the government was not justified in
holding Lebanese detainees as ``bargaining chips'' for the release
of captured Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Following a hearing behind closed doors, the court ordered eight
of the 15 Lebanese being held in Israel released from prison
immediately. Seven others were in another group not included in the
petition considered by the court.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent of the seven are Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a
Shiite Muslim spiritual leader in the Hezbollah guerrilla movement,
who was abducted in 1989 from southern Lebanon, and Mustafa Dirani,
a leader of the Amal militia who was kidnapped in 1994 and also
transferred to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The two have been held by the Israeli army, apart from other
detainees, and their fate was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights lawyers said the court's ruling was broad and
should apply to all seven Lebanese whose release was not ordered
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Israel's prisons excluded Dirani and Obeid
when she told Agence France-Press that ``all 13 Lebanese held by
the prisons authority will be released and returned to Lebanon as
soon as the technical arrangements have been finalized'' with the
International Committee of the Red Cross. She said the two detained
Lebanese leaders were not under the control of the prison
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the sensitivity of the case, the supreme court
delayed releasing the 50-page decision so it could be reviewed for
classified information. Instead, the court issued a one-paragraph
summary of the 6-3 ruling by the panel of nine judges.
</P>
<P>
   The terse announcement left unclear whether the judges had
decided that the government does not have the right to hold
hostages in general, or whether their ruling applied only to
hostages who do not pose a clear and present danger to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision said that Israeli law on administrative
detention does not grant the Defense Ministry the right to hold
hostages. The decision was written by the court's chief judge,
Aaron Barak, who had written the earlier ruling in 1997 upholding
the detention of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Prime Minister Ehud Barak released a statement
saying that he had been briefed on the high court's ruling and
respected the decision. ``Although the prime minister believes that
Israelis should continue to hold the detainees for a certain
period, he will act in accordance with the high court ruling,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long faced international pressure to justify its
imprisonment of the Lebanese, some of whom have spent more than a
decade behind bars without charges against them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Lebanese were held to exchange for a missing Israeli air
force navigator, Ron Arad, who was captured after being shot down
in 1986 over southern Lebanon and has not been seen since. His
mother, Batia Arad, told Israeli Radio that ``the supreme court
abandoned Ron today.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other Israeli soldiers missing since a tank battle with
Syrian troops in 1982 are also thought to be prisoners-of-war,
though Syria has not acknowledged their captivity.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese hostages were seized inside their country by
Israeli commandos and Christian militiamen allied with the
Israeli-backed Southern Lebanese Army and held to trade for the
missing Israeli soldiers. The existence of the hostages in Israel
was kept secret for many years. The government did not admit
holding the hostages until 1998, six months after the court upheld
their detention in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A 16th Lebanese hostage, Ghassan Dirani, a former bank clerk,
was freed a week ago for reasons of mental health after more than
13 years in detention. Dirani had been abducted by a Christian
militia group in Beirut and turned over to Israel because he is
related to the Amal leader, Mustafa Dirani.

   WASHINGTON _ Maria's voice is a whisper, but her lurid tale of
being taken from Mexico and sold as a sex slave in Florida is a
damning indictment of the growing problem of the international
trafficking of women and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, at age 18, she was moved from one mobile home
to another in rural Florida, where she was forced to service up to
35 men per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weekends were worse,'' Maria said. ``Our bodies were utterly
sore and swollen.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew how many men she had been with from counting the
wrappers of condoms the migrant farm workers purchased for $25 _
``tickets'' that were exchanged for intimate time with the young
woman. ``I could not believe this was happening to me,'' Maria
said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who is now receiving counseling in the United States,
testified before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee earlier
this month, describing her ordeal before a packed hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never ever have done this work. No one I know would
have done this work,'' she said through an interpreter, Virginia
Coto, a lawyer with the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center.
</P>
<P>
   Coto said the sex trafficking ring that snared Maria also preyed
on Mexican girls as young as 14, like Rosa, a child from Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put it behind me. I still feel shame. I was a decent
girl in Mexico. I used to go to church with my family,'' Rosa said
in a statement submitted to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and other federal agencies estimate that
about 1 million women and children are held against their will,
raped, beaten and sold to the highest bidder each year worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 are brought to the United States from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about slavery,'' said William Yeomans, chief of
staff for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ``This is
as barbaric as the trade that brought African-Americans to this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has asked Congress to strengthen laws
against those who traffic in humans for sex, labor and other
purposes. The House and Senate are weighing separate bills to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, lawmakers are considering measures that include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing the penalty for involuntary servitude from 10 years
to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making it easier to prosecute acts of coercion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving victims of the crime permanent status in the United
States to receive medical care and to assist law enforcement
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the cruelest human rights abuses. Moreover,
it's a growing wave, which has increased dramatically over the last
10 years,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., the chairman of the
committee hearing the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Maria, the events began innocently enough.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a maroon dress, a scarf and sunglasses, she told
lawmakers that her illegal immigration into the United States
quickly plummeted into a living hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in fear for my life now more than ever,'' she told
lawmakers who listened intently to her story from the ornate,
fourth-floor room of the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, she held a job in a general retail store and worked
as a domestic helper in Veracruz, Mexico. She was not married, but
she had a daughter and worked two jobs to feed and clothe her
family.
</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance approached her about jobs available in the
United States, in restaurants and bars that paid more money. Maria
jumped at the opportunity, and a ``coyote,'' or smuggler, took her
across the Rio Grande, near Matamoros, to Texas, where she was kept
in a safe house until she was smuggled to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   There, she testified, a man named Abel Cadena informed her that
she would be working at a brothel as a prostitute to work off her
$2,200 debt for being smuggled into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The woman testified that she was given ``tight clothes to wear''
and taken to a mobile home brothel to work with other girls in
similar straits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armed men were selling tickets to customers in the trailer.
Tickets were condoms,'' Maria said. ``At the end of the night, I
turned in the condom wrappers. Each wrapper represented a supposed
deduction to my smuggling fee. We tried to keep our own records,
but the bosses would destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never sure what we owed.''
</P>
<P>
   Each brothel had four girls and armed guards. The trailers were
located in rural and isolated areas. ``We were transported every 15
days to another trailer in a nearby city,'' she said. ``This was to
give customers a variety of girls, and so we never knew where we
were in case we tried to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who escaped and were caught were severely punished with
beatings and rape, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could do is stand there and watch,'' she said. ``I was
too afraid to try to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria's servitude ended in 1998 when federal and state law
enforcement officers broke up the prostitution ring that catered to
Hispanic migrant farm workers throughout central Florida. ``The
women and girls were forced to engage in sexual acts with as many
as 130 men a week. They were beaten and assaulted, and some were
forced to have abortions when they became pregnant,'' Yeomans said.
``We prosecuted the case and obtained seven guilty pleas.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, Mexican authorities arrested Abel Cadena Sosa in
Veracruz on a U.S. extradition warrant alleging he participated in
a prostitution ring using underage Mexican women.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held in Mexico City's Southern Penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   Coto, of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, said other men
involved in the prostitution ring who were prosecuted in the United
States received as few as two years in jail. ``Eight defendants are
still at large,'' she told the senators, adding that ``these
survivors cannot return to the same neighborhoods where their
(former) captors live, and would surely retaliate against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities first detained the victims of the Cadena
ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not receive medical or psychological treatment. They
did not have adequate legal assistance,'' Coto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not understand what happened to them and what was
going to happen,'' she said. ``What they did know is that they were
terrified and needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center won their release
to Safespace, a battered women's shelter in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are illegal immigrants, they are not eligible for
public benefits in the United States. Community groups have
provided psychological counseling, medical care, food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Maria said the experience still haunts her. She is afraid of
people, and she suffers from ``flashbacks.'' Maria urged the
senators to help other young women ``so that they will not suffer
as we did in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tricked into coming here,'' she said. ``Please help
me. Please help us. Please do not let this happen to anyone else.''

   ECOM-COMPANY-VALUATION-NYTSF _ When Internet companies swap
advertising space on each other's Web sites, they generally record
the value of their benefit from the barter as if it is a sale.
Interesting, indeed. To the dismay of many stock-market veterans,

   ECOM-MONETIZING-EYEBALLS-NYTSF _ Once upon a time, the Internet
was a place where people offered information freely. Personal home
pages, chat rooms and bulletin boards drew millions seeking advice,
news or companionship. Then, of course, came e-commerce. Now
alongside commerce sites are content sites, in which a publisher

NORTH-SOUTH MEETING MAY GIVE GOVERNING PARTY ELECTORAL BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ For weeks this country saw nothing but
topsy-turvy maneuvering in preparation for mid-term parliamentary
elections on Thursday, which, for all of the pirouettes, seemed
destined to leave Kim Dae-jung a lame duck for the remaining three
years of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party lost its main coalition partner in a bitter
defection; a few days later, the leading opposition party
splintered. Meanwhile, civic groups, taking advantage of the
country's high Internet usage, began a cyberspace campaign against
politicians, mostly in the opposition, who they said were unfit for
office because of past corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But after the dramatic announcement Monday of a June summit
meeting between Kim and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, all
bets are off. For the first time in the campaign, political
analysts here say that Kim's party could win or, at the very least,
stave off a debilitating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the ruling party is reaping benefits from the
South-North summit and will be likely to emerge as a majority force
in the new parliament,'' said the newspaper Munhwa Ilbo.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than treat the planned summit meeting as a step toward
peace on this heavily militarized peninsula, the main opposition
party, the Grand National Party, has all but called the diplomacy a
dirty electoral trick. The latest opposition polls show that 67
percent of potential voters say the summit meeting announcement
will affect voters' choices, prompting the Grand National Party's
vice president, Kim Deong-ryong, to denounce the meeting as a
``diversion of public attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Kim's Millennium Democratic Party, meanwhile, have
steadfastly denied there are domestic political motivations behind
the summit meeting, and are already seeking to manage high public
expectations, particularly among families separated by the breakup
up of the country at the close of World War II. In a Cabinet
meeting Tuesday, Kim warned that the public should not expect
miracles overnight. But in the next breath, he repeated pledges
first made in Berlin last month to invest heavily in rehabilitating
North Korea's shattered economy if detente with the communist North
can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing by the governing party would strengthen Kim's
hand in promoting his so-called Sunshine Policy of engagement with
the North. And many people believe that the talk of increased
investment to rebuild the country's Cold War enemy was meant to
help win over South Korea's powerful business conglomerates, which
have traditionally supported the president's conservative
opponents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Korean political analysts have said for months that Kim's
indifferent popular support ranks as one of the country's biggest
political enigmas of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The president's biography is the stuff of political legend. As a
lifelong dissident and democracy advocate who was imprisoned and
tortured by former governments, he overcame long odds and finally
won the presidency in 1997, in the freest election the country has
known. Taking office during the worst regional economic crisis in
decades, Kim pushed through bold reforms, leading his country to a
bracing recovery _ including 10 percent growth last year and
sharply lower unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But until last week, opinion polls showed that voters were still
clinging to powerful currents of regionalism long at play in Korean
politics, painting Kim into a difficult corner, or were simply
indifferent to national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most post-war leaders, who came from the southeast or
close to the capital, Kim hails from the relatively poor Cholla
Province, in the southwest. And strong regional stereotypes that
have branded Cholla residents as clannish and abrasive strivers
have eroded his popularity. There has also been grumbling about the
emergence of an increasingly visible underclass amid booming
growth, and complaints that Kim's opening of the economy has given
too many opportunities to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sad fact for Kim, who has had tremendous successes in
economic reforms, but Korean voters behave like free riders,'' said
Moon Jung-in, a professor of political science at Yonsei
University. ``The Korean electorate is not mature yet, in that it
does not reward performance. People stick to regional
preferences.'' &QL;

CRUDE AWAKENING: TEXAS STOUT STANDS UP TO THE HEARTIEST GRUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wildcatter Crude, made by Yellow Rose Brewery in San Antonio, is
a fine stout with a hoppiness that's reminiscent of Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   It lacks the fullness and the complexity of Guinness, but it's
an exceptional brew worthy of your consideration and the $2 per
bottle price at your favorite retailer of brewed, distilled and
fermented beverages.
</P>
<P>
   It goes down smooth, but is sturdy enough to accompany very
strong food. And it was just the thing as we sat down to a meal
prepared by my visiting Great Uncle Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Brother's stay was not exactly planned. He ran out of bus
fare in Dallas while en route to Vegas and decided to lay over
until his ``gub-ment'' check arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, he's not really my uncle or my brother. Growing up as
the sole male child with six sisters, he became known simply as
``Brother.'' Of course, to his sisters' children and grandchildren
he became known as Uncle Brother and then Great Uncle Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Brother is my mother's cousin, which makes him my
Second Cousin Great Uncle Brother, but then it really gets
complicated, since he also was briefly married to my father's
cousin's half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   He also smells a little peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   That might come from the mainstay in his diet. It's something he
calls ``Brother's Famous Sardine and Tater Tot Hash.'' The word
``famous'' was a recent addition designed to impress Lurine, a bar
hostess he is wooing at Red's Levee Lounge back home in Bunkie, La.
</P>
<P>
   So anyway, despite repeated protests that we had already eaten,
Brother insisted on whipping up a batch of hash.
</P>
<P>
   This sent us looking for a beverage, and we figured something
``Crude'' was just the thing to wash down Brother's hash.
</P>
<P>
   The hoppy aroma flooded my mouth just as Brother dumped two cans
of sardines and their oil into a cast-iron frying pan. He added a
chopped-up onion, a couple of handfuls of frozen tater tots and a
couple of jalapenos. You fry it 20 minutes and eat. Brother says it
tastes even better the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, food like this calls for an assertive brew, and
Wildcatter does the job.
</P>
<P>
   Brother, whose beer of choice is Schaeffers, said Wildcatter was
good, but he's afraid that at $2 a bottle he'd have little cash
left with which to woo Lurine.
</P>
<P>
   Brother gives it a 3. I give it a solid 4.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Rose Brewery also makes Bubba Dog Wheat, Cactus Queen
IPA, Honcho Grande brown ale, Vigilante Beer and Yellow Rose Pale
Ale.

 &HT;    Editor's note: In late 1997, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
went to court to gain access to the Georgia Division of Family and
Children Services records of children who had died after their
families were reported to the state for abuse or neglect. The state
turned over the files of 844 children who had died between 1993 and
1998. From those files, reporter Jane O. Hansen published special
reports that led the Georgia General Assembly and governor to take
action to protect such children. This story looks at one of the
most severe cases.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Did 5-year-old Terrell have to die?
 &HT;    Georgia's child protection system failed him _ and then covered
up the truth.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jane O. Hansen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Fulton County district attorney called it ``one of
the most horrific cases of child abuse ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   When 5-year-old Terrell Peterson was pronounced dead in 1998 at
a metro Atlanta hospital, doctors found his thin, frail body
battered and bruised, scarred and malnourished. Death may have come
from a blow to the head.
</P>
<P>
   It was the brutal end to the harsh life of a child, who, at
least as a baby, was described as always laughing, getting into
everything and loving to blow spit bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's grandmother and aunt and the aunt's boyfriend have
been charged with killing him. The two women could face the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another story, an untold story. And the public was
barred from hearing it, just as the public is prevented from
knowing how hundreds of other children have died after coming to
the attention of the child protection system.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, and throughout the country, details about child
protection and what happens to children like Terrell are guarded
with a level of secrecy generally reserved for matters of national
security. Confidentiality laws, designed to encourage citizens to
report child abuse, also serve to shield child protection agencies
from public scrutiny and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting the state failed in its role to protect Terrell,
Georgia's governor recently signed four bills designed to aid
children at risk from abuse or neglect. One bill named after
Terrell gives doctors the authority to take temporary custody of
children they believe are in imminent danger from abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated incidents of abuse
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's accused killers were not the only players in the
child's short life. In response to recurring signs of neglect and
abuse, dozens of government, hospital and criminal justice workers
drifted in and out of his world. But their actions have been kept
secret in records that only became public in response to a court
petition filed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The records tell a story of torture and death that might have
been prevented at a number of points:
</P>
<P>
   _ They chronicle sloppy investigations by the Fulton County
Department of Family and Children Services into seven complaints
that Terrell and his two siblings were victims of neglect and
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   _ They indicate that hospital personnel did not alert child
protection workers when the boy was hospitalized for third-degree
burns.
</P>
<P>
   _ They show that Terrell told authorities his grandmother beat
him a year before he died, but a judge dismissed criminal charges
against her when no one brought the child to court.
</P>
<P>
   _ And in the end, they reveal a government agency whose highest
officials told the public they had done everything possible to save
Terrell, despite two state internal investigations that had found
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Goldberg, a former spokeswoman for the Georgia Division of
Family and Children Services, defends the child welfare agency,
saying the state gives first-rate care to the vast majority of
children needing its help. But she said cases like Terrell's hurt
the agency's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens, your readers might readily
jump to the conclusion that all cases are handled this way, and
then covered up,'' said Goldberg, now director of communications
for Georgia's new Department of Community Health. ``And I don't
think that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the story is Terrell, a bright little boy with
a full head of dark, curly hair. ``Bad and sweet,'' his mother once
called him, before she reportedly abandoned him for a life of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's life was steeped in drugs. He was born in 1992 with
cocaine in his blood. His mother was said to have been addicted to
crack.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times between 1991 and 1995, state records show, people
called the Fulton County Department of Family and Children Services
to report apparent neglect of Terrell or his siblings, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The mother took drugs while pregnant, used food stamps and
welfare checks to buy crack, one caller reported in May 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The parents are locked the children in the bedroom on weekends,
denied them food and water, another reported in August 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mother on drugs, children are unsupervised (February 1994).
</P>
<P>
   _ Children begged neighbors for food, mother used cocaine daily
(January 1995).
</P>
<P>
   _ Mother is addicted to crack, left children with their sickly
maternal grandmother (November 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Despite these reports, the children remained at home with their
mother. Under the privacy laws that protect child abuse records,
not even the people who called in the complaints were allowed to
know what the child welfare agency was doing in response.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much, according to a subsequent internal investigation
by the state. Throughout the family's involvement with the Fulton
child welfare agency, 11 caseworkers, overseen by 10 supervisors,
handled the complaints. The investigation found that many
caseworkers violated internal guidelines for investigating abuse
and neglect reports.
</P>
<P>
   No one, for instance, required drug tests for the parents, even
though drugs were at the core of the complaints. They never checked
criminal histories, even though they had reason to believe there
was one. Some caseworkers never saw or interviewed the children,
even though Terrell and his siblings were old enough to talk. They
often failed to get pertinent medical records and they seldom
checked with others who may have witnessed the children's plight.
</P>
<P>
   However, by June 1996, in response to the ongoing complaints,
the child welfare agency pressured the mother to sign over
guardianship of the children to their paternal grandmother, Pharina
Peterson, then 48.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's case fell through the cracks
</P>
<P>
   No one knows precisely, but events suggest Terrell became the
object of physical abuse within six months of going to live with
his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1996, an eighth complaint came into the Fulton
Department of Family and Children Services, this time involving
physical abuse rather than neglect. Police and medical records show
that several days earlier, on Thanksgiving Day, an ambulance had
brought 4-year-old Terrell to the hospital after his mother said
she found him covered with bruises. The child had been staying with
her for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the case say what happened next may have
offered the best chance to make a difference in Terrell's life, but
instead became a missed opportunity. When he came into the
hospital, Atlanta police investigator A.C. Booker was dispatched to
the emergency room, where a doctor told her the child was a victim
of long-term physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I looked at little Terrell's body, most of his injuries was
old,'' the investigator wrote. ``However, he had marks, scars and
lacerations about his body. His injuries included: right forehead
and ear badly scarred, mark pattern, buttocks swollen and tender
(reddish), lower back marked and left forearm.''
</P>
<P>
   The child told Booker that his grandmother, Peterson, had beaten
him with a belt and sometimes with a shoe. He said he received the
latest beating ``because he urinated in his clothes,'' the police
report states.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor also noted the extent of Terrell's fresh and old
injuries and diagnosed him with ``battered child syndrome.'' ``The
patient (Terrell Peterson) said that his paternal grandmother ('my
grandmother') did it,'' the physician's notes state. When the
doctor asked how, the little boy answered his grandmother had hit
him with a ``white shoe and two belts,'' and he held up two fingers
to show what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Atlanta police charged Pharina Peterson with
reckless conduct, a misdemeanor, for the beating of her grandson.
She was ordered to appear in Atlanta Municipal Court the following
week to face the charge. After photographing the child's injuries,
police released Terrell to his mother with instructions that she
should not return him to his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   But again Terrell's case fell through the cracks, this time in
an Atlanta courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The state's investigation found that the Fulton County child
protective services worker failed to show up at Peterson's court
hearing, and on Dec. 10, Judge Catherine Malicki dismissed the
charge. The reason, as stamped in bold black letters on the arrest
citation: ``Victim not in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the judge nor the prosecutor remembers the case, and
court transcripts from that year have been thrown out. But the
solicitor assigned to prosecute Peterson said it appears no one
else involved in Terrell's case was in the courtroom that day.
``DFACS should have had the kid in court,'' said Darrell Kimbrell,
the former assistant solicitor. ``Or someone from DFACS should have
been in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the case say whatever happened in court,
there was an obvious breakdown in communication. ``That was one of
the most depressing cases I ever saw,'' said Suzanne Ockleberry, a
former prosecutor. ``Because I think if someone had intervened that
child still would be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Records indicate Terrell was back with his grandmother the day
after her arrest, and the child welfare agency closed its case once
the criminal charge was dropped. Peterson had told the caseworker
she did not abuse Terrell and that his injuries were ``from him
falling, fighting at school, etc.'' The state's subsequent
investigation found that the caseworker never got the police
report, never interviewed Terrell or his siblings, never talked to
the doctor, never requested medical records, never spoke to
Terrell's Head Start teacher to verify whether the child fell or
fought a lot in school. She instead took the grandmother's word for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks later, on Dec. 28, Terrell was back in
Hughes Spalding hospital _ this time with an infected third-degree
burn to his left foot that one expert says should have raised
immediate suspicion. Peterson told doctors Terrell had burned his
feet the week before by standing on a space heater grate. She said
she had been treating the burns herself, but his left foot had
become infected, medical records show. Terrell was admitted to the
hospital and a few days later had to have a skin graft from his
hip. But this time, there is no record that anyone from the
hospital reported the incident to the child welfare agency.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the burn was not consistent with Peterson's
explanation, and doctors should have raised questions about how it
occurred, said Dr. Randell Alexander, director of the Center for
Child Abuse at Morehouse School of Medicine. ``I have a problem
with that story,'' Alexander said. ``If it's going to be hot,
you're going to jump off it as fast as you can. A 4-year-old is
going to get off it.''
</P>
<P>
   One year later, on the evening of Jan. 15, 1998, Terrell
Peterson arrived at Hughes Spalding hospital in cardiac arrest. He
was pronounced dead at 10:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's daughter, 29-year-old Terri Lynn Peterson, told
police she had been feeding her nephew at 9 p.m. when the child
told her he was tired and stopped breathing. She could not explain
the abrasions, bruises and fresh blood on the child.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy the next morning showed Terrell had died from abuse
suffered over a long period of time. Near-starvation had shrunk the
5-year-old to 29 pounds. After his death, the child welfare agency
received reports that the boy had at times been force-fed and
dunked head-first into a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner said it wasn't clear what finally killed
Terrell. He may have starved to death. It may have been a blow to
the head or several blows to the head. It may have been a
combination of all that had been inflicted upon him. Peterson, her
daughter and her daughter's boyfriend Calvin Pittman have been
charged with murder and their trials are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative action in Georgia
</P>
<P>
   Since the initial story of Terrell's short life was published in
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a state civil lawsuit has been
filed on Terrell's behalf, seeking independent oversight of DFACS,
a separate lawsuit seeks a federal takeover of DFACS and Gov. Roy
Barnes named a new head of DFACS and said he would seek an
independent children's advocate office to investigate and intervene
in DFACS cases.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a dirt road in Randolph County, 170 miles south of
Atlanta, Terrell Peterson's body lies in a small country cemetery.
Two old potted plants are toppled over near an oak tree that hangs
over a small patch of red clay. They are the remnants of tributes
paid to those buried in the Mitchell Grove Baptist Church cemetery
in Cuthbert.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no visitors to Terrell's grave, no mourners to
mark his passing, says Susie Crowell, a member of the church who
knows Terrell's kinfolk.
</P>
<P>
   He's buried in the family plot near the grave of Thomas
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   She says Terrell was buried in a hurry one day by some people
who came down from Atlanta. The deacon happened to come upon them
as they laid him in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just dug a hole and buried him,'' Crowell says.

(Eds: with Matzo recipes 1 and 2) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During Passover, the Festival of Freedom or of Unleavened Bread,
which begins at sundown April 19, Jews eat matzo to remind them of
the exodus of the ancient Hebrews from slavery in Egypt. The
crackerlike matzo is unleavened and replaces bread because, as the
Jews fled in great haste, there was no time to let the bread rise.
In addition to leavened bread, flour, grains, yeast and baking
powder are also forbidden during the eight-day celebration.
</P>
<P>
   So matzo _ in flat sheets, crumbled into pieces or ground up
into matzo meal or matzo cake meal _ has become the base of many
innovative Passover creations _ from appetizers and entrees to
desserts. Many traditional foods based on matzos are served during
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to eat matzos,'' notes Susan Friedland, author of
five cookbooks, including ``The Passover Table'' (HarperPerennial)
and the recently released ``Shabbat Shalom'' (Little, Brown ), ``is
slathered with lots of softened butter and sprinkled with salt.''
But beyond that, she also enjoys them in Matzo Brei, Matzo Meat or
Chicken Pie, Spinach Pie, Matzo Meal Pancakes and more _ all
included in her Passover volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be locked into convention,'' writes Friedland, director
of cookbook publishing and executive editor at HarperCollins in New
York. Light main courses such as Matzo Meal Pancakes and Matzo Brei
are good for breakfast, lunch or dinner with an accompaniment such
as fruit or a salad.
</P>
<P>
   She also suggests whipping up a Matzo Meat Pie by layering
cooked onions and ground beef combined with minced dill, parsley
and seasonings between layers of whole matzos that have been soaked
in warm water and eggs. More beaten eggs are poured over the top.
With baking, a rich brown crust forms and the pie is then cut into
wedges to serve. Another possibility is a baked Spinach Pie _ a
combination of spinach, green onions, matzo meal, fresh dill, eggs
and lemon juice. Serve warm for a light lunch or supper _ or as an
accompaniment to a roast. Friedland's savory Chicken Matzo Pie, a
recipe she learned as an adult, is a beauty to behold with layers
of whole matzos.
</P>
<P>
   Friedland also uses matzo meal in several kugel variations
including Matzo and Cheese Kugel, Matzo Farfel and Apple Kugel, and
Carrot and Apple Kugel. The last version combines grated carrots
and apples, nutmeg, grated lemon peel, matzo meal and slivered
almonds.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget those all-time classic matzo balls served in
chicken soup. ``The best recipe is the one printed on the box of
matzo meal,'' recommends Friedland.
</P>
<P>
   Matzo Brie has only two basic ingredients _ matzos and eggs, but
there are numerous variations on the theme, depending on the cook.
``The first variant,'' writes Friedland, ``is the proportion of egg
to matzo; the second is the style of cooking: pancake style,
souffle style or scrambled-egg style. The third variant is the
texture of the matzo. Should it remain crisp or should it be
soggy?''
</P>
<P>
   This is dependent on the soaking technique. ``Some people merely
pass the matzo under cold water; others soak it in boiling water
for three or four minutes. Try them all, then decide which way you
like best,'' she advises.
</P>
<P>
   For some quicker ideas when forgoing bread, matzos are also good
topped or sandwiched with tuna fish _ to make a tuna sandwich of
sorts. Or for breakfast or lunch, top matzos with cheese and pop
into the microwave or toaster oven just until cheese is melted.
</P>
<P>
   Kids favor matzos with bologna and mayonnaise sandwiched in
between _ or even peanut butter. Or try matzos spread with butter
and topped with a sprinkling of granulated sugar. Some even crush
up whole matzos to use as a cheesecake crust.
</P>
<P>
   For Marcy Goldman, author of ``A Treasury of Jewish Holiday
Baking'' (Doubleday), Caramel Matzo Crunch has earned the top spot
as her favorite matzo recipe. It's a take-off of the original
recipe version made with soda crackers. She substitutes matzos for
an outstanding, easy and unique confection. ``If you make only one
thing at Passover, make this,'' she writes in her book.
</P>
<P>
   Since flour is banned, several Passover desserts _ including
cakes and cookies _ also rely on matzo products including matzo
cake meal, matzo meal and matzo farfel cake meal.
</P>
<P>
   Matzo has many moods, a few of which are showcased in today's
recipe roundup.

 &HT;    Editor's note: In late 1997, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
went to court to gain access to the Georgia Division of Family and
Children Services records of children who had died after their
families were reported to the state for abuse or neglect. The state
turned over the files of 844 children who had died between 1993 and
1998. From those files, reporter Jane O. Hansen published special
reports that led the Georgia General Assembly and governor to take
action to protect such children. This story looks at one of the
most severe cases.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Did 5-year-old Terrell have to die?
 &HT;    Georgia's child protection system failed him _ and then covered
up the truth.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Fulton County district attorney called it ``one of
the most horrific cases of child abuse ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   When 5-year-old Terrell Peterson was pronounced dead in 1998 at
a metro Atlanta hospital, doctors found his thin, frail body
battered and bruised, scarred and malnourished. Death may have come
from a blow to the head.
</P>
<P>
   It was the brutal end to the harsh life of a child, who, at
least as a baby, was described as always laughing, getting into
everything and loving to blow spit bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's grandmother and aunt and the aunt's boyfriend have
been charged with killing him. The two women could face the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another story, an untold story. And the public was
barred from hearing it, just as the public is prevented from
knowing how hundreds of other children have died after coming to
the attention of the child protection system.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, and throughout the country, details about child
protection and what happens to children like Terrell are guarded
with a level of secrecy generally reserved for matters of national
security. Confidentiality laws, designed to encourage citizens to
report child abuse, also serve to shield child protection agencies
from public scrutiny and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting the state failed in its role to protect Terrell,
Georgia's governor recently signed four bills designed to aid
children at risk from abuse or neglect. One bill named after
Terrell gives doctors the authority to take temporary custody of
children they believe are in imminent danger from abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated incidents of abuse
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's accused killers were not the only players in the
child's short life. In response to recurring signs of neglect and
abuse, dozens of government, hospital and criminal justice workers
drifted in and out of his world. But their actions have been kept
secret in records that only became public in response to a court
petition filed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The records tell a story of torture and death that might have
been prevented at a number of points:
</P>
<P>
   _ They chronicle sloppy investigations by the Fulton County
Department of Family and Children Services into seven complaints
that Terrell and his two siblings were victims of neglect and
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   _ They indicate that hospital personnel did not alert child
protection workers when the boy was hospitalized for third-degree
burns.
</P>
<P>
   _ They show that Terrell told authorities his grandmother beat
him a year before he died, but a judge dismissed criminal charges
against her when no one brought the child to court.
</P>
<P>
   _ And in the end, they reveal a government agency whose highest
officials told the public they had done everything possible to save
Terrell, despite two state internal investigations that had found
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Goldberg, a former spokeswoman for the Georgia Division of
Family and Children Services, defends the child welfare agency,
saying the state gives first-rate care to the vast majority of
children needing its help. But she said cases like Terrell's hurt
the agency's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens, your readers might readily
jump to the conclusion that all cases are handled this way, and
then covered up,'' said Goldberg, now director of communications
for Georgia's new Department of Community Health. ``And I don't
think that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the story is Terrell, a bright little boy with
a full head of dark, curly hair. ``Bad and sweet,'' his mother once
called him, before she reportedly abandoned him for a life of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's life was steeped in drugs. He was born in 1992 with
cocaine in his blood. His mother was said to have been addicted to
crack.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times between 1991 and 1995, state records show, people
called the Fulton County Department of Family and Children Services
to report apparent neglect of Terrell or his siblings, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The mother took drugs while pregnant, used food stamps and
welfare checks to buy crack, one caller reported in May 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The parents are locked the children in the bedroom on weekends,
denied them food and water, another reported in August 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mother on drugs, children are unsupervised (February 1994).
</P>
<P>
   _ Children begged neighbors for food, mother used cocaine daily
(January 1995).
</P>
<P>
   _ Mother is addicted to crack, left children with their sickly
maternal grandmother (November 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Despite these reports, the children remained at home with their
mother. Under the privacy laws that protect child abuse records,
not even the people who called in the complaints were allowed to
know what the child welfare agency was doing in response.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much, according to a subsequent internal investigation
by the state. Throughout the family's involvement with the Fulton
child welfare agency, 11 caseworkers, overseen by 10 supervisors,
handled the complaints. The investigation found that many
caseworkers violated internal guidelines for investigating abuse
and neglect reports.
</P>
<P>
   No one, for instance, required drug tests for the parents, even
though drugs were at the core of the complaints. They never checked
criminal histories, even though they had reason to believe there
was one. Some caseworkers never saw or interviewed the children,
even though Terrell and his siblings were old enough to talk. They
often failed to get pertinent medical records and they seldom
checked with others who may have witnessed the children's plight.
</P>
<P>
   However, by June 1996, in response to the ongoing complaints,
the child welfare agency pressured the mother to sign over
guardianship of the children to their paternal grandmother, Pharina
Peterson, then 48.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's case fell through the cracks
</P>
<P>
   No one knows precisely, but events suggest Terrell became the
object of physical abuse within six months of going to live with
his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1996, an eighth complaint came into the Fulton
Department of Family and Children Services, this time involving
physical abuse rather than neglect. Police and medical records show
that several days earlier, on Thanksgiving Day, an ambulance had
brought 4-year-old Terrell to the hospital after his mother said
she found him covered with bruises. The child had been staying with
her for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the case say what happened next may have
offered the best chance to make a difference in Terrell's life, but
instead became a missed opportunity. When he came into the
hospital, Atlanta police investigator A.C. Booker was dispatched to
the emergency room, where a doctor told her the child was a victim
of long-term physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I looked at little Terrell's body, most of his injuries was
old,'' the investigator wrote. ``However, he had marks, scars and
lacerations about his body. His injuries included: right forehead
and ear badly scarred, mark pattern, buttocks swollen and tender
(reddish), lower back marked and left forearm.''
</P>
<P>
   The child told Booker that his grandmother, Peterson, had beaten
him with a belt and sometimes with a shoe. He said he received the
latest beating ``because he urinated in his clothes,'' the police
report states.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor also noted the extent of Terrell's fresh and old

reckless conduct, a misdemeanor, for the beating of her grandson.
She was ordered to appear in Atlanta Municipal Court the following

police released Terrell to his mother with instructions that she
should not return him to his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   But again Terrell's case fell through the cracks, this time in
an Atlanta courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The state's investigation found that the Fulton County child
protective services worker failed to show up at Peterson's court
hearing, and on Dec. 10, Judge Catherine Malicki dismissed the
charge. The reason, as stamped in bold black letters on the arrest
citation: ``Victim not in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the judge nor the prosecutor remembers the case, and
court transcripts from that year have been thrown out. But the
solicitor assigned to prosecute Peterson said it appears no one
else involved in Terrell's case was in the courtroom that day.
``DFACS should have had the kid in court,'' said Darrell Kimbrell,
the former assistant solicitor. ``Or someone from DFACS should have

there was an obvious breakdown in communication. ``That was one of
the most depressing cases I ever saw,'' said Suzanne Ockleberry, a
former prosecutor. ``Because I think if someone had intervened that

</P>
<P>
   Records indicate Terrell was back with his grandmother the day
after her arrest, and the child welfare agency closed its case once
the criminal charge was dropped. Peterson had told the caseworker
she did not abuse Terrell and that his injuries were ``from him
falling, fighting at school, etc.'' The state's subsequent
investigation found that the caseworker never got the police
report, never interviewed Terrell or his siblings, never talked to
the doctor, never requested medical records, never spoke to
Terrell's Head Start teacher to verify whether the child fell or
fought a lot in school. She instead took the grandmother's word for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks later, on Dec. 28, Terrell was back in
Hughes Spalding hospital _ this time with an infected third-degree
burn to his left foot that one expert says should have raised
immediate suspicion. Peterson told doctors Terrell had burned his
feet the week before by standing on a space heater grate. She said
she had been treating the burns herself, but his left foot had
become infected, medical records show. Terrell was admitted to the
hospital and a few days later had to have a skin graft from his
hip. But this time, there is no record that anyone from the
hospital reported the incident to the child welfare agency.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the burn was not consistent with Peterson's
explanation, and doctors should have raised questions about how it
occurred, said Dr. Randell Alexander, director of the Center for
Child Abuse at Morehouse School of Medicine. ``I have a problem
with that story,'' Alexander said. ``If it's going to be hot,
you're going to jump off it as fast as you can. A 4-year-old is
going to get off it.''
</P>
<P>
   One year later, on the evening of Jan. 15, 1998, Terrell
Peterson arrived at Hughes Spalding hospital in cardiac arrest. He
was pronounced dead at 10:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's daughter, 29-year-old Terri Lynn Peterson, told
police she had been feeding her nephew at 9 p.m. when the child
told her he was tired and stopped breathing. She could not explain
the abrasions, bruises and fresh blood on the child.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy the next morning showed Terrell had died from abuse
suffered over a long period of time. Near-starvation had shrunk the
5-year-old to 29 pounds. After his death, the child welfare agency
received reports that the boy had at times been force-fed and
dunked head-first into a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner said it wasn't clear what finally killed
Terrell. He may have starved to death. It may have been a blow to
the head or several blows to the head. It may have been a
combination of all that had been inflicted upon him. Peterson, her
daughter and her daughter's boyfriend Calvin Pittman have been
charged with murder and their trials are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative action in Georgia
</P>
<P>
   Since the initial story of Terrell's short life was published in
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a state civil lawsuit has been
filed on Terrell's behalf, seeking independent oversight of DFACS,
a separate lawsuit seeks a federal takeover of DFACS and Gov. Roy
Barnes named a new head of DFACS and said he would seek an
independent children's advocate office to investigate and intervene
in DFACS cases.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a dirt road in Randolph County, 170 miles south of
Atlanta, Terrell Peterson's body lies in a small country cemetery.
Two old potted plants are toppled over near an oak tree that hangs
over a small patch of red clay. They are the remnants of tributes
paid to those buried in the Mitchell Grove Baptist Church cemetery
in Cuthbert.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no visitors to Terrell's grave, no mourners to
mark his passing, says Susie Crowell, a member of the church who
knows Terrell's kinfolk.
</P>
<P>
   He's buried in the family plot near the grave of Thomas
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   She says Terrell was buried in a hurry one day by some people
who came down from Atlanta. The deacon happened to come upon them
as they laid him in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just dug a hole and buried him,'' Crowell says.

   State ombudsmen for child protection
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states as well as New York City and Cook County, Ill.,
have ombudsman's offices whose primary function is to monitor state
child welfare agencies; about half operate outside and independent
of those agencies. Staffing ranges from one employee in New Mexico
and Wyoming to 175 in Cook County. A look at the 21 offices:

   MATZO BREI &QL; 
3 matzos &QL; 
Water &QL; 
4 eggs &QL; 
Salt &QL; 
3 tablespoons butter &QL; 
Jam, sour cream, sugar OR cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Break matzos in half and then in half again. Soak in hot water 1
to 2 minutes. Remove and, with your hands, squeeze out as much
water as you can.
</P>
<P>
   Beat eggs lightly with salt in a mixing bowl. Add matzos and
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Heat butter in a heavy skillet and, when it starts to turn
brown, add eggs and matzos. Either leave mixture to set on bottom
and then turn as you would a pancake, or stir mixture with a wooden
spoon as you would scrambled eggs. By either method, matzo brei
will be done within 5 minutes, depending on how well-done you like
your eggs. Serve immediately with jam and/or sour cream, sugar or
cinnamon. Makes 2 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: To make souffle-like matzo brei, separate eggs. Beat yolks
until thick and pale in color. Add matzos to yolks. Beat whites
until stiff and gently fold into yolk-matzo mixture. Cook in butter
as for pancake variation.

TWINS ARE LOVABLE LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They are members of baseball's longest-running comedy
series. It's been seven years of laughs for the Midwestern comedy
troupe known as the Minnesota Twins. In this, their eighth season,
not much has changed. Their show is just as bad now as it was in
1993, when they introduced fans to their strange, no-win humor.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins visited Fenway Park Tuesday for a 1 p.m. matinee. As
usual, they were awful. It's part of the act. They lost to the Red
Sox, 13-4. They will end this season with at least 91 losses, which
has been their average since '93 in nonstrike seasons. The only
pathetic goal they haven't reached since then is the magical
100-loss level. But there's always next year.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're wondering how an outfit this bad can survive. I'll
tell you how: Quirks. The Twins and their entourage are loaded with
them. And as the Jerrys, Rickis, Judge Joe Browns, Judge Judys,
Larry Kings, and Vince McMahons can attest, America loves quirks.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins have the lowest payroll in baseball ($16.5 million)
but still have a chief financial officer. That's like being the
money manager for a peso account. You think sportswriting is easy?
I want (itals)that(unitals) guy's job.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of sportswriting, that's another interesting thing
about the state and its baseball team. If you are a baseball fan in
Boston, you are familiar with two people who work in Minnesota:
Brad Radke and LaVelle E. Neal III. Radke is the pitcher whom the
Sox should acquire. If they do that in exchange for minor league
talent, you won't have to worry about any Boston curses; the Sox
will win the World Series. And when that happens, the only
reference to lingering curses will be in Neal's briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   Neal is the Minneapolis Star-Tribune writer who left Pedro
Martinez off his 1999 MVP ballot. Shortly after this information
became public, Neal discovered that ``You've Got Mail'' is an
understatement. He received more than 400 e-mails, most of them
from Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   One guy cursed Neal in Spanish and English, then requested a
phone call (he left his number) so he could tell the writer a few
more things. Another Sox fan at the University of Texas left an
e-mail with a subtle subject heading: ``You are a bastard.'' That
was the nice part. Another fan sent a six-page message that
contained one word. Loser. Except it was in block letters and
appeared like this: LOSERLOSERLOSERLOSER. For six pages.
</P>
<P>
   So, has Neal changed his mind about pitchers being eligible for
MVP?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, sifting through the weighty pile of mail.
Before doing that, Neal volunteered to compile the records of all
the teams he has covered. In six seasons, he has watched the Twins
and Kansas City Royals. The total record is 348 wins, 449 losses,
and a tie. Which means the man has watched a lot of bad baseball.
Neal hasn't spoken with Martinez yet, but says he will.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the strange Twins tale doesn't stop there. The team's
starter Tuesday was a kid named Joe Mays. It took him only 45
pitches to give up eight runs, five of them earned. He walked four
Sox, didn't strike out anyone and lasted 1 1/3 innings. It was a
classic early- to mid-1990s Twins performance.
</P>
<P>
   Awful.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Tom Kelly watched the game, retreated to his office, and
then said, ``We try to play baseball, and it wasn't a game today.''
He repeated his words and added, ``It was a terrible event. It
wasn't fun for anybody. It wasn't a game, and for that we
apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly has managed the Twins since 1986. He has won two World
Series titles. He is an interesting man, the kind of character that
you'd expect to leap off the page in a Kafka novel. (Perhaps ``The
Metamorphosis'' would be appropriate: He has seen a great team
become a non-team.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was asked if all this terrible, low-budget losing gets on
his nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't be here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly then shakes hands. Says it's nice to meet you. He walks
off and prepares for another day in which he will be asked to go to
a big league war armed with a collection of minor leaguers. You
think I'm saying that in a mean-spirited way? Meet Twins right
fielder Matt Lawton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of players better than myself stuck in Triple
A,'' Lawton said after going 2 for 5. ``The Yankees have a lot of
guys who could be in the big leagues. Maybe if I didn't play here,
I wouldn't be good enough to play on someone else's team.''
</P>
<P>
   There are double takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton is listed at 5 feet 10 inches, but he appears to be about
5-7. He also has a Martinez connection. That is, Pedro is not a fan
of his. Two years ago, Lawton tried to disrupt Martinez's rhythm by
continually stepping out of the batter's box when Martinez was
ready to deliver. So Pedro drilled him. Tuesday, Lawton extended
the rivalry by taking a swipe at Sox starter Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he was overpowering by any means,'' Lawton
said. ``I hope he stays in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another day, another odd Twins show. If Fenway had Dolby
Surround Sound speakers and cushioned seats, you'd swear that the
Twins were character actors in a laughably bad movie. But there's
something lovable about them. I'm sure the Sox and their fans will
agree with me on this: I wish the Twins could visit town more
often.

MY TRADEMARK, MOST REQUESTED &QL; 
ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT &QL; 
CARAMEL MATZO CRUNCH
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 unsalted matzos &QL; 
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter OR unsalted Passover margarine &QL; 
1 cup packed brown sugar &QL; 
3/4 cup coarsely chopped semisweet chocolate chips OR semisweet
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Line a large (or 2 smaller) cookie sheet(s) completely with
foil. Cover bottom of sheet with baking parchment _ on top of foil.
This is very important since mixture becomes sticky during backing.
</P>
<P>
   Line bottom of cookie sheet evenly with matzos, cutting extra
pieces, as required, to fit any spaces.
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine butter and brown
sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture
comes to a boil, (about 2 to 4 minutes). Boil 3 minutes, stirring
constantly. Remove from heat and pour over matzos, covering
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Place cookie sheet in preheated 375-degree oven and immediately
reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake 15 minutes, checking
every few minutes to make sure mixture is not burning (if it seems
to be browning too quickly, remove pan from oven from oven, reduce
temperature to 325 degrees F and replace pan).
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven and sprinkle immediately with chocolate. Let
stand 5 minutes, then spread melted chocolate over matzos. While
still warm, break into squares or odd shapes. Chill, still in pan,
in freezer until set.
</P>
<P>
   VARIATION: You can also use coarsely chopped white chocolate (or
a combination of white and dark) and chopped or slivered toasted
almonds (sprinkled on top as chocolate sets). You can also omit
chocolate for a caramel-alone buttercrunch.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I met with a financial planner but decided I want to take
control of my own financial situation. I would like your opinion on
my strategies on my 401(k), Roth IRA, Oracle stock, mutual fund
accounts, and mortgage payments. Should I change my 401(k)
allocation, which is 25 percent to each fund? Is Vanguard Index 500
the best IRA investment? Should I continue buying Oracle stock each
month? Do you like my choice of taxable funds? What should I buy
next? I'm considering Vanguard Small-Cap Index. Should I make extra
payments on the mortgage or continue to build the mutual fund
accounts? My overall goal, putting the Oracle holding aside, is a
total portfolio with 50 percent in large-cap stocks, 20 percent in
small-cap funds, and 10 percent each in mid-cap, international, and
health care funds.
</P>
<P>
   S.A., Beaverton, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What can I say? By my lights, you have done it almost
perfectly. I like your target allocation, but I'd also move a few
things around.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you want the holding with the largest potential
gain in your Roth account, where all of it will eventually come to
you tax-free. For that reason, although it will bring you a tax
bill, I'd sell Vanguard Index 500 in the Roth IRA and buy Vanguard
Health Care for the Roth. Then I'd sell a like amount of Health
Care in the taxable account and buy Index 500. If you find the tax
consequences of that move too onerous, or if you are unwilling to
pay the redemption fee charged by the Heath Care fund, you could at
least target future contributions to the Roth IRA to Health Care,
and further contributions of the taxable account to Index 500.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you are seeking another small-cap position, I'd
allocate some of the 401(k) contributions to Fidelity Low-Priced
Stock and Fidelity OTC rather than going with Vanguard Small-Cap
Index. Although I do frequently recommend Vanguard Small-Cap Index
fund, it's usually for people who want to stay within Vanguard or
who prefer index funds. Although the Vanguard fund tracks its peer
group nicely, my gut feeling is that the small-cap universe is a
place where index funds might be at a disadvantage, compared to
well-managed competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Oracle stock, the position now represents about 39
percent of your portfolio, not counting the emergency savings
account. That's a fairly heady level, and I don't suggest that you
go much beyond that. But since you specify (in an edited part of
the letter) that you buy the shares at a 15 percent discount from
market price, I would continue buying new shares, selling older
positions as required to keep the position from exceeding 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Following the same reasoning as I suggested with the Roth IRA,
you would probably be better off, taxwise, to move some of your
401(k) money to more aggressive holdings and to balance that by
buying more cautious (and more tax-efficient) funds for your
taxable accounts. In this case, it's probably not worth making any
sales, but for future contributions, for example, you might buy
shares of Fidelity Equity Income fund in a taxable account instead
of buying additional shares of Strong Growth fund. You could then
buy a corresponding value of shares in Fidelity Growth company in
the 401(k), diverting the money for those purchases from the
Fidelity Equity-Income account there.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, your mortgage looks attractive at a 7.75 percent fixed
rate. Given your youth and the excellent long-term prospects of
your growing portfolio, I would favor continuing to build your
taxable fund accounts, rather than prepaying the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a small hardware store and am thinking of retiring. I
wonder if you can see ways to improve my investments. I have
written to Vanguard about its Capital Opportunities fund, which has
a $25,000 minimum. Is this priced too high? Is it too close to
Alliance Technology fund, which I hold in my taxable portfolio? Do
I have too much stock for safety? What would my projected income
be, the way you see it?
</P>
<P>
   L.R., Jasper, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. I calculate a whisker more than 57 percent of your
investments on the fixed-income side, which is perhaps a little
less than many would prefer, but on the other hand not particularly
drastic. I think the question of how _ or whether _ to change your
portfolio lies more with your needs than with the portfolio
breakdown. I estimate that you would have an income of nearly
$40,000 _ $39,963 to be precise _ if you made no changes.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate was based on an assumption of an average 6 percent
yield from your fixed-income holdings and annuities, and a 1.5
percent yield from your stock and fund accounts.
</P>
<P>
   My approach to the portfolio: start with the likely proceeds
from the sale of your business, and the put that amount to one side
in your mind. Then calculate what you would like to have as income
in retirement. Let's say the figure is $50,000 a year. You could
then calculate that you would need to have about $155,000 in a
fixed-income investment to provide a $10,000 annual income stream
(here using a 6.5 percent projected yield). You could then move
$155,000 of the money from the sale of the business, or both from
that pool and the equities portfolio, to a fixed-income investment
such as a good GNMA fund, and you'd have the desired income stream.
</P>
<P>
   The problem would come either if the proceeds from the sale of
your business were small or if your required income stream is very
large. You now have $293,844 in equities _ a handsome enough sum.
But if you were to move a very significant part of that amount to
the fixed-income side, you would be in danger of not providing
yourself with the overall portfolio growth that you will need to
protect yourself against inflation in the later years of your
retirement. I would see no problem if you moved $93,844 to
fixed-income investments, but I would be uncomfortable with the
overall situation if the equity side went below $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether to go for Vanguard Capital Opportunities fund,
that would in large part depend on how the previous questions were
answered. It's not exactly a duplication of your position in
Alliance Technology, since that fund focuses on technology stocks,
while Vanguard Capital Opportunity focuses most heavily on heath
care issues, followed by services, and then technology.
</P>
<P>
   Despite glowing recent numbers _ its 97.8 percent 1999 gain and
its 32.5 percent year-to-date advance, as this is written _ you
might look back to its early years to see that it hasn't always
been so. (Although you could also argue that those bad years came
under a different portfolio manager.)
</P>
<P>
   In any event, I would view it as one of Vanguard's riskier
funds. My suspicion is that this was the reason the fund family
bumped the minimum investment up to $25,000 _ probably seeking to
limit the fund's growth, but also to price out unsophisticated
investors.
</P>
<P>
   My view is that this might be a good long-term investment, but
at this stage of the market, I would tend to avoid it unless you
have a very large amount of cash left over after providing a
fixed-income portfolio that will provide for your needs _ and if
you are willing to hold the fund for a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our annual income is just over $100,000; we have no debt. As
I grew older and looked at friends and relatives, I often wondered
how we stacked up financially. How are we doing? Can we be content
that we have handled our finances successfully?
</P>
<P>
   K.W., Sun City, Ariz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're doing just swell.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for statistics, a Web site run by the US
Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis lists per-capita
personal income for 1998 for each state, with Connecticut first, at
$37,598, and Mississippi last, at $18,958. The census currently
under way will probably yield more information, but not for a
couple of years. But any way you fry it, you're clearly doing very
well.

<P>
   If April showers will indeed fall, here's a great recipe for a
rainy day. It's a good way to pull the kids away from TV for a
while, and it's an instructive activity that guarantees fun with
instant results.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe, inspired by Chinese and other Asian cooking, comes
from chef Clark McDaniel of Fort Worth's Angeluna restaurant. He
says you can use nearly anything for filling, from chopped wieners
to browned and drained ground beef.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   4 tablespoons hoisin sauce
</P>
<P>
   Make filling first by sauteeing mushrooms and water chestnuts in
a dash of olive oil, mixing in shredded chicken. Remove from heat
and add enough hoisin sauce to bind. Chill mixture. Meanwhile,
prepare buns by flouring a work surface and rolling out biscuit
dough. On each biscuit, leave a small, dime-sized spot in center
unrolled. Put a small amount of the chilled filling in the center
of four biscuits; brush edges with a wash made from beaten egg and
a little water. Put a plain, rolled biscuit atop each biscuit with
filling, pleat edges until closed. Brush each bun with egg wash,
then dust with sesame seeds. Steam in a boiling steamer for 10
minutes. Serve, if desired, with a little hoisin sauce that has
been thinned with chicken stock.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1990, at a spot on Heartbreak Hill near his home, Jim Davis
was watching the Boston Marathon. As chairman and chief executive
of New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc., he wasn't just enjoying the
race; he was also checking out the runners' footwear.
</P>
<P>
   Davis didn't like what he saw. Instead of New Balance shoes,
many runners were wearing other brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't getting the share we used to have,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, New Balance shoes could be spotted nearly everywhere,
on the feet pounding Heartbreak Hill as well as on trendy young
people who'd never dream of running a marathon. In 1999, running
shoes from niche brands such as New Balance, Saucony Inc., and
Asics Tiger Corp. seemed to be all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Long known as a company that makes quality sneakers for serious
runners, aging baby boomers, and folks with wide feet, New Balance
last year saw some of its new, flashier styles snapped up by
yunger, fashion-conscious consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For Boston-based New Balance, fashion was only part of the
story. Dismayed by the scarcity of New Balance-shod marathoners in
1990, Davis vowed then to broaden his customer base. Over the next
few years, he targeted women, children, and adults between 22 and
35 _ groups he hadn't always aggressively courted. All these
initiatives came together to produce a record year in 1999 as
worldwide sales rose 41 percent, to $890 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion trends gave a similar lift to Saucony. 1999 sales of the
Peabody, Mass. company rose 47 percent, to $154.06 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock groups have started wearing our shoes,'' marvels
Saucony's president and chief executive, John H. Fisher. Saucony's
core customer had previously tended to be age 30 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Those big gains are all the more impressive because the Sporting
Goods Manufacturers Association says overall US retail sales for
athletic footwear were flat in 1999 at $13.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to giants Nike Inc. and Stoughton-based Reebok
International Ltd.? In 1999, they may have lost some fashion cachet
to smaller brands.
</P>
<P>
   At Franklin Resource Group, a Boston sporting goods consulting
firm, president Marty Lillis calls it ``the Izod syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One year everybody's wearing your alligator; the next year
nobody is,'' he says. ``People don't want to wear what everyone
else is wearing. To be cool, you have to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   In a desire to be different, many fashion-conscious consumers
turned to New Balance, Saucony, and Asics last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, Reebok, and adidas AG all ``seemed to stumble at the same
time,'' Fisher says. And that created opportunities for smaller
brands to get more attention from retailers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, with Michael Jordan starring in splashy Nike ads,
basketball shoes dominated the athletic footwear industry. That
year, US consumers bought 345 million pairs of all kinds of
athletic footwear, the manufacturer's association says. But by the
time Jordan retired , the basketball-shoe fad seemed to have run
its course, and US sneaker sales had dropped to about 315 million
pairs.
</P>
<P>
   From $2.9 billion in 1996, retail sales of basketball shoes have
fallen by nearly a third, the SGMA says.
</P>
<P>
   That's been bad news for the likes of Converse Inc., of North
Reading, Mass., and Fila, whose brands are linked to basketball,
says Bob McGee, editor of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   As teens bought sandals, hiking boots, and other kinds of casual
shoes instead of basketball shoes, running shoes emerged as a
bright spot for the athletic footwear industry. According to the
SGMA, annual US retail sales of running shoes have grown to $2.6
billion from $1.7 billion over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   That's meant a big boost for companies with running heritages,
such as New Balance, Saucony, and Asics.
</P>
<P>
   At New Balance, Davis cautions against attributing too much of
his company's big 1999 to a shift in the fashion cycle.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the marathon in 1990 and seeing too few of his
shoes on runners' feet, Davis instituted a number of changes that
really gained momentum in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   His first move was to diversify his shoe lines and broaden his
market beyond male baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, 20 percent of sales came from women; today that figure
is 45 percent, says Davis, who bought the privately held company in
1972. Once, New Balance aimed its mostly gray and blue shoes at
customers 35 and older. Now, it has added more colorful lines
designed to appeal to consumers ages 22 to 35.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales of children's shoes, virtually nonexistent in
1996, now approach 15 percent of total company sales.
</P>
<P>
   Offering shoes in many widths, New Balance has also gone after
the estimated 15 percent of the market with big or small feet. Few
other athletic shoe companies pursue those customers.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of hiring sports celebrities such as Jordan to
promote its shoes, New Balance ads sometimes noted that many of its
shoes were made in the United States, something else that sets it
apart from rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But as sales grew, New Balance began to outstrip its capacity
for domestic manufacturing and it, too, had to look to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, 80 percent of New Balance shoes sold in the United
States were either made domestically or assembled here with some
overseas parts. By 1999, that number had dropped to about 50
percent, Davis says. New Balance operates five factories in
Massachusetts and Maine for the bulk of its US production.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, federal regulators took issue with some New
Balance ads that claimed its shoes were made in the United States.
The regulators contended the ads were misleading because some shoes
were made with imported parts.
</P>
<P>
   Now ads steer clear of such claims and instead urge consumers to
``Connect with yourself. Achieve New Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a big 1999, Davis still takes an L.L. Bean approach to
fashion. It's an outlook that can be summed up this way: ``If
fashion comes our way, great. But we don't chase trends.''
</P>
<P>
   New Balance customers ``couldn't care less about purple shoes,''
says John J. Shanley, an analyst who covers the sporting goods
industry for First Security Van Kasper. ``What they care about is
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of the teen market, Nike and Reebok often flood the
market with new styles and colors. New Balance, in contrast, puts
out a style and sticks with it, tweaking it mostly with technical
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Because this year's line is so similar to last year's, Shanley
doesn't expect New Balance to see the stunning growth it
experienced in 1999. The fashion crowd could soon be looking
elsewhere for trendy casual footwear, he says.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK with Davis. Too much growth can strain a company.
Projected growth this year of 25 to 30 percent will be just fine,
Davis says. As New Balance prepares to move into larger Boston
quarters in October, sales should exceed $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion trends come and trends go. But one thing is almost sure.
When runners in the Boston Marathon struggle up Hearbreak Hill next
week, ``We'll see more New Balance shoes than we did 10 years
ago,'' Davis says.

<P>
   Before people realized they could make a million dollars on the
Web by putting an ``e'' in front of any word in the dictionary,
registering the new name and shaking down a venture capitalist for
seed money, the Internet was a much more communal place.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it was populated largely by academics and
technology geeks who either cared little about getting rich or
considered the idea so outlandish as to be irrelevant, the Internet
assumed a quaint identity as a place where people offered
information freely.
</P>
<P>
   Personal home pages, chat rooms, bulletin boards and Usenet
groups, which are open-discussion forums on various topics, drew
millions seeking advice, news or companionship. Those running the
sites frequently relied on surplus computer space from universities
or whatever network power they could scrape together with spare
money.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, came e-commerce, a phenomenon that prompted the
tripartite categorization of the Internet: Alongside commerce sites
are now content sites, in which a publisher provides news and
information, and community sites, in which the users create the
content.
</P>
<P>
   But the tremendous interest in making money from the large
number of people who frequent a site, or ``monetizing eyeballs'' in
industry parlance, also foretold profound changes for community
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Community sites began selling advertising to stay in business.
The sites incorporated and wrote business plans. Some, like
TheGlobe.com, went public. Others, such as the Internet Movie
Database (IMDb.com), were bought by bigger sites _ Amazon.com, in
this case. Still others, such as DejaNews.com, a buying guide in
which consumers rate products and give advice, assumed a new
identity (Deja.com) and charged headlong into the e-commerce fray.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the community sites angered their constituencies,
who accused them of selling out to commercial interests. In others,
the transitions were smooth. But whatever the story, analysts and
executives of community sites say the e-commerce revolution changed
the face of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community sites have been wandering the desert in search of a
revenue stream,'' says Lisa Allen, an e-commerce analyst with
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``Now they've latched onto
e-commerce, which is the fair-haired child of the Internet. The
only problem is, commerce isn't making any of them rich, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, commerce has alienated the users who helped create
the sites' content. Tom Phillips, the chief executive of Deja.com,
says that site angered ``a lot of people when we made the change.''
</P>
<P>
   The change Phillips referred to took place last year.
DejaNews.com, one of the few sites to provide easy access to and
retrieval of Usenet topics and information, became Deja.com, a site
devoted to users who wanted information about a range of products.
DejaNews.com had generated a loyal following and had made money by
selling advertising. But when Deja.com rolled out, it began posting
boxes on the site's pages, requesting opinions and ratings on
products.
</P>
<P>
   Those opinions were aggregated into a vast _ and anonymous _
database, the linchpin of the new Deja.com site. But as Phillips
says, ``we sort of force-fed people the ratings and reviews, and it
slowed the site down,'' leaving it less navigable.
</P>
<P>
   David Wilson, Deja's senior vice president, adds, ``The
complaints mostly talked about how Deja was, and is, the
standard-bearer of Usenet, and they were concerned we'd take our
eye off the Usenet ball and everyone would suffer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Phillips says, ``we lost a chunk of people _ but we
also gained some, so our traffic has been pretty flat.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Deja would drop the ratings boxes and that,
``given the viral nature of Usenet,'' he expected those who left
the site to return.
</P>
<P>
   But Deja is not dropping its e-commerce ambitions. rather, the
company's newest incarnation, released in March, expands its
offerings of purchase information and includes direct links to
merchants selling goods featured on the Deja site.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from community to commerce was much less bumpy
for the Internet Movie Database, a compendium of movie trivia built
largely by contributions from movie buffs around the world who
gathered on the IMDb.com site.
</P>
<P>
   According to Col Needham, who founded the database in 1990 in
Britain, the site received four complaints when it decided to start
selling advertisements in 1996, and no complaints when it was
bought by Amazon in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the people who used the database were thrilled. Some
felt that a friendly, comfortable online community had been
swallowed by a giant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Needham says, not only did the alliance with Amazon lead
to an increase in the number of contributors to the database, but
as it has grown the database has hired some of the people who had
previously contributed voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that, in the end, most people understand that when you
have e-commerce in a content site, you can fund the future growth
of the site, so users win both ways,'' he says. ``They can buy
things they're interested in, and they have better content.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo encountered trouble last year when it bought GeoCities, a
site that allows users to create free home pages. Soon after the
acquisition, Yahoo posted a notice on its GeoCities site
(http://geocities.yahoo.com), suggesting that Yahoo could take the
content from a person's GeoCities site and use it in a book, for
example, without compensating the home-page publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The event caused a stir among the GeoCities faithful, spawning a
boycott and inquiries from at least one consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand where the users were coming from,'' says Doug
Hirsch, a senior production director for Yahoo Communities. ``But
at the end of the story, we did change our terms of service.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, home-page publishers can rest assured that their
content is, in fact, their property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are very wary of what commerce sites are doing with
content they provide _ and they should be,'' Hirsch says.
</P>
<P>
   He argues, however, that GeoCities had become less commercial
since Yahoo bought it, notably containing less intrusive
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually proud that it hasn't lost its grassroots vibe,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other community sites are heading into e-commerce, hoping to
make a similar claim in the future. Gamers.com, a site devoted to
video-game enthusiasts, is one such venture. Among other things, it
lets users rate video games and post notes on message boards about
anything related to games.
</P>
<P>
   According to the site's chief executive, Dennis Fong _ known in
professional computer-game circles as Thresh, the undefeated world
champion _ the company will soon introduce a service that allows
users to buy games on the site from retailers or buy from other
users in an auction format. In addition, he says, they will be able
to trade games.
</P>
<P>
   Fong says he expects no resistance from users, because the site
is committed to the open exchange of information about every game
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the Switzerland of the games industry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he adds, the transition should be done carefully,
lest it wave the e-commerce flag too proudly in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want to be known as is a store,'' he says.
``It's very hard for a store to be cool.''

L.A. SUBWAY   IS MASS NON-TRANSIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The subway here is perhaps unique in the world. It
is clean, and the trains run on time. It is, in effect, free; no
one checks if you have bought a ticket. The vast platforms are the
size of aircraft carrier flight decks; each one could accommodate
thousands of riders. When I was riding the system last week, there
were at most 15 or 20 people waiting for trains.
</P>
<P>
   That is the secret of the $5 billion subway's ``success'' _
hardly anyone rides it. For an Easterner, riding the Red Line (the
only line) is an out-of-subway experience. No accordion-wielding
buskers; no beer-breathed bums; no marauding schoolchildren. Sleek,
Italian-made cars full of comfortable, available seats. This is no
subway _ it's the Orient Express!
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has had a century-long love-hate affair with mass
transit; mostly hate. Cars rule. The transportationally
dispossessed ride buses. There are a few commuter rail lines
linking the center of the city with exurban destinations like San
Pedro or Long Beach. Twenty years ago, the city decided to build
what the Los Angeles Times now calls its ``cursed'' subway system.
The first few stations opened for business in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is smack in the middle of a horrific transportation
crisis. The storied freeways have been unreliable for almost a
decade. A routine trip could take 15 minutes, or an hour and 15
minutes. The state estimates lost work hours due to highway
congestion at 400,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
   So, with gasoline prices edging up to $2 a gallon, why not
embrace the subway? For starters, it really doesn't go anywhere.
You can't get to the airport. You can't get to Dodger Stadium. You
can't even get to the new Krispy Kreme doughnut stand in Van Nuys
that everyone is talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The existing line links downtown stations, like the Civic Center
and Union Station, with the businessy Wilshire Boulevard and the
still-sleazy-but-soon-to-be-tarted-up center of Hollywood. But the
people who work downtown or along Wilshire don't live in Hollywood.
The vast bedroom tracts of West Los Angeles (more affluent) and
East Los Angeles (less affluent) are untouched by the subway, and
will be forever.
</P>
<P>
   Cost overruns that make Jim Kerasiotes look like a management
whiz and an untimely gas explosion in the mid-1980s have soured
Angelenos on pouring new money down the subway hole. Eighteen
months ago, a local pol sponsored a successful ballot initiative
that halts new subway construction after this year. Just last week,
governor Gray Davis announced a $5.2 billion transportation plan
``to get California moving again.'' Although he staged the photo op
at a Los Angeles subway station, all of the allotted funds were
earmarked for freeway expansion, buses, and above-ground rail
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The subway has other drawbacks. Although Angelenos are not prey
to irrational earthquake fears, even the most stouthearted
straphanger wouldn't want to be caught in a subway tunnel during a
``seismic event.'' On a more visceral level, many residents just
plain don't like it. A ``New York solution for a Los Angeles
problem,'' is the phrase one hears.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this summer, the subway will reach a place where people
actually live: the San Fernando Valley, home to the world-famous
valley girls. The two new stops at the Universal City theme park
and in North Hollywood lie across the Cahuenga Pass, and could
theoretically relieve congestion on the traffic-choked Hollywood
Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the 11-mile-long system carries about 60,000 riders a
day, one-10th as many as Boston's vastly larger network. The
extension into the valley will add 6.3 miles of track and about
40,000 riders. At least that was the most recent estimate. When I
phoned a Metro Rail spokesman to check the numbers, he said the
subway isn't in the business of predicting ridership anymore. There
just hasn't been much good news to report.

   E-commerce folks know more about routers than riders, more about
margins than legislative markups. But as they spend more time on
Capitol Hill, they are learning one thing fast: It takes a lot more
than being this year's darling to get what you want.
</P>
<P>
   All those stodgy nondot-coms have not been paying all those
stodgy lobbyists all that money for nothing. And those
Gucci-loafered lobbying wizards love nothing better than
piggybacking their pet project onto somebody else's fast-track
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Take digital signatures _ e-commerce jargon for secure
electronic-identification codes. Many e-commerce transactions would
be simpler if such signatures were recognized as the legal
equivalent of their ink-and-paper counterparts, allowing
transactions to be completed online that now have to detour through
fax machines or the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Legal weight, of course, is conferred by laws, and a bill to
give electronic signatures that weight was a top Congressional
priority for Internet and high-technology groups last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huzzah!'' insurance and banking lobbyists cried, more or less.
``A complicated financial bill that's likely to pass! Allow us to
offer a few helpful suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates use the word ``hijacking'' to describe what
followed, as the bill magically sprouted amendments eliminating
some traditional paper record-keeping and consumer-notification
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting feud between Republican-backed financial interests
and the administration-supported consumer groups has largely left
the technology companies on the outside looking in, eager to
support whichever version of the bill has the best chance of
passage.
</P>
<P>
   And observers say the fight over digital signatures will pale in
comparison with some of the Internet battles that are looming. In
the process, alliances of all sorts are going to be stirred and
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   James Lucier, an Internet analyst at Prudential Securities, says
that right now Democrats on the Hill are losing e-commerce fights
because their traditional supporters, ``consumer groups, trial
lawyers, are persona non grata in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Republicans are going to get hit soon,'' he warns. ``Their
traditional interest groups _ insurance, realtors, broadcasters,
wholesalers _ are going to be coming into conflict one at a time
with Web-based businesses. It's not going to be pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   One way of looking at the conflicts is less in terms of partisan
politics than in terms of time frames or frames of mind. Influence
in Washington is based on everything the Internet is not: history,
both in relationships and campaign contributions, location, as in
the presence of insurance agents and restaurant owners in every
Congressional district, and mastery of legislative and regulatory
processes as arcane as, well, the legislative and regulatory
process.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol wholesalers showed how powerful such history can be on
Capitol Hill when, despite repeated calls by Democratic and
Republican Congressional leaders to keep the Internet generally
free of regulation, the House last year passed a bill that would
keep small wineries and breweries from selling alcohol over the
global network.
</P>
<P>
   Although that bill was initially proposed as a measure to ban
the sale of liquor to minors, wholesalers _ who often have virtual
statewide monopolies with complete control over what brands of
beer, wine and liquor are sold _ jumped on the bandwagon and got
the bill changed to prevent companies from selling alcohol online
unless they abide by varied and cumbersome state distribution and
tax laws that are too complex for small companies to follow.
</P>
<P>
   And Internet businesses face another threat, the kind that comes
with success. So far, e-commerce and high-technology interests have
stood together to oppose bills that threatened the freewheeling
nature of the Internet. But as interests shift, that solidarity
could dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the recent decision by eBay, the online auction
company, to quietly switch sides in a brewing dispute over how far
copyright protection should extend to online databases.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Realtors, along with Lexis-Nexis,
the New York Stock Exchange and other compilers of traditionally
proprietary databases, are pushing for a bill introduced by Rep.
Howard Coble (R.-N.C.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's
intellectual-property subcommittee. His bill would give broad
copyright protections to both databases and many of the individual
facts they are built on, prohibiting most people from using
information contained in those compilations.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of the Internet has been developed by start-ups
experimenting with variations on traditional businesses, it is not
surprising that Internet interests are backing a narrower bill by
Rep. Thomas Bliley (R.-Va.), chairman of the House Commerce
Committee. The bill introduced by Bliley would protect the
compilations, but not the facts within them.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, however, has moved from Internet start-up to Internet
giant. As it sees more competitors using its listings, its
representatives have begun independently visiting Congressional
offices, making subtle noises about changing sides. To help make
its case, it recently opened a Washington office, hiring a lobbyist
from one of the most influential groups in town _ the Motion
Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, the eBay folks will be buying Gucci loafers
for themselves, and steak-and-martini lunches for lawmakers.

<P>
   When Priceline.com arranges deals in which consumers name their
own prices for, say, airline tickets, it reports the money that the
passenger pays for the seat as its own revenue, even though it
neither owns nor flies any airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   And when Internet companies swap advertising space on each
other's Web sites, which has become routine, they generally record
the value of their benefit from the barter as if it is a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable issues arising from the new world of business in
cyberspace? No doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Are they important only as grist for discussion among
accountants? Not on your Lifeminders.com.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of many stock-market veterans, valuing Internet
companies has become a matter largely untethered from reality,
limited only by visions of distant triumph. Indeed, most of these
companies have yet to turn a profit, much less pay the skimpiest of
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of traditional benchmarks, analysts and investors
focus on less-substantial gauges such as how much investment
capital has been poured into the business, how many eyeballs are
being attracted to a Web site and, probably most important, how
much money is coming in _ without regard to how the income relates
to the expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies tend to be valued on the basis of their
revenue,'' says Robert Willens, a tax-and-accounting analyst at
Lehman Brothers. ``For Internet companies, it's particularly
crucial to show top-line revenue growth.''
</P>
<P>
   And since fledgling companies need booming stocks to raise
capital at low cost and to attract and hold scarce
stock-option-minded talent, they have considerable incentive to
build revenue however they can.
</P>
<P>
   Some professional investors, mainly those who specialize in
betting on which stocks will fall, complain that various companies
are overstating results.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of a New York hedge fund, for example, questions
whether Internet companies should be allowed, in effect, to use the
capital markets to create revenue by buying smaller competitors and
then collecting fees from them for Web space.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have refrained from saying that there has been any
significant abuse, but they are becoming concerned about aspects of
Internet accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The concern was reflected in a list of 20 issues that Lynn E.
Turner, the chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, identified in October as warranting consideration by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the profession's chief
rule-making body.
</P>
<P>
   Urging attention by the Board's Emerging Issues Task Force,
Turner says that these items are either not yet addressed in
accounting rules, are being treated differently by different
auditors or are subject to what he called ``inappropriate''
developing practices.
</P>
<P>
   One chief issue is whether an Internet company should report its
transactions ``gross'' or ``net'' _ that is, should it regard as
revenue the entire value of what it sells, such as an airline
ticket, or only its profit from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Another accounting issue is fulfillment costs, such as shipping,
handling and warehouse expenses, which are a significant cost of
doing business for many e-tailers. Some companies show these
charges as marketing expenses rather than as a component of gross
profits, which would shrink this major gauge of performance.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the SEC, which is reportedly scrutinizing
Amazon.com and eToys on this point, says such differing treatment
should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A transaction should be accounted for the same, whether it's
an e-business or a brick-and-mortar business,'' says Scott Taub, an
aide to Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting-standards board's panel put as its first order of
business the treatment of barter deals, in which Internet companies
exchange Web advertisements, which are recorded as both revenue and
offsetting expense. The panel decided in January that the practice
is legitimate only when the participants can show a history of
collecting cash payments for ``similar advertising'' within the
last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet-accounting questions include whether to write off
the cost of developing Web sites as it is incurred or to spread the
deduction over several years. How to value stock options is also up
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   It is a knotty set of decisions, not easily unraveled, and some
of them are bound to become visibly contentious soon. But Taub
expressed optimism that accountants and their clients will find
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope,'' he says, ``is that the bulk of these issues can be
resolved this year.''

   Kate Berry is a reporter for The Orange County (Calif.)
Register.
</P>
<P>
   Like people who have used the auction site eBay to turn the
clutter in their garages into cash, businesses are turning to a new
Internet marketplace to sell or swap surplus goods, from diesel
engines to fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   Online exchanges hope to attract a wide range of businesses that
want to unload excess inventory through an electronic forum where
companies can accept bids from potential buyers. The concept is
sometimes linked to barter, which is flourishing on the Internet
among companies that swap advertising space. But online exchanges
deal primarily in cash and have a bigger market in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a business out there that doesn't have excess
inventory or idle assets,'' said George Samenuk, the president and
chief executive of TradeOut.com, an online exchange. TradeOut, in
Ardsley, N.Y., focuses on Fortune 1,000 companies that want to
unload excess inventory. The average transaction on TradeOut.com is
$20,000, compared with just $40 on eBay, which happens to be a big
investor in TradeOut.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most misunderstood and hidden areas of
business,'' Mr. Samenuk said. ``Not many people want to publish how
much excess inventory they have.'' That dissuades some potential
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   TradeOut.com is typical of most online exchanges, charging
sellers a $10 fee to list an item and a 5 percent commission once a
transaction is complete. Bids are sealed, as opposed to a
traditional auction, when each bidder knows what the others have
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts think live Internet auctions, broadcast from
factory floors, will supplant traditional liquidators and
auctioneers as more businesses make deals online. Electronic
business-to-business auctions and exchanges are expected to grow to
more than $700 billion in 2004, up from $29.4 billion this year,
according to Forrester Research. At stake are surplus goods or
assets valued at $300 billion to $500 billion worldwide, experts
say, though they will probably be sold at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   Online exchanges are already jockeying for position. As with
other big Internet businesses, the key to growth is the ability to
get businesses to list goods on their sites. And as with other big
Web sites, the bigger the audience, the more valuable the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But business buyers have caught on slowly. TradeOut.com has sold
just 5 percent of the $450 million in inventory available on its
Web site, which was started in June.
</P>
<P>
   The business-to-business auction companies say their Web sites
are efficient for sellers seeking a wide variety of buyers, which
can result in higher prices. Excess goods that might have gone out
the back door for 30 cents on the dollar often command 70 cents on
the dollar online.
</P>
<P>
   A few sites have decided not to identify the seller. Being
anonymous is an incentive for companies that do not want to risk
the ire of their distributors or manufacturers or do not want to
reveal their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies can't send merchandise back to the vendor
and are tempted to e-auction it,'' said Tom Petters, the chief
executive of Redtagoutlet.com, in Minneapolis, which operates
Redtagbiz.com, an exchange that caters to manufacturers selling
mostly surplus consumer goods. The anonymity is appealing to
sellers because ``no one wants to show other people what didn't
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   BigVine.com, in Redwood Shores, Calif., straddles the wall
between an online exchange and a barter operation. Bippy Siegal,
the company's chief executive, thinks small businesses, which can
carry as much as 15 percent to 20 percent extra inventory, are
interested in swapping goods not for cash, but to use as barter.
His site allows sellers to set the price of an item, which is
listed in so-called trade dollars. These can be used to buy other
goods or services on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very interested in barter and in trading,'' Siegal
said. BigVine is backed by American Express, which invested $10
million for a 10 percent stake, giving American Express a chance to
market a variety of services to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Serra, a senior vice president for interactive service at
American Express, said small companies were strapped for cash but
had plenty of excess inventory or services to give away. She sees a
huge market because only 500,000 of the 25 million small businesses
in the United States barter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What barter does is give a new distribution channel to small
companies,'' Serra said.

<P>
   In a Web-based world, where an electronic embrace is replacing
the personal encounter, business-to-business entrepreneurs are
rediscovering the might of the human touch. Some nouveau
Net-setters are even pitching the Internet as the ultimate ``people
power'' tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``In business-to-business _ as against business-to-consumer _
Web transactions, human beings generally represent value added,''
said Anna Copeland Wheatley, the editor-in-chief of ``AlleyCat
News,'' a business magazine that covers the Internet and technology
in the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers do not need much handholding when buying simple
commodities, like books and tapes, or even standard office
supplies, Wheatley explained. But in most of the
business-to-business market, transactions involve complex
purchasing decisions, a host of variables, lots of money and
manufactured items bought and sold among a comparatively small but
educated audience. That means that relationships with suppliers can
be more important than the lowest price; companies have gone
bankrupt saving money on the wrong product.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this universe, you often need more than textual
information,'' Wheatley added. ``You need to bond a bit with the
people you're dealing with; you need an element of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Developing trust means going beyond e-mail exchanges; research
shows, and experience confirms, that we are face-to-face animals.
We gauge character through signals, like body language. And bonding
requires someone responsive to bond with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business customers come back, I suspect, because of the
stickiness of the seller, not the site,'' Wheatley said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, interviews with business consultants, scholars and
executives confirm that from venture capitalists to sales
representatives and product distributors, the business-to-business
supply chain is relationship-rich _ stubbornly so for entrepreneurs
determined to connect buyers and sellers by electronics alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always disturbed by these tattooed, ponytailed
netrapreneurs saying they'll revolutionize industries by
eliminating the middlemen and their human inefficiencies,'' said
Mark Walsh, the president and chief executive of VerticalNet Inc.,
which runs 56 industry-specific Web sites. ``So they launch Web
sites that declare war on all the supply chain participants who
existed before the Internet came on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Guiding their attacks is the notion that the Internet is so rich
with information that it creates an omniscient buyer who knows the
cost and the price of everything. But business types with Internet
expertise and brick-and-mortar experience note that many
netrapreneurs, enamored of technology and highly skilled in it, are
short on real-world business experience. They haven't cut deals
themselves. Or as Walsh said, ``They haven't lived with the lies
they've told in business, nor with the humiliation of being lied
to.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they do not understand that businesses are not
purely price-driven, that business executives believe in margins
and a degree of loyalty to vendors. They love it when vendors
remember what they bought last; they want the best that works.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Walsh thinks there will be a backlash in which people
who participate in the new marketplace say the Internet is
primarily a relationship enhancer. The vanguard may have already
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Derek Bromley, who joined Greg Ahnert in 1997 and
founded BevAccess.com, an online exchange where beverage-alcohol
producers, distributors and buyers research, buy and sell wine,
spirits and beer. ``We don't want to cut industry sales forces, but
to help them work smarter _ to shorten sales cycles and reduce the
time spent in transit and on paperwork so as to improve
relationships and contacts with existing and new accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coes, the president and chief executive of eSprocket, a
Boston start-up trying to create a marketplace in the $400 billion
worldwide, used-industrial-equipment industry, is a relationship
convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like our competitors, we were going to cut out the brokers and
dealers by launching an auction site,'' Coes said. ``We now think
that was wrong. Dealers and brokers are essential in a business
where the typical buyer is a career person at a small or midsize
company making an occasional purchase, the typical seller is a
Fortune 1,000 making an occasional sale and the average transaction
is between $35,000 and $60,000.''
</P>
<P>
   What these new businesses seem to be discovering, consultants
and scholars say, is the importance of human interactions in
business relationships and the need to understand how those
relationships work in particular industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auctions, for example, create a false sense of urgency by
leaving no time for discussion,'' said John R. Coleman, a founding
partner and president of VIA Inc., in Portland, Me. The firm
specializes in marketing and Internet strategies for eSprocket,
among others. ``But in something like used capital equipment, you
need a site that allows initial contacts to happen and negotiations
to take place _ and not just through the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman has discovered empirically what Kathleen L. Valley, an
associate professor at Harvard Business School, has shown
experimentally. ``We found that e-mail transactions and
negotiations are most successful when the parties have a
pre-existing relationship,'' Valley said. Even then, Internet
communication has limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the volume of exchanges these days, she said, e-mail
puts a premium on saving time and money by keeping messages short
and succinct ``with no social greasing of verbal interactions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But our research also found that the norm in e-mail exchanges,
anyway, is to not share information,'' she said. ``It seems that
there is very little trust.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. ``Whatever information is shared
electronically is much more likely to be altered in some way,''
Valley said. ``People tend to shade and misrepresent more readily,
even though e-mail is a written record.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are Web sites and e-mail exchanges the best avenues for
negotiated deals, even among parties who enjoy long-standing
relationships. Valley has found that when people meet face to face,
the impetus is to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
Telephone conversations resulted most often in lopsided deals.
``Surprisingly,'' she said, ``callers tended to assume that
listeners could not detect a lie, while listeners assumed that they
were hearing truths.''
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail exchanges most often resulted in impasse, and often
with increased anger leading to a cutoff of communications, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Valley's advice to business executives? ``Appreciate electronic
exchanges for allowing you to stay in touch: you can communicate
any time with anyone, inexpensively and efficiently. But spend time
sharing with customers and business partners the kind of social
information that develops trust. And when it comes to the clinch,
meet with the other person, or pick up the phone.''

<P>
   Sale time in the world of brick-and-mortar retailing tends to
mean holiday time _ Presidents' Day, Labor Day and other times when
people are off work and physically out shopping.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, retailing is also developing its own sale rhythms,
though they are less predictable and tied to the times people are
in cyberspace or visiting particular sites.
</P>
<P>
   Many e-commerce sites already discount merchandise and therefore
do not follow traditional sales schedules. The exceptions are the
big shopping holidays _ Christmas, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day
and Father's Day _ according to statistics from BizRate.com, a site
that tracks online shopping habits.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that specialize in gift-giving help spread online shopping
activity past the holidays. Flooz.com, which sells gift currency
that users can redeem in online stores, is seeing the sales of its
retail partners, which include Tower Records and Godiva chocolates,
increase at off-peak times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love that we can take advantage of the holidays by
getting people to send and receive Flooz, and then drive the
recipients into the stores right after the holidays,'' said Robert
Levitan, the company's cofounder and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Reel.com, a film-related site that combines content with the
sale of movies on videocassette and DVD, offers sales and
promotions tied to news events and trends rather than calendar
holidays, said Dave Rochlin, the chief operating officer. The site
has made its own annual sales tradition centered on the Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously know the Oscars are huge for movie watchers,''
Rochlin said. He added that Reel.com has in the past brought in
many customers for its content, which included Oscar-prediction
games and film retrospectives, and ended by selling them movies.
</P>
<P>
   Even sites that are spun off from traditional establishments are
adapting their sales practices to the habits of online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're catering to different customers with different time
considerations,'' said Gene Domecus, the vice president for
Internet merchandising at Macys.com. ``When consumers come to your
Web site looking for a product, they are ready to buy it now. `On
sale tomorrow' or `Come back three days from now' doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Macys.com went online in 1996 offering only bridal registry
services. The site was revamped in 1998 to include many of the
items found in Macy's retail stores, from women's suits to
toasters.
</P>
<P>
   But though the merchandise may be the same, the sale practices
are not. The purchasing habits of online shoppers differ: ``I do
most of my business between noon and 3,'' Domecus said. ``People
really shop online at lunchtime and then after 10 at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales online are a different animal, too; the borderless
dimensions of Macys.com enable the site to reflect a special sale
at the Macy's West or Macy's East division.
</P>
<P>
   But the convenience of online shopping in general may also
diminish the need for significant discounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stores are closed and we're still open and doing
business,'' Domecus said, ``the sale calendar also starts to not
make sense.''
</P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Fast forward to this time next year. There's me, crashed on the
sofa in front of the television, tapped into a next-generation
video-game console, playing another gamer halfway around the world,
then using the console to browse the Web and also buy CDs and order
pizza. I will eat that during my regular Wednesday-night
videoconference call over the console's high-speed connection.
After that, I will download a movie.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this is not your father's Game Boy; it is
serious e-business.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of promises of gadgets to link your PC and your
TV, it turns out that games are the thing that will make this a
marriage made in couch-potato heaven. And the biggest thing about
these monster game machines, which will cost less than $500, is the
possibilities they pose beyond games.
</P>
<P>
   All the usual console-game heavyweights are here: Sony, Nintendo
and, back from the near dead, Sega. Oh, and one new contender,
Microsoft, which may wind up in a league all its own (one it knows
well): domination.
</P>
<P>
   While the other players are modifying video-game machines to act
more like PCs, Microsoft is doing the opposite. Its product is
called X-Box, and guess what? It is really just a Windows PC tuned
for gaming _ like the one I already own with a Pentium III
processor, a big hard disk and a high-end video card _ crammed into
a small box that plugs into the TV.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows better than Microsoft where people want to go _
and spend money _ on the Web? It already has the browser, e-mail
and, more important, e-commerce security goodies for making its
video-game way to the Web a palatable proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Plug-in ports will make it possible to attach devices like
keyboards, mice and joysticks, turning the X-Box into the sort of
device that Microsoft has struggled to make work as WebTV for so
long, without all the trade-offs, like dumbed-down Web browsing and
e-mail. Microsoft says that the X-box will be available in the fall
of 2001, practically a millennium away in gamer years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Big Three of video games are not down for
the count, not by a long shot. Each thinks its strategy will win
the hearts, minds and wallets of both game players and Net
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Sega's Dreamcast, a $200 video-game console introduced last
year, which is far more advanced than the current Sony PlayStation
and Nintendo 64 consoles, is the taste of the near future. It is
the first video-game machine with a built-in modem. To register for
Internet service by using the Dreamcast requires only a credit card
and a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Those few minutes are difficult, though. While the Dreamcast
controller earns praise for landing kicks and punches in fighting
games, it is not a great mouse for tapping information onto the
on-screen keyboard. An optional $25 keyboard plugs in to make Web
browsing and e-mailing simpler.
</P>
<P>
   But Sega is not betting the farm on browsing and e-mailing.
Community and multiplayer gaming are where the company intends to
earn a prizefighter position. Its current bag of Net tricks,
however, is not exactly making hard-core game players palpitate.
</P>
<P>
   There's Chu Chu Rocket, a cutesy (and addictive) cat-and-mouse
puzzle game that can be played solo or against other players
nationwide. Sega also offers small diversions like up- and
downloadable enhancements for Sonic Adventure, and posting high
scores from Sega's Web site to see who is the speediest ``Star
Wars'' Racer.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall, Sega plans to offer an add-on digital camera called
Dreameye, which can e-mail snapshots or make videophone calls _
activities familiar to desktop PC users.
</P>
<P>
   Also due for Christmas is a snap-in module that will link many
players in different places and give the Dreamcast the high-speed
Net performance that serious PC multiplayer fans demand. That means
your game console will be able to handle any high-speed connection
your cable TV or telephone company can provide. Thus, no stammering
slowdown when blasting an enemy, and filling your online shopping
cart faster.
</P>
<P>
   Online shopping is a major e-commerce component that Sony plans
to let buyers tap into by using its PlayStation 2 console, which
will go on sale in the United States in the fall. (When PlayStation
2 went on sale in Japan early this month, the company sold nearly a
million units in three days.)
</P>
<P>
   The device, which should cost about $400, also plays DVD movies,
creating two consumer products in one. PlayStation 2 offers a fast
network connection and an optional hard drive that has lots of
space for downloading games, videos, movies and music.
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear is whether Sony's own record and entertainment
labels _ already playing on CD, DVD and VHS as well as Cineplex
screens around the world _ will get top billing among the products
accessible via PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its cue from the cable TV business, Sony might offer
pay-for-play gaming events, similar to pay-per-view championship
boxing matches. The difference is that you will be in the ring,
taking virtual punches instead of just watching.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least in the battle of the consoles is Nintendo,
whose early-2001 next-generation entry, code-named Dolphin, is
still under wraps. Count on Nintendo to also offer high-speed Net
access along the lines of what Sony and Sega are promising, as well
as ports that should make it possible to connect devices like disk
drives, keyboards, mice and cameras, probably at about the same
price as its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   If all these forward-thinking video-game systems sound like PC's
in disguise, that is because they are. It takes the enormous
capacity of a hard disk to store all that entertaining information,
along with the bits of data, like credit-card numbers and buying
preferences, that matter most to the companies on the other side of
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   So don't just zap an opponent in Half-Life. Ready, aim, spend!
</P>

<P>
   With both transmitters out of commission, little money and more
than $40,000 in repairs needed to keep Boston University's student
radio station, WBTU, on the air, Bill Rigby was getting desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things never looked bleaker,'' said Rigby, a Boston University
senior and the station's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it dawned on him that one important aspect of campus life
might work in the station's favor: 70 percent of his audience,
students living in dorms, had high-speed Internet access in their
rooms. So, in an all-or-nothing gamble, he abandoned the airwaves
for the Internet, investing the last of the station's money in
equipment for broadcasting over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   For the last quarter of 1999, the station could afford only to
Webcast its programming. Yet during that time, WBTU received high
participation rates from listeners and built its highest ratings in
years on sports, which Rigby, 22, attributed to more alumni
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   By New Year's Day, the station could afford enough repairs to
get back on the air; staff morale was high; and student
applications for on-air, online and production jobs were pouring
in, Rigby said.
</P>
<P>
   And the very nature of the station changed. It began investing
its increasing revenues not just to fix its broadcast equipment but
also to expand its Internet features.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if this was working so well, why not push it further
with chat rooms and a Web cam showing the D.J. on the air,'' Rigby
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Laksin, a Boston University freshman and frequent listener
to WBTU, liked the Webcasting. ``Why would I turn on my radio when
I can get interactive radio online?'' Laksin said.
</P>
<P>
   On campuses from the University of Maine to San Jose State
University, a radical change is under way in college radio. Its
image as a noncommercial medium doomed by tiny transmitters to low
ratings and a miniscule niche market is evolving into a global
medium serving audiences craving an alternative to the slickly
marketed, predictable fare offered by commercial radio.
</P>
<P>
   The new potential for global reach has also enabled alumni to
keep in touch with campus events. Sports coverage is also proving
popular, often testing the limits of the stations' Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   The stations use software like RealAudio or Windows Media Player
to ``stream'' music _ in streaming, the audio or the video that is
transmitted over the Internet begins to play when only partly
downloaded, reducing waiting time. The cost for most college
stations to start Webcasting with RealAudio is a couple of thousand
dollars, which is cheap by radio standards.
</P>
<P>
   Depending upon the size of the bandwidth of the radio station's
server and the number of listeners logged on, the sound can range
from scratchy mono to crystalline stereo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality is good enough that it reaches the same quality
level of FM radio that people are used to hearing,'' said Jay
Wampold, a spokesman for RealNetworks, the maker of RealAudio.
</P>
<P>
   At Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., WQHS has enjoyed
a cult following of its heavy-metal and hard-rock music, producing
unheard-of ratings for college radio stations. Nevertheless, the
station's general manager, Lenny Sprecht, agreed that Webcasting
has allowed the station to reach listeners who had not had access
to the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get at least a hundred e-mail messages a month
congratulating us on our show from as far away as Austria,''
Sprecht, a senior, said.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of Webcasting is the increased fees charged by
Ascap and BMI, the recording industry's major royalty-collection
agencies, for permission to play music by artists they represent.
These fees are determined by the size of the audience that the
radio signals reach.
</P>
<P>
   Royalties paid by the station at Ithaca College in Ithaca, N.Y.,
have increased nearly fivefold, said Chris Wheatley, the manager of
radio operations.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ithaca College's station is adding tracking
software to record the amount of traffic on the server, which
Wheatley hopes will enable the station to charge advertisers higher
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the software and technology is not in place,
the potential for e-commerce is staggering. Before, college radio
stations were limited to Class C, nonprofit educational broadcast
licenses that, under Federal Communications Commission rules, left
them few means of raising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, broadcasting through a virtually unregulated Internet,
stations with these licenses can charge higher advertising rates
and sell college and station merchandise and hard-to-find CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Rigby credits Webcasting for allowing WBTU to ``rise up from
nothing to a pretty bright future.''

   JERUSALEM _ Internet infrastructure, the veins and muscles of
the World Wide Web, has become Israel's entree to e-commerce, a
veritable back door to the global Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   Established and start-up companies are providing software and
microchip technologies that allow people to search, find and buy
products relatively easily, and with some measure of security, on
the World Wide Web. Indeed, of the 91 Israeli companies trading on
the Nasdaq, almost a quarter are involved in Internet
infrastructure technology.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity was almost irresistable: The Internet's quick
growth often overwhelmed businesses' e-commerce systems, clogging
the bandwidths and security arrangements with a flood of
information that needed to be routed, and sometimes rerouted.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Israeli entrepreneurs created thousands of
companies that strove to quickly relieve Internet traffic jams,
devise security checks and verify information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israeli companies anticipate the problems and provide the
quick fix,'' said Noam Ohring, an Israeli venture capitalist who
specializes in Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a commerce haven here, but you'll always find
behind-the-scenes kinds of companies.''
</P>
<P>
   What these companies have formed is a world of fire walls and
digital packets, load-balancing equipment and ``push'' technology,
customized information tailored to specific needs. Where they have
excelled is in not just patching up problems, but in turning their
solutions into the industry's standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli entrepreneurial knack is, to a great extent, a
result of the country's four-year mandatory military service for
men at the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers learn to improvise and be responsible for
others at a relatively young age. In addition, many of the
entrepreneurs served in elite technical units, gaining skills that
they use now in software start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   BackWeb Technologies is one such example. As a start-up, it has
quickly become the ``FedEx of the Internet.'' This Nasdaq-traded
company acts as a bulldozer behind dozens of e-commerce companies,
customer-relations management firms and supply sources.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, BackWeb's stock went up 142 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of people doing what they're doing,'' said
Elan Zivotofsky, a Goldman, Sachs technology analyst.
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli entrepreneur, a nuclear physicist named Nahum
Sharfman, founded two companies, first CommTouch Software Ltd.,
then DealTime, both of which cater to the supply and maintenance
end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies are as close as Israeli companies get to
providing pure e-commerce content.
</P>
<P>
   CommTouch develops consumer e-mail applications by outsourcing
services to companies and organizations, with surfers receiving an
e-mail box bearing the company's or organization's logo. CommTouch,
whose president is Isabel Maxwell, the daughter of the late British
media magnate Robert Maxwell, also offers various value-added
services, such as translating mail into 15 languages, including
Hebrew, and transmitting e-mail messages to telephones, fax
machines and beepers.
</P>
<P>
   Dealtime, Sharfman's second start-up, is a shopping service that
rates products and merchandise, everything a consumer might need to
know about anything from computers to books.
</P>
<P>
   DealTime and CommTouch, however, are not typical Israeli
infrastructure companies because their technology is ``in the
basement,'' as Sharfman likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   DealTime, for example, thrives on service, trying to find the
best deals on the Internet for its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's managers are in New York, where they search for
products and services, while the programmers are in Netanya, a
resort north of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis are out-of-the-box thinkers,'' said Nir Barkat, one
of four managing directors of the BRM Group, a Jerusalem investment
firm that acts as an incubator for local high-tech companies.
``They're far from the market, so they play with ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   One of BRM's first successful companies was Check Point Software
Technologies Ltd., a Nasdaq-traded security software provider used
by many Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking ahead has been a prime part of the company's success.
It came out with its first fire wall product in the 1990s, long
before anyone was thinking about the Internet and security. Now its
products form the core of the fire-wall market.
</P>
<P>
   BRM calls itself a ``vincubator,'' developing companies from the
``womb to I.P.O. tomb'' by providing capital and management skills
to create as many Internet infrastructure companies as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli companies always seem to do better when there is a
technology element to their trade, though this is not surprising
considering the legions of Israeli army-trained engineers and
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leverage yourself when you focus on a subsegment of the
Internet market,'' Barkat said. ``You have to have the goal of
being a guerrilla in a place where you can be significant.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   After a day trader went on a murderous rampage in suburban
Atlanta last summer, big brokerage firms distanced themselves from
the risky, rapid-fire stock trading that had cost the gunman, Mark
O. Barton, nearly a half-million dollars. Privately, many Wall
Street executives voiced smug I-told-you-so's.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, day trading is still a dirty term to
some people on Wall Street, but euphemistically it is a hot topic
of conversation. Firms represented by such sober spokesmen as
Charles Schwab and Peter Lynch, the former manager of Fidelity
Investments' Magellan fund, are recommending their firms' services
for ``active'' traders and offering those investors lower
commissions than other customers pay.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders try to make money by buying and selling stocks
quickly via low-fee Internet trades _ often using money borrowed
from brokerage firms _ to capture small price movements. They are
called day traders because they generally close out their positions
every day rather than hold stocks overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Charles Schwab Corp., whose founder and co-chairman has
preached the virtues of long-term investing for many years, took
the biggest plunge earlier this year when it agreed to pay $488
million for Cybercorp.com, a company that develops technology for
what it calls ``the professional, experienced online trader.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say it is inevitable that big Wall Street
brokerages, such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Citigroup, will follow
Schwab's lead in courting the most active traders.
</P>
<P>
   What these firms have discovered is that although frequent
trading may not be a sure way for investors to make money, it is
certainly lucrative for the brokerage firms. They collect a fee of
$8 to $20 each time a customer buys or sells shares. The problem
the big brokers face is how to embrace day trading without
alienating the customers who were attracted by pronouncements about
the importance of making a long-term financial plan and sticking to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really fine line,'' said Steve Galbraith, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., ``to try and preach this investment
mantra of `buy and hold' out of one side of the mouth and at the
same time court the day traders.''
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith, who analyzes investment firms, expressed amazement
that highly respected firms would risk, from his point of view,
sullying themselves to cash in on a frenzy of speculative trading
that he thinks may be a fad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite its poor image, day trading is as alluring to
some brokerage firms as it is to some individuals. David Pottruck,
who shares the titles of chairman and chief executive with Charles
Schwab, said that his company, which is in San Francisco,
considered acquiring one or more of the firms that operate
casinolike day trading rooms, where customers try their luck at
shifting money in and out of stocks for hours on end.
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck said he thought most of those day-trading rooms posed
issues of compliance with securities-trading regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that it was a reputational risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even thinking about operating day-trading rooms like the ones
that Barton attacked is a stretch for a firm headed by Schwab, who
has been a pied piper for small investors. In his 1998 book,
``Charles Schwab's Guide to Financial Independence,'' he advised:
``Hold on. Investing is not an overnight phenomenon. It's a
financial commitment of at least seven years. Longer is even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Schwab appears in television advertisements for his firm's
high-speed trading service, Velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch has also published books recommending that investors do
research on companies before buying their stocks, and is well known
for his buy-what-you-know approach. But, at the same time that
Fidelity is using Lynch to promote its mutual funds, the Boston
company is marketing its PowerStreet Pro online trading service to
active traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can make the generalization that one message
necessarily conflicts with another,'' said Tracey Curvey, the
executive vice president of Fidelity Online Brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Where does Fidelity stand on the growing number of people trying
to make a living by trading full time online?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not discouraging it, but we don't encourage it,
either,'' Curvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck sees the shift as evolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed,'' he said. ``A few years ago, it was our
belief that the extremely active trader never made money.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that individual traders can gather much of the market
information that was formerly available only to Wall Street pros,
Pottruck said, Schwab thinks many very active traders are quite
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the conclusion that it was in fact a good
business,'' Pottruck said. ``We don't want to concede any end of
the market. We want to be successful in all ends of the trading
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstreaming active trading is likely to lead day trading out
of the kind of offices that attracted Barton, analysts say.
Thousands of people will be spending most of their time trading
stocks electronically, analysts predict, but virtually all will do
so from home, using technology provided by big brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Most traditional Wall Street brokerage firms were slow to offer
online trading to customers, fearful of alienating their armies of
well-paid brokers. But last year, some of the biggest brokerages,
including Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.,
introduced low-commission electronic trading services. Having taken
that plunge, these firms are exploring ways to broaden their appeal
to serious online traders.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Keene, who analyzes the stocks of electronic-brokerage
firms at Putnam, Lovell, deGuardiola &AMP; Thornton, recently visited
several small firms that have developed stock-trading systems for
day traders. Company executives were buzzing about the prospect of
selling to big brokerages, as CyBerCorp did with Schwab. The buyout
fever is running so high that a firm in Richardson, Texas,
1800daytrade.com, is considering changing its name, Keene said, to
make it a more palatable takeover target to a firm worried about
its image.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: MUTUAL FUNDS ARE MOVING TO INTERNET TIME, BUT VERY SLOWLY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is Friday morning, and you are watching a professional
investor being interviewed on CNBC. Struck with an urge to buy into
the mutual fund he manages, you call up the fund's Web site within
seconds, only to find it will take a week to own any shares.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of instant gratification, most mutual-fund companies
and even some brokerage firms are still denying investors the
ability to buy now. Despite their claims of technological savvy,
these firms insist that investors fill out and sign an application,
attach a check and mail it to open a new account.
</P>
<P>
   The hang-up has been the one thing most investors cannot supply
electronically: a signature. Most mutual-fund companies think they
must have a signed application before they can sell shares to
investors, even though securities regulations do not seem to
require one.
</P>
<P>
   While other companies wait for digital signatures to be given
the definitive force of law, John Pauley is setting an example by
plunging ahead. Pauley, 30, is the vice president for electronic
commerce at Invesco Funds Group, a mutual-fund company in Denver
that has been opening accounts directly over the Internet
(www.invesco.com) since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Invesco has landed 22,000 new accounts from people who logged on
to the site, filled out an application and authorized Invesco to
withdraw as much as $25,000 from their bank accounts. Those
customers received a quick confirmation that Invesco would sell
them shares after that day's stock market closing.
</P>
<P>
   The site pays off for Invesco, whose funds are sold mostly
through the fund supermarkets run by Charles Schwab Corp. and
Fidelity Investments. When people buy the company's funds through
brokerage firms, Invesco does not know who they are or how to
contact them. But people who buy online become Invesco's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Other fund companies are coming around to Pauley's view. Marsico
Capital Management, a fund company in Denver, recently started
opening accounts online (www.marsicofunds.com). Several bigger fund
companies plan to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Internet adds value is when someone does business
with you and says, `I had no idea it could be this easy,''' Pauley
said. ``Once this industry embraces the technology, that's when
you'll see the changes.''

   GeniusBabies.com, a fledgling business owned by Michelle
Donahue-Arpas, joined the giant online mall Yahoo Stores in April
1999. One month later, its sales doubled; by November, sales had
reached $20,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Though Yahoo has served Donahue-Arpas well _ with a 95 percent
customer approval rating, she is a featured merchant _ she knows
she should expand her horizons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo giveth, and Yahoo can taketh away,'' she said, referring
to the ``featured merchant'' designation, which raises the profile
of her business, a seller of educational and developmental toys for
babies and toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   As a small fish swimming in a very big pond, Donahue-Arpas, like
other small retailers, must make careful decisions about how to
expand her company. In such a world, it would be easy to be
overwhelmed, overshadowed or swallowed up if she is not careful.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing number of shopping platforms from which small
businesses can choose, a free-for-all is developing in online
retailing. Portal shopping centers are offering an increasing
number of services, such as gift registries, price-comparison tools
and reviews, to lure consumers while bolstering their base of
merchants by making it easy to set up and run an online store.
Amazon.com has opened an Internet bazaar it calls zShops, and a
growing number of companies known as e-business service providers
are offering retailers free tools to establish and maintain online
stores with them.
</P>
<P>
   Each alternative has advantages and disadvantages for merchants,
and no clear answers have emerged about the best way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most retailers are still unclear on how to do it and, more
importantly, who to do it with,'' said Kneko Burney, director of
markets and computing at Cahners In-Stat Group, a research group in
Scottsdale, Ariz. ``The big hurdle for them is building a Web
presence that makes sense and making it known.''
</P>
<P>
   In-Stat estimates that 60 percent of the small companies in the
United States have Web sites and about 80 percent use the Internet,
but few do an effective job of selling products or services online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of platforms that offer a quick fix for big
bucks,'' said Sue Schwartz, who developed YarnXpress.com, which
sells specialty yarns, with the help of an e-business service
provider called Freemerchant.com. ``It's really `Let the buyers
beware,''' she said, referring to the merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if caution is in order, analysts think there is also
opportunity. Seema Williams of Forrester Research, which analyzes
e-commerce, observed, ``A bit of a free-for-all is actually a good
thing,'' opening up options for small retailers. It is important to
remember where interests lie.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she noted, Amazon.com is foremost a store, and its
interests will come first. Shopping portals such as Yahoo, which is
not a retailer, will always have more allegiance to their big-name
merchants, who pay more money to be on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that small merchants must look out for
themselves, getting their names out in any way possible and using
resources as long as they are cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, of YarnXpress, could not agree more. She said she was
pleased with the set-up features offered by Freemerchant.com but
played down the links it provided to search engines as a way of
generating business. More valuable, she said, was the link to eBay,
which led to the sales on which she built her business. Rather than
pay to put her business on established sites, she has used other
strategies, including starting an online group for knitters and
advertising in a knitting magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Freemerchant sees itself as giving small businesses ``a techno
grub stake,'' offering free site construction, free hosting and
back-office support like inventory control and sales-tax
calculation. But it stops short of being a shopping destination.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, online malls and portal shopping centers have the
benefit of traffic and built-in name recognition that can give an
instant lift to a merchant. While the cost of aligning with some of
these sites remains prohibitively high, other sites are lowering
monthly fees and offering business-related services.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista, for example, is adding a variety of direct-marketing
capabilities to its Shopping.com service while plugging more stores
_ large and small _ into the search and product listings areas.
</P>
<P>
   But such a relationship costs a few thousand dollars a month,
more than what many small retailers can afford. In addition,
analysts said, the big shopping sites' focus on comparison
shopping, particularly regarding price, is not often advantageous
for small retailers, who will be undercut by larger merchandisers.
</P>
<P>
   At Yahoo, whose goal is to be the leading shopping site on the
Web, Jennifer Dulski, a brand manager for Yahoo Shopping, which
includes Yahoo Stores, said services were geared to buyers as well
as sellers. Yahoo Shopping, which includes 9,500 stores and an
auction, offers tools to merchants to help them establish and
manage Web sites. The cost is about $100 a month to post 50 items,
but it rises from there.
</P>
<P>
   In late September, Amazon.com introduced zShops, which offers
merchants the chance to list their stores for $9.99 a month. Amazon
can process credit-card orders for an additional 2.25 percent of
the total sale. Merchants can also take advantage of Amazon's
one-click shopping feature, which allows consumers to store their
shipping and credit-card information in a database.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, said that
while Amazon would provide a retailer with traffic for a while,
``the worry is, you're going to lose your category if Amazon
decides to offer your product.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, linking with a site that has a customer base of 17
million people is enticing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the people who have the financial resources to
advertise their Web site or latch on to those who can advertise for
them are the ones that are going to be successful,'' said John
Arnold, a customer-service manager with the Pacific Cookie Co. in
Santa Cruz, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Cookie has established a Web presence mainly through
partnerships in which it provides goods to sites wholesale but pays
nothing up front. It began with sites like Greatfood.com and then
established relationships with entities like Givechocolate.com, a
gift site.
</P>
<P>
   When approached by Amazon about joining zShops, Pacific Cookie
readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen a lot of orders from them,'' Arnold said,
``but just to be on a site like Amazon we thought was worth the
cost we were putting forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Cookie will not stop there. By this summer, Arnold said,
the company will be listed on about 10 shopping platforms, most of
which cost the company nothing.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bryan Matthews, who sells antique books in Los
Angeles, has stuck mostly to putting his books on databases.
Although he said he was approached daily by online virtual malls to
join their sites, he has gone with zShops because of his
longstanding relationship with Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews is also investing his time and energy in developing the
first online cooperative of booksellers, which he thinks will
protect his business interests in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will let people know there are all these independent
booksellers and turn them away from the brands and the big
platforms,'' he said. ``We want to let buyers know they are better
off dealing with personalities. We're the ones that have the
books.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Neal Johnston is a lawyer who gardens in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   GARDENERS in the United States, who spend about $5 billion a
year to watch things grow, can now watch the emergence of gardening
Web sites. Many electronic seedlings are in place, but much
pinching, pushing and pruning is coming.
</P>
<P>
   So far, growth has been slow, and it is almost entirely native.
All American mail-order gardening companies are now online, from
niche nurseries to the giant ones that fill a gardener's mailbox
and fulfill fantasies in January and February _ like Park Seed
(www.parkseed.com), Stokes Seeds (www.stokeseeds.com) and Burpee
Seeds and Plants (www .burpee.com). And all are struggling to
exploit the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Many gardeners are sure to switch to electronic ordering. Not
having to find a stamp or add up all those .95's at the end of
every price is an argument-winning convenience. Selection, as
opposed to ordering, is a different matter. The industry consensus
is that so far, the bulk of the e-commerce gardening business
involves new gardeners. The old hands still spread the catalogs
over the coffee table and spend half the winter gazing at the
midsummer marvels that always look best in February.
</P>
<P>
   But the move onto the Internet is inevitable. Those beautiful
catalogs are not cheap.
</P>
<P>
   For example, three years ago, White Flower Farm, a classic among
East Coast mail-order garden companies, bought Daffodil Mart, a
well-respected source of virtually every jonquil, tazetta and
cyclamineus daffodil ever named. It would be ridiculous excess for
White Flower to incorporate 600 different daffodil bulbs into its
fall catalog; it would be no less a waste to reduce the serious
specialists' choices to one-tenth of the number traditionally
listed by Daffodil Mart.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, White Flower Farm will post all the old Daffodil
Mart options on its Web site and continue to sell the four or five
dozen standard bulbs through its catalog.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce seems most likely to affect the garden's exotica: it
is a natural for the novice and the specialist. For the vast
middle, accustomed to ordering King Alfred daffodils by mail and
stopping by the garden center to eye a flat of white impatiens, its
utility will be restricted to ordering the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Only one company has its sights set on serving the entire
dirty-fingernail set: Garden.com, which was created in 1995 in
Austin, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   The company has contracted with about 70 nurseries nationwide,
each shipping directly to the buyer. The scattered inventory has
about 20,000 items, from seeds, plants and cut flowers to books and
garden gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Its Web site, at www.garden.com, is thoughtful, and its sales
last quarter tripled to $3.6 million from $1.2 million in the same
period the year before. But in the best e-commerce tradition, its
losses were even more impressive, rising to $7.2 million last
quarter from $2.1 million for the same period a year ago. The
company says it expects to turn a profit at the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Garden.com is a wonder world for the novice, and it is the
novice it has reached so far. The company says 90 percent of its
customers do not order through the mail, which creates
head-scratching by the experienced gardener who finds the site. For
instance, at the end of the season, Garden.com was offering
amaryllis buffs more than five dozen kinds of bulbs (at half price,
no less), and at the same time was offering four different types of
morning glory seedlings for $4.25 each. The only thing more certain
to grow than a morning glory seed is a child's foot, so only
gardeners with a profound mistrust of the post office would think
of ordering a morning glory seedling in late winter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the unsure, the options have been enormously
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I disagree about most things, including almost
everything in the garden. So she gets the backyard and I get the
top-floor deck. She likes tall, delicate, spiky things. I prefer
loud, vulgar splashy things. One such vulgarity is the caladium, a
flowerless low-lying leafy thing that resembles leftover Christmas
wrappings.
</P>
<P>
   The standard catalogs generally offer a half-dozen varieties of
caladium, which should satisfy most tastes. But two minutes with a
search engine leads straight to the handful of commercial caladium
growers around Lake Placid, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   These farms supply the mail-order houses, and in this case, if
home gardeners are willing to buy in lots of 25 bulbs where 5 would
normally do, they can quickly find twice as many choices at half
the regular price.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, a gasp of discovery and despair resonated
through the gardening world when yellow clivias were suddenly
available, at several hundred dollars for a flowering plant. The
clivia takes five years from germination to flower, but what
results is a wondrous foot-high stalk bearing a globe of red-orange
florets that last almost as long as an orchid and leave a rattle of
attractive seeds that glide from green to red to deep maroon over
12 months. It is a splendid way to thumb one's nose at mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that price was too steep even for the strangest of
colors. Two years later, the catalogs offered yellow clivia seeds.
I ordered two, for $40, with the near promise that five years later
at least one would turn into a yellow plant. After the indignity of
being put on a waiting list, I got my two seeds, and in three more
years may have something to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   My law partner, who can't tell a rhizome from a res ipsa
loquitor, went to the Web and tracked down the South African
hybridizer. At www.clivia.co.za, he ordered three seeds for a mere
$20.
</P>
<P>
   But as international as the Web may be, seeds and plants are a
focus of every country's border police, and retail commerce in
greenery is wrapped in red tape. Each order of yellow clivia seed
requires a $15 ''phytosanitary'' certificate.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dutch with their tulips and the Brazilians with their
passionflowers and the South Africans with their gesneriads put
their wares online, the American gardener may be exceedingly
frustrated by all the material that is not quite available at the
click of a mouse.

</P>
<P>
   WHEN Kate Shoup Welsh wants to buy hip beauty products, she does
not head to a mall. ''I live in Indiana, and though we have some
nice stores here, you can't find a lot of high-end boutique
brands,'' said Ms. Welsh, the author of ''Bargain Shopping
Online.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her fingers do the walking on the Web: ''I've shopped
at beautyscene.com, beautymax.com, beautybuys.com, eve.com,
beauty.com _ you name it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, there has been a virtual explosion of online
beauty retailers, which are estimated to total about 300. The
downside is that major players like Estee Lauder, Lancome and
Clinique _ which account for 70 percent of the $4 billion high-end
beauty market _ have not signed on with the new sites, though some
sites may sell these brands unauthorized. Major brands often set up
their own sites, instead.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the online slice of the beauty pie has been small. The
NPD Group, a research and consulting company in Port Washington,
N.Y., reported that in 1999, fewer than 1 percent of all beauty
products were sold online. However, Jupiter Communications, an
Internet research company based in New York, projects that by 2004,
5 percent of all beauty products will be sold online.
</P>
<P>
   The upside is that the start-ups have been a boon for niche
brands, which get limited shelf space in department or specialty
stores. ''A lot of these brands, even known ones, may not advertise
all over the country,'' Ms. Welsh said. ''I didn't even know
Versace made cosmetics until I saw them on beauty.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Lord, the vice president for content at ibeauty.com,
said, ''We're giving niche players a chance that they never would
have had in retail.'' Boutique beauty companies like Philosophy,
Bloom, Joey New York, Tony &AMP; Tina, Jaqua Girls (or Tom Girls),
Benefit, Urban Decay, Hard Candy, Nars, Tocca, Lorac, Vincent Longo
and Lolita Lempicka may not have the presence of a Lauder, but Web
exposure is helping to build their recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Philosophy, which is based in Phoenix and sells
250 beauty products with tongue-in-chic names like Hope in a Jar
and The Miracle Worker, was introduced in Barneys New York,
followed by Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue and Sephora. ''People like
Oprah Winfrey talked about our line on her show, yet when people
went out to the stores, they could never find it,'' said Cristina
Carlino, the chief executive of Philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Internet companies started calling. Philosophy
signed up with eve.com, then ibeauty.com, gloss.com, beauty.com and
sephora.com. ''All of a sudden, e-commerce gave us a very broad
distribution,'' Ms. Carlino said. ''It's still limited to people
who are on the Internet. But for a small company like Philosophy,
it's been a good thing.'' It also boosted business at the counter.
''People who'd never heard of us were going into stores asking,
'Where's Philosophy?' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Internet's immediacy, the beauty business is
changing. ''There's a revolution going on in cosmetics right now,''
said Mariam Naficy, a founder of eve.com. ''Previously, it was
difficult to gain nationwide distribution. Department stores are a
very expensive proposition for any manufacturer _ you have to pay
for fixtures, the staff behind the counter and so on. On a Web
site, there is virtually nothing in costs, no fixed fee. It's
extremely profitable and it's a way to display the brand with
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey New York, which carries a 25-product skin-care line that
includes hot products like Super Duper Lips and Botox in a Bottle,
began eight years ago by selling through salons, spas and catalogs.
The company expanded to stores like Henri Bendel, Bergdorf Goodman
and Sephora. Now, Joey New York products are available at major
beauty sites _ beauty.com, beautyjungle.com, eve.com, ibeauty.com
and sephora.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our brand-name recognition has grown tremendously,'' said Joey
Roer, the company's founder and chief executive. ''In New York or
California, it's easy to get products like ours because there are a
lot of specialty stores, but for consumers who aren't aware of our
line, the sites have been great.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites have also helped Joey New York's bottom line. Ms. Roer
said, ''The beauty sites account for about 15 percent of our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, niche products cannot live by the Web alone.
''The real question will be the rate of growth,'' said Varsha Rao,
Ms. Naficy's partner at eve.com. ''Can they grow fast enough on the
Net? It remains to be seen. They may need multiple points of
distribution. It could be a store, a catalog or their own site.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Carlino said: ''I don't believe you can exist just in the
virtual world. I think people need to see these lines in very
traditional places.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that when it comes to beauty, real-world retail
still reigns. The sensory component _ packaging, texture, color,
scent _ plays a critical role in selling cosmetics. Most consumers
want to touch before they buy, which is the weak point of online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts agree. ''The sites can't duplicate the
department-store experience,'' said Mike May, a digital commerce
analyst with Jupiter Communications. ''Sampling is going to have to
be a huge initiative for all these sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Karyn Schoenbart, a group president for tracking at the NPD
Group, said: ''When you go into a store like Saks and buy an
expensive product, there's a whole ambience that goes along with
that experience. I don't believe that beauty or apparel products
online are ever going to be as big as other types of online
products.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly are few bargains. Online prices for niche beauty
products are usually the same as retail. ''It's hard to find
discounted high-end cosmetics online,'' said Ms. Welsh, the beauty
author. ''It's the convenience factor, and that counts for a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger question remains: How will all these beauty sites
with similar names and products survive? ''Without question, many
of the sites, even the well-capitalized ones, are going to fall by
the wayside or be rolled into another operation,'' Mr. May said.
Ms. Schoenbart agreed, saying, ''I feel confident saying there's
going to be tremendous consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is happening already. In recent months, jasmin.com, a
fragrance site, was bought by Ashford.com, a luxury goods site, and
beauty.com was recently purchased by drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   The online winners, Mr. May said, may be those sites with a
retail link. ''This is where Sephora has an advantage,'' he said.
''It can drive sampling and first-time purchases at its
brick-and-mortar stores. And then they can move customers to the
Internet for speedy replenishment purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   For niche brands, getting their message out is most important,
and the Web is an effective tool, Ms. Schoenbart said. ''There are
a lot of ways to build brand equity, and the Web is certainly one
of them,'' she added
</P>
<P>
   But being the next Estee Lauder may not be every beauty maker's
intention. Small is beautiful, too. ''We're very happy about where
we are today,'' said Ms. Carlino, of Philosophy. ''I don't think we
need to be anywhere else. We're just not prepared to handle any
more distribution. We just aren't there yet. It will take another
three or four years to think about getting bigger. We can only
handle where we are today.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A crush of high school graduates, a flush economy, and changes
in the admissions process have made 2000 the most competitive year
ever for top students trying to gain entry to the college of their
choice, a survey of universities indicates.
</P>
<P>
   With many Ivy League colleges reporting record numbers of
applications, students from abroad and around the country
increasingly applying to colleges on the Internet, and more money
available for scholarships, the nation's top universities are
having to reject some of the best and brightest applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, for example, accepted its lowest percentage of applying
students this year. With a record 18,691 applications for 2,035
slots, the university turned down about 1,000 valedictorians, as
well as hundreds of students with perfect Scholastic Assessment
Test scores. Just since 1998, the percentage of applicants accepted
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has fallen from 23
percent to 15 percent. And even Boston University, which has cut
recruiting to reduce the size of incoming freshman classes,
continues to get record numbers of applications.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions officials at schools including Brown, Yale,
Dartmouth, Princeton, Cornell, Tufts, Williams, Stanford, and
Amherst also report being swamped with applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real story isn't just in the numbers,'' said Marlyn
McGrath Lewis, director of admissions at Harvard College. ``From
where we sit, for several years running, the strength and quality
of the pool of applicants is much higher, and we can really feel
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Top grades and high SAT scores still land applicants in the A
pile for consideration, but as schools receive a glut of such
statistically promising students, other more subjective factors are
used to determine the cream of the crop.
</P>
<P>
   As well known as it is that applicants are judged on more than
SATs and grade point averages, the nation's top high school seniors
need more than a position on the student council or a
resume-building weekend volunteering at a local soup kitchen to
edge out their competition, admissions directors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make our decisions solely on objective information,''
said Maria Laskaris, admissions director at Dartmouth. ``We look at
love of learning, curiosity, a willingness to question and debate,
depth of analysis, and recommendations that tell us more than a
student is bright and hard-working. That distinguishes successful
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, changing demographics have been the
most obvious explanation for the increased competition at top-tier
colleges. An ``echo baby boom,'' as some call it, is creating
increasingly larger numbers of 18-year-olds, and more of them are
applying to colleges every year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 2.8 million students who graduated from
high schools in the spring of 1997, a record 67 percent attended
college in the fall of 1998, according to federal figures.
</P>
<P>
   And those numbers are expected to increase through the next
decade. By the year 2012, according to the College Board, the
number of high school graduates will grow by 31 percent in the
West, 23 percent in the South, 17 percent in the Northeast, and 10
percent in the north-central states.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, however, the rise in the number of high school
graduates is supposed to peak sometime between 2004 and 2008,
according to the New England Board of Higher Education. And the
region is still recovering from a 15-year downturn in the number of
18-year-olds, which ended in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But since the rebound in population began _ New England public
and private colleges received more than 500,000 freshman
applications in 1999, a 7 percent increase from the previous year _
the competition only has gotten more intense, educators say. Last
year, 64 percent of the 217 undergraduate campuses in the region
saw an increase in freshman applications, according to the New
England Board of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enrollment in New England is down compared to the rest of the
country because we have had the nation's slowest-growing
population,'' said John Harney, executive editor of the board's
Connection magazine. ``Students can now study at less expensive
institutions elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasing mobility, virtual tours of universities via the
Internet, and the ease of applying electronically have erased
previous boundaries for bright high school seniors who might have
chosen to attend a college closer to home otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Though hard data are lacking, admissions officials say
competition has been boosted by the number of applications filed
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a huge reason for higher numbers of
applications,'' said Michael Goldberger, director of admissions at
Brown University in Providence. ``Kids today are doing a better job
investigating, and the colleges are a lot more accessible to them
this way. It's easier for them to apply to multiple institutions,
and the schools don't seem quite as far away.''
</P>
<P>
   The stiffening competition to get into Brown, which had a record
16,803 applicants this year for 2,541 places in the freshman class,
is also attributable to changes in the university's admissions
process, Goldberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, like Harvard, MIT, and Boston College, has dropped
restrictions that prevented students seeking early admission from
applying to other colleges. In the past, students could only apply
to such schools for an early December decision if they didn't seek
such early acceptance elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the difference almost immediately,'' Goldberger said.
``Our regular applications stayed the same, while our early action
candidates increased by 65 percent from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy has also played a role in attracting more
applications to top schools that otherwise may have been
off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   The surging stock market, for example, has helped raise
endowments at Harvard to nearly $15 billion, $7 billion at Yale, $5
billion at Princeton, and $4.5 billion at Stanford. The more money
the universities have, the more they can give in scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, nearly 50 percent of undergraduates this year will
receive some form of financial support from university resources, a
record for the school. The average grant will cover almost
two-thirds of the $33,100 it costs to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators also say rising SAT scores, aided by a growing
industry of test-prep services, have increased the number of
seniors who can consider applying to the top colleges.
</P>
<P>
   in Massachusetts, for example, high school students taking the
college-entry exam last year scored on average six points higher
than the previous year, and the scores have been improving steadily
since 1994. The average was 511 on both the math and verbal
sections of the SATs, with 78 percent of all high school students
in the state taking the test.
</P>
<P>
   But all the competition has hurt many hard-working high school
seniors and has put pressure on admissions committees and directors
to explain why top-tier candidates are rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The calls come in now every few hours, sometimes more
frequently, and it's often up to Lewis to explain to the angry
parent on the line why the student in question, maybe a
valedictorian with perfect SAT scores, didn't get into Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Laskaris at Dartmouth said she can hear it in the tone of
their voices. Sometimes it's the students who call, confused,
disappointed, and looking for answers. And as much as she tries to
explain the process, how a knack for fencing or leadership on the
student council might make the difference, she said it will never
be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not believe this, but it's painful turning away so
many promising candidates,'' Lewis said. ``All we can do is try to
tell people the truth: There was not any flaw in their son or
daughter's application; it's just other people were chosen instead.
Of course, that's a very unsatisfactory message.''

STAPLES HURT WHEN NEW, OLD ECONOMIES COLLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it wasn't the ideal moment to tell the world you were
gung-ho on electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   No one will compare the Staples Inc. stock slide of the last six
weeks to the kind of plunges suffered by investors in scores of
Internet companies, but there is little doubting a connection
between them.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples slump since March 1, which has cut the company's
stock price by 29.5 percent, also shows just how difficult it can
be to mix conventional business with new economy ventures and keep
shareholders happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many investors who own retail stocks are not the same people
who buy Internet stocks,'' said Staples chief executive Tom
Stemberg. ``In effect, a retailer actively pursuing e-commerce is
selling apples to orange buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing black and white about the recent Staples slide.
Continued interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve could hurt
business, though many retail stocks have climbed recently.
</P>
<P>
   Worries over how weaker competitors could hurt Staples's office
supply market persist. Some people wonder if the company's overhead
cost containment, which helped results in the most recent quarter,
can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no getting around the impact of comments by Staples
on March 2 about business at its Staples.com, which is expected to
sell as much as $250 million in tracking stock to the public,
probably later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Wall Street was starting to punish e-commerce companies
that spent relentlessly to bring business through the virtual door,
Staples announced it would accelerate online investments and
planned to lose $150 million on its Internet venture this year,
twice as much as previously forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was awful,'' said Rary Delaney, an analyst at Fleet
Investment Advisors, which owns Staples stock.
</P>
<P>
   Staples.com was knocking the cover off the ball in its fiscal
fourth quarter with sales that increased 80 percent from the
previous three months and 450 percent compared to the same period a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to capitalize on this is now,'' Staples.com president
Jeanne Lewis said in a statement at the time. The goal was
explicit: strike while the iron was hot and spend to win market
share by acquiring new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason for upping the spending was to be put in
the category of a very aggressive dot-com company with a land-grab
mentality,'' said Eileen Leary, an analyst at State Street Research
and Management, another big Staples investor.
</P>
<P>
   That led Aram Rubinson of PaineWebber to downgrade Staples to a
``neutral'' recommendation shortly after the announcement, though
he appeared to be the only brokerage analyst to cut his rating. ``I
think it's probably the biggest issue at the moment, whether the
existing shareholder base is willing to tolerate as aggressive
(Internet) spending as they are with a pure play,'' said Rubinson.
</P>
<P>
   Stemberg is not one to pin all of Staples's stock problems on
the company's more aggressive Internet expansion, but he agrees it
is a ``contributing factor.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with Staples executives, Stemberg says, ``I
discussed a number of factors that have contributed to the stock
decline, including that investors are not excited about our
aggressive spending decisions, decisions to take a leadership
position in the small business arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage analysts and institutional investors generally like
Staples's chances in the online world. It already has lots of
advantages start-up e-retailers spend a fortune to create: a valued
brand name, sophisticated order fullfillment operations and volume
that commands the best prices from suppliers. They have helped
generate online gross profit margins north of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Staples.com also brought in a blue-chip group of Internet
investors and venture capitalists for an early stake and seats on
an advisory board that also includes eBay Inc. chief Meg Whitman
and William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   But the type of large institutional shareholder who owns Staples
stock isn't necessarily thrilled about fast-spending Internet
ventures and Web investors aren't interested in conventional retail
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   When Staples.com goes public, it may help by creating stocks for
both categories. But Staples still will own the lion's share of its
online venture and therefore investors in the parent company will,
too. Who will stay and what will they demand?
</P>
<P>
   These are no easy questions and will be posed in many different
industries coping with the Internet for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail business is like an aircraft carrier _ investors
are looking for steadiness, healthy growth,'' Stemberg said.
``Internet businesses are more like cigarette boats that fly over
the waves and you are willing to take the bumps. The game is about
revenue growth. When you try to mix the two together, what you end
up with is something that is not entirely appealing to either
category,'' he said.

FROM BUFFALO GAP TO MANHATTAN, THIS TEXAN WRANGLES UP PLAIN GOOD
FOOD
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by COWBOY CUISINE-RECIPES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Perini is not a traditional ranch cook. He has certainly
rattled his chuck wagon across some of the biggest ranches in the
Southwest, but he has also prepared his Texas beef dishes at the
Governor's Mansion in Austin, and fed hundreds at sophisticated
gatherings in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He once hauled 5,000 pounds of mesquite across Japan to fuel his
fires and show Japanese homemakers how tender and juicy Texas beef
could be.
</P>
<P>
   But just a few days ago, while walking down New York's Fifth
Avenue, he let just a little tip of his rural roots show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buffalo Gap came out in me,'' he said with a laugh,
referring to his hometown just outside Abilene. ``I looked up and
saw a poster, and all my books there in the window and thought,
`Oh, my God, what has happened?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perini, owner of Buffalo Gap's acclaimed Perini Ranch
Steakhouse, is on a whirlwind promotional tour for his new
cookbook, ``Texas Cowboy Cooking'' (Time-Life Trade, $24.95). It is
a venture he never planned, never expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been invited to cook at National Arboretum in June of
last year,'' Perini explained by telephone from a Manhattan hotel.
``The arboretum has about 400 acres in Washington, D.C., and they
were having a big Texas fund-raiser. They wanted the whole thing: a
chuck wagon, cowboys, mesquite and Texas beef. They wanted a
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Perini gave it to them, and while the event was winding down and
people were filing by to offer their congratulations, one man
approached and asked if he had ever thought of doing a cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him no, I had not considered it, nor had any of the
English teachers I'd ever had,'' Perini said.
</P>
<P>
   The man offered his card and walked off. Later that night, as
Perini emptied his pockets at the hotel, he discovered that the man
was president of Time-Life Books.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make Perini consider a book. Later, when he
talked it over with friends, he became convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we developed is a combination of stories and histories,''
he said of ``Texas Cowboy Cooking.'' ``The photographs are
magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Perini's effort is a cookbook and a history lesson. Food
photographer Mark Davis filled the book with stunning photography,
but he had to fight for precious space with historical cowboy
artwork from Fort Worth's Amon Carter Museum, Sid Richardson
Collection of Western Art, and the Texas and Southwestern Cattle
Raisers Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   There are also photos from noted cowboy photographer Erwin E.
Smith, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, and the Swenson Land and
Cattle Co. in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary cowboy photography was done by Bob Moorhouse,
manager of the famed Pitchfork Ranch in Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   But the recipes are pure Perini: simple, unpretentious and full
of taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted real Texas food,'' Perini said of the cookbook
editors. ``This is the way we've always cooked. Our whole food
situation is that we want to do food that tastes good, looks good
and is recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do plate drawings. If you find a leaf on your plate,
it fell from a tree. Send it back to the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Perini began his ``beef'' career working on the other side of
the chuck wagon. He tried to run the family cattle business back in
the late 1960s, but was having a tough time. Between feeding and
doctoring cattle, he also cooked on the ranch wagon, finding that
work much more to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually developed a reputation for quality food, and soon
other ranches were calling, asking for his help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swensons would call and ask us to come over,'' Perini
said. ``They would have a sale or something, and we would cook for
their cowboys and guests. Eventually, we ended up cooking for the
Pitchfork, the Long X and the Matthews ranch. I ended up catering
all the big ranches.''
</P>
<P>
   As the catering business grew during the 1970s, the cattle
business continued to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watt Matthews of the Lambshead Ranch was kind of my mentor,''
Perini recalled. ``I would ask him a lot of questions, and he'd
help me. I remember telling him I was having a hard time, and he
told me he thought the best cross for a Hereford was a pumpjack.
Meaning it didn't hurt if the ranch had oil as well as cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Matthews advised Perini: ``You can honestly do more
for the beef industry by cooking it, instead of raising it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perini opened his Buffalo Gap restaurant in 1983 and launched
his full-scale food enterprise. His biggest boost came in 1995,
when he received a call from the prestigious James Beard House in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called and asked us to cook for them,'' he said. ``We
were very flattered, but I didn't call them back for two or three
days. I really thought it was a situation where they had made a
mistake. With a name like Perini, I figured they thought we were a
fancy Italian place.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the same week, the Governor's Mansion called and wanted
Perini to cook for an affair; then a friend in Abilene insisted
that Perini send samples of his peppered beef tenderloin to
newspapers and magazines around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Beard event was a tremendous success, as was the governor's
dinner. Parade magazine called to say it was going to do something
about the restaurant, and then The New York Times called asking for
another tenderloin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it turned out, The New York Times was having a contest for
the best mail-order food items in the country. We just sent them a
tenderloin to taste and they put it in the contest. They picked us
as the No. 1 mail-order gift, which was great, but we didn't have a
mail-order business,'' Perini confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Now he does, and the mesquite-grilled peppered beef tenderloin
is listed in the Neiman Marcus and the Williams-Sonoma catalogs. It
is also served on Northwest Airlines' European and Asian routes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not in the cookbook. Perini is willing to give up some of
his secrets, but not the one that established an entire mail-order
business all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   He does offer other Perini Ranch signature dishes, such as the
green chile hominy, zucchini Perini and bread pudding with whiskey
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   There are colorful recipes for drinks, side dishes, desserts and
breads. The Texas history and cowboy lore fill the book from front
to back. But the real essence of ``Texas Cowboy Cooking'' is
clearly the beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in simple food,'' Perini said. ``Most chefs
feel like they have to be creative to make food good. I want
something that just tastes right. I don't want a chicken-fried
steak with a mango glaze.''
</P>
<P>
   Perini recently made his third visit to the James Beard House,
this time kicking off his book tour with a menu of fried catfish,
chicken-fried rib-eye steaks with cream gravy, and fresh strawberry
shortcake made with buttermilk biscuits. He also offered his
mesquite-grilled peppered beef tenderloin.

MARATHON WINNER RAINSBERGER FINDS A NEW CAREER: COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lisa Rainsberger has the distinction of being the last
American woman to win the Boston Marathon, and she doesn't like it
one bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' said the woman who, as Lisa Weidenbach, crossed
the finish line first in 1985 and who will be in town this weekend
to celebrate the 15th anniversary of her victory. ``We have so many
talented young athletic girls and women in our country. It just
doesn't seem possible that we can't provide the support, coaching,
mentoring, and avenues to duplicate the marathon successes'' of US
athletes such as Joan Benoit Samuelson and Kim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, second in 1993, has the best recent finish of any
American woman at Boston. Last year the top American was Lynn
Jennings, who finished 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Still ranked the seventh-fastest American woman ever, thanks to
a personal best of 2:28:15 in 1989, Rainsberger, now 38, has had a
solid career. Although she's probably best known for finishing
fourth in three consecutive Olympic Marathon trials, she adds to
her Boston win a pair of back-to-back marathon victories in Chicago
(1989, 1990); a 48:28 15-kilometer time at the Cascade Run Off in
1989, which was then an American record; and a fifth place at the
1988 Olympic Trials at 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, Rainsberger has been forced to face the end
of her marathon career. While pregnant with her daughter Katie
Lynn, now 19 months old, she developed a 16-inch blood clot in the
femoral vein of her right leg, which couldn't be treated with
conventional drugs because of potential damage to the baby. So, she
explained, the clot basically solidified, with the veins
surrounding it taking up the duty of transporting blood back to her
heart. Although she can still run shorter distances and hopes to
become competitive again when she hits the masters circuit at age
40, running more than two hours or getting dehydrated now brings
excruciating pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if someone is taking a tourniquet and squeezing my
leg,'' said Rainsberger, whose hopes to run in Boston wearing bib
number 1985 in honor of her anniversary were dashed. ``My marathon
days, I think, are over. Rather than just beat myself up and
struggle with it, I'm at peace with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of running marathons, she has eagerly turned to
coaching. While in high school, Rainsberger lost a friend, Jeanne
Poll, to leukemia; when she was looking for a way to give back to
the sport, she called the Leukemia Society of America to ask if
they needed a coach. Answer: yes. So she began preparing some Team
in Training athletes near her home in Colorado Springs to run for
the charity at the 1998 Suzuki Rock 'n' Roll Marathon in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group I was coaching wouldn't let me quit,'' said
Rainsberger, explaining why she's still at it. ``They even started
paying me.'' She now coaches for Team Diabetes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Her stable has grown to include about 25 athletes, most of them
recreational, but one member, Theo Martin, turned in a 2 hour, 15
minute, 7 second debut at the California International Marathon
last December that makes him the eighth-fastest qualifier for the
men's Olympic Marathon Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since she started training me, I just started improving
each race,'' said the 25-year-old Martin, who went into Cal
International hoping to run 2:18 or 2:19. ``She's helped me make
that next step. Two steps, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   At Boston, Rainsberger will have five runners, including her
husband, Bud, 44, a partner in the firm of Carnick &AMP; Rainsberger
Financial Planners. ``Their whole excitement in going to Boston
gives me goosebumps,'' said the past champion, who said she figures
she'll be more stressed out watching the race than she would be if
she ran, ``probably because I'm helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   She was anything but in 1985. The 23-year-old, then living in
Marblehead, beat her closest rival by more than eight minutes on an
unseasonably warm day in which she clocked a 2:34:06. Although she
quickly apologized for the slow time, she was already on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a pedigree, so that when I spoke to people about
what I did or who I was, they seemed to understand,'' said
Rainsberger. ``Once, I told someone that I was a road racer, and
their response was, `Oh, you race cars?' When I tell people that I
have won the Boston Marathon, they understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder to understand is what it felt like to finish fourth in
three consecutive Olympic Trials (1984, 1988, 1992), just missing
the team each time. While some view it as remarkable consistency on
her part and others imagine it to have been unspeakably
frustrating, Rainsberger sees it, at least from this distance, as
merely three races in a long career.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think finishing fourth is devastating,'' she said.
``For a day, it's devastating. Finishing fourth was a lot harder on
those close to me because they didn't know how to react around me.
Sort of like when a friend gets divorced. What can you say to
them?''
</P>
<P>
   Making it to the Olympics, however, was a dream she held through
three decades and just as many sports. In 1980, Rainsberger, an
All-American swimmer for the University of Michigan, qualified for
the Olympic Trials in that sport, only to see them canceled because
of the boycott. Then came the marathon years, fruitful in many ways
but never yielding that Olympic berth. After the 1996 marathon
trials, in which she finished 19th, Rainsberger decided to combine
her talents for running and swimming and pin her hopes on training
for the triathlon, which will make its debut as an Olympic sport in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going very well,'' she said. ``Then I got pregnant.
She's my medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she added a new line to her athletic resume: race
director of the Cheyenne Mountain Sprint Triathlon, which includes
a children's category that lasts about 12 minutes. ``Some of these
kids are on tricycles,'' said Rainsberger, laughing. ``They're
allowed to have a parent in the transition area to help them tie
their shoes. One thing I have to do is give back to our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the state of distance running in America, Rainsberger is
not optimistic, calling it ``the bottom dweller of sports right
now.'' Asked what she would tell Craig Masback, CEO of USA Track &AMP;
Field, if he were to ask for her opinion on how to mend the sport,
she replied: ``I would need a great deal of his time. The solution
I see would take an entire generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a forum in which people like her could share their
opinions and ideas on the sport would be a start, she said.
Considering a national and regional system of clubs and teams for
children, led by USATF coaches, would be another. ``We have women's
soccer and women's hockey to look up to,'' she said. Lining up
financial support for post-collegiate athletes, with corporations
hiring athletes and creating teams the way Japan does, might be a
third option.
</P>
<P>
   As for the recent women's Olympic Marathon Trials, the first in
which she did not participate, Rainsberger called them a fiasco of
hot, hilly conditions and confusion over Olympic qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not just expect them to run with a 10-pound bag of flour
on their backs?'' she said. ``What hit the newspapers was the fact
that we had the slowest performance ever, and that's what our young
people read about.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, did she wish she'd been able to compete? Sure, she
said, the athlete in her will always want to be there. ``On the
other hand,'' she added, ``it's time for me to get off the fence
and voice my concerns, and maybe help if I'm asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like another new career.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ The game is over, and the W is in the books. The

   Yes, he is, and he's kind of amused with the transformation
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 26 or 27,'' he said with a laugh, ``the only thing
I'd be thinking about after a game was going home and drinking some
beer in my garage.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, deep into his third season as head coach of the Indiana
Pacers, he walks like a coach, talks like a coach, thinks like a
coach, and, most of all, agonizes like a coach.
</P>
<P>
   `You know,'' he said, ``when I played, if we were up 5 with two
minutes to go, I figured you could chalk it up. We're at Toronto
last Sunday, and there's just a couple of minutes left. Sam Perkins
hits a three to put us up 21. I said, `All right, maybe this is
over.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So what's with this ``contest'' business?
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy put a hand up on me, it never bothered me much,'' he
explained. ``But it really makes a difference. We keep track. I was
talking about this with (Indianapolis Star beat man) Mark Montieth
Tuesday, and I was just telling him that they shot 36 percent when
contested and 54 percent when uncontested.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   A coach never runs out of worries, but Bird will tell you this
for sure: He won't be worried about coaching matters much longer.
Catch him now, because he swears that when the Pacers' season is
over, no one will ever find him on the sidelines again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe him,'' said the Pacers' Jalen Rose. ``He's said from
Day 1 that he'll coach out this contract, and that's it. We've got
to make sure it ends with cigars and champagne. Hopefully, we're on
course for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are good, but no one believes they are that good.
They are an old, fragile team, with some obvious strengths and some
appalling weaknesses. They may have peaked in a seven-game series
with Chicago two years ago. It would be a significant achievement
for the Pacers to outmaneuver Miami and New York, not to mention
Philadelphia and Charlotte, and somehow win the Eastern Conference
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to come out of the East,'' Bird said, ``and it
could be us. If Shaq goes down, anything could happen. That's why I
stress, `Get there, and let's roll the dice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But win or lose, he is outta here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three years have gone by pretty fast; I'll tell you
that,'' he said. ``But I believe that three years are enough for
any coach, other than Pat Riley. And Jerry Sloan gets away with it.
It's all according to the kind of players you have. But, for me,
three years will be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Some slight interpretation is needed. What Larry said in
parenthesis is that three years in one place is about right for the
average guy in any average situation. As for Bird, the Pacers were
the only team he ever would have coached, and three is enough for
him. He has always pretty much thought that the coaching sun rose
and set on Riley, and he thinks that the Jazz are a realm unto
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   People in the organization are willing to accept it, but they
don't really understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so few players who come in and really get it, right
away,'' said general manager David Kahn. ``Larry did. And he's just
gotten better and better as a coach. It is very frustrating to see
him walk away when he is starting to master his craft.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mucky-mucks are sad about Bird's imminent departure, how
do you think the players feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe him,'' said Austin Croshere, Bird's first draft
choice. ``I wish it weren't true. He's a lot more hands-on this
year. He's taken more control in practice. He's more open
personally with the players. I think he's having a good time. He
coached in the summer league last year, and I sensed he really
liked being around the young kids who were just running up and down
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the funny part. Bird does like coaching. He just thinks
it's ``time.''
</P>
<P>
   He's satisfying his competitive urges. He's tapping into some
old feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to love winning on the road,'' he said. ``There was
nothing better. There still isn't. When we win a good one on the
road, I like to just sit in the office a little longer after the
game and soak it up. Of course, you know there's a love fest going
on out there on the floor, and I hate that. I don't want to see
that. It's a different league now. So I'll sit inside and enjoy
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He recognizes that it's all different with him than with most
other guys. He's got all the money he and several generations of
Birds will ever need. He's coaching because he wants to coach, not
because he has to. He took the Indiana job because it was the right
time, with the right franchise, with the right immediate boss
(Donnie Walsh), with the right owners (Herb and Melvin Simon), and
with a team that could win. Subtract any of these ingredients, and
he would not have taken the job, not that he needed a job. He
cannot imagine how gut-wrenching this life would be if he had to
coach generic Team X in order to put food on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand how guys are lifers at this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What no one can figure out is what Bird will do next. He
discovered just how quickly the golfing and fishing thing can get
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year I probably played five times a week,'' he said.
``At the end I was probably out there once a week _ if that.''
</P>
<P>
   When he took the Pacers job, he said it was, in part, because
coaching was the closest thing he could find to replicate the
competition he had relished during a 25-year playing career. So he
won't have that kick any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' he said, ``I'd love that. There just aren't too
many people out there you'd want to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   General managing or player personnel stuff?
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's left to do that really intrigues me,'' he
said, ``is to be able to put a team together. That would be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing cooking on any of these fronts. So what is
he going to do once he retires from coaching? A lot of people who
are interested in him from afar, not to mention many people who
really do know him, are concerned. What could possibly make Larry
Bird happy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Professionally?'' he said. ``Look, I've only been really happy
professionalwise for three weeks in my life _ the week after each
of the championships. Believe me, other than that, I've never been
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy around my kids, and I'm happy doing stuff with
(wife) Dinah. But professionally, it's always just grinding and
grinding and never remembering enough about the good games.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of kids, how would you like to be coach of a youth team
and see Larry Bird sitting in the stands? It happens. Connor Bird
is growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Connor's playing now,'' said Bird. ``The other day we
came home after a game and I thought of something Red used to say.
I told him, `Connor, you're out there in the living room, and the
action's in the kitchen.' I always liked that. But Connor's my
little M.L. Carr. When the other kids are out of the game, they're
waving to the crowd. But Connor is really watching the game, and
he's cheering for the other kids. Yup, he's my little M.L.''
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is that Bird will return to Naples and take at
least a year off. Let everyone else worry about what he's going to
do. Bird isn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, Larry. One year from today, you have no idea what you
might be doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' he said with a shake of his head. ``Absolutely no
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got antsy last time, he took the Pacers job. When he
gets antsy this time, he'll do something else. It's about that
simple.
</P>
<P>
   For the final time, would Larry Bird ever coach again, at any
level?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never do it again,'' he said. ``And not because I didn't
like it. It's been a ride. It's been competitive. It's been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   John Updike said, aropos of Ted Williams, that ``Gods don't
answer letters.'' They don't always have the same thought process
as we mortals, either. Larry Bird simply feels it's time for him to
go, and so nothing else matters.

   SC-FLAG _ COLUMBIA _ So far, the battle over South Carolina's
flying the Confederate battle flag atop the Statehouse has been
fought in public rallies, newspapers and broadcasts. Wednesday, the
skirmish moves to a body that has a real say in the debate: the
state Senate. Senators will try to hammer out a compromise that
will move the Civil War emblem to a spot on the Statehouse grounds
and off the penny-colored dome. It's widely thought that state Sen.
Glenn McConnell holds the key to compromise. The Charleston
Republican, who owns a Civil War memorabilia shop, has been
steadfast in his support of the flag. Moderates, though, are
hopeful he'll be the one to offer a compromise deal that ultimately
will be sent to the state House. Another pro-flag senator said
Wednesday will be ``Armageddon'' in the already fiery debate. South
Carolina is the only state that flies the battle flag from its
Capitol dome, though Mississippi and Georgia have incorporated the
design into their state flags. Debate starts at 11 a.m. Wednesday
and could drag into the weekend if needed. (Manuel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   PRIVATE-PRISONS _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla., _ With a state prison
crowding problem more than five years behind them, lawmakers are
contemplating what will happen if private prison companies start
importing murderers, drug dealers and other criminals from out of
state. Prison companies insist they have no plans to host the rest
of the country's inmate population in Florida, though they do own
vacant land. Since the state has no laws on this issue, corrections
officials say that leaves the door open to private companies could
building new prisons for out-of-state inmates, tomorrow with
virtually no state regulation. ``It's ridiculous,'' said Sen. Tom
Rossin, D-West Palm Beach. ``Why do we want to bring (inmates) from
out of state into the state? We have enough of our own problems.''

   TEST-PROTESTS (Great Barrington, Mass.) _ From the Berkshires to
Cambridge, brushfires of civil disobedience flared in classrooms
across Massachusetts on Wednesday, as hundreds of high school
sophomores, and dozens of fourth- and eighth-graders, boycotted the
first of nine days of statewide standardized testing. In a sign of
rising student and parent discontent with politicians' reliance on
such tests, the protests followed _ and exceeded _ similar
rebellions in recent months in Illinois, Ohio, Louisiana, Wisconsin
and Florida. Though most of the students in Massachusetts reported
to class as scheduled, they chose to write essays about their
opposition to testing rather than answer the questions posed. Some
of the students face disciplinary actions ranging from suspension
to having a failing test grade incorporated into their third

   UNILEVER-BEN&AMP;JERRYS (Undated) _ Unilever, which has been
shedding brands, makes two high-profile acquisitions in the United
States. As expected, it seems to have brought an end to the
skirmish for control of Ben &AMP; Jerry's by agreeing to pay $43.60 a
share, a total of $326 million. And, at the other end of the
calorie spectrum, it will buy SlimFast Foods for $2.3 billion,
adding the top producer of weight-loss products to its growing
nutrition business. In connection with the Ben &AMP; Jerry's purchase,
it will establish a formal structure for achieving socially

<P>
   JDN-REALTY (Atlanta) _ JDN Realty, an Atlanta real estate
investment trust and a major Wal-Mart partner, has uncovered
``discrepancies in cost and other information'' in leases and sales
with both Wal-Mart and Lowe's, its other big tenant. The company's
stock is down 25 percent on Wednesday _ on top of a huge drop that
came when JDN acknowledged in February that two of its executives
had received millions in unreported salary in the last five years.
Management experts criticize the company's board, which is packed
with friends and associates of top officers, for failing to react
to the original bad news. The continuing travails make JDN an
excellent case study of the conflicts between the interests of
shareholders and executives at small companies. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-TELECOMS (London) _ The auction for five licenses for
Britain's ``third generation'' mobile telephone systems is shaping
up as a windfall beyond the government's wildest dreams. The bids,
which have been rising day after day, now approach $25 billion,
twice the government's budget surplus. For the companies still
alive in the bidding, the prices are not out of line with
expectations of great demand when the dazzling new
telecommunications gear becomes available in two or three years. By
Alan Cowell.

   HKONG-AUSTRALIA-TELECOM (Hong Kong) _ Pacific Century CyberWorks
Ltd., which is acquiring Hong Kong's local telephone company, plans
to sell 40 percent of the mobile-phone business of Cable and

HOVAN ALL SET TO TACKLE THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Chris Hovan will gather up his belongings Wednesday,
load them in his new Ford Expedition, point himself in the general
direction of the Midwest, and begin the solitary drive back home to
Cleveland. He'll groove to a few tunes along the way. Nothing too
metallic. Or too boring. Maybe even some country music. Perhaps
Willie Nelson crooning ``On the Road Again'' would be appropriate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just some easy listening,'' he said with a laugh. ``I don't
want to get too hyped up before Saturday because I know that's how
I am. That's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovan will be alone with his thoughts on the way home to
Cleveland, where his football career began as a standout defensive
lineman at St. Ignatius High. ``He started out as a linebacker in
the fifth- and sixth-grade recreational league,'' recalled Hovan's
father, Dennis. ``But he just kept moving up and up as he kept
getting better and better. By the time he got to the seventh- and
eighth-grade parochial school league, they started flopping him
over and playing him on both sides of the line. He never came out
of the game except for halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, that career will come full circle when the
All-American defensive tackle from Boston College is selected in
the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Hovan made certain of his future employment with an eye-opening
performance in the NFL scouting combine in February in
Indianapolis, where the 6-foot-2 1/2-inch, 305-pounder had several
scouts doing double-takes. He ran a 4.8 in the 40-yard dash, pumped
out 32 repetitions in the 225-pound bench press, clocked a 4.16 in
the short shuttle run, and recorded a 30-inch vertical leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest knock on me going to the combine was my
athleticism,'' said Hovan, who devoted a considerable amount of
time after his stellar senior season working with BC's assistant
strength and conditioning coach, John Whitesides. ``I knew what I
could do and I knew what I had to do to prove these people wrong.
So we worked on the 40, we worked on the short shuttle, the bench,
the vertical, the three-cone drill . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``People were really, really happy, and I turned a lot of
people's heads. I went through the line drills really fluidly, and
I was able to open the eyes of some GMs and coaches, so that was
the main focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The only questions that remain for draft day are: What round?
And which team?
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the first round, as predicted in The Sporting News,
which ranked Hovan second behind Florida State's Corey Simon among
a strong class of defensive tackles?
</P>
<P>
   And will it be the Packers who select him? The Giants? Jets?
Steelers? Eagles? Colts? Seahawks? Or Raiders? All have expressed
an interest.
</P>
<P>
   What questions could NFL scouts possibly have about Hovan now?
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been that many,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien.
``Everybody calls and basically asks the same thing. Nowadays,
character seems to be a much more important question. Will he
practice? Will he play hurt? Those kind of things are what they
generally ask about everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hovan's case, that was never the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the one kid who improved, both on the field and
off, every single year in my three years here so far,'' O'Brien
said.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year starter at BC, Hovan was regarded as a tireless
worker in the weight room and the strongest player on the team for
the last three seasons. Noted for the eye-black he smears on his
face, Hovan gained more notoriety when he wrapped up his senior
year by making 75 tackles (47 unassisted, 20 for losses, including
11 sacks). He became the first BC player to be named All-Big East
first team three consecutive years, and he was a first-team
selection to the Burger King/AFCA All-America team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a player like him,'' said BC defensive line
coach Mike London, ``you try to put him in as advantageous position
as possible, so we moved him around a lot and tried to put him in
match-up situations where we could best utilize his abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hovan plans to utilize those abilities in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any draft hopeful where he would prefer to play, and
invariably the answer will be: ``Anywhere.'' But ask Hovan, and
he'll tell you, straight up, it would be for his hometown Browns.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows it is not likely, given Cleveland's pole position
in the draft order and the expectation Penn State defensive end
Courtney Brown will be the first player taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when you're a kid you always love your hometown
team,'' he said. ``I've got to the point in my life where I love
football so much that I just want to play anywhere where I can play
right now. I just can't wait to play in the NFL right now. If a
team wants me more than another team, then that's where my heart
and soul is going to be _ with that team. So, really, you start up
with the team that wants you and, hopefully, you end up that way,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one player he targeted during his workouts at the
combine: Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney Brown will probably be the No. 1 pick,'' Hovan said.
``He's a very good player and he's a great pass rusher and he's a
talent that hasn't come around for a long, long time. Hopefully,
for myself, I'm neck-and-neck with Corey Simon. That was the main
goal. If it wasn't to jump ahead, then to make people think twice
about us. I wanted to make people think, `Chris Hovan's got a lot
to offer, and Corey Simon's a great player, too. This is a tough
choice.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, by the style I play, they'll choose me ahead of
him. That was the main focus, to go down there and jump out to No.
1 tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all up to the GMs and coaches now. It's their decision
now. Certain coaches have talked to me and interviewed me, and it's
going to be the team's preference, so we'll just see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the player London described as ``a guy who has a great
motor'' will crank it up one more time, hit the road, and head for
home, where he plans to spend draft day surrounded by family and
friends to get the phone call for which he's waited his entire
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited,'' he said. ``It's something that I've been
dreaming about since I was a little kid. Now the opportunity has
arisen and I'm just getting ready and excited, and I just can't
wait.''

<P>
   HINGHAM, Mass. _ Poor John Danehy. The only time he's been able
to find to fertilize his evergreens is at 6:30 in the morning. He's
temporarily given up jogging, he's cut his tennis time in half, and
he hasn't given skiing a moment's thought all winter. Even worse,
his baseball pals went to Opening Day at Fenway Park Tuesday
without him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Danehy is spending about 80 hours hunkered down inside
his carpeted office here. Just as he did last week. And the week
before that. His tie is loosened only slightly (he's a certified
public accountant, after all), but he's besieged on all sides by
the tools of the season. His files bulge. His computer purrs. His
telephone jangles. And visions of itemized deductions dance in his
head.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Danehy is no undertaker, but if death is indeed
one of life's only two certainties, he represents the other: taxes.
He's an income tax preparer, one of the uncounted tens of thousands
of paid professionals assisting roughly half of the country's 126
million individual taxpayers with their 1999 returns. Normally the
tax season runs from approximately February 1 to precisely April
15, but this year, because of the upcoming holiday weekend, it will
last three days longer for those of us _ meaning the residents of
the six New England states and upstate New York _ who file at the
Andover IRS Center. That means that Danehy, a ``sole practitioner''
with one full-time employee, has until Tuesday to labor over
returns for the 220 or so of his 320 individual clients who aren't
taking a four-month filing extension.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why the folks who pay him $250 and up (and whose
incomes range from modest five figures to low seven figures) have
this year been in no particular hurry to bring him their requisite
data. For his part, Danehy is puzzled by their tardiness. ``I
thought the good weather would bring 'em in, because usually even a
snowflake causes them to cancel appointments,'' he says. ``So now
my theory is that people are doing so well in this economy that
most of them owe the government money. And since they knew they
weren't getting refunds, they were reluctant to come in early.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighs. ``In February, I was sitting here twiddling my
thumbs,'' he laments.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is not only self-employed accountants who are
experiencing the annual tensions of tax season. A mixed bag
consisting of lawyers, IRS-certified ``enrolled agents,'' and
just-plain kitchen-table types also plies the tax-prep trade.
There's Mary Lou Wilson, an H&AMP;R Block employee who is one of the
company's nearly 50,000 tax preparers and who will personally turn
out about 600 returns by Tuesday. There's Richard Eckstein of the
accounting firm of Walter &AMP; Shuffain PC, who takes his clients'
data home at night, cranks up his PC, and works ``until I can't do
it anymore.'' There's Lynne McLaren, an enrolled agent who labors
alone in a second-floor walk-up, a well-heated office where a copy
of the original Form 1040, vintage 1913, hangs on the wall. There's
Eric Weinstein, a second-generation tax preparer who works in
storefront and sells cars when he's not crunching numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But while tax preparers differ, their high season does not, and
Danehy's is typical: He simply hits the pause button on his
nonprofessional life. ``Between February 1 and the middle of April,
I don't pick up a paintbrush or a snow shovel unless it's an
absolute emergency,'' he muses. (When Tax Season '78 turned into
the Blizzard of '78, Danehy went to work anyway and, after his car
was hit by a snowplow, was stranded on Route 128 while police
evacuated his pregnant wife from their heatless home.)
</P>
<P>
   Capital gains? Income from estates and trusts? IRA
distributions? Danehy wrestles with such gremlins until long after
sundown, whereupon, having skipped lunch yet again, he hauls
himself home to eat a late dinner before invariably falling asleep
on the sofa in front of the family television set.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that more than 25 tax seasons have robbed him of
considerable time with his three daughters, now grown, but there
was at least one instance of payback along the way: Several years
ago, after their father dozed off in front of the TV, the trio
placed bows in his hair, put lipstick on his mouth, and painted his
nails. ``The next morning, he showered and went to work,'' says his
youngest daughter, Liz Danehy. ``While he was meeting with a client
he noticed that his pinky nail was still painted red. Needless to
say, he wasn't happy with us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for him at this time of year,'' says Danehy's wife,
Mary, whom he wed 27 years ago. (``Notice I got married after tax
season ended,'' John Danehy points out.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just dragging when he comes home,'' Mary says. ``He's not
physically tired. He's mentally exhausted. I don't know how he
thinks straight.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of most days, Danehy admits, he doesn't. ``I know
it's time to go home when I start making mental errors and snapping
at people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Danehy will do his best to limit his appointments over the next
few days, leaving time not only for last-minute details but also
for the type of client who showed up on his doorstep one April 14:
a clinical psychologist who in the previous year had married twice,
had divorced once, had worked in two states, had lived in a third,
and had worked two jobs. ``It took three days just to figure out
what his marital status was,'' Danehy says. ``Needless to say, I
filed an extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Danehy's clients include four senior military officers, three
authors, a restaurateur who gains income in both Massachusetts and
Florida, a United Nations employee in Mozambique, and a US
physician with Canadian income. He prepares about 40 out-of-state
returns. Like most tax prepararers, he is extremely grateful for
the commercial diagnostic software _ for which he says he pays
about $3,000 a year _ that helps him wind his way through the
growing complexities of US tax law. ``I do not,'' he says, ``wear a
green visor or a pocket protector.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the returns that Danehy prepares are for
working couples, but something has clearly changed in the world of
family finance. ``With the over-50 types, it's the guy who watches
the money,'' the accountant explains. ``Among younger couples, it's
often the wife who's the more financially savvy about personal
financial matters. That's true even if she's a stay-at-home wife. I
have big-income guys who can't do their taxes without calling their
wives.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, John Danehy will go out for a celebratory dinner
with the five other accountants who rent space in the same office
condominium. Sometime thereafter, he and his wife will leave for
their annual post-tax-season vacation to a yet-to-be-determined
destination. Then he'll come back to his office to face the 100 or
so 1999 tax returns for which he has filed an extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Including,'' he points out wearily, ``my own.''

CARAMEL OR PECANS _ THE SLICE IS RIGHT

<P>
   Kathryn Moore of Bedford, Texas, sent in the requested recipe
for caramel pie. She writes, ``My grandmother, Bertha Reese White,
and my mother-in-law, Opal Lathrup Moore, and her mother, Tommie
Lathrup, made wonderful homemade caramel cream pies. I am sending
two lists of ingredients, and the directions are the same for both.
I hope this is exactly the taste that the reader is looking for. I
must admit that I never took the trouble to make this pie, but it
makes my mouth water just thinking about the caramel smell and
taste in my grandmother's kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda B. Dickson of Arlington, Texas, sent the cake recipe. She
writes that this recipe was originally on the back of an Imperial
Brown Sugar box, probably in the early 1970s, and is named harvest
pecan cake. ``The first time I made it,'' she writes, ``there was
an immediate addition to my `favorite' list. The rich, dark color
and the wonderful taste of pecans made it a winner that I serve at
special occasions and just because.''

JANE JACOBS'S NEW YORK STATE OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jane Jacobs doesn't look much like a folk hero. She
seems more like a figure from a Roz Chast cartoon in The New Yorker
_ the frumpy lady with white bangs, beaked nose, big glasses, and a
jolly smile that makes her face beam.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, though: Jacobs once terrified the powers of
this city. She led protest brigades, saved whole neighborhoods from
the wrecking ball, inspired generations of community activists, and
changed the way urban planners, scholars, and ordinary citizens
think about cities.
</P>
<P>
   She left New York for Toronto 32 years ago and carried on there,
stopping an expressway that threatened to cut through the middle of
the city practically the moment she arrived. She has rarely come
back to her old hometown in the decades since. But when she visited
late last month, to speak at the Public Library and promote her new
book, ``The Nature of Economies'' (Modern Library), hundreds packed
the hall to cheer her return.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, sitting in her hotel room on the Upper East Side,
Jacobs said she has no regrets about leaving all those years ago,
but she retains her love for New York _ ``it has so much vitality,
so much pizazz.'' And while she despairs at its many problems, she
is pleased with how much the place has improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``One good thing about getting old,'' said Jacobs, who is now
84, ``is you get to see how things turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, New York has improved to the degree that it has
followed Jane Jacobs' advice, and it has serious shortcomings to
the degree that it has ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Jacobs wrote ``The Death and Life of Great American
Cities,'' and if she had never written another word or committed
another act, her place in history would be secure. An audacious and
clear-headed tome, written by a mother in her mid-40s who never
went to college, it famously began:
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is an attack on current city planning and
rebuilding. It is also, and mostly, an attempt to introduce new
principles of city planning and rebuilding, different and even
opposite from those now taught in everything from schools of
architecture and planning to the Sunday supplements and women's
magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the high priests of urban planning touted the
bulldozing of disorderly neighborhoods for massive expressways and
sterile towers (and called it ``urban renewal''), Jacobs celebrated
the hubbub of unplanned diversity and the spontaneity of the
sidewalk, which she viewed as ``the art form of the city'' and its
true source of vitality and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Back then she lived on Hudson Street, in the West Village, the
area of Manhattan that most matched her ideal _ short, winding
blocks, with a mix of old and new buildings, residential and
commercial, and lots of people out on the street, for lots of
different reasons, at all hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, when urban planners tried to declare her
neighborhood a ``slum'' and raze it for high-rises, Jacobs led the
opposition and won the battle. She even designed an alternative
plan for a big middle-income apartment complex that could be built
in the area without tearing down anything (the West Village Houses,
still the happy home of hundreds).
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, when the city planned to build an expressway
to connect the Holland Tunnel with the Manhattan and Williamsburg
bridges _ essentially wiping SoHo off the map _ she jumped into
action again, this time dealing Robert Moses, the most powerful
builder-destroyer in New York's history, his first major defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Berman, the cultural historian, saw her victory as a
turning point, a decisive acceptance of the idea ``that the street
and the neighborhood were the very heart of city life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of her victory, Jacobs _ disgusted by the US
government's involvement in the Vietnam War, and feeling alienated
by its harsh suppression of the antiwar protests _ moved to Toronto
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration of New York City in the early 1970s deepened
her mood. ``When I'd come back and visit,'' she recalled, ``I would
realize how sad I had been getting with the way things were getting
continually worse _ and how happy I was with the way things in
Toronto were getting wonderfully better, how this improved the
spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, she went all the way and became a Canadian citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more civil society than America,'' she said of her
adopted homeland. ``I like that civility. But it does have its
drawbacks. It's hard to know really what people are thinking, and
it's considered impolite to ask. In New York, people don't mind
telling you, `What you said was stupid!' In Canada, it's a little
like talking to a pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs's new book is written in the form of a spirited
conversation among four friends. ``I was going to set it in
Toronto, but I couldn't get my characters to argue with each
other,'' she said with a cackle of a laugh. ``I was at my wits' end
with writer's block. So I put them in New York _ wow, that was
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   The five books she has written since moving have taken on the
same themes as ``Death and Life of Great American Cities.'' ``The
Economy of Cities'' (1969) analyzed how cities spur the economic
rise and fall of regions and nations. ``Cities and the Wealth of
Nations'' (1984) cast cities as the driving force behind global
development.
</P>
<P>
   Her new book posits the idea that cities, and economic systems
in general, work according to the same principles as the ecosystems
in nature. ``I've been getting broader and broader,'' she said,
again with a laugh. ``First cities, then the world, now the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an idea that she began pondering 30 years ago. ``I didn't
know I was thinking about a particular book,'' she said. ``I was
just noticing things that were adding up.''
</P>
<P>
   Failed foreign-aid projects, the downfall of Detroit, the
ruination of farmland in Uzbekistan, deserts that never bloom _ all
had a similar cause: a lack of diversity, which, as she had found
in her earliest studies of cities, was essential to refueling and
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to understand how innovation occurs
successfully and how diversity grows successfully,'' she said,
``because we can do better whenever we introduce new methods, new
products _ and that requires economies that can develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream economists have long viewed specialization as the
best avenue for growth, especially for poor regions or Third World
countries. Jacobs sees it as the surest road to failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada used to try to help its poor regions with these big
projects,'' she recalled. ``They'd put a big factory out in the
middle of nowhere to make heavy water for a nuclear power plant. Or
they put a great big cucumber project in Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is,'' she went on, ``they didn't realize
development doesn't happen in isolation. You need other things to
sustain life in a community, and these other things never
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely the widespread fear about New York City: that
its latest economic boom is so dependent on Wall Street, if the
stock market collapses, the city will, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs doesn't accept this line entirely. ``Compared with any
other city, New York is amazingly diversified,'' she said. But she
too considers it more vulnerable than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem, not only in New York but throughout
America,'' she noted, ``is there is so little manufacturing. A lot
of manufacturing has been lost for good reasons: the products have
become so obsolete or it's become more economical to produce
somewhere else. But why is this the case? It comes down to
innovation. The design and improvement of computers _ we've become
very good at that. But manufacturing computers is not done at all
in America. Taiwan can outdo America. It's not just low wages _
wages have been rising in Taiwan. It has to do with our methods of
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York used to take the lead in solving common problems _
problems of health, transportation, social problems. It hasn't been
so good at this lately. It hasn't been in the forefront of the
waste-and-garbage problem and how you recycle.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has also been trapped in the rut of subsidizing what
Jacobs calls ``vicious circles.'' For example, rent controls have
dampened incentives to build new housing. But if controls were
lifted, housing might not be stimulated anyway, unless other things
changed at the same time _ for instance, lower construction costs,
which are part of the reason for controls to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone who's a drug addict because his life is
miserable,'' she said. ``You can't take care of one without the
other. This sort of dynamic can reach a point of no return, where
the vicious circle gets so gridlocked, you can't do anything about
it.'' What happens then? She shrugged and replied, ``You die.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways out of the circle. She points to the conversion
of moribund factory buildings to residential lofts, and how that
revitalized lower Manhattan. She traces the origins of the
canned-fruit business in early-20th-century San Francisco and how
it spawned a rich complex of enterprises _ in agriculture,
glassware, tin, and ironworks _ that kept the city from
deteriorating after the collapse of the Gold Rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way that dynamic systems can stay alive is constant
self-renewal,'' she said. ``That goes for a person, a city, a
species, a biomass, whatever.'' By that measure, Jane Jacobs should
be around for quite a while longer.

GOVERNOR HAPLESS HITS BOTTOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opening Day for the Red Sox was Closing Day for public
confidence in the Cellucci administration. Far from the madding
crowd at Fenway, the governor skulked in Washington, proffering his
figurative knuckles for a stern rap-rap-rap from the federal
officials who have shoveled billions in US taxpayer cash into the
bottomless pit known as the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   Catching the spear for the most incompetent state administration
in living memory is James Kerasiotes, the outgoing Turnpike czar
whose management, competence, and veracity have been called into
question by a lengthening train of auditors, accountants,
administrators, and accusers. Cellucci can't fire himself; more's
the pity. The hapless successor to William Weld, elected by a
margin of 3 percent two years ago on promising ``the Big Dig is on
time and on budget,'' is drowning in bad news, red ink, redder
faces, and bleak prospects for any immediate turnaround in his
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Having bragged to The Wall Street Journal months ago that
Cellucci was afraid to fire him, Kerasiotes ran out of excuses and
friends in high places at just about the same time. Having insulted
the governor's top two aides as ``a reptile'' and ``a moron'' in
that same interview, Jimmy the K saw his fate debated Tuesday in
Cellucci's inner sanctum by the fraidy cat, the reptile, and the
moron. Did anybody say what goes around comes around?
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, like a tenderfoot out on a wilderness trek who is
about to lose his guide, looks skyward for help. If I fire Jim, he
murmurs, who do I get to take the job? What if Kerasiotes decides
to get even with me by spilling more beans? How much more grief can
I take? With his lieutenant governor hung up between dubious
helicopter flights to family meals and smarting aides drafted to
baby-sitting duties, with a string of appointees crashing and
burning in the wake of various behavioral lapses, with a business
community concluding he is not a go-through guy, and with a largely
hostile media crowd convinced he is a dope, Cellucci has to face
the music.
</P>
<P>
   His tendencies over the three years he has been running the shop
betray a simple pattern: provoke a fight, blame the other guy,
throw large dollops of tax-cut promises, capital punishment vows,
and other raw meat items at the media, and pray that economic boom
times will let everything blow over.
</P>
<P>
   He still blames Mike Dukakis for anything that went wrong. He
blames the Legislature for ``lunacy'' when they point out, ahem,
er, Guv, your tax cut won't fly with a $2 billion overrun. He
blamed the Massachusetts congressional delegation, all Democrats,
for failing to loot the federal treasury of even more reimbursement
money than has already been filched.
</P>
<P>
   But all those mythical fall guys evaporated as the Big Dig
hemorrhaged cash. Every time a shovel dipped further into the muck,
more problems appeared. At $1.7 billion per mile, it is the
priciest roadway on the planet. The moon could be paved over for
what this will cost.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci's political aspirations fed off Big Dig money.
Contractors and insurers and all manner of pie-slicers and
pork-choppers forked over dump truck loads of campaign
contributions. Unions that could be suborned by shadowy promises
broke ranks with Democratic rival Scott Harshbarger. Hundreds of
new pickup trucks, thousands of new mortgages, countless fancy
meals and trips to the Cape and beyond, were financed by Big Dig
cash flow. Dozens of cops make more than $100,000 a year, thanks to
Big Dig details.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't we hear anything about the lies and deceit of the
overruns? ``Because everybody was getting their money,'' explained
a veteran criminal investigator appraising the debacle. ``No one
spoke up because the money kept coming. It's when the money stops
that stuff starts to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about this simple question: How come barely one person in
a thousand knows the name of the big cheeses involved in the Big
Dig? Because they never raised a ruckus. Why no ruckus? They got
just about everything they wanted from Mr. Big. Kerasiotes
extracted signed promises from staff not to reveal financial
secrets. He bullied underlings. He threatened outsiders with
ostracism or political retribution from the Cellucci machine.
</P>
<P>
   The whole scheme was stitched together with cash _ most of it
from Washington, until the federal government got wind of the
debacle. Now the state will be penalized. The Massachusetts
taxpayer will have to dig deeper. Cellucci's income tax cut
referendum on the November ballot is a huge hoax. Bridge and
highway projects around the state will expire, throttled in the
cradle, because the Big Dig cannot be left uncompleted.
</P>
<P>
   But Uncle Sam holds the purse strings now. Kerasiotes's chief of
staff mocked the feds' investigation as ``silly season.'' But who's
laughing now? The congressmen Cellucci had his henchmen denounce
are all that stands between the Massachusetts taxpayers and a
vengeful federal establishment. Grandstanding at home by promising
a big income tax cut while pleading poverty in D.C. does not cut
it. Somebody has to explain that simple fact to Cellucci. The
newspapers tried. The legislative chiefs tried. The Massachusetts
Taxpayers Foundation tried. But he's the governor who doesn't get
it. Which is why Kerasiotes will have to get it. Because governors,
no matter how incompetent, can't fire themselves.

POLITICIAN'S BEST FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their feelings are easily hurt and their self-esteem is shaky.
When an opponent mentions voting records, they holler ``Negative
campaigning!'' If rivals cast doubt on their abilities, they
scream, ``Personal attack!'' Today's candidates whine and whimper
like nap-deprived children. Instead of complaining, they should
each get a dog.
</P>
<P>
   One small terrier, Fala, figured in the most satisfying response
to criticism in the history of presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, running for a fourth term, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
looked every one of his 62 years. His opponent, Thomas E. Dewey, a
Republican racket-buster before becoming governor of New York, was
42. He charged that FDR's administration had become ``old and tired
and quarrelsome in office.'' Dewey did not oppose New Deal
programs, which caused Republicans to grouse about ``me-tooism,''
but which also made him a formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt had more to worry about than Dewey. In July, a month
after the successful Allied invasion of Normandy, he traveled to
Hawaii to meet with Admiral Chester W. Nimitz and General Douglas
MacArthur about the conduct of World War II, then toured Pacific
military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Roosevelt Republicans in Congress had targeted his wife,
Eleanor, and his sons, who were serving in the military. Then,
Representative Harold Knutson of Michigan charged that a Navy ship
had traveled 1,000 miles to fetch Fala, forgotten in Alaska. The
House majority leader, John W. McCormack of Massachusetts, called
the Navy to determine the facts, and said, ``The dog was never
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In speeches at Bremerton, Wash., and San Diego, FDR looked as
old and tired as Dewey had alleged. As the war and homefront
rationing dragged on, he abandoned his nonpolitical strategy and
spoke on Sept. 23 to a friendly audience, the Teamsters Union, and
to voters via radio. The familiar grin reappeared as he warned that
in election years, Republicans ``suddenly discover that they really
love labor . . . Can the Old Guard pass itself as the New Deal? I
think not.''
</P>
<P>
   With the hotel audience and the nation securely in his grip, his
baritone slowed into mock mournfulness. ``These Republican leaders
have not been content with attacks on me or my wife or my sons. No,
not content with that, they now include my little dog Fala,'' FDR
said, igniting laughter and allowing him to slow down even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course, I don't resent attacks, and my family doesn't
resent attacks, but Fala does resent them,'' the president said, to
more laughter. ``You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, as
soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers, in Congress
and out, had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the
Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him _ at a
cost to the taxpayers of two or three or eight or twenty million
dollars _ his Scotch soul was furious. He has not been the same dog
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooting and hollering, banging the tables, the Teamsters wanted
more, as did millions at home. FDR complied, with patrician
earnestness: ``I am accustomed to hearing malicious falsehoods
about myself, such as the old worm-eaten chestnut that I have
represented myself as indispensable. But I think I have a right to
resent, to object to libelous statements about my dog!''
</P>
<P>
   In response to what a Reader's Digest feature called ``the
perfect squelch,'' Dewey said, ``Mr. Roosevelt designed that speech
to make me angry, and he has. The result is that I will now
campaign all the harder.'' Yeah, right. Roosevelt won 432 electoral
votes. Dewey won 99.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs do not guarantee presidential serenity. Richard Nixon, who
owned Checkers, complained about a left-wing conspiracy. The wife
of Bill Clinton, who has Buddy, alleged a right-wing conspiracy.
But a fragile ego can benefit from canine companionship, especially
if it's a dog like Fala, who was, at one crucial moment in 1944,
one man's best friend.

FAMOUS SONGWRITER EXPLAINS HIS JOURNEY TO ISLAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a young boy named Steven Demetre Georgiou, his religious
identity was muddled _ his father was Greek Orthodox from Cyprus,
his mother a Baptist from Sweden, and his teachers were nuns at a
Catholic school in London.
</P>
<P>
   As a young pop singer named Cat Stevens, he flirted with
Buddhism, astrology, and even Pythagorean numerology on what he now
describes as a quest for truth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as an adult who has taken the name Yusuf Islam, he is a
devout Muslim who is trying to use his fame to spread the word of
his adopted religion.
</P>
<P>
   The songwriter has only recently begun to reenter the world of
music _ he won't play the guitar but he has resumed singing and
songwriting _ and he is now on a speaking tour in the United States
to promote two albums and to explain, in his words, ``why this rock
star who seemed to have everything going for him would hang up his
guitar and say goodbye to that kind of world.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance at Harvard University this week, Islam said
becoming a Muslim at age 28 came after years on a spiritual quest
triggered by a harrowing bout with tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wrote the song `Peace Train,' where was the peace train
going? I didn't know, but I felt I was on it, on this kind of holy
journey to the station of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his introduction to Islam came when his brother, knowing
he was on a spiritual quest, gave him a copy of the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found my place and my identity,'' Islam said, adding that
every question he had was answered in the Koran, the sacred book of
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   But he complained that since his conversion, his words about
Islam have been ignored or sensationalized in the media. He was
particularly critical of news coverage of his remarks a decade ago
about author Salman Rushdie, although he did not recant from or
apologize for his position that Islamic law would allow capital
punishment for what Islam described as the author's unrepentant
blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Islam complained that the very question posed to him
about Rushdie was ``cunning,'' an effort to hurt his image.
</P>
<P>
   Islam sold his guitars when he became a Muslim, and says he is
not willing to play the guitar any longer because the music might
be offensive to some orthodox Muslims. But he said he has resumed
singing, starting in 1995, recording a few new songs, reissuing old
songs, and recording spoken-word albums about Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Islam now has two new albums on the market, ``The Very Best of
Cat Stevens,'' a greatest hits album featuring a previously
unreleased recording, and ``A is for Allah,'' a children's album
about Islam.

   Question of the Week
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is mortal sin?
</P>
<P>
   Mortal sin is the most serious level of sin in Christianity and
is a term generally applied to violent actions such as murder and
to extreme heretical actions such as the denial of God, also called
apostasy.
</P>
<P>
   Most Christian traditions hold that people who commit mortal
sins are not eligible for salvation unless they are absolved of
their sins by a clergyman. Catholics consider abortion, as the
taking of a human life, to be a mortal sin.
</P>
<P>
   Although mortal sin is one of the oldest concepts in
Christianity, theologians today are reshaping the language they use
to talk about mortal sin and the importance of mortal sin in
society. The theologians talk of punishment for mortal sin not as
hell, but as life without God.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of mortal sin is understood not so much in terms of
an action we do, but in terms of breaking our relationship with
God,'' said the Rev. Robert M. Friday of the Catholic University of
America. Contemporary theologians _ unlike their medieval
predecessors _ also increasingly view mortal sin as rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time, particularly from the 15th to 17th
centuries, when the assumption was that people were sinning
frequently, and in some old manuals almost anything that had to do
with sexuality was considered a grave matter, so that an adolescent
boy daydreaming was almost as malicious as the dreadful violent
rape,'' said Boston College theologian Thomas Groome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contemporary Catholic theology would say that an ordinary,
everyday struggling human being never sins mortally. A mortal sin
is not the incidental haphazard lapse. Very few ordinary struggling
people commit mortal sins.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holiday of the Week
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   April 12 is Ramnavami, a Hindu holiday honoring the birth of
Rama. Rama is a popular Hindu deity, thought to be one of the two
most important incarnations of Vishnu, the god who preserves the
cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Rama is revered as a paragon of moral virtue _ at a time of
polygamy, he only had one wife and was loyal to her. And he was
said to be an accomplished warrior _ he was a king and military
leader who vanquished demonic opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rama has become very important in the modern Hindu
imagination,'' said Arvind Sharma, a professor of comparative
religion at McGill University. ``He is very upright and martial,
and he symbolizes the persistence of the Hindu hope for some kind
of restoration of his power.''
</P>
<P>
   The central feature of celebrations of Ramnavami is the ritual
recitation of the Ramayana, which is an epic narrative describing
Rama's life. The Hindi version is embellished with homilies and
narratives, and accomplished speakers can expound on the text for
hours.

NEW BOSS'S WAYS SEEN AS BANE, BENEFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When he takes control of the largest public works
project in the nation, Andrew S. Natsios will come with a fierce
belief in mininalist government and a stubborn streak that often
tries even his closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   At the State House, where Natsios has served as Governor Paul
Cellucci's chief fiscal operative for the last year, visitors to
his office seeking state assistance are routinely ushered to a
conference table dominated by a sign engraved with a single word:
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say Natsios's renowned tight-fisted ways, and his
experience going nose to nose with local officials demanding more
state aid, make him ideally suited to impose fiscal order on the
financially troubled Big Dig project.
</P>
<P>
   They also say his record as manager of international famine
relief programs under President George Bush, and the respect he
commands as one of the brightest officials in the Cellucci
administraion, are certain to help him restore federal confidence
in the administration's management ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy is a superb choice to head the Big Dig project,'' said
Paul Guzzi, president of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.
``He's had extensive state financial experience, and he's had
extensive federal management experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But other business leaders privately worry about Natsios's
tendency to adopt principled stands without considering their
practicality _ a trait some say led to the downfall of outgoing Big
Dig manager James J. Kerasiotes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Natsios, 50, insisted that Cellucci veto
$94 million in additional state aid for local education _ only to
suffer a unanimous override in which Cellucci was abandoned by
every Republican in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios freely admits to a certain hard-headedness that has
characterized his career since he served as a gadfly in the state
Legislature. He was a Republican representative from Holliston in
the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a streak in me that's stubborn and absolutely
hard-headed,'' he said in a Globe interviewTuesday, adding that in
a job as demanding as running the Big Dig, stubbornness ``is almost
a prerequisite.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, business leaders and elected officials alike
are questioning whether Natsios has the ability to match
Kerasiotes's record of completing more than half of the technically
complex project safely and without significant disruptions of
downtown traffic or commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to all the revelations of Big Dig cost overruns, I would
have given Kerasiotes about the highest marks of anybody in the
administration,'' Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham said.
</P>
<P>
   But Natsios said he believes that, with most of the engineering
work done, the principle challenges in managing the Big Dig are
restoring public confidence in Cellucci administration officials
and controlling costs.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said his first order of business on taking the helm of
the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority and the Central Artery/Tunnel
project Wednesday will be to establish ``a culture of openness'' to
encourage staffers to keep him apprised of any bad news.
</P>
<P>
   In a list of 16 management priorities he will distribute to Big
Dig staff, Natsios says: ``I will not shoot the messenger of bad
news. Keep me informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said it may take a couple of months before a review of
the Big Dig by the accounting firm of Deloitte &AMP; Touche will allow
him to inform federal officials and the public about the full
extent of the Big Dig cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he's confident that the $2 billion estimate cited
by federal auditors is the last word on the subject, Natsios simply
said, ``No.''

THE POLIO WAR: ROTARIANS NEAR A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARBLEHEAD, Mass. _ Gene Hastings is a devoted Rotarian now, but
he remembers when his boss first suggested that he join the local
chapter. He groused to himself: Why me? Why waste lunch?
</P>
<P>
   But Hastings soon saw it differently. He grew to like the
camaraderie at the Rotary meetings. And he enjoyed the projects,
especially the audacious one: Rotarians, he learned, wanted to help
wipe out polio around the world.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1985. At that time, there were perhaps 350,000 cases
worldwide even though a polio vaccine had become available 31 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Rotarians' dream is within reach. Last year, health
workers recorded only 6,000 cases of polio, and the disease has
been eradicated in 20 countries. The goal is to stop the
transmission of polio in the remaining 30 countries by the end of
this year and then to keep giving immunizations until there is
certainty that the virus is dead.
</P>
<P>
   It would mark only the second time in history that a disease has
been eradicated. Smallpox was declared dead in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable, really,'' Hastings said, sitting in his
Marblehead living room. Laid out on a long table were hundreds of
photographs of smiling Rotary members at conferences around the
world. ``There's so much good you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable is not just the goal of the project, which is
led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, and Rotary International, but that
a group of volunteers can help pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   The race to wipe out polio may come as news to many Americans.
There hasn't been a case of polio in the United States for 25
years, nor a case in the Western Hemisphere for nine years. But for
Americans 50 and older, the word triggers memories of warnings to
stay out of the pool in summer for fear of winding up with a
shriveled leg or wedged into an iron lung.
</P>
<P>
   Now the focus is on the most inaccessible, populous, and
war-torn nations in Asia and Africa, where world leaders such as
the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, have intervened to put wars
on hold _ at least for a few days _ to allow tens of thousands of
volunteers to immunize children.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Rotary has long been perceived the way
Hastings once thought of it: a collection of aging men who lunch
together regularly and perhaps spend a few thousand dollars a year
on a small project in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   But the group, started in 1905 by four Chicago businessmen
seeking companionship, has long been global, with 1.2 million
members in 162 countries. In 1987, it opened its doors to women. In
2,000 of the 29,700 clubs, the presidents are now women.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Bowering, 36, of Wakefield is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of Rotary to help the less fortunate,'' said
Bowering, a travel agency owner who organized a trip to the Ivory
Coast in Africa this year for an immunization day, only to have it
canceled because of a military coup. ``Most of our efforts should
stay within our communities, but we also should support
international projects. When you see what your money does for these
people in poor countries, it's overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotary clubs have installed countless wells and have dug
latrines all over the world. Last year, the Wakefield club spent
$12,000 to ship five tractor-trailer containers of books to South
Africa. But no project captures its international focus as well as
the effort against polio.
</P>
<P>
   The goal in 1985 was to raise $120 million in three years.
``That may not seem significant, but we had never done this kind of
thing before,'' said Bill Sergeant, 80, chairman of Rotary's
International Polio Plus Committee. ``We started fund-raising
throughout the world, and we had the most unusual results.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization raised $240 million, twice its goal, about half
from American members. Today, the figure has increased to $372
million, but the group's most significant contribution may rest in
the tens of thousands of volunteers who have helped immunize
children under the age of 5. Now, Rotary and media magnate Ted
Turner are about to collaborate in a $200 million fund-raising
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Many problems loom ahead, though.
</P>
<P>
   To get the job done, the four partners, WHO, UNICEF, CDC and
Rotary, must get the combatants in several wars to stop shooting _
at least temporarily. Countries declared polio-free could see new
cases as victims cross borders.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers estimate it will take an additional $300 million to
$350 million to pay for and administer vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   The three largest vaccine producers are under increasing
pressure to turn out the vaccine as fast as possible. The health
organizations are shipping the vaccines as fast as drug companies
can produce them. About 2.5 billion doses will be given this year,
nearly twice as much as any previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The places that are most difficult are the countries at war,''
said UNICEF's executive director, Carol Bellamy. ``The problem is
getting access. Even after we negotiate the days of tranquility in
Afghanistan, Somalia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, it
really is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Poliomyelitis, which is transmitted in airborne droplets and
through an infected person's feces, attacks the brain and spinal
cord. In severe cases, it can lead to extensive paralysis or death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, 558,000 people contracted polio, leaving thousands
unable to walk. Two years later, Dr. Jonas Salk began trials of his
vaccine, which was given by injection. And by 1961, Dr. Albert
Sabin's oral polio vaccine was approved for use.
</P>
<P>
   The oral vaccine had a major plus: It allowed anyone to
administer the two drops of vaccine needed to immunize a child.
Suddenly, vast networks of volunteers could be employed. And, in
the early 1990s, Rotarians began lining up in great numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy, a former Peace Corps director and former president of
the New York City Council, attended a Rotary meeting last year in
Nice, France. ``You know, they're mostly a group of middle-aged
men, but they really decided this was their thing. And they're
really working on it, pushing themselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other world leaders, including President Clinton and the UN's
Annan, have said Rotary is an example for other private
organizations. Doctors say its efforts give them hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible,'' said Dr. Paul Farmer, director of
Harvard Medical School's Program in Infectious Disease and Social
Change and a leader in the fight against the spread of
drug-resistant tuberculosis. ``Just look at what the Rotarians
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the polio program has not been without detractors. Some
Rotarians believe the group's local chapters should focus
exclusively on their own communities. The initiative also has not
stopped a slide in national membership, which has suffered as the
culture of work has changed and fewer business people are willing
to take a long lunch every week. In response, many chapters have
switched to breakfast meetings.
</P>
<P>
   And some Rotary districts have been less generous than others.
Eastern Massachusetts, for example, had averaged $39,000 a year in
donations to international programs. New Hampshire chapters,
Hastings said, were giving an average of $300,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so mad when I learned that,'' said Hastings, 70, a past
district governor of the organization. In the last two years, his
efforts have helped boost Eastern Massachusetts' giving to
$126,000. ``We'll reach that $300,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One motivating factor is likely to come from Rotarians
themselves, and the stories they can tell.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Jim and Ellen Labrie of Rye, N.H., traveled to
Ethiopia for a national immunization day. They stayed for several
days; Ellen, a nurse, helped deliver three babies at a small
clinic, then gave polio immunizations to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible feeling,'' Ellen Labrie said. ``You've got
this little vial in your hand, you drop two drops on a child's
tongue, and you make a difference in the child's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way to the clinic, we passed 50 or 75 people who had
fallen victim to polio,'' she said. ``They have these mallets they
hold in their hands like a crutch. Their legs are useless, their
lower legs are tied up, and they swing their torso and land on
padded knees. That's their method of walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband and another Rotary volunteer who was there had lost
relatives to polio years before. She said she would never forget
watching the two Rotarians as they administered the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of them,'' she said, ``they had tears streaming down
their faces as they gave the vaccine to children.''

AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN CUISINE COMES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cab driver can't locate Danube, one of the most talked-about
restaurants in New York City, on a dimly lit block of Hudson Street
in Tribeca, so we tell him to pull over and we get out. It's half a
block back, the entrance so understated that I have to peer at the
little sign on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it's like falling into a plush, decorated egg. Gorgeous
blue and yellow tiles cover the walls; heavy draperies in a burnt
orange with delicate cream undercurtains cover the windows. Pretty
chairs are deep enough to sink into; table linens are so starched
they crackle as I brush past; waltz music wafts in the air. At 6:30
p.m., the room is full of well-dressed, abundantly jeweled diners
and waiters stiffly at attendance.
</P>
<P>
   In the same measured beat that a waltz is played, the
Austro-Hungarian empire has swirled back onto the stage. Danube is
the newest restaurant of David Bouley, whose contemporary
interpretations of French cuisine ruled the New York and US food
worlds for almost a decade, until he closed shop in 1996. Now, in a
land awash in Mediterranean and French-influenced cuisine, he's
betting that we've all missed those pots of sour cream and
dumplings, the pickled vegetables and apple strudel. For that style
of cooking _ whether in Austrian, Hungarian, or German restaurants
_ flourished in an earlier America and still does in parts of the
Midwest. It harks back to a time when going out to dinner meant
either a steakhouse or a formal restaurant where the menu ran to
Wiener schnitzel and oodles of schlag over apple strudel. The heavy
sauces, the sour cream, the goulash sound exotic now. And none too
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Not to fear, however, that Bouley and his chef, Mario Lohninger,
will smother the eater in sour cream. Danube's interpretation leans
resolutely toward the delicate. From the first offering _ an
amuse-gueule that is tiny tastes of a sardine on a wisp of a potato
chip, a thimbleful of squash soup, a postage stamp-size cut of mahi
on red cabbage, a cocktail duck sausage _ the dishes tiptoe around
the theme. The classic Austro-Hungarian ingredients are sprinkled
up and down the appetizers and entrees but with utmost discretion.
And quark, which sounds Mr. Spock-y but is actually a type of soft
farmer's cheese, seems to be Bouley's answer to sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Potatoes abound, but what potatoes. A little potato dumpling is
stuffed with salty caviar, the two tastes heavenly together. Potato
ravioli, really an ethereal gnocchi, wrap around a heady veal
filling. Austrian potato salads with several entrees only vaguely
resemble the German potato salad I grew up with. Thin shavings of
potatoes in a sprightly vinegary dressing glisten on the tongue _
it's as though the lowly potato had just stepped out of
Cinderella's pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Lest all this sound too modern and light, Bouley pours richness
into plenty of his dishes. One amazingly long-winded appetizer _
Carinthia ``Schlutzkrapfen'' high-altitude Austrian cheese ravioli
with harvest corn and smoked Canadian chanterelles _ is
heart-stopping in its intensity, the cheese lingering at the back
of the palate as the heady mushrooms hit the front of the tongue.
And the Wiener schnitzel, though light, tasted pretty much like
schnitzel.
</P>
<P>
   Desserts pull out all the stops _ while not heavy, they
certainly aren't spa. A vanilla savarin shimmers on the plate and
the tongue; mousse-like chestnut cake melts into one's
consciousness at the same moment as the surprise of licorice ice
cream. Chocolate sacher is definitely an up-to-date version,
intense but svelte, and the apple strudel has a flaky, buttery
crust.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddling with this cuisine doesn't do disservice to history. The
Austro-Hungarian empire was never homogeneous in cuisine. German
sausage spilled over into Austrian dumplings and became seasoned by
the Hungarian fondness for paprika over several centuries, until
the 19th-century nationalism pulled the empire apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no Danubes in Boston _ at least not yet _
there are a few chefs who evoke some of the same romance. The
grande dame of this cuisine here is Cafe Budapest, a place whose
history and that of its owners has kept it unchanged in almost four
decades. Here the courtly maitre d's seem frozen to their positions
as they preside over sparsely populated dining rooms. When I met a
friend at the bar before dinner recently, our talk was accompanied
by a violinist and a pianist playing for us alone, as the bartender
audibly stood by sighing. The food, served quickly and very
solemnly by tuxedo-clad waiters, was from an earlier era, too. The
breading of the Wiener schnitzel predominated; a pork chop
smothered in a gulyas of onions was tough; a dobos torte was sweet
but a little dry. The Sleeping Beauty feel of the place reminded
one that even cuisine must change to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosen of Salts in Cambridge takes another tack in his
interpretations of Eastern and Middle European dishes, drawing on
strains of family ancestry _ his family's Russian and Romanian
roots and his wife Lisa's Polish ones. As with Bouley, the flavors,
the memories of grandmothers' dishes, the romance illuminate the
food, never overwhelming or dating the cuisine. A delicious red
lentil soup is spiked liberally with smoked paprika and bears a few
feathery white lentil-and-garlic dumplings, a wonderful contrast to
the soup. Venison gets an almost medieval tinge from its
accompaniment of black currant jam; poppy-seed spaetzle soaks up
the meat juices.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen says he's always looking for a slightly lighter tone to
the food, while respecting the tradition. For summer, he plans a
very thinly rolled-out pierogi dough stuffed with sweet corn to
serve over a lobster ragout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get in the scene where it's too far out,''
says Rosen, who enjoys reading food history for inspiration. ``I
want it to have a more solid footing. I'm looking for a little bit
of refinement,'' without making unrecognizable combinations.
</P>
<P>
   So the Austro-Hungarian empire waltzes into a new century,
wearing a lighter, more elegant gown.

U.S. OFFICIALS TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS ON HANDOVER OF CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to end the series of delays that have kept Elian Gonzalez
from his father, Justice Department officials said they would send
instructions Wednesday to the boy's Miami relatives telling them
how to hand over Elian to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides in the international custody battle agreed Tuesday
night to reunite father and son in Washington Wednesday. But the
Miami relatives who have cared for Elian for four months canceled
the meeting late Tuesday after a flurry of last-minute
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still encouraging the meeting, but we will be going
through with the letter,'' said Carole Florman, a Justice
Department spokeswoman. ``It's a transfer order. It gives them
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Florman said the letter with the instructions would likely be
sent by facsimile to lawyers representing the Miami relatives. She
refused to give details of the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, had
agreed to fly with the boy to Washington to meet Wednesday with
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the father who came from Cuba last week to
claim his son. But shortly before midnight, the great-uncle told
journalists and anti-Castro protesters outside his Miami home that
Elian did not want to go through with the meeting. Federal
officials were never notified, said Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had not heard officially at that point that the meeting was
completely off,'' Cardona said. ``At that point, we were involved
in discussions about the meeting. We are still focusing on our
efforts to try and get the families to meet and talk. If they do
that, we believe it will be possible for this to be quickly and
peacefully resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, representatives from the Cuban American National
Foundation said Wednesday morning that they were trying to broker a
meeting in Washington. The talks might take place at the Vatican
mission because both sides would feel comfortable meeting under the
auspices of the Catholic Church, said Jorge Mas Santos, an official
with the group, which opposes Cuban President Fidel Castro's
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done is to support the family's efforts to make
this meeting happen,'' Santos said at a Washington news conference.
``It's important that there are no conditions placed with the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department confirmed Wednesday that the Vatican's
diplomatic mission in Washington was being discussed as a possible
meeting place.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton's support, Attorney General Janet Reno
has said that the government would reunite Elian with his father
before the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the father, has said he does not want to
meet with the Miami relatives unless they give him his son. But
Elian's great-uncle has refused to turn over the boy without first
determining whether the father is acting under durress from Castro.
Juan Miguel Gonzalez said last week that Castro had been like a
``brother'' to him through this ordeal. He, his current wife and
their 6-month-old son are staying in a Cuban diplomat's home in the
Washington suburb of Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The father left the residence Wednesday morning to meet with his
lawyer, Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was given temporary residency status and placed in the
care of his great-uncle after fishermen discovered him floating in
an inner-tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy was one of
three survivors of a capsized refugee boat. His mother, who was
divorced from the boy's father, and 10 other Cubans drowned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like thousands of Cuban Americans who oppose Castro's
government, Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, is reluctant to
see the boy returned to Cuba. He is asking the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta to compel the INS to grant the boy an
asylum hearing. The court is scheduled to hear oral arguments the
week of May 8.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Cuban Americans who want Elian to remain in this
country have maintained a round-the-clock watch at the Miami home,
waving Cuban flags and staging candelight vigils. They have
practiced locking arms in a human chain to prevent federal
officials from forcibly removing Elian. Signs outside the home read
``Loco Castro'' and ``Let Elian Stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, as a heavy downpour drenched Miami streets,
Lazaro Gonzalez took Elian to Mercy Hospital, where the two met
with the boy's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez. She had been one of
Elian's primary caretakers but was hospitalized over the weekend
for exhaustion. Afterward, Elian and his great-uncle went to the
Miami Beach home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, who has acted as a
mediator in the custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez suggested Tuesday that O'Laughlin's home be used
as a neutral site for a family meeting. The nun hosted a meeting in
late January between Elian and his Cuban grandmothers, who had
flown to the United States in an unsuccessful attempt to bring the
boy back to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The great-uncle has said he would not hand Elian back to his
father unless he gets a guarantee that Juan Miguel Gonzalez would
not try to return to Cuba with his son before the Atlanta court
reaches a decision. But Elian's father has not promised to stay in
the country, although federal officials have said he would likely
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez said last week that if he stays through the
appeals process, he would like to be accompanied by an entourage of
Elian's teachers, classmates and close relatives, as well as
doctors and a high-ranking official. He pleaded last week with the
State Department to grant visas to such a delegation, which had
been assembled by Castro. The State Department granted six visas to
the group last week and said it is considering 21 others.

<P>
   Even the staunchest believers in technology stocks have had
their faith tested in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   For mutual fund investors, it's meant hanging on while
tech-heavy portfolios were pummeled _ and seeing that a euphoric
ride up can be grim on the way back down.
</P>
<P>
   Though last week was dramatic, with two violent days for the
Nasdaq Composite index, technology stocks have in fact been under
pressure since March 10, their recent high point. They've tumbled
nearly 12 percent since then, more than halving their gains since
the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very active quarter because the changes in the
market have been so drastic,'' said Gary Craven, manager of
Evergreen's successful Small Company Growth fund, who has been
standing up to the pressure admirably.
</P>
<P>
   Craven's $1.5 billion fund gained 18 percent in first-quarter
2000, while his peers tracked by Lipper Inc. in the
mid-capitalization growth group were up 17 percent, on average.
Year-to-date through Thursday, he was still up 13.6 percent,
outperforming the average 11.9 percent for the group.
</P>
<P>
   While tech stocks and biotechnology were the only place to be at
the end of 1999 and early this year, by late February, Craven
explained, those sectors had moved ``too far, too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the slump in the second half of March, aggressive
growth fund investors had little to complain about in the first
quarter. Mid-cap growth funds surged 17 percent, according to
Lipper; small-cap growth funds charged ahead 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret which sectors fared best. Science and technology
funds jumped nearly 18 percent in the quarter, while investors in
health and biotechnology funds enjoyed an 18.2 percent rise.
Telecommunications funds gained 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's gyrations, the small and the tech-oriented
funds have easily outpaced large stock funds this year. Craven
thinks that's where the best bets still lie as he looks ahead
through year-end. ``It's still the most attractive part of the
domestic market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's picky. He trimmed back his biotech holdings after
prices soared; some are again attractive, he suggests. He likes
technology, but avoids frivolous Internet plays. He's interested in
wireless companies and Web infrastructure. Those with no plans for
profitability need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms, both B2C and B2B, are really getting to the
point where they have to deliver,'' Craven said, ``and make it
clear how they're going to grow and ultimately make money.''

   The awakening to the risks of the market's Internet darlings
could push gains in other parts of the market, experts contend.
Large companies are having to become more serious about doing
business online, and those in the lagging ``value'' category, such
as construction, steel, and financial services, are trying to
remake themselves to compete with start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Goodman, chief economist at Putnam Investments in Boston,
calls this phenomenon the rise of the new old-economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the next six months, a new theme is going to develop on
Wall Street,'' Goodman predicted. The cyclical companies, he said,
are ``taking on growth-like characteristics and therefore should be
accorded growth valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a big shift in thinking. Value funds have posted
lackluster returns this year, not exceeding 5.8 percent on average.
Not since a brief period last April has value outpaced growth as a
category.
</P>
<P>
   One week is hardly enough to build a crystal ball around. But
last week, as tech funds were slumping 3.7 percent, large-cap value
funds rose 1.7 percent. Small- and mid-cap value funds gained more
than a percent each, as well.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, value funds are ahead of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index _ the large-cap growth benchmark _ which gained 0.9 percent
last week and is up a modest 2.3 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rosenbaum, research director at Lipper, called the recent
value gains ``further indication of a change of leadership in the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   But he warns against having too many eggs in any basket. ``This
market has been giving investors a wake-up call since March,'' he
said. ``Please examine your assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The best idea, of course, is to be exposed to all sectors.
Putnam's Goodman does not suggest shifting out of growth funds, but
adding new money to value funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tech area is alive and well,'' he said, and the bull
market is still chugging along. The trouble, he said, is that some
people have lost track of the level of risk they've taken on.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's because their aggressive funds have reaped such
strong returns that they now make up a larger part of their
portfolio than was intended. Others, Goodman said, ``think they can
just get on a computer and buy stocks they know nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies clearly believe there will be a continuing
appetite for technology-focused funds. Some are jumping on the
bandwagon late, having missed last year's dot-com frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Mutual Funds of Boston just kicked off a Science and
Technology fund, citing a ``dynamic and rewarding investment
sector.'' Boston-based MFS Funds is rolling out a technology fund
this month, despite its stance that profitless Internet stocks
don't meet its investment standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are big technology investors,'' MFS spokesman John Reilly
said. ``We also pay close attention to valuations. We're going to
use the same research discipline we use in everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly admits the timing could be better: ``Sometimes the knees
are a little weak after a sell-off,'' he said. ``We think it's
still an area of great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only on US soil that small growth funds have fared best
so far in 2000. International small-cap funds climbed 13.1 percent
in the first quarter. Other strong areas included China region
funds, which surged 14.8 percent _ making it the strongest gaining
foreign sector of the past 12 months. Canadian funds followed, up
10.9 percent. European funds notched a 5.9 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   Japan funds slumped 3 percent in the quarter, after their vast
rise of last year. Latin American funds rose 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, everybody's expecting volatile markets in the
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Said Craven, ``We've had it pretty easy for the past year.''
Look for a strong year, he said, but ``the second quarter should
prove to be challenging.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The cornerstone of career and financial success
might well be a very old and very lame joke: How do you eat an
elephant? One bite at a time.
</P>
<P>
   When you tackle overwhelming projects, you break them into a
series of smaller tasks, then gobble them up one at a time. If you
want to be the chief executive of a corporation, you have to
navigate each step on the corporate ladder. Smart workers know all
that. But even smart workers can feel overwhelmed by the whole idea
of personal finance, especially investing in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding personal finance is a crucial and often overlooked
career skill. Using your money wisely can give you enough of a
financial cushion to quit an unsatisfactory job, cut back to
part-time work or start your own business. Those things are scary
or downright impossible for people living from paycheck to
paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite Web sites is the Motley Fool (www.fool.com),
because it approaches personal finance the same way workers should
approach their jobs. Here are a few Foolish lessons, for your money
and your life:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't automatically assume something is too complicated for
you.
</P>
<P>
   The Motley Fool is the best site I've seen for explaining what
you need to know about investing in stocks and how you can
determine whether any particular stock would be a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial planners tell clients that the stock market is so
complicated that individual investors stand a good chance of losing
their money. Depending on the planner and the investor, that can
either be good advice or incredibly self-serving advice. This site
does a good job of explaining the basics and getting rid of the
intimidation, giving you a better opportunity to decide whether you
have the smarts and temperament to invest on your own.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happens with careers, particularly in high-tech.
People get so intimidated by all the jargon or frustrated by a
couple of bad experiences that they automatically reject high-tech
as a career field. If they had better teachers or more patience,
they might have found that the field wasn't so intimidating after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a lot of people won't be suited for high-tech careers
_ or investing in individual stocks. But try to struggle past the
jargon in both cases; the potential rewards could be well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Separate the substance from the hot air.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets are filled with breathless pundits who talk
about what stocks will do in a week or a month or a minute, but
that's closer to legalized gambling than investing. The Motley Fool
talks about investing in good companies for the long term and
generally ignoring short-term comments from analysts. When you do
that, the stock market isn't so risky after all.
</P>
<P>
   Careers can be like that, too. We get so caught up in day-to-day
politicking and overwhelming projects that we lose sight of what's
really important: long-term growth. At least once or twice a year,
set aside some time alone or with your family to discuss your goals
and how you're trying to accomplish them.
</P>
<P>
   Are there assignments your boss could be giving you that he's
not? Have you earned the right to those assignments? Have you been
adding people to your network? What makes you a more attractive
worker or job applicant now than you were a year ago?
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand the importance of framing.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies do this all the time. If they had a great
year, they compare their year's results with the S&AMP;P 500. If they
had a lousy year, maybe they'll do a five-year or 10-year
comparison instead. Or they'll compare their fund with similar
funds in their category. They're not lying, just framing the truth
in the way that looks best for them.
</P>
<P>
   As a worker, you need to provide a frame for your boss to
consider your performance. Maybe you can point to having better
sales than anyone else, or developing a skill that no one else has,
or coming up with unique approaches to solving problems. Try to
make sure that when your boss thinks of you, a particular strength
is the first thing to pop into her mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ You need a touch of arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody recommending individual stocks has to have a huge amount
of confidence. After all, thousands of people recommend stocks, and
not all of them can be right, even in a bull market. If you don't
have enough arrogance to stick to your beliefs when others
challenge you, you won't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Few answers in the working world are absolutely right or
absolutely wrong, and sometimes you have to be arrogant enough to
think that you can do something right, even if you have no proof.
Without a little of that arrogance, you'll never challenge yourself
as much as you should.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't rely too much on any one source.
</P>
<P>
   Although I like the Motley Fool, you'd be nuts to take what
anyone says as the gospel without doing your own research. That's
why I'll always check out stocks at places like Yahoo
(quote.yahoo.com), CNET (news.com) or MSN Money Central
(moneycentral.msn.com).
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're with a great company, resist the temptation to
rely on it for everything, such as when all your friends are
co-workers and all your money is tied up in the company's stock.
Even great stocks have been known to tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can take the place of thorough research and a good
network, whether you're investing in a company or investing in
yourself.

&HT;     SOMETIMES AT WORK, THE BEST ANSWER IS PLAIN `NO' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's a two-letter word that can get you into
four-letter trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to just say no in the workplace. Bosses demand long
hours, clients push for constant service, colleagues beg for help.
And if you give in to all their requests, your spouse just might
head for the door.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you turn a no-win situation into a no-with-a-win
situation? Three of the keys are perspective, preparation and
prevention, says Patti Breitman, the coauthor of ``How to Say No
Without Feeling Guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, written with Connie Hatch, covers how to say no in all
sorts of situations without sounding like a naysayer, including a
large chapter on work. In a recent interview, Breitman said many
people don't re-examine their career goals often enough to make
sure they still fit in with the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us achieve success and don't realize it,'' she said.
``Most of us are too busy to even think about whether we're
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Breitman said bosses can be demanding, but many times workers
perform an extra task because they assume it's expected of them,
when really it isn't. ``Sometimes we're our own worst slave
drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when things are expected of you, often you can avoid
trouble. ``The best way to do it is to practice prevention,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a family outing planned for the last weekend of the
month, for example, let people at work know early that you won't be
available then. If you know you'll have a big project that will
leave your department scrambling, let others know in advance that
you won't be able to help with routine items during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more warning, the better,'' Breitman said. ``We recommend
honoring plans with yourself and your family as much as you honor
plans with everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that it's often best to tell people simply that you
have a commitment. If you explain precisely what you're doing, you
create the possibility of an argument if your priorities for
balancing work and life don't happen to suit theirs.
</P>
<P>
   What should you tell a boss who asks for an explanation?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long-standing family commitment I cannot break,''
Breitman said. ``I'm the kind of person who likes to keep my
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   She said an answer like that is hard for bosses to argue with
because they know that you'll also keep your commitments to them in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   One key principal behind saying no without guilt is to have a
clear understanding of what is important in your life, not only to
you, but to your family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and your partner should have an ongoing negotiation and
compromise,'' Breitman said. ``If you focus on what you're saying
yes to, it's easier to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Breitman said she is not encouraging people to say no to the
boss all the time, but just to be clear on what role work plays in
their lives. Some people who are trying for a promotion or working
for an Internet start-up might have to make major personal
sacrifices, and they need to make sure their family members
understand what long-term benefits could occur because of those
sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   When a boss insists that you do something you don't want to do,
Breitman suggests you make sure you understand the boss's real
goal. Maybe you're told that you have to work on Saturday, for
example, but the real goal is to make sure you have a report
finished by 9 a.m. Monday. By working Friday night or early Monday,
you might meet the boss' real goal without sacrificing the
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes saying you have a policy can help, such as if your
family has a policy of having dinner together. ``It sounds more
authoritative,'' Breitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often not the boss who is pressuring you, but your
colleagues,'' she added. ``You never say, `That's not my job,'
because then you're not perceived as a team player.''
</P>
<P>
   Breitman suggests three steps when faced with a request you
don't want to fulfill:
</P>
<P>
   _ Express your desire to be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quickly make it clear that you can't perform the task
requested.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suggest a person or resource that might help.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes colleagues make other requests, such as asking for
charity sponsors or donations for a party. Breitman said it's often
best to pick a couple of charities worthy of your donations; by
saying yes to those charities, it will be easier to say no to the
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know in your heart that you give generously to other
causes, you won't feel guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't contribute money for office parties because you
have other financial priorities, the author suggests offering your
services in some other way, such as picking up the cake or shopping
for a present. ``There can be all kinds of resentments if you don't
participate somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosses also have to say no, of course. For them, too,
preparation is key. If they can't give a good employee a raise
because the budget is tight, they should consider whether there are
other alternatives that would be attractive, such as better fringe
benefits, extra time off or allowing the worker to telecommute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a good boss, you're probably giving praise whenever
it's due,'' Breitman said. ``When you do need to say no, it's in
the context of someone who's fair.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The number of anti-Semitic incidents in
California increased last year while the number nationwide
declined, according to an annual audit released by the
Anti-Defamation League (ADL).
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia reported 1,547
anti-Semitic incidents to the ADL in 1999, a 4 percent decrease
from 1998 when 1,611 were reported. Of those incidents, 868 were
harassment and 679 were acts of vandalism. Eighty-five percent of
the harassment cases were against individuals rather than Jewish
institutions and synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   In California, 275 incidents were reported in 1999, a 23 percent
increase from 1998 when 223 incidents were reported. California
ranked second among states with the highest number of anti-Semitic
incidents reported. New York led the nation with 352 incidents
reported. After California, came New Jersey with 226, Massachusetts
with 111 and Florida with 88.
</P>
<P>
   The ADL said the five states have the largest Jewish populations
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Bernstein, director of central Pacific region of the
ADL, said the high profile firebombings of synagogues in Sacramento
and the community center shooting in Los Angeles prompted copycat
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, those anti-Semitic acts heightened
awareness, making people more inclined to report incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are becoming tolerant of people different than
themselves,'' he said. ``We've made some significant inroads.
Still, we have a long way to go. At the same time . . . there are
those people who are hard-core haters, who are being pushed to the
extremes because they are no longer accepted in political (and
social) circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidents tend to be more bold, in-your-face attacks
rather than vandalism,'' Bernstein said. ``That's a disturbing
trend we have to keep an eye on.''

Thursday, April 13:

<P>
   OPEN-CURTAINS (New York) _ Gina Tarantino has sheer curtains,
but she and her husband never draw them. Neither do their
neighbors, who roll out of bed naked each morning, as unashamed as
Adam and Eve before the consumption of the apple. The 38-year-old
product designer, maintains that despite the view from her East
Side living room into the neighbors' bedroom, there remains a real
sense of anonymity.In fact, the curtainless situation has become a
challenge of wills. ``It has almost become a war,'' Ms. Tarantino
added. ``We're both just waiting to see who's going to draw their
curtains first. Our parents tell us all the time that it's just
like `Rear Window.''' Trend watchers, take note: It's curtains for
drapes. Farewell to billowing swathes of fabric. By Kimberly
Stevens.

<P>
   MILAN-FURNITURE-ARTWORK (Milan, Italy) _ Fearing that the latest
sleek samples of minimal elegance and technological wizardry might
not sufficiently wow the crowds at the annual furniture fair here,
organizers asked 14 international artists to create installations
within the splendid Rotonda della Besana in the middle of the city.
Robert Wilson, Yoko Ono, Peter Greenaway and other artists
interpreted the theme of ``rooms and their secrets.'' By Julie V.
Iovine.

   GARDEN-QNA (Undated) _ Gardening questions answered. By Dora
Galitzki.

<P>
   SURVIVORS-HAGGADAH (Undated) _ Every Seder table needs its
user's manual; it's called the Haggadah _ Hebrew for ``telling.''
But one long forgotten Haggadah stands out as starkly, darkly
different from all others. Called ``A Survivors' Haggadah,'' it was
created by and for displaced Jews in Munich, Germany, for their
first Passover after the end of the Third Reich. By Peter Hellman.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGN-BOOKS (Undated) _ Bookstore shelves are groaning under
the weight of ever more design titles. And whether they're
coffee-table fluff, scholarly analyses or plain-spoken how-to
books, they find buyers. A look at interesting new releases in the
field, whether triumphs or ambitious failures. By Eve Kahn.

   HOME-FURNISHINGS (High Point, N.C.) _ The ladies who lunch made
a surprise reappearance at the International Home Furnishings
Market, which opened here last Thursday and finishes tomorrow. Just
as Minimalism and Modernism are entrenched in the mainstream, the
upper end of the market took a swerve toward the traditional,
glamorous looks of the 1930s and '40s, offering a champagne
complement to the dry martini Deco modern that ushered out the
1990s. By Liz Seymour.

<P>
   TEST-PROTESTS (Great Barrington, Mass.) _ From the Berkshires to
Cambridge, brushfires of civil disobedience flared in classrooms
across Massachusetts on Wednesday, as hundreds of high school
sophomores, and dozens of fourth- and eighth-graders, boycotted the
first of nine days of statewide standardized testing. In a sign of
rising student and parent discontent with politicians' reliance on
such tests, the protests followed _ and exceeded _ similar
rebellions in recent months in Illinois, Ohio, Louisiana, Wisconsin
and Florida. Though most of the students in Massachusetts reported
to class as scheduled, they chose to write essays about their
opposition to testing rather than answer the questions posed. Some
of the students face disciplinary actions ranging from suspension
to having a failing test grade incorporated into their third
quarter marks. By Jacques Steinberg.

</P>
<P>
   UNILEVER-BEN&AMP;JERRYS (Undated) _ Unilever, which has been
shedding brands, makes two high-profile acquisitions in the United
States. As expected, it seems to have brought an end to the
skirmish for control of Ben &AMP; Jerry's by agreeing to pay $43.60 a
share, a total of $326 million. And, at the other end of the
calorie spectrum, it will buy SlimFast Foods for $2.3 billion,
adding the top producer of weight-loss products to its growing
nutrition business. In connection with the Ben &AMP; Jerry's purchase,
it will establish a formal structure for achieving socially
conscious goals. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   JDN-REALTY (Atlanta) _ JDN Realty, an Atlanta real estate
investment trust and a major Wal-Mart partner, has uncovered
``discrepancies in cost and other information'' in leases and sales
with both Wal-Mart and Lowe's, its other big tenant. The company's
stock is down 25 percent on Wednesday _ on top of a huge drop that
came when JDN acknowledged in February that two of its executives
had received millions in unreported salary in the last five years.
Management experts criticize the company's board, which is packed
with friends and associates of top officers, for failing to react
to the original bad news. The continuing travails make JDN an
excellent case study of the conflicts between the interests of
shareholders and executives at small companies. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-TELECOMS (London) _ The auction for five licenses for
Britain's ``third generation'' mobile telephone systems is shaping
up as a windfall beyond the government's wildest dreams. The bids,
which have been rising day after day, now approach $25 billion,
twice the government's budget surplus. For the companies still
alive in the bidding, the prices are not out of line with
expectations of great demand when the dazzling new
telecommunications gear becomes available in two or three years. By
Alan Cowell.

&HT;     ANGLERS GEAR UP FOR THE START OF SALMON SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The opening of salmon season out the Golden Gate
is always a mystery. What anglers are praying for, however, is that
the mystery not be turned into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of both for this Saturday's opener, along with an
undercurrent of pent-up excitement from the latest opening day for
salmon in history.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery? Where are the fish? Right, now nobody knows, although
there are plenty of guesses, including the Deep Reef, the Weather
Buoy, B Buoy and the Farallon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Doubt? Will bad weather tank the day?
</P>
<P>
   Excitement? According to the California Department of Fish and
Game, the ocean is full of salmon, and many are already big, 8 to
10 pounds, and will be growing a pound and an inch per month as the
season progresses _ with the ocean plugged with feed from roughly
the 50-fathom line on out another 10 miles.
</P>
<P>
   What is for sure is that thousands of fishermen on hundreds of
boats are planning to head out from Bay Area ports at dawn Saturday
in one of the few big-time annual traditions remaining in the
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks tremendous, with fish up and down the coast,'' said
Roger Thomas, captain of the Salty Lady from Sausalito. ``The Bay
Area boats will probably head to deeper water, where the amount of
feed is just fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is so excited just to go out there and fish for
those salmon,'' said Jacky Douglas of the boat Wacky Jacky out of
San Francisco. ``We can hardly wait to fire those engines up and
head out the Golden Gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Stone of Emeryville Sportfishing said his fleet of boats
has been booked for the opener for months and that many owners of
private boats have been trying to inveigle a few secrets from the
pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to know where we'll be fishing, but this year
the decision won't be made until Saturday morning when all the
boats are heading out,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   The only consensus is that the fish are not inshore and that the
Golden Gate Fleet will break up and search across the Gulf of the
Farallones, starting at the 50-fathom line, where whale watching
has been outstanding in the past two weeks because of such high
amounts of feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll fan out and start prospecting,'' Thomas said. ``The
radio will get lively as soon as somebody catches one.''
</P>
<P>
   An insider's note is that private boaters should tune in to VHF
Channel 67, where most skippers will be trading information.
</P>
<P>
   The opener is the latest ever, with two more weeks cut off from
the beginning of the season (for years, the opener was set for Feb.
15). However, Thomas, who represents the Golden Gate Fleet on the
Pacific Fisheries Management Council, was able to help negotiate
adding another week to the end of the season, enhanced further by
attractive size limits.
</P>
<P>
   The season is now set to run through Nov. 5, with a 24-inch size
limit through May, then a 20-inch size limit starting June 1,
approved last Thursday by the Council.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, circle hooks will again be required for mooching,
but J hooks are acceptable for trollers, rules which result in a
fish being hooked in the jaw and high-survival rates for undersize
fish that are released.
</P>
<P>
   When circle hooks were first introduced, many fish were lost by
experienced fishermen trying to set the hook and instead simply
pulling the hook out of the salmon's mouth. With a circle hook, you
do not set the hook, but instead allow the fish to turn their heads
and swim away with the bait, and at that point, you just reel, and
bingo, you're on, with the hook solid in the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas predicted that for the opener, the fleet will be split
50-50 between trolling and mooching.

   SCI-ONEILL-DEATH (Undated) _ Eugene O'Neill, playwright of souls
in search of forgiveness, is given an absolution of sorts himself
today, in the pages of a medical journal. Contrary to Mr. O'Neill's
own suspicion that heavy drinking in his youth caused the brain
disease that crippled him later in life, a new report says alcohol
was not to blame. Far more likely, the progressive deterioration of
O'Neill's brain was due to a rare genetic disorder, said Dr. Bruce
H. Price, chairman of the neurology department at McLean Hospital
in Boston, and coauthor of an article in the New England Journal of
Medicine that is based on a new analysis of his medical records and
autopsy, and describes in detail the illness that kept him from
writing during the last 12 years of his life. By Denise Grady. (900

GETTING THE MOST FROM CIRCULAR SAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphic is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers can make purchase
one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most popular power tool for professionals and
do-it-yourselfers, after the portable electric drill, is the
circular saw. It can make most of the cuts done by table or
radial-arm saws, and it has the added advantage that it can be
carried to the job site. Fitted with the right blade, a portable
circular saw can cut through almost any material, and obviously,
faster than a hand saw.
</P>
<P>
   Most portable circular saws have similar design features. The
motor is enclosed in a housing mounted on a baseplate, or shoe. The
cutting part of the saw blade projects through a slot in the
baseplate. There are two handles mounted on the motor housing: the
main handle and the front handle. The main handle has the trigger
switch, which is a ''dead man's switch'' _ when finger pressure is
relaxed the switch opens and the motor is turned off. The front
handle is a knob that affords a two-hand grip and gives the user
greater control over the tool.
</P>
<P>
   For safety reasons, the blade is enclosed in two guards. The
upper blade guard is attached to the motor housing and remains
fixed in place. The lower blade guard is movable and retracts as
the saw cuts. It is spring-loaded so it snaps back to cover the
blade after the cut is made.
</P>
<P>
   All circular saws feature two blade adjustments. The depth of
cut adjustment moves the motor up or down on the baseplate so more
or less of the blade projects through the cutting slot. The angle
adjustment tilts the motor and blade so the saw can make miter
cuts. Most saws have a protractor gauge on the angle adjustment so
the blade can be set for a variety of angles.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the saw is determined by the diameter of the blade,
and blades are available in diameters from 4 3/8 inches to 8 1/4
inches. The most popular and practical size saw for the
professional and do-it-yourselfer is the 7 1/4 -inch model fitted
with a one-horsepower motor. (Many professional choose this size
saw with a heavier, two-horsepower motor.)
</P>
<P>
   Different blades are available to cut a variety of materials,
including wood. Wood-cutting blades are available with
carbide-tipped teeth. These blades are more expensive than ordinary
steel blades, but they stay sharp longer and make smoother cuts.
Generally, the more teeth per inch a blade has, the finer the cut.
For routine wood cutting jobs, buy a general-purpose, combination
blade with 20 to 24 teeth. This will allow you to rip or crosscut
lumber and composition board. A fine-cutting blade with 36 to 40
teeth is useful for cutting plywood and veneered stock. Other handy
wood-cutting blades are the hollow-ground planner blade and the
flooring blade.
</P>
<P>
   The hollow-ground planner blade is designed to produce a fine
finish on both surfaces when making either crosscuts or miter cuts.
The blade is thinner than the standard combination blade so the cut
is narrower. This blade cuts more slowly than the other
wood-cutting blades, but it makes a smooth cut.
</P>
<P>
   The flooring blade has tough carbide-tipped teeth and is
designed to cut through rough lumber, secondhand boards and
flooring. This is the ideal blade to use when cutting through wood
materials that have a high glue content, like particleboard.
</P>
<P>
   There are special blades for hard materials. The most useful is
the abrasive disk. Abrasive disks are not made of metal but are
molded from tough, abrasive materials like silicon carbide. There
are abrasive disks for metal and others for masonry andconcrete.
When cutting thick masonry or metal, it is best to start with a
shallow cut, then make several passes, increasing the depth of the
cut each time.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of metal-cutting blade is the friction blade. It is
made of steel and has square, not pointed, teeth. It is designed to
slice through corrugated steel and sheet metal. The biggest danger
when using a portable circular saw is called kickback. It occurs
when the blade binds in the stock, and the powerful torque
generated by the motor propels the saw back toward the user. There
are a number of ways to minimize the danger of kickback. Always cut
with a blade that is sharp and clean. Support the work adequately
so the kerf does not close in on the blade. Do not attempt to saw
through wet wood, and be especially careful when cutting wood that
is warped or knotty.
</P>
<P>
   When using a circular saw or any power tool, wear all the
necessary protective equipment like goggles and earplugs. You
should also wear a dust mask when cutting pressure-treated lumber.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ About 20 years ago, a student interrupted Deborah
Lipstadt during a history lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Then a young college professor in California, Lipstadt was
telling her students that the U.S. government in the 1930s and
1940s had received reports about Nazi atrocities against Jews. It
stands to reason, she told
</P>
<P>
   them, that American newspapers carried stories reflecting these
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you,'' a student blurted out. ``I don't
believe that people like my parents could have known about it and
done nothing and then said that they didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt was taken aback by the student's distress. She decided
to take the students to the library to see for themselves what
American newspapers had reported.
</P>
<P>
   What she found was both disturbing and enlightening. When she
expected to see a major story on the front page, she would find
something relegated inside the paper. When she expected to see at
least a mention of
</P>
<P>
   some event, she would find nothing.
</P>
<P>
   She came to the realization that American newspapers may have
severely underplayed the story of the Holocaust story. This
launched her five-year odyssey through aging newspaper clippings
that produced her
</P>
<P>
   first book: ``Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming
of the Holocaust 1933-45.''
</P>
<P>
   She argued in the book that if the press had been more
aggressive in its coverage of the worsening situation for Jews in
Germany and eventually much of the rest of Europe, then public
opinion might have also been stirred. This might have prompted the
U.S. government to do more.
</P>
<P>
   Now nearly two decades later, Lipstadt, a 53-year-old professor
at Atlanta's Emory University, finds herself concerned about how
the story of the Holocaust is told.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, she is not fighting over how the story was
reported in the past but how it is being told in the present and,
perhaps more importantly, how it will be told in the future.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she won a decisive triumph over English historical
writer David Irving, who had sued Lipstadt and her British
publisher Penguin Books over her portrayal of him in her book
``Denying the Holocaust: The
</P>
<P>
   Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.'' It was published in the
United States in 1993 and in Britain in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A British judge found that three months of testimony and
documents supported Lipstadt's portrait of Irving as a bigoted
would-be historian who had intentionally distorted historical facts
to support his extremist political views.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who has made a handsome career out of trashing the
accepted understanding of what happened to European Jews during the
World War II era, was humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   At a packed news conference at the London Waldorf hotel Tuesday
afternoon, Lipstadt, who had been silent during the three-month
trial, confidently unleashed her flat, New York accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked many times if I had it to do over again, would
I write this book again,'' she said. ``The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have written a tougher one,'' she said, sounding more like
a jubilant New York Yankee in a post-World Series news conference
than a scholar who had prevailed in an cerebral contest.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee the day before the verdict, Lipstadt _ described
Wednesday by the Times of London as a ``striking redhead'' _ was
supercharged in a way people often are when they find themselves in
a favored limelight. In Britain as in the United States, she has
been widely portrayed as the defender of good against David
Irving's bumbling prince of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   In the sitting room at her elegant London hotel _ Lipstadt's
home away from home during the trial _ a waitress brought her a
small porcelain coffee pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you nervous?'' the waitress asked politely as she set the
pot and cup on the table before Lipstadt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrenaline. Adrenaline,'' said Lipstadt, who apparently
decided that was all the stimulant she needed and asked for decaf.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning during the trial the uniformed doorman wished
Lipstadt good luck as she headed off to court. When she returned at
night, he asked her how it went.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concierge told me to be optimistic because there is plenty
of time to be pessimistic afterwards,'' she said, clearly proud of
the quasi-family she has acquired at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   She will miss the hotel life. ``I'll really miss the magic
bed,'' she said. ``You know, every morning I leave and it's a mess
and when I come back it's made.''
</P>
<P>
   Her journey to this fine hotel in London began in New York City,
where she was the child of two devout Jews who instilled in her a
deep respect for the faith and intellect.
</P>
<P>
   He late father, Erwin Lipstadt, owned a cemetery stone business
in New York. He left Germany in 1928 during the Great Depression.
``He treasured, treasured America because of the opportunities it
provided him
</P>
<P>
   and his family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Miriam, came to the United States from Canada as a
baby. She is a former newspaper columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt knows of no relative who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest in Jewish history blossomed her junior year at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In the course of her studies, she
once said she noticed that ``everything I was doing was on American
Jewish history. And I said somebody is telling me something here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt earned a Ph.D. in American Jewish history at Brandeis
University in Massachusetts. She helped start the Jewish studies
program at the University of Washington in Seattle in the 1970s.
After five years in
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, she left for UCLA in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to LA's Occidental College before being lured by
Atlanta's Emory University in 1993 during the early years of the
school's campaign to recruit first class faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very excited to come to Emory because of Emory's
reputation _ it's a really fine university,'' she said. ``And also
I was attracted by Atlanta's reputation as a city. I have been
wooed by other universities _ good universities _ but they weren't
in metropolitan areas that I wanted to be part of.''
</P>
<P>
   A little over a year ago, she was appointed to the chair of the
newly-created Institute of Jewish Studies at Emory, the first such
program of its kind in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt also was recently re-appointed by the White House to
the executive committee of the Holocaust Memorial Council, which
administers the Holocaust Museum in Washington. She has also just
completed a term as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's adviser
on religious discrimination abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Irving verdict almost certainly will cast her more into the
fray over Holocaust deniers, perhaps elevating her to the position
of their prime nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt, who said she often found the trial ``deeply
energizing,'' seems up to the fight, and believes the cause is
worth the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   She worries that revisionists such as Irving are working their
way into mainstream thinking, slowly eroding the shared memory of
the Holocaust. ``I don't see deniers as a clear and present danger,
I see them as a clear and future danger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors are the greatest protectors of the Holocaust's legacy,
but their ranks are dwindling, she said. ``Soon there won't be
people to tell the story in the first person singular.''
</P>
<P>
   She rejected an invitation to settle out of court because she
feared it would be seen as a victory for Irving and his cause. ``I
was sued. If I hadn't fought it, he would have won by default,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she has always avoided debates with deniers because she
feared this could give them unwarranted authority. ``It would be
the equivalent of asking astronomers to debate whether the Earth is
flat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has had substantial help in her battle.
</P>
<P>
   Penguin, which is owned by the British media giant Pearson,
stood resolutely by her. (Pearson is headed by Marjorie Scardino, a
Texan who made a name by winning a Pulitzer Prize with her husband
Albert Scardino at a Savannah, Ga., weekly newspaper.)
</P>
<P>
   Her legal team, headed by two noted lawyers, was from the
British powerhouse firm Mishcon de Reya. (CQ) Richard Rampton is
one of the country's foremost libel lawyers, while Anthony Julius
is famous for representing Princess Diana during her divorce from
Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
   While she was impressed with the decorum of the British
courtroom, Lipstadt frankly doesn't know what to compare it to.
``This is my first law case, period,'' she said. ``I was a complete
novice when it comes to the law courts.''
</P>
<P>
   She offered particular praise for Emory University, which along
with Penguin Books picked up most of her costs for transportation
and lodging in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emory as an institution has been outstanding,'' she said.
``You would hope a university would do that when one of their own
came under fire, but they don't all do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got e-mails not just from the president, the provost, the
dean of the college. I got e-mails and messages from secretaries
and custodians there wishing me support and everybody in between,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Next for her is a return to Atlanta, where she will redouble her
efforts with the fledgling institute.
</P>
<P>
   She also plans to write a book about the Irving trial.
</P>
<P>
   She says she has no illusions that winning the case means the
end of her fight. ``The nightmare is not over,'' she said hours
after the verdict was rendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no end to the battle against racism, anti-Semitism,
and fascism.''

   Problems With PDFs And Noisy Zip Drives
</P>
<P>
   Q. I downloaded a PDF file from the Internet, and there was
nothing in it but blank pages. Is it the file or my PC that's
having the problem?
</P>
<P>
   A. The attraction of PDF, the Portable Document Format created
by Adobe Systems, is that computer users on a variety of platforms
can see and print documents as they were originally designed
without having the fonts and graphics loaded on their machines. To
view PDF files, you need to have a small program called Acrobat
Reader.
</P>
<P>
   You might try to download a PDF file from a different site and
see if you can view it. If you can open other PDF files, the
problem may lie with the document in question. There have been
several versions of Acrobat Reader released in the past few years,
so you may be trying to look at a PDF file that was created in a
later version of the program and isn't compatible with the older
version of Acrobat Reader you have on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to Adobe's Web site to download the latest version of
Acrobat Reader that is available for your operating system. There
is a link to the downloading page for Acrobat Reader on Adobe's
main page (www.adobe.com).
</P>
<P>
   If you've never seen a PDF file, you might want to look on
Adobe's Web site at several literary works that have been converted
to that format. You can download them free if you register in the
ePaper part of the site (www.adobe.com/epaper/main.html). The
titles include ``Hamlet'' and ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.''
For those with more modern tastes in fiction, there is also a link
to download a PDF file of Stephen King's new novella, ``Riding the
Bullet,'' which was recently published in electronic book format.
</P>
<P>
   PDF files may even help you save gasoline. The federal
government has posted many common forms on its sites that you can
download and print out. If you're the type who hasn't yet started
filling out your tax forms, you can even download PDF versions of
the proper forms at www.irs.gov/forms(underscore)pubs/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My Zip drive sometimes makes a lot of clicking sounds when I
use it. Is that normal behavior for this type of device?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is normal to hear a quick clicking sound when you first
put a Zip disk into a Zip drive. That is the sound of the drive's
heads finding the disk. Iomega, the manufacturer, warns that
constant clicking sounds coming from the drive might be a problem
and that disks that click constantly should not be used.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is sometimes called the ``click of death'' among Zip
users because it is often the mournful cry of a Zip drive getting
ready to malfunction for good. If your drive is perpetually
clicking, the company advises that you notify it on the Web at
www.iomega.com/support/nav(underscore)contact.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I use a Macintosh and Microsoft Word 98 as my writing tools
of choice, and I hate having to press multiple keys to get the
proper quotation marks. Is there a way to make this easier?
</P>
<P>
   A. Turning on Word's AutoCorrect feature (found under the Tools
menu) will automatically put in the proper quotation marks when you
press the apostrophe key, or the shift of that key. You can also
assign keyboard shortcuts to typographic characters that you use
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, go to the Insert menu and select Symbol from the
list. You will see a box with two tabs pop up on your screen. One
tab contains accented letters, symbols and dingbats, and the other
has a selection of special punctuation characters like quotation
marks and dashes. Click on the symbol or character you want and
then on the Shortcut Key button. A new box will pop up that will
allow you to assign the symbol to a single key on the keyboard.
Pick the key or key combination you want and click Assign. The
program may not let you override regular letters, but you can
assign shortcuts to the row of F keys along the top of your
keyboard.

   Frozen Oleander
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a beautiful oleander, grown from a little cutting 20
years ago. In the winter it lives in the garage, where it gets
plenty of light and where the temperature is never below freezing.
This winter, however, someone left the garage door open one night,
and it was exposed to the bitter cold for about 12 hours. My
husband said we should throw it out since its leaves all looked
dead, but I am still watering it in the hope that it may revive.
Could it? It has great sentimental value to me. Is a freezing cold
night always fatal?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not necessarily. Thomas Silva, who teaches plant physiology
at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., said that when a plant
freezes, death comes as a result of cells bursting. That can happen
if the liquid in the cell freezes, expands as it forms ice
crystals, and breaks the walls. Or if water in the vascular system
surrounding the cell freezes first. That draws water out of the
cell, causing its walls to shrink. When the ice thaws, the water
rushes back into the shrunken cell, bursting it like an overfilled
balloon. If enough cells die, so does the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part is figuring out how far below freezing the
temperature has to go, and for how long, before damage is fatal.
Leaves are out there in the cold air, so they freeze first. A plant
can stand losing its leaves and a few branches as long as its roots
survive. Since they are insulated by soil, it takes colder
temperatures or a longer time for them to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   How much soil was in the pot and how wet it was are important
factors. Moist soil is a better insulator for the roots than is dry
soil because the water has to freeze first.
</P>
<P>
   Some or all of your oleander has obviously been damaged, but I
would keep caring for it until it is very clear that reports of its
death have not been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Privet Hedge Control
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have 8-foot-high privet hedges that line my driveway and
act as a beautiful natural fence. Because of their height, they are
now unmanageable. I would like to cut them back to 5 or 6 feet. To
do so, I would be cutting established branches 1/4 to 1/2 an inch
thick. What is the best time of the year to cut privet hedges back
so drastically?
</P>
<P>
   A. Today. Right now. Don't even go to work. Ideally, major
privet renovations should be done just before new growth begins in
the spring in order to give the plants the best opportunity to heal
their wounds.
</P>
<P>
   While cutting back 2 or 3 feet may sound drastic, it isn't.
Privet hedges can be cut back to 18 inches above the ground and
will do just fine if they are cared for afterward _ fertilized,
mulched and watered during summer dry spells.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of total renovation may be necessary if improper
pruning, or no pruning, has resulted in a hedge with foliage at the
top but sparse foliage at the base. To let light in to the whole
shrub, promoting foliage growth all the way down, be sure to prune
with a taper so the top is slightly narrower than the bottom. That
will prevent the upper section from shading the lower parts.
</P>
<P>
   When you do your maintenance pruning in the spring, including
this shortening, shear off half of last year's growth on the sides
as well as the top to continue promoting a dense wall all the way
down without bare areas. Go over the hedge lightly in mid-July just
to keep it neat. And smile while you prune. With a 5-foot hedge,
you will have a different relationship with your neighbors.
</P>

CHINESE WARN HONG KONG MEDIA ON COVERAGE OF TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By MARK LANDLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A senior Chinese official warned the news media here
Wednesday not to spread or advocate separatist ideas in coverage of
Taiwan's political transition.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Wang Fengchao, the deputy director of the Chinese
government's liaison office in Hong Kong, said journalists should
be selective in how they report news about Taiwan. Wang's remarks
came after a Hong Kong television station broadcast an interview
with Taiwan's vice president-elect, Annette Lu, in which she said
Taiwan should be only a ``remote relative and close neighbor'' of
China.
</P>
<P>
   China interpreted Lu's remarks as a sign that she favors
independence, and the Chinese media unleashed a stream of invective
at her. An editorial in Wednesday's People's Daily said Lu had
``evil intentions to alienate the relations between people across
the Taiwan Strait.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang is the first mainland Chinese official based in Hong Kong
to call on the local media to curb themselves since this former
British colony reverted to Chinese rule in July 1997. And his
remarks alarmed journalists and pro-democracy politicians here.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's news media have reported both sides of the Taiwan
story. Newspapers and television stations widely covered the recent
election, while pro-Beijing papers here often telegraph changes in
the Chinese government's policy toward Taiwan. But Wang's comments,
made at a seminar organized by a pro-China media association here,
indicate that China would prefer a one-way street.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said the Hong Kong news media should not report different
voices on the issue of Taiwan's independence, but should make
choices based on the interests of the Chinese nation. He said the
local government should police the media by enacting a law that
outlaws subversion and sedition.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government radio station, Radio Television Hong
Kong, paraphrased Wang's comments in its English-language news
broadcast. A verbatim translation was not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is very serious,'' Margaret Ng, a pro-democracy
legislator, said of Wang's comments. ``It is not only his
admonition to the press, which is bad enough, but he also wants a
new law, which presumably would be more restrictive. This is not
good for one country, two systems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One country, two systems'' is the agreement between Britain
and China under which Hong Kong is to retain its own legal system
and a free press for 50 years after the handover. China often
promotes it as a model for Taiwan's eventual reunification with the
mainland, though officials in Taiwan, including the
president-elect, Chen Shui-bian, say it is not suited to their
circumstances.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government, which is careful not to pick fights with
China, issued a statement Wednesday evening saying it supports the
principle of a single China. But Anson Chan, the acting chief
executive, reminded Beijing that freedom of the press is guaranteed
under the territory's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that the Hong Kong media is free to comment and
report on all matters of current interest,'' said Chan, who is
sitting in for Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive. Tung is in San
Francisco, finishing a trip to the United States that included a
visit with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that China has been annoyed by
coverage of Taiwan in the Hong Kong news media. Last year China's
deputy prime minister, Qian Qichen, publicly rebuked Radio
Television Hong Kong for giving airtime to a senior Taiwanese
official who sought to explain President Lee Teng-hui's policy of
``state to state'' relations between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Qian's complaints, the long-time director of
Radio Television Hong Kong was reassigned to a job in Hong Kong's
trade and economic office in Japan.

<P>
   Russell Robertson was grappling with an unusual assignment. As
an industrial designer, his mission was to figure out how kitchen
appliances will be designed when, as he put it, ``the fridge talks
to the coffee pot.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes twinkled as he spoke, but he was not kidding about the
basic concept. In fact, while the idea may have once sounded
ridiculous, predictions of the advent of such devices are now
becoming almost cliched.
</P>
<P>
   News articles champion the coming era of ``smart'' appliances
and ``pervasive'' or ``ubiquitous'' computing. Engineers have
demonstrated how once-dumb machines, if embedded with tiny
computers, might communicate wirelessly and embark on tasks like
making coffee or ordering groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers, like Merloni, an Italian company, have
already started to sell a few products. It appears that the age of
``things that think,'' a phrase that emerged from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory in 1995, is nearly upon
us.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? At ECCO Design in New York City, where Robertson
works, that was the question behind four months of research
commissioned by an appliance manufacturer. Sketches on the walls
behind him showed refrigerators and microwave ovens, some shaded
with colored pencil and surrounded by scribbled notes. Binders
stuffed with survey results sat on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   The project, said Eric Chan, ECCO's founder, had caused his
company to ask some fundamental questions: Do people need all this
automatic information? Do they want technology to be that
pervasive?
</P>
<P>
   Others are starting to wonder the same things, whether they are
engaged in idle conversation or seriously pondering the questions
in company meetings. Manufacturing companies are hiring design
firms and consultants to research whether people would use
something like a networked washing machine or a refrigerator that
knows when they're out of milk. Anthropologists who understand
consumer behavior are in sudden demand.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, too, are starting to be heard above the trumpeting of
pervasive-technology's virtues. At a recent Intel conference on
product design, some attendees belittled the concept as nothing
more than clever marketing by companies trying to sell new
products.
</P>
<P>
   In NetFuture, an online newsletter about technology and social
responsibility, Langdon Winner, a political science professor at
the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, described most
pervasive-computing devices as ``sheer silliness'' and criticized
researchers for spending more time trying to make appliances talk
than attempting to mend society's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ubiquitous-computing development is a tool in search
of a purpose,'' Winner said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, new technology has always drawn skeptics _ even the
wheel probably had its doubters. And questions about whether people
really need some sort of new technology can seem pointless in a
historical context. Who imagined 30 years ago that computers would
seem so essential or that microwave ovens would be in practically
every kitchen?
</P>
<P>
   And how many people would have forecast that the videophone, a
technology that had been heralded by futurists for decades, would
turn out to be such a dud among consumers?
</P>
<P>
   But predicting whether a technology will be adopted is critical
for companies that want to succeed, or even survive, in the
marketplace. The ones that can figure out what will be deemed
useful, superfluous or downright ridiculous will win. And today, as
tiny, wireless computer systems are being perfected and the
Internet is allowing the distribution of data in seconds, dozens of
appliance manufacturers are betting that some sort of
pervasive-computing devices will come to be considered as necessary
as a telephone. The trick, for them, is to figure out which ones.
</P>
<P>
   A conference earlier this year in Gaithersburg, Md., gave some
indication of how much engineers and computer scientists are
convinced that networked communications devices will be mainstays
of the future. The conference, called Pervasive Computing 2000, was
sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and
considered the development of standards for such devices.
</P>
<P>
   On two snowy days in January, nearly 200 engineers crowded into
a dimly lit conference room to discuss topics like sensors that
could recognize conference attendees and home appliances that could
alert manufacturers when a repair was needed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the speakers was William Mark, vice president for
information and computing sciences at SRI International, which
specializes in developing new technologies. He talked about the
complications that could arise once appliances were asked to
communicate. Each machine has its own language, he said, displaying
slides with cartoon images of a toaster and refrigerator. A toaster
would know only ``toasterese'': signals like ``heat'' or ``brown.''
Similarly, a refrigerator would know only ``fridgese.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, he said, the two would have to use an intermediary
language to communicate. And they might also need a language to
communicate with humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future,'' Mark said, ``it's going to be quaint to think
of a time when refrigerators didn't talk to you.'' He ended his
talk with a slide showing a simple equation: ``Billions of people
plus billions of devices equals a community, not a rabble.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, Jeffrey Senn, chief technologist for the Maya
Design Group, a software company in Pittsburgh, shook his head.
When asked why he seemed to disagree with the presentation, Senn
said: ``Not billions of devices. Trillions of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the presentation, and throughout the conference, the
question of why people will need toasters that talk to
refrigerators was never broached. And to Senn, such questions are
not really pertinent. ``Creating the raw technology'' is the
engineers' objective, he said. The market will answer the question
of whether it is needed or not, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of response that Stephen Talbott, the editor of
the NetFuture newsletter, considers a ``disastrous abdication of
moral responsibility.'' Scientists who refuse to look at the
consequences of their inventions or who resist questions of
societal need are engaging in a ``willful blindness that cannot
lead to good for society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about what is best for society, he argued, should come
before questions of technological standards or the adoption of new
technology. Even asking whether something would be useful might not
be enough, he said. ``We should be less concerned about embedding
little bits of silicon in everything and more concerned about
embedding ourselves more deeply in real world contexts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Winner, at Rensselaer Polytechnic, said he wished that engineers
would consider the unintended effects of new technologies before
creating devices that seemed to promise to save time or reduce
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people add more and more time-saving, labor-saving
equipment to their homes,'' Winner wrote in an issue of NetFuture,
``their lives do not become simpler and easier. Instead their days
become even more complicated, demanding and rushed.'' The latest
push to embed chips and communication devices into appliances,
Winner said in an interview, is little more than serving ``the
exotic needs of the world's wealthiest people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the MIT Media Lab, where many of today's ideas about
pervasive computing were born, such criticisms sting.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gershenfeld, a professor in the laboratory and the author
of ``When Things Start to Think'' (Henry Holt &AMP; Co., 1999), wonders
if people who ask about the need for embedded computers get the
point. He envisions pervasive computing, he said, as a way to make
people's lives better, not worse.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, for example, he developed a smart chair that
sensed even the smallest gestures. Soon NEC, a computer company,
was using the technology for its airbag controls. Once the seat
recognizes that it is occupied by a small child, the airbags will
not inflate, reducing the chance of injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   He gives other examples in which tiny computers could be
embedded in anything from shelves to name tags to help people with
rudimentary tasks. The best part, he said, is that people might not
even know that the computers were there. ``I would rather call it
unobtrusive computing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the kitchen is where most pervasive-computing appliances
are emerging. Sunbeam, for example, recently announced the creation
of a company called Thalia Products (Thalia stands loosely for
``thinking and linking intelligent appliances) and is planning to
offer items like a smart coffeemaker, a smart mixer and a smart
alarm clock this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The mixer will weigh ingredients and follow recipes stored on an
Internet-connected console, the company's Web site says. The clock
will synchronize other clocks in the house and give you information
about other appliances, like the fact that your coffeemaker is out
of water.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni is already selling machines from its new interactive
product line, Ariston Digital. ``Phone the washing machine and
practice e-cooking,'' a recent press release said. The Ariston
Digital Oven can download recipes from the Web, regulate its
temperature based on its sensors' information about how the food is
cooking and turn itself off when it senses that the dish is done.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Merloni's products added urgency to ECCO Design's
work for the appliance manufacturer (ECCO will not disclose its
client's name, but it is not Merloni). Late last fall, Chan and his
designers interviewed chefs, parents, anthropologists, consultants
and software makers. They sent out a questionnaire to 50 people and
brainstormed about what features consumers would probably reject.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the notion of a refrigerator that automatically
ordered replenishments started to sound less feasible. If the
refrigerator was supposed to sense that the milk was low, for
example, the milk would probably have to be placed on the same spot
on the same shelf each time it was returned so a sensor could track
its weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what if a child suddenly puts something on Shelf 3 instead
of Shelf 4?'' Robertson asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``People fear being locked into a system,'' Chan said. If
appliances are going to be intelligent, he said, they need to be
intelligent enough to know when to let human nature run its course.
At the conference in Maryland, one speaker imagined a day when his
trash compactor would notice that he had thrown away a box of
Wheaties and automatically order a new box. But what if he was
going to be away for a week or was in the mood for Cheerios?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the innovations related to smart appliances remind Judy
Tso, an anthropologist hired by ECCO Design, of the promises of the
``smart house,'' a concept that has been floating around among
architects and builders for more than a decade. In one version,
systems for heating, cooling and security adjust automatically,
depending on who is home.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line is that the benefits are wimpy,'' said
Tso, who has her own consulting company, called Aha Solutions
Unlimited, in Boston. ``And it is expensive.'' With any new
technology that might be introduced, she said, ``there is always
this tension between what it will cost and what it will do for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   James M. Utterback, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of
Management, has spent several years looking at the life span of
technological innovations. If a product is to succeed, price plays
a critical role, he said. And timing can be everything: Companies
that continue to manufacture a product when a new standard is
starting to evolve, for example, will almost inevitably fail, as
diskette and typewriter companies have learned too well.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the main reasons that companies with new products
stumble, Utterback said, ``is that they fail to appreciate or
investigate the marketplace.'' Many companies simply ask, ``What
can we do with the technology?'' And once they determine what they
can do, he said, they assume that people will want it.
</P>
<P>
   To Utterback, many of the pervasive-computing appliances he has
heard about fall into that category. ``They seem kind of silly to
me,'' he said offhandedly at the end of an interview. ``Like having
your fridge order your groceries. Who really wants it?''

 &HT;    LEGISLATION FILED TO COMBAT SEXUAL SLAVERY
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two senators who agree on little else introduced
almost identical bills Wednesday to crack down on the growing
worldwide problem of trafficking women and girls for forced
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Most people ``don't believe this could actually be happening
today, in the year 2000,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Wis., one of
the most liberal members of Congress, who has formed an alliance
with staunch conservative Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Central Intelligence Agency estimates
that at least 700,000 women are tricked or kidnapped and taken to a
foreign country for forced prostitution each year. The CIA reports
that 50,000 women and girls are brought into the United States
annually for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Among other provisions, the bills would double the maximum
penalties for ``enticement into slavery and sale into involuntary
servitude'' to 20 years and adds the possibility of a life sentence
in cases involving death, rape or abuse of children.
</P>
<P>
   Victims, who are now often jailed or deported, would be eligible
for temporary visas, legal aid, and crisis treatment. To aid in
prevention, the United States would sponsor a public information
campaign abroad to warn women not to trust offers of lucrative jobs
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators differed on only one issue, U.S. sanctions
against countries that refuse to fight this crime. Brownback wants
to mandate specific sanctions, and Wellstone would give the
president more leeway.
</P>
<P>
   However, the two senators agreed to back whichever version
emerges from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Brownback said
he was hopeful that the panel would move soon, although no action
is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   A companion bipartisan bill is moving through the House.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists have said that no country has laws that
are tough enough to stop this modern sexual slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutions are rare, even in the United States, where some
traffickers in Florida last year were given only a two-year
sentence for holding a group of Mexican women, including a
14-year-old girl, under armed guard and forcing them to service
migrant workers in trailers converted to brothels.
</P>

MUNICH, 1946: WORDS FROM A SEDER UNLIKE ANY OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo of one of the woodcuts is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling

 By PETER HELLMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every Seder table needs its user's manual; it's called the
Haggadah _ Hebrew for ``telling.'' As Passover begins next
Wednesday evening, our family's choice will be the old standby
distributed since 1934 by Maxwell House coffee (40 million copies
in print), augmented by direct readings from Exodus. The Passover
story, with its ever timely theme of liberation from bondage, has
begotten thousands of Haggadot, including specialized versions for
feminists, vegetarians, hippies, gays, lesbians, Christians and
ecumenicals.
</P>
<P>
   This year even brings a children's pop-up Haggadah based on the
famed Bird's Head Haggadah from Germany (circa 1300), in which
humans do indeed have slightly macabre birds' heads. At West Side
Judaica in New York, I counted 70 Haggadot for sale. Cody's Books
in Berkeley, Calif., claims to stock 200.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, just as Seder night is different from all other nights, one
long forgotten Haggadah stands out as starkly, darkly different
from all others. Called ``A Survivors' Haggadah,'' it was created
by and for displaced Jews in Munich, Germany, for their first
Passover after the end of the Third Reich. These stateless souls
were called in Hebrew she'erith haptelah, the remnant that escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The Seders were held in the Deutsches Theater restaurant on
April 15 and 16, 1946. The unlikely publisher was the occupying
American Third Army. Two years ago, the American Jewish Historical
Society published 500 copies of a richly annotated collector's
edition, priced at $360. Now comes a commercial edition from the
Jewish Publication Society, at $50.
</P>
<P>
   The DPs, or ``displaced persons,'' who sat down to Seder in
Munich in 1946 were no longer in bondage to Hitler, yet neither
were they free. They could not or would not go home to the wreckage
of their former lives. Those who fervently wished to go to
Palestine faced the British blockade. America was then closed to
them. And, of course, their families had been murdered. How were
they to ``celebrate'' Passover?
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Haggadot praise God for the miracle of deliverance
from bondage into freedom. But the pages of ``A Survivors'
Haggadah'' resonate with bitter sarcasm toward the God who was a
spectator to the Holocaust. Consider its twist on the normally
joyful Seder song ``Dayenu,'' which means ``It would have been
enough.'' Instead of reciting God's wondrous acts and adding that
refrain, this version ticks off the atrocities permitted by God:
``Had he given us Hitler but not ghettos, dayenu. Had he given us
ghettos but no gas chambers and crematories, dayenu. Had he given
us gas chambers and crematories but our wives and children had not
been tortured, dayenu.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven spectral woodcuts invoke the Jews' bondage to Hitler. Most
are accompanied by traditional text. A biblical passage, for
example, accompanies ``Selection,'' which shows a hard-faced Nazi
officer separating a boy from his mother as masses of Jews trudge
off toward smokestacks: ``While Pharaoh decreed death only for male
children, Laban sought to uproot all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Haggadah's final woodcut, smoke is seen curling up from
tall chimneys, becoming the disembodied heads of an old couple and
a child. The four-word caption, ``We are bound to ...,'' will be
cryptic to those unfamiliar with the traditional Haggadah, where
these words, taken from the psalmic verses of praise called hallel,
continue, ``... thank, laud, praise, glorify and exalt him who
performed all these miracles for our forefathers and us.'' ``A
Survivors' Haggadah'' chooses silence, not praise, for the God who
performed no Holocaust miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its singular power, ``A Survivors' Haggadah'' was
quickly forgotten. Then, three years ago, Saul Tauster, a retired
professor of law and social policy at Brandeis University, was
sifting through four generations' worth of family papers when a
copy of ``A Survivors' Haggadah'' fell out of a box of his late
father's papers. On its cover was a white letter A in a red and
blue bull's-eye, the emblem of the Third Army.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Tauster set out to learn all he could about this
curious Haggadah, even though he was proficient in neither Hebrew
nor Yiddish. A little dabbling quickly became an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The text was credited to Yosef Sheinson, a Hebrew teacher from
Lithuania who had survived the war as a slave laborer before
arriving in Munich as a DP. Sheinson also created the Haggadah's
line-drawn borders, mixing pharaonic, Nazi and Zionist motifs. And
those accomplished woodcuts? They were signed only Ben Benyamin
(``Son of the Son of the Right Hand''). It took two years of
digging before Tauster identified the artist as Miklos Adler, a
survivor from Hungary. At the end of the war, Adler had returned to
Debrecen, his hometown, and had gone to work on a portfolio of 16
woodcuts. In a preface, Adler wrote: ``My means, I know, are modest
and old-fashioned; my style, I know, is poor. And yet I feel that
I, too, must tell what follows in these pages. Oh, my murdered
brothers and sisters, you who sanctified God's name! I will mourn
you until I die.''
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1965, and Tauster suspects, based on interviews with
several relatives, that the artist never knew that seven of his
woodcuts had found their way into ``A Survivors' Haggadah.''
</P>
<P>
   The Haggadah's preamble, written by Abraham Klausner, an
American Army chaplain assigned to the DPs, invokes the name of
Gen. Lucian K. Truscott, commander of the occupation army. But it
ignores his predecessor, Gen. George S. Patton, who had been fired
by Eisenhower. While Patton had only scorn for the plight of the
DPs (his diary attacks those who ``believe the displaced person is
a human being, which he is not, and this applies particularly to
the Jews, who are lower than animals''), Truscott had only empathy.
His grandson, the writer Lucian K. Truscott IV, told Tauster that
his grandfather had ``indelibly marked the Holocaust on his
family's conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tauster's Seder next week, the traditional Haggadah will be
supplemented by readings from ``A Survivors' Haggadah.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfying a yen to hold in my own hands a 1946 original, I
visited the rare book room (frigid to preserve delicate pages, pens
prohibited lest they leave errant marks) in the library of the
Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. Two copies are in the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have something of related interest,'' volunteered David
Wachtel, a library associate. He handed me another small Haggadah
in a slipcase of multiple pastel hues, this one published for
Passover in 1945, nearly two months before the Nazi surrender, by
the advancing 42nd Infantry Division, known as the Rainbow
Division.

   Tucked into the Rainbow Haggadah was an accompanying letter from
Eli Bohnen, a Jewish chaplain with the division, dated April 16,
1945, exactly one year before ``A Survivors' Haggadah'' was used at
the Deutsches Theater. ``I am confident,'' he wrote, ``that it is
the first Hebrew religious work printed in Germany since the advent
of Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter recounts, too, that the Haggadah was printed on a
captured offset press. The press was dirty, and ``the only rags
available were some Nazi flags.''
</P>
<P>
   For once, the chaplain concluded, Nazi flags ``served a useful
purpose.''

   You will find nothing unusual about this menu until you come to
the ingredient in the chicken recipe, garam masala. Before you
discard the menu because you don't have the seasoning in the house
_ whatever it may be _ please read on.
</P>
<P>
   Garam masala is an Indian spice blend that contains coriander,
cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, mace and black peppercorns. All of
those ingredients are available in most ordinary supermarkets. They
do not produce a hot seasoning, but rather one that is subtly sweet
and full of aroma.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot find garam masala easily, you can make your own by
combining: 1 2/3 tablespoons ground coriander seeds, 3/4 teaspoon
cinnamon, 3/4 tablespoon ground cumin, 3/4 teaspoon ground
cardamom, 3/4 tablespoon mace and 3/4 tablespoon ground pepper.
Stir well and store whatever is leftover in a tightly covered
container.
</P>
<P>
   When using the mixture in this recipe sprinkle the chicken
lightly on both sides with it, something more than a teaspoon but
less than a tablespoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the chicken recipe cooking the fennel for a long time makes
it as sweet as the cooked onions but with that wonderful mild
licorice taste. The tomato paste adds a touch of acidity and the
whole is a fine balance of flavors.
</P>
<P>
   The potatoes could not be simpler and proof that you can have
crisp slices without deep fat frying. There are a lot of
vegetables, like sweet potatoes, zucchini, yellow squash that can
be roasted the same way.
</P>

   IMF-PROTEST (Washington) _ Reciting a litany of negatives about
trade, thousands of steelworkers, truck drivers, auto workers and
other union members rallied on Capitol Hill and swept through the
halls of Congress in a show of muscle intended to block a trade
agreement with China. Their message, conveyed both by union leaders
and rank and file members who traveled here from as far away as
Michigan and Nebraska, was that trade was working for American
corporations but not for American workers. It served to kick off a
series of demonstrations planned by a diverse coalition of activist
groups for the next five days around meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   ISRAEL-PRISONERS (Jerusalem) _ Reversing itself, the Supreme
Court of Israel ruled Wednesday that Israel is not justified in
holding Lebanese detainees as ``bargaining chips`` for missing
Israeli soldiers. The court ordered that eight of 15 Lebanese
detainees who have been imprisoned without charges for more than a
decade be released immediately. In the closed-door hearing, the
court said the men did not ``pose a danger to state security'' and
that, ``absent any other reason for their arrest,'' their long
detention was illegal. By Deborah Sontag.

   TEST-PROTESTS (Great Barrington, Mass.) _ From the Berkshires to
Cambridge, brushfires of civil disobedience flared in classrooms
across Massachusetts on Wednesday, as hundreds of high school
sophomores, and dozens of fourth- and eighth-graders, boycotted the
first of nine days of statewide standardized testing. In a sign of
rising student and parent discontent with politicians' reliance on
such tests, the protests followed _ and exceeded _ similar
rebellions in recent months in Illinois, Ohio, Louisiana, Wisconsin
and Florida. Though most of the students in Massachusetts reported
to class as scheduled, they chose to write essays about their
opposition to testing rather than answer the questions posed. Some
of the students face disciplinary actions ranging from suspension
to having a failing test grade incorporated into their third
quarter marks. By Jacques Steinberg.

suspicion that heavy drinking in his youth caused the brain disease
that crippled him later in life, a new report confirms that he died
of a rare brain disorder, but says alcohol was not to blame. Far
more likely, the progressive deterioration of O'Neill's brain was
due to a rare genetic disorder, said Dr. Bruce H. Price, chairman
of the neurology department at McLean Hospital in Boston, and

   NAZI-ART-MUSEUMS (New York) _ After nearly two years of scouring
their collections for artworks that might once have been stolen by
the Nazis, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art
and a few other major American museums are finally starting to
reveal their findings. But they are taking different tacks, and
some are clearly closer to the full disclosure they promised than
others. Some of the works could conceivably now be claimed by heirs
to those who owned them half a century ago. At 9 a.m. Wednesday,
the Met posted on its website (www.metmuseum.org) a list of 393
paintings, drawn from the 2,700 European paintings in its
collection, whose ownership histories have a gap between 1933 and
1945 _ even if it is only a month. By Judith Dobrzynski.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If any product demonstrates the gap between what can be created
and what people actually want, the videophone may be it.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the telephone was invented, according to historians
of technology, people have been talking about what seemed like the
next best step: the ability to see the person on the other end of
the line. As far back as the early 1930s, engineers have shown that
it can be done. Products have appeared on the market for 30 years.
Yet even today the vast majority of households are still using
regular telephones, conversing blindly without the benefit of
screen or camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been on the verge of happening for nearly a hundred years
but hasn't yet,'' said Paul Levinson, a professor of communications
and media studies at Fordham University and the author of ``The
Soft Edge: A Natural History and Future of the Information
Revolution'' (Routledge, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Hochheiser, AT&AMP;T's corporate historian, calls the
videophone ``the most famous failure in the history of the Bell
system.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not for lack of trying. In 1931, AT&AMP;T conducted the first
test of a concept that was like two-way television. In the test,
which was set up between two offices in New York City, a screen was
available at each location, and people could see and hear
themselves on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Depression and the excitement about television's broadcast
capabilities got in the way of further development until the 1950s,
when AT&AMP;T decided to try again. By 1964, it had a viable product to
unveil: the PicturePhone, which was demonstrated to enthusiastic
crowds at the New York World's Fair. ``People seemed to think it
was wonderful,'' Hochheiser said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the PicturePhone came on the market in Pittsburgh and
Chicago five years later, he said, very few people bought it. In
1972, AT&AMP;T pulled the plug.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have attributed the flop to several factors, like the
phone's high cost and the fact that it was useful only if the
recipient of a call had one, too.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason usually tops the list: ``It turned out that it
wasn't entirely clear that people wanted to be seen on a
telephone,'' Hochheiser said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T tried one more time, in the early 1990s, with a product
called the Videophone 2500, which has also been discontinued. And
other companies have come out with similar products, many of which
can still be purchased today. But Berge Ayvazian, chief executive
of the Yankee Group, a technology consulting company, said he saw
the real desire for such devices coming from corporations that want
to use them for videoconferences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are still people who believe that the videophone will
someday become a fixture in the home. Ayvazian, for example, said
he could imagine a popular version of the videophone that would let
online shoppers talk to sales representatives who could show them
products. And Alan I. Marcus, a professor at Iowa State University
and co-author of ``Technology in America: A Brief History''
(Harcourt Brace, 1999), said that the Internet's broadband
capabilities, coupled with the youngest generation's focus on
visual material, would kick off a new desire for communication with
video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are getting close to creating a demand for it,''
Marcus said. ``And someday we'll think about the old days when we
couldn't see each other while we were talking.''

WEB SITES CLAMOR FOR TEEN-AGERS' ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ERIC V. COPAGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do teen-agers want? That question _ which once would have
elicited a ``who cares?'' _ has become a $150 billion mantra among
advertisers tripping over one another as they clamor for their
attention. The burgeoning population of adolescents is predicted to
grow to 34 million from its current 29 million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Although the answer to the question remains a mystery, a clue
may be found in the technology with which the teen-agers of
Generation Y have grown up. Susan Chaggaris, director of a panel on
teen-agers for North Castle Partners Advertising, which specializes
in the teen-age market, said adolescents use the Internet mostly to
make new friends and keep in touch with older ones and to research
homework.
</P>
<P>
   But teen-agers also put information about themselves on the
Internet. What do their home pages and e-zines reveal about them as
a group?
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the Web to discover what teen-agers are posting about
themselves can be problematic. Typing anything containing ``teen''
into some search engines is as likely as not to return a multitude
of variations on ``Lolita Does Dallas.'' And the sheer exertion and
expertise needed to start and maintain a Web site may account for
why so many prospective sites return the message ``URL cannot be
found'' or ``site under construction.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites that do exist are often, not surprisingly, about their
creators. ``There is usually an `about me' thing,'' said Esther
Drill, executive director and co-founder of gURL.com, which posts
home pages by teen-age girls. ``What's fun is that they have rants,
which are mini-essays about what they feel passionately about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerl.org, an elegant, spare site created by a 19-year-old, is a
case in point. It includes questions and answers detailing a few of
her favorite things (smell? banana nut bread; brand of gum?
``something sugarless'') and links to friends' sites with names
like Insanitarium, One More Addiction and Colourless World. The
Gerl site mixes the bathos of the cartoon heroine Daria with 1970s
Joni Mitchell-like fragility.
</P>
<P>
   Bolt.com, a site for teen-agers and young adults, offers
earthier fare on a section of the site that every week offers
temporary lodging for 13 home pages created by teen-agers. Recent
highlights included a delightfully surrealistic haze of a page
called Dreaming Realm, created by a 19-year-old. His dense site
includes his meditation on men and women. (He writes that when
girls ask, ``Do I look fat in this dress?'' it means, ``We haven't
fought in a while.'') There is also Real Audio video of several
versions of the Lambada (The Forbidden Dance) and a selection of
the teen-ager's artwork and poetry, and the poetry of visitors to
his realm.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Bolt.com is a 15-year-old girl's colorful and elaborate
homage to ``Sailor Moon,'' an animated Japanese story about a
14-year-old girl who is given magical powers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes teen-agers are happy to simply document the lives of
their favorite television, movie and musical stars.
</P>
<P>
   The more outward-looking Web sites even take on established
presences on the Internet. Steven Drypolcher, 16, who created the
game site www.game-guru.net, said: ``I couldn't relate to other
game sites because they had no teen angle. Older guys will describe
things in technical terms that are way over the head of teens.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is possible that Drypolcher was speaking with some
self-promotional exaggeration _ certainly top gaming sites run by
adults speak ``teen'' flawlessly _ his Game-Guru is a clean,
well-organized and attractive site, done in cool robin's egg blue
and drawing a staff from his school computer club. He said his ``as
for now'' nonprofit site gets an impressive 10,000 hits a day.
``Every time I put in an article, I send it to a gaming news site,
such as Blue's News or Voodoo Extreme, and they will post it,'' he
said. ``From there, people see it and follow the page.''
</P>
<P>
   But the days of the renegade teen-age Webmaster may be coming to
an end as Mother, Father and Big Brother see the dollar signs and
catch teen-ager fever. The phrase ``by teens, for teens'' seems to
have become a kind of drumbeat to market a site to adolescents.
Even the likes of the MXGonline.com megasite (run in part with
support from USA Networks) bills itself as ``built by girls for
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Edelman, the 41-year-old president of the Student Center, a
network of a dozen Web sites for college students and teen-agers,
contemplated the changes in teen-agers' presence on the Internet
over the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays it would be very hard to start because there has been
such an explosion,'' Edelman said. ``Just two or three years ago,
it was far easier to get links to your site because there was less
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelman's company has bought two sites from teen-agers,
including Technoteen.com and Teens-online.com, which attract more
girls than boys. Another site Edelman owns, Teenadvice.net, says in
its About Us section, ``If we want to talk about music, we'd rather
talk with our peers than with the frustrated 40-somethings reliving
their Woodstock years.'' All of Edelman's sites are run by
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   So, according to the Internet, what do teen-agers want? They
want to make money. And they want to be celebrities, or at least
meet some celebrities. And most of all, it seems, they want to
explore and interacting with the world in a way that can be can be
summed up with lyrics from those Paleolithic Woodstock years: ``See
me. Feel me. Touch me. Heal me.''

lives may be pleased to learn that it can also play a role after
their deaths. A Web site called FinalThoughts.com offers its users
a place to store e-mail messages online so they can be sent to
family members and friends after each writer has died. Think of it
as e-mail from beyond the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The site was created by Todd Michael Krim, 30, a lawyer from Los
Angeles. He conceived of the idea on a particularly turbulent
transatlantic flight to London last year. As the plane shook
violently, he realized that he hadn't properly said goodbye to his
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   While the ``afterlife e-mails,'' as they're called, became the
basis for creating the site, Krim envisioned FinalThoughts as a
free, one-stop source where people interested in death and dying
could find all kinds of information, like descriptions of estate
and funeral planning and online discussions about spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   With help from his three brothers and $500,000 in seed money,
Krim began operating FinalThoughts last September
(www.finalthoughts.com). It makes money from banner advertisements
and commissions on purchases made by visitors who click on links
like Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a mission to bring awareness to this issue and
encourage advanced planning,'' Krim, who has quit his legal job,
said in an interview. ``I want people to recognize this is
something they should be doing for their family. The practical side
is to ease the financial and emotional burdens by making these
decisions in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the site's many other features, Krim is asked most
often about the afterlife e-mail. Each user chooses a ``guardian
angel'' who will notify FinalThoughts after the user has died. The
site notifies intended recipients via e-mail that a message from
the person who has died is waiting to be read.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that Uncle Joe or Aunt Mary doesn't keel over in shock
after receiving a message that appears to have come from the great
beyond, each recipient must click on a hyperlink to view the
message. So far, none of the afterlife e-mail messages have been
activated because no one who has signed up for the service has died
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Groves, 56, a private investigator in Northern California,
is convinced of the site's value. When her husband, Bob, died
suddenly two years ago, Groves was distressed that he had never
discussed funeral arrangements or other end-of-life issues, like
organ donation. Unsure of his wishes, Groves agonized over the
decision, then donated his kidneys and liver for transplants,
acting on what her sons thought their father would have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Groves was directed to FinalThoughts by a kidney transplant
recipient who was familiar with the site's online organ donor
consent forms. Now she takes solace in making her own wishes
available to her family and friends. In messages intended for her
two grown sons, she writes that she is proud of how they have
brought up their own children and tells them, ``You have both been
worthwhile additions to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   She praises one son's strength in protecting her from the
outside world after her husband's death and thanks the other for
his sensitivity and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything Groves has written strives to be profound. She
has posted a small dictionary of her husband's own nonsense
language, defining words he sometimes used with close family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-mail messages I've done are for posterity, something my
family can look at whenever they want,'' Groves said. ``It's
comforting to open an e-mail message, to see these words of love
reinforced. It's something I wished I had been able to have with my
husband. And unlike something tangible, it can't be lost or
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Groves has also taken advantage of the site's Resource Centers,
which include links to articles on coping with loss and to online
support groups. The site also provides online forms in which users
can instruct survivors on nearly every aspect of their wishes after
their deaths. The personal property allocator, for example, lets
relatives know who gets what, while the pet lover's organizer tells
the family how to take care of the parakeets.
</P>
<P>
   Krim emphasized that none of the documents or forms were legally
binding and could not serve to invalidate a will. They can function
as organizational tools and give survivors a clear picture of those
things not mentioned in a will, like a particular song to be played
at a funeral or memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the approximately 10,000 customers who have signed up
for the free afterlife e-mail are under 40, Krim said. He reasons
that people that age are not only more familiar with the Internet
but also view talking about death as less taboo than their parents
and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Krim blanches at being referred to as a cyberspace funeral
director, as he has been in several published articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``FinalThoughts is not morbid at all,'' he said. ``In many ways
the site is life-affirming. We communicate that death is a natural
human experience.''

SHARES IN CHINESE-OWNED INTERNET BUSINESS SET TO GO PUBLIC IN
U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The first of China's leading Internet companies is set
to go public in the United States on Thursday _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering, from Sina.com, is the first of what
are expected to be many such Nasdaq listings in the months ahead.
But investors who buy the stock will not actually own a stake in
China's most popular Internet portal. Instead, they will own a
piece of the Sina.com's offshore Web sites _ a fraction of its core
business.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are buying a stake in the company's marginal Hong
Kong, Taiwan and North American portals. Sina.com, incorporated in
the Cayman Islands, holds various licensing agreements with a
Chinese company that owns the Chinese portal.
</P>
<P>
   People in China's Internet industry are closely watching the
offering, somewhat aghast that American investors may be willing to
accept a company gutted of content. Sina.com's performance will
determine whether other Chinese Internet companies take the plunge
or choose to wait until China's ever-shifting regulations change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it will fly,'' a Chinese Internet entrepreneur
said Wednesday at an industry party in Beijing called ``The Bubble
Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com, founded by a 32-year-old Beijing University graduate,
became the hottest Web site in China last year after it posted
reports of the NATO bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, within minutes of the official press.
</P>
<P>
   And it provided more information than any other mainland source,
relying heavily on foreign news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main Chinese portal is linked to nine different
``channels,'' Web sites that offer everything from news to online
shopping for cellular phones, flowers, even food. The company's
free and fast e-mail accounts and timely news updates have made it
the most popular portal in China for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the IPO, however, will own none of that, thanks to
regulations intended to allow Chinese Internet companies to raise
capital on overseas stock markets while adhering to China's
longstanding ban on foreign investment in the telecommunications
and media industries. Those rules are supposed to change when China
joins the World Trade Organization. And the country has welcomed
private foreign investment in the Internet. Venture capitalists
estimate that as much as $1 billion has flowed into Chinese
Internet start-ups in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   But the country remains fearful of allowing ownership of its new
e-businesses slip overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com quickly grew from a handful of people to more than 500
Wednesday in Zhongguancun, Beijing's answer to Silicon Valley.
Investment bankers were soon offering the company bundles of cash,
and it subsequently raised nearly $100 million, giving it an
estimated market capitalization of close to $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's boldness won it fans, but not among China's
conservative officials, who made it clear that Sina.com would not
be given approval to list abroad unless the company toed Beijing's
line. With its access to venture capital nearly exhausted, the
company was eager to improve relations with the regulators, said
people close to the company. To win their favor, the company
dropped news from all sources other than the state-run press and
removed links on its site that led users to foreign media sites.

DESIGNING A CLEANER, QUIETER SNOWMOBILE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Wyo.)   (Circuits)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clean snowmobile'' may sound like a contradiction in terms.
Snowmobiles produce both noise and exhaust emissions, and the
machines have numerous foes who want them banned from national
parks and other locations.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of engineering students at the State University of
New York in Buffalo may lead the way toward rehabilitating these
vehicles. The students won a design contest by retrofitting a used
snowmobile to eliminate virtually 100 percent of its unburned
hydrocarbon emissions and a great deal of its noise.
</P>
<P>
   The retooled machine won first place in a contest for improved
snowmobile design sponsored by the Society for Automotive
Engineers, which announced the winner in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on
April 4. Seven colleges competed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of a technical solution to a huge
problem,'' said Dr. Lori Fussell of Wilson, Wyo., an environmental
engineer who dreamed up the competition with a colleague two years
ago and has been working on the project ever since. ``People on the
extremes of the issue want either unrestricted use or complete
prohibition,'' Fussell said. ``This way we can deal with it not as
a political issue, but as a research one, finding ways to reduce
pollution and noise at reasonable cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors worked with two-year-old snowmobiles, former rentals
from Yellowstone National Park. ``National parks are extremely
interested in a technological solution to this controversy,''
Fussell said.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong series of tests at Jackson Hole evaluated the
snowmobiles for fuel economy, performance, design, noise and
emissions. At the end, trophies were awarded, and the Buffalo team
got $17,000 in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo group, which won in all categories except
performance (a combination of acceleration, hill climbing and
handling) designed a four-stroke engine that reduced unburned
hydrocarbons to undetectable levels when compared with controls.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up, the University of Waterloo in Ontario, reduced
the amount of unburned hydrocarbons by 95 percent with a two-stroke
engine.
</P>
<P>

the reputation of the snowmobile? Check the Society of Automotive
Engineer's Web site (www.sae.org).

HOLD THE SEAT BELTS AND STEP ON THE GAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By JEFFREY R. YOUNG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When taking the wheel of Crazy Taxi, you can forget about seat
belts, traffic lights and anything you may have learned about
defensive driving. In this game, the more near-collisions,
spin-outs and drawbridge leaps you manage, the bigger the tips from
your virtual passengers, who praise your speed and daring. It's
enough to confirm your worst fears about how taxi drivers view the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy Taxi, an irreverent arcade hit, is now available for
Sega's Dreamcast. When the cab is empty, nothing matters but
picking up passengers. And when there is a fare on board, nothing
matters but getting to the destination as quickly as possible (an
arrow hovering in the sky shows the way).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike adrenaline-fueled racing games like Sega Rally, Crazy
Taxi has no predetermined routes, so players can drive nearly
anywhere, including through shopping malls or even into the ocean.
Because the goal of Crazy Taxi isn't just reaching a finish line
but also pleasing passengers, the riders do their share of
back-seat driving and are quick to leap out of the cab without
paying if they think the trip is taking too long.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is a fictional metropolis that blends the hills and
trolleys of San Francisco with features from other cities. The
passengers' destinations, however, are real product placements;
they include Pizza Hut, KFC and Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   The game is intuitive enough that players can start their own
crazy taxi services immediately. But to gain anything more than
mediocre tips, it is necessary to memorize the layout of the city.
After all, cutting through an alley can shave valuable seconds off
many a trip.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to master the advanced driving maneuvers taught in
the manual, like the ``crazy drift'' _ shifting the cab into
reverse while slamming the wheel to the left or right to make
sharper high-speed turns.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy Taxi falls into a tradition of arcade classics that place
gamers in seemingly mundane jobs, but with a twist. Perhaps the
best example is Paperboy, where players run a paper route but score
points for breaking windows of houses belonging to nonpaying
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples are Burgertime, where players take the role of a
chef who builds giant hamburgers while running from evil walking
eggs, pickles and hot dogs, and Tapper, where players must sling
beers to an endless stream of misfit drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi is a nearly perfect copy of
the arcade game, with rich graphics and fast-paced action that
shows off what Sega's 128-bit game console can do. The home version
also offers an extra city to explore and a training section to help
players hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce the game's theme that only a wild misfit would want
a license to drive a taxi, players must choose to play one of four
antisocial drivers. Each has a different attitude and a different
type of cab.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a half-hearted attempt to give personalities and
backgrounds to the passengers. These aren't exactly Taxicab
Confessions: the game manual says some of the many passengers
you'll encounter are the flower-toting Pierre, ``who spends all of
his time and money chasing women'' and a graduate student named
Dan, who is doing his thesis on ``the impact of the fashion
industry on world markets.'' But it's hard to deduce these
backgrounds from the lines passengers mumble as they enter and
leave the cabs.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack, with neo-punk tunes by Offspring and Bad
Religion, matches the game's frenetic pace. But unfortunately,
Crazy Taxi has just a few songs. A few trips around the block lead
to the painful sensation of being stuck in a car tuned to a grating
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest allure of Crazy Taxi is that it gives players the
satisfaction of speeding through city streets that in real life
would doom drivers to gridlock. That puts it in a category with
recent games like Midway's San Francisco Rush and Microsoft's
Midtown Madness, where players can race through virtual renderings
of well-known cities.
</P>
<P>
   The incredible level of detail in the games also points to how
far driving games have come from the low-resolution days of Pole
Position. In Crazy Taxi, it's easy to keep the speedometer at or
above 80 miles per hour, and there are no police officers to
interfere.
</P>
<P>
   When a lane of traffic backs up, just use the sidewalk and plow
through phone booths, hot dog carts and other obstacles. You can
adjust the density of traffic in the game by using the options
settings, but even the thickest traffic level leaves plenty of room
to weave an uninterrupted path of cab exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Those cab rides through Times Square might seem tame in
comparison. &QL;

PACIFIC CENTURY CYBERWORKS AND AUSTRALIA'S TELSTRA PLAN 2 MAJOR
DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Pacific Century CyberWorks Ltd. does not even own
Hong Kong's local telephone company yet. But the upstart is already
selling off chunks of it.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century said Wednesday it would sell 40 percent of the
mobile-phone business of Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT to Telstra Corp., the
state-controlled phone company of Australia, for $1.5 billion.
Telstra will also invest $1.5 billion in Pacific Century to create
an alliance that its partners said would be Asia's leading provider
of Internet, data, wireless, and broadband communications services.
</P>
<P>
   Both transactions depend on Pacific Century's completion of its
huge acquisition of Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT. That deal, which was
announced in late February and has been called into question by
Pacific Century's eroding share price, must be approved by HKT's
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Li, the 33-year-old who started Pacific Century
CyberWorks less than a year ago and has turned it into one of the
brightest stars in Asia's cyberspace, exuded confidence Wednesday.
``We have not been sitting around waiting for technical issues to
be settled in the merger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Li's chief lieutenant, Francis Yuen, predicted that Pacific
Century would gain the approval of Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT's
shareholders without much trouble. And analysts in Hong Kong agreed
that shareholders would regard Telstra's investment as a vote of
confidence in the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific Century is getting $3 billion from Telstra, which
should reassure Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT's shareholders that the deal
will go through,'' said Greg Feldberg, the head of Internet and
telecommunications research at Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century, which owns a portfolio of investments in
Internet start-ups and is developing a satellite-delivered Internet
and television programming service, offered to buy HKT in a stock
deal initially worth more than $38 billion. But the company's
shares have been dragged down in the global sell-off of technology
stocks, and the offer is now valued at barely $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century's shares were suspended Wednesday before the
announcement of Telstra's investment. Some analysts predicted that
they would soar Thursday, since the shares of Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT,
which now trade in tandem with Pacific Century, jumped 14 percent
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Telstra's planned investment has eased one big worry: That
Pacific Century would be swamped by $11.3 billion in debt after it
took over Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT. Li estimated that Telstra's $3
billion _ plus $2 billion already on the balance sheet of HKT and
another $2 billion on his company's balance sheet _ would enable
Pacific Century to whittle down the merged company's debt to $5
billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite its many financial benefits, Li preferred to focus on
the strategic implications of the alliance. He said Telstra and
Pacific Century would create two joint companies: a regional
mobile-telephone carrier and a wholesale carrier of voice, data,
and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Li said the carrier would immediately compete with international
players like Global Crossing and Level 3. And he said the partners
would take it public. The regional mobile-phone service, which will
be 60 percent-owned by Pacific Century, will include HKT's 900,000
subscribers. In addition to cash, Telstra will contribute an
undisclosed number of its cellular customers outside Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lofty multiples of recent cellular deals like
Vodaphone's acquisition of Mannesmann, some analysts said they were
not impressed by Pacific Century's deal. ``Hong Kong has a very
competitive mobile market, so perhaps the customers aren't worth as
much,'' said David Webb, a former investment banker who edits
Webb-site.com, an Internet service that tracks deals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important than cash, Telstra will offer Pacific
Century another distribution channel for its ambitious Internet and
entertainment service. The service, dubbed Network of the World, is
to be introduced in India and China in July. Skeptics have
questioned whether Li will be able to attract an audience large
enough to justify his enormous investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific Century has gone around the world looking for partners
who will expand the audience for Network of the World,'' Feldberg
said. ``It looks like Telstra will be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Telstra said it wanted to break out of its home
market and ally itself with a company that was perceived as being
on the leading edge of the information revolution. Telstra is still
51 percent-owned by the Australian government. But the government
sold off shares in mid-1998 and late 1999, and says it intends to
sell the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are unifying two large, capable companies who stand apart
from their competitors in being progressive,'' said Ziggy
Switkowksi, the chief executive of Telstra.

BEN &AMP; JERRY'S AGREES TO BE ACQUIRED BY UNILEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's, the quirky Vermont-based ice cream company that
made advancing socially responsible policies a crucial part of its
business strategy, agreed early Wednesday to be acquired by
Unilever PLC, a $50 billion global giant that already owns the
Breyer's and Good Humor ice cream brands.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever is paying $43.60 a share for Ben &AMP; Jerry's, making the
all-cash deal worth about $265.75 million, a significant premium on
Ben &AMP; Jerry's earlier share price, which by early afternoon jumped
$8.125, to $43.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever also said Wednesday that it was paying $2.6 billion for
Slim-Fast, the diet shake company based in West Palm Beach, Fla.
Slim-Fast controls 45 percent of the $1.3 billion nutritional
supplement and weight management market.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal for Ben &AMP; Jerry's appear to preserve the
unusual aspects of a company that has created a loyal following
over the years, creating a fund to help disadvantaged businesses,
contributing the same 7.5 percent of profits to an existing
foundation that works on causes like preserving the environment,
and keeping the company's operations in South Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge win-win for all the constituents involved,'' said
Perry Odak, Ben &AMP; Jerry's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Antony Burgmans, the chairman of Unilever, said in an interview
that he pursued Ben &AMP; Jerry's to fill gaps in his company's product
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a situation where Unilever has the largest ice cream
manufacturing presence in the world, but no strategic presence in
the super-premium category,'' Burgmans said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIOBAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief issues facing Ben &AMP; Jerry's is its distribution
system in the United States, where it sells most of its flavors
like Cherry Garcia and Wavy Gravy. Until 1998, most of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's ice cream was distributed by Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, an
Oakland, Calif.-based company that has a large share of the market.
Ben &AMP; Jerry's broke off the arrangement, which began in 1987, and
replaced it with one that relied on Haagen-Dazs, another big
competitor, as well as Dreyer's and some company-owned
distributors. Many analysts saw this arrangement as a
less-than-ideal solution.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly not a negative for Unilever,'' said Jeffrey
G. Kanter, a food stocks analyst for Prudential Securities on
Tuesday. ``Whether or not it becomes a home run remains to be seen.
Unilever is obviously looking at this for the long term. It's a
fair price for an asset with strong brand equity.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's, which had received takeover offers in the past,
issued an unusual statement in early December in which it said it
had received ``indications of interest'' and would be evaluating
them. The stock has risen since then from about $17 a share, and
people involved with the company, including several owners of
franchised ice-cream shops, said Ben &AMP; Jerry's appeared to be
taking the offers more seriously than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A big concern of the franchise owners has been whether a new
owner would preserve Ben &AMP; Jerry's commitment to social causes like
helping the homeless and conserving the environment. Unilever
maintains on its Web site that it is working to preserve clean
water resources and is involved with other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's made an offer of $31 a share in February, according to
a copy of documents submitted with the offer. Two days later,
Meadowbrook Lane Capital submitted an offer of $32 a share. Both
were lower than the $40 a share that Unilever bid around the same
time, said a person familiar with the negotiations.

HDTV IMAGES ARE THE BEST, BUT BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ERIC A. TAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people would fail to notice the extraordinary picture
quality created by high-definition television. Images from
standard-definition DVDs sparkle, while programs transmitted in
true high-definition format are as sharp and clear as if you were
looking through a window.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing new owners of these expensive digital TVs are
learning is that weak analog television signals, whether broadcast
over the air or transmitted by cable or satellite, may look even
worse on a $5,000 HDTV set than on an old $400 set.
</P>
<P>
   To make standard broadcasts approximate the quality of
high-definition transmissions, manufacturers of HDTV sets have used
line-doubling technology that fills in the blanks on the picture,
erasing the horizontal lines of a regular television image that are
so noticeable on very large screens. (HDTV broadcasts, with more
than twice the number of scanning lines for each frame, do not have
visible lines.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the technology not only doubles the lines but
also doubles picture ``noise'' like snow and wavy lines. If the
original transmission looks bad on a regular TV, the line-doubled
version will look even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely a true phenomenon,'' said Yves Faroudja,
whose company, Faroudja Laboratories, sells $6,000 line-doubling
equipment for sophisticated video installations. ``Line doubling
without precautions will give you a fuzzier picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Line-doubling systems work by comparing one line of the video
image with the line immediately below it, and then approximating
the picture information that should be in a line added between the
two.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's Digital Reality Creation technology compares each line
with a database of tens of thousands of digital video patterns and
picks one to approximate a high-definition image. Philips
Electronics, which will introduce several new picture tube HDTV
models this year, has the Digital Natural Motion system, which
analyzes the movement of each picture element and tries to
compensate for signal noise.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba's technology compares successive video lines but also
looks at the lines from the preceding video frame before deciding
which information to use to fill in the missing picture elements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of these systems is perfect. Before spending $2,500
or more for a digital or digital-ready television, it makes sense
to judge the quality of a regular broadcast, cable or satellite
signal on the high-definition set, not just a high-definition
transmission or a DVD movie.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to turn off line doubling would seem to make sense,
but manufacturers say the additional circuitry needed to disable
the doubling technology would add to the cost of an already
expensive piece of equipment. ``The question is, is line structure
more objectionable than a softer picture,'' said Foy Wilkey, a
product manager for Thomson Multimedia, the French company that
manufactures RCA and Proscan TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could only receive noisy television pictures, I'd think
twice before buying a digital television,'' said Linda Schumann,
director of television product planning for Philips.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: For log cabin Republicans, maybe next time
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)

<P>
   George W. Bush and the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, have
forged a truce as Bush prepares to meet with other gay Republicans
today. Bush excluded Log Cabin leaders from the meeting because
they supported John McCain in the primaries. But Richard Tafel, the
group's executive director, said Bush aides have assured him of
likely inclusion in future sessions. Bush spokesman Scott McClellan
, however, would say only that ``there have been discussions.''
Among those invited today are Carl Schmid, an alternate GOP
convention delegate from Washington, D.C.; former Rep. Steve
Gunderson (R-Wis.); Plattsburgh, N.Y., Mayor Dan Stewart; and D.C.
Councilman David Catania. Said Schmid: ``I think the important
thing is what is talked about, and not exactly which people are in
the room.''
</P>
<P>
   BEG YOUR PARDON?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, asked by newspaper editors Wednesday about a pardon for
President Clinton stemming from the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky
investigation, said Clinton has effectively eliminated the
possibility that he would pardon himself or accept one. ``He said
publicly some time ago that he would neither request nor accept a
pardon. That is the answer to that question,'' Gore said. Laura
Quinn, Gore's communications director, said afterward that Gore
believes Clinton ``has taken (the pardon option) off the table'' by
saying he would refuse to accept one.
</P>
<P>
   I USED TO BE A NEWSPAPER MAN MYSELF
</P>
<P>
   A day after George W. Bush proposed tax credits to help working
people buy health insurance, Al Gore accused his rival of
``political malpractice'' Wednesday at the annual conference of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington. He prodded the
editors to give Bush's proposals a close examination. ``I worked in
journalism long enough (''The Tennessean'' in Nashville) to know
that some claims demand serious scrutiny,'' Gore said. Bush ``wants
us to believe he's committed to issues like education, health care
and the environment. Let's face it, the Bush approach on these
issues is a headline without a story.''
</P>
<P>
   BILLIONS FOR HEALTH IN REMOTE AREAS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush followed up his $42 billion ``New Prosperity
Initiative'' Wednesday with a five-year, $4.3 billion proposal to
expand health care in underserved and remote areas. The cornerstone
is a $3.6 billion proposal to add 1,200 community and migrant
health centers across the country, raising the total to 4,200. Bush
also wants to overhaul the National Health Services Corps to better
place health care providers in areas of shortage. The newest
proposal, called ``Strengthening the Health Care Safety Net,''
would provide $500 million in grants over five years for
communities to establish pilot health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   FOOT-IN-MOUTH DISEASE ?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was working hard to walk away from remarks made
by Texas Health Commissioner William R. Archer III, a Bush-approved
appointee who was quoted as suggesting Hispanics are primarily
responsible for the state's high teen birthrate. Archer issued an
apologetic press release, which read in part: ``I deeply regret
that I have created an erroneous impression about Hispanics and
teen pregnancy.'' Previously, though, he said that teen pregnancy
was hard to limit among Hispanics because they didn't believe
``that getting pregnant is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSE WILL EAT, BUT WON'T ENDORSE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is getting together with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura at
a private dinner Wednesday night at home in Washington. Aides to
both said their meeting would be as much a social opportunity for
them and their wives as a chance to talk issues. But a coveted
endorsement by Ventura, the nation's best-known independent
officeholder, was not in the works for today: ``It just won't
happen,'' said Ventura spokesman John Wodele. After dinner, Gore
heads for Charlotte, N.C., to make good on the rain check he gave a
middle school when he canceled a visit there last week to stay in
Washington and be with a sick friend.
</P>
<P>
   CASH AS THE APPETIZER
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was stimulating his appetite before dinner with Jesse
Ventura by raking in some cash. He was joining fund-raising pro
Terry McAuliffe at an intimate meeting Wednesday to rally other
prominent Democrats to raise money for the party's Aug. 14-17
national convention in Los Angeles. He also was holding forth at a
small, $500,000 luncheon at the Washington home of former New York
Rep. Tom Downey, now a government consultant whose clients include
Microsoft. On Saturday, he and President Clinton are to campaign
together for the first time this year to court big-money
contributors assembled by Hollywood moguls David Geffen and Steven
Spielberg in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   AND CASH FOR DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore kicked off his week of multimillion-dollar fund-raising
for the Democratic National Committee with a dinner last night at
the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Andrew Tobias, the financial
writer who is treasurer of the committee, was the host of the
dinner, where 50 people paid $20,000 each, raising $1 million for
the party.
</P>
<P>
   HARD POSITION ON SOFT MONEY
</P>
<P>
   John McCain vowed to boycott a record Republican fund-raiser and
salute for George W. Bush. McCain, a leading voice for campaign
finance reform, said he'll stay away from the April 26 gala in
Washington because much of the $15 million raised will be
unregulated ``soft money.'' ``I won't have anything to do with soft
money,'' McCain said. Bush is to be the featured speaker at the
fund-raiser, expected to draw more than 1,000 people, including
many members of Congress and governors. Even though he isn't going,
McCain said he remains a loyal party member committed to reducing
the influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN HAS ROLE FOR HOFFA
</P>
<P>
   Sharing a stage with unlikely allies, the Reform Party's Pat
Buchanan promised protesting Teamsters Wednesday that he would
appoint union President James Hoffa to his Cabinet and oppose
normal U.S. trade relations with China. Approving such status for
China, which President Clinton wants, would hand American jobs and
money to a nation with a poor human rights record, Buchanan told
several thousand Teamsters gathered in the Capitol's shadow.
``There's something that unites us all. It's the belief that
citizens of the United States are citizens first before they're
consumers and there are values higher than money,'' Buchanan said.
``This battle's about the American family.''
</P>
<P>
   FINALISTS SET IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   A retired military lawyer, Gene Kelly, won the Democratic
nomination to run against Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in
November. In runoff elections, Kelly beat ex-state Rep. Charles
Gandy, and state Rep. John Culberson defeated businessman Peter
Wareing in a bitterly fought Republican runoff for the seat of GOP
Rep. Bill Archer, who is retiring. Hutchison is an odds-on
favorite, and Democrat Jeff Sells, who won outright last month, is
expected to provide Kelly only token opposition in the
predominantly Republican district in November.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTAL DISCRETION, _ AND NOT JUST FOR TV
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and fathers could become a critical swing vote if Al
Gore can't close what might be called a ``parent gap'' between
himself and George W. Bush. Interviewed by The Associated Press at
shopping centers, schoolyards and diners across the Midwest and
into New Jersey, parents have been saying that Clinton
administration scandals have dimmed their view of Gore. Many
parents said promises by Bush to improve schools and the
environment have made it easier for them to reject Gore _ at least
for now. One typical example: Phoebe Cairo, a 40-year-old single
mother in suburban Cleveland who normally votes Democratic, said
there is a ``strong possibility'' she'll back Bush.
</P>
<P>
   PRODDING TO TAKE A STAND
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton asserted that Rudy Giuliani was avoiding
discussion of how he would vote in the Senate, and said it is not
enough to ask voters to judge him based solely on his record as
mayor of New York, as Giuliani has suggested. ``I am running a
campaign that will tell you what I will do,'' Clinton said in a
hall packed with municipal workers in Albany. Giuliani has
discussed these issues, but only in a limited way and only in
response to questions. He has yet to give a major policy speech in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   GRAMS AGAINST THE LAWYERS
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Sen. Rod Grams, a Republican facing a tough
re-election battle, also has had to contend with tough TV
advertising. Issue ads sponsored in part by the Association of
Trial Lawyers of America attacked Grams for supporting legislation
that would make it harder for victims of asbestos-related illnesses
to sue asbestos companies. Grams accused the lawyers of attempted
blackmail and bribery, saying a lobbyist left a taped telephone
message suggesting the ads wouldn't run if Grams dropped his
sponsorship of the bill. Grams' office says the Justice Department
will investigate. The lawyers' group dismissed Grams' charge as
``not only absurd, but libelous on its face.''

HEARING IMPLANT WITH A GENTLE TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By DANIEL SORID   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A novel variation of an implantable device that has brought
hearing to tens of thousands of deaf people could soon make speech
more understandable for people who are hard of hearing, who
sometimes get little help from today's hearing aids.
</P>
<P>
   The new device, a type of cochlear implant, goes beyond the
basic sound amplification achieved through traditional hearing aids
to help people with partial hearing loss, and it seems to work
while protecting the patient's natural hearing. But its value has
yet to be proved because at this stage of the research, it has been
used by only a few people.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who lose their hearing _ often from aging, disease
or overexposure to noise _ first lose the ability to hear
high-frequency sounds, like the sound of the consonants ``s'' and
``d.'' That can make understanding conversation almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The broad amplification of analog hearing aids serves little
purpose for patients who have trouble hearing high-frequency
sounds, although many of them may be helped by digital hearing aids
that amplify only the high-frequency sounds. And people with
partial hearing loss who have standard cochlear implants can find
that their remaining natural hearing is endangered.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at the University of Iowa are experimenting with
a cochlear device that may be able to restore only high-frequency
sounds without destroying the patient's ability to hear other
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   In normal hearing, sound is processed in the cochlea, a tube
that is curled in a spiral like a nautilus shell and contains the
organs of hearing. Sound wave vibrations are conducted to the
cochlea, where they lead to movements of the fluid, hair cells and
membranes inside. Then hair cells send nerve signals to the brain.
Hair cells in deeper areas of the cochlea respond to low-frequency
sounds, while cells in the area closer to the opening process
high-frequency sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most cochlear implants include an electrode array that occupies
most of the cochlea's spiral and, behind the ear, a microphone. A
box where the signals are processed is worn on a belt or behind the
ear. The device designed at the University of Iowa uses a shorter
array of electrodes that occupies only part of the cochlea and is
intended to augment only the areas that are involved in processing
high-frequency sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Iowa device is designed to restore
high-frequency hearing without destroying the natural hearing
ability. The shorter electrode array does not need to be threaded
through the entire cochlea, which minimizes damage.
</P>
<P>
   When a longer electrode array is inserted in a regular implant,
that can injure delicate membranes, destroying the ear's ability to
process sounds naturally. And the shorter electrode component also
reduces the risk that the array will push against parts of the
cochlea that need to vibrate freely to work.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Iowa device was designed by Dr. Bruce Gantz,
head of the university's department of otolaryngology. In three
implants completed as part of a feasibility study, he said, the
natural hearing of low-frequency sounds was maintained while the
patients' ability to recognize consonants was improved.
</P>
<P>
   After the implant, one patient reported hearing someone say
``sh,'' Gantz recalled. ``This person said, `I haven't heard that
for years,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if we'll be able to integrate that into helping
them understand words,'' Gantz said. ``If it will, it would be a
major advancement for people with moderate to severe hearing loss
that have very poor word understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people that have progressive hearing loss from
aging or noise exposure always start with high-frequency loss. We
say that there are 28 million people that have hearing loss in this
country. That means there's a whole host of people that have
high-range hearing loss that causes communication problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who are most likely to develop high-frequency hearing
loss include farmers, factory workers and musicians, who are all
exposed to loud noises. That kind of hearing problem can also be
caused by illnesses and often affects the aging.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of which patients can benefit from cochlear
implants is expanding as the Cochlear Corp., which built the
short-electrode-array implants for the University of Iowa, and the
several other developers of cochlear implants make more innovative
and efficient cochlear devices, even though cochlear implants with
standard electrode arrays put a patient's natural hearing at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criteria for implantation have been relaxed,'' said Dr.
Chris van den Honert, director of research at the Cochlear Corp. in
Englewood, Colo., part of Cochlear Ltd., based in Australia. ``It's
really an acknowledgment of a trend in the entire industry toward
implantation of people with less and less hearing loss. Ten or 15
years ago, someone had to be completely deaf to qualify as a
candidate for a cochlear implant.''
</P>
<P>
   The short-electrode-array implant is a good thing, said Dr. Peg
Williams, executive director of the Cochlear Implant Association, a
nonprofit group for implant recipients, their families and
researchers. ``It stands to help a whole new generation of people
that have not had help before by the use of cochlear implants,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Research on the device is still preliminary; even if the device
continues to show promise, clinical trials will probably not begin
for another year or two. But one sign of hope is that the brain
seems able to handle auditory stimulation from both natural and
artificial processes in interpreting speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought it would be difficult for the brain to
integrate acoustic and electrical processing because electrical
processing is much more rapid to the nerve,'' Gantz said. ``These
people don't seem to have a problem with that. There doesn't seem
to be any delay.''

NEW GAME IN TOWN: DATABASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The national pastime has fallen prey to the national obsession _
technology. While the game itself is relatively unchanged since the
19th century, computers have changed nearly everything else about
baseball. And teams from the majors to the minors are going digital
to lure fans to technically sophisticated new ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are most apparent at the three new major-league
parks that have opened in the past week: Enron Field in Houston
(Astros), Comerica Park in Detroit (Tigers) and Pacific Bell Park
in San Francisco (Giants). These parks are designed to evoke the
cozy feeling of old-time stadiums, with lots of brick and exposed
steel beams. But inside, the stadiums practically hum with
technology. Fiber optic networks handle torrents of data flowing
from voice and data links, concession stands, scoreboards, security
cameras, sound systems, interactive kiosks and video production
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Many clubs now have information managers, and the teams are
collecting so much data about fans _ not to mention players _ that
the game is almost becoming a new sport, databaseball. From various
places in the new ballparks, a fan can call up statistics on a
player, a player can call up video archives of an opponent, and the
owner can call up statistics on the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Even older parks are swinging for the fences with technology,
preparing giant LED (light-emitting diodes) video scoreboards for
the arrival of high-definition television, wiring suites and
premium seats for Internet access and offering Internet-based
services to fans.
</P>
<P>
   These new technologies add millions of dollars to the cost of
the stadiums. But the technologies are also designed to squeeze
more money out of fans and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   All the major-league teams have Web sites where fans can check
the schedule, order tickets, buy team merchandise, listen to the
game over Internet radio, chat with other fans, get the latest team
news and information, subscribe to electronic mailing lists,
download pictures of their favorite players and even get a job (the
New York Yankees are looking for a stadium watchman).
</P>
<P>
   Internet access is a standard feature in the luxury suites that
are now built into every new stadium. And many baseball parks are
also considering adding Internet-access kiosks throughout the
stadium for fans in the cheaper sections.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next few years, with the Internet becoming an integral
part of fans' lives, Internet and e-mail access will be seen as a
necessity rather than as a luxury at sports stadiums,'' said
Matthew Freedman, editor of Team Marketing Report.
</P>
<P>
   SMART SEATS
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla., the domed stadium that
is the home of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, may take the prize for
electronic distractions. Mounted on swivel arms on the expensive
seats behind home plate are liquid crystal displays that deliver an
interactive software service called ChoiceSeat.
</P>
<P>
   The service lets fans call up photos, scouting reports and
statistics for any player; to see a graphical representation of the
position, type and speed of every pitch; to view replays from
different camera angles; to follow scores of other games; and even
to watch the regular live TV broadcast of the game in front of them
_ just like at home.
</P>
<P>
   If they choose, fans in the smart seats can shop for official
team merchandise, vote for All-Star selections and play a trivia
game or bingo. Of all the services available, including statistics
and game scores, bingo is the most popular, a team spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   (Technology and baseball do not always mix at Tropicana. Last
year a radio-controlled video blimp went haywire on its maiden
flight and nearly crashed into the pitcher's mound.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, there are no smart seats at the three new
ballparks. The Giants held focus groups and polled their fans, many
of whom work for Silicon Valley high-tech companies, and the fans
balked at smart seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said part of the reason they come to the park is to
concentrate on the game and leave the computer at the office,''
said Sandy Eeds, vice president and project manager for HOK Sports
of Kansas City, Mo., which designed all three parks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other teams building new stadiums, the Giants chose not
to wire the seats. ``Why invest in conduit when we can go wireless
later?'' Eeds said. With Pacific Bell as a sponsor, wireless data
access may be in the ballpark's future. Concession workers who send
hot dog and beer orders from the premium seats to the concession
stands already use it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FAN LOYALTY PROGRAMS
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of baseball stadiums now have database-driven fan loyalty
programs that reward frequent ballpark visitors for attending games
and buying refreshments and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   They work like this: Fans sign up for the team's program either
on the Internet or at any of the interactive kiosks at the ballpark
and receive a plastic identification card that has a magnetic
stripe capable of storing information. Fans accrue points by
swiping the card at a kiosk each time they attend a game or buy a
hot dog. The points can be redeemed for items like free or
discounted game tickets or team jackets. At certain thresholds, the
points earn the fan the opportunity to attend autograph sessions
with the players, do a half inning of play-by-play announcing on
the radio broadcast of the game and even play catch or take batting
practice with the team before the game. The rewards tend to be more
extravagant at minor-league ballparks, which traditionally are more
aggressive in their promotions. AIM Technologies of Austin, Texas,
created the FanCard loyalty kiosks used by more than 40
professional baseball teams.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The use of fan-loyalty cards, the Internet and bar-coded tickets
allows team owners to know more about the fans than ever before.
And it is not just what games the fans attend, when and where they
arrive at the stadium and how many hot dogs they buy. Web sites
connect the teams to the fans in ways never possible before. As a
condition for gaining FanCard points and receiving discount coupons
at the stadium, the fans have to answer questions on a touch-screen
display, including questions that the team will use to plan things
like future promotions, concession sales and staffing.
</P>
<P>
   TICKET TURNSTILES
</P>
<P>
   At Pacific Bell Park, the technology begins at the gate, where
electronic turnstiles include bar code readers. Each ticket is
printed with a unique bar code stripe that not only helps to
control counterfeit tickets (Giants tickets are in such high demand
that all but a few of the 81 home games are already sold out) but
also sends valuable information to a central attendance server
computer.
</P>
<P>
   By tracking the bar codes as the turnstiles read them, the club
gets precise, instant counts on attendance and traffic patterns,
which in turn enables the redeployment of ushers, concession
workers, kegs of beer and even extra mobile turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   Lost or stolen tickets can be ``turned off,'' or invalidated, by
the computer, and new tickets can be issued.
</P>
<P>
   By midseason, said Bill Schlough, a Giants vice president and
chief information officer, the club hopes to be able to allow
season-ticket holders who cannot attend a game to call or e-mail
the box office, turn off their tickets and let the club resell the
seats (splitting the money, no doubt). Doing so will not be as
lucrative for the ticket holder as scalping the tickets outside the
stadium or selling them on eBay, but it will certainly be more
convenient.
</P>
<P>
   If a season-ticket holder misses several games, the club can get
in touch with that person to find out why, all in the interest of
providing improved customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are talking with Ticketmaster and other high-tech
companies about a plan to enable fans to buy tickets over the
Internet and print their tickets on a home printer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate vision is that you shouldn't need to have a
ticket at all,'' Schlough said. ``The technology is moving to a
stored-value card.'' A stored-value card, he explained, could be
encoded with the digital equivalents of game tickets and cash. It
would be swiped at the turnstile, at a concession stand or at a
souvenir stand.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCOREBOARDS
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has come a long way from the mechanical scoreboards
still being used at Chicago's historic Wrigley Field, home of the
Cubs (and, in a nice touch of tradition, at Pacific Bell). Modern
video scoreboards are huge. The one at Comerica in Detroit is 204
feet wide, the same size as a 10-story building across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Older video displays were made up of collections of cathode ray
tubes, like regular television sets. The newer ones have switched
to light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, which yield better-quality
video, use less electricity and last longer.
</P>
<P>
   The giant video screen in Houston will be capable of receiving
high-definition television signals when that emerging technology is
ready, said Ron Baker, senior associate at Wrightson Johnson Haddon
Williams, a Dallas design company. In Detroit, the scoreboards are
controlled from a video production room where more than a dozen
technicians work during the game.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboards are also revenue machines. Using a variety of
recent technologies that allow advertisements to be cycled
throughout the game, an electronic billboard can have more than a
dozen sponsors. In Detroit, the $10 million scoreboard system has
the potential to generate $2 million a year in advertising revenue,
said Michael Delano, the team owner's representative.
</P>
<P>
   SOUND SYSTEMS
</P>
<P>
   Most stadiums have replaced their old, echo-producing speakers
with modern sound systems. At Enron Field in Houston, more than 400
speakers are distributed throughout the stadium, backed by more
than 100 power amplifiers that can make between-innings music
really rock.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the speakers closer to the fans has made announcements
clearer, and the sound is synchronized with the scoreboard video
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stadium sound systems are as good as the stereo
systems in the fans' homes,'' said Robert D. Wyatt, a vice
president of the Barton Malow Co., which helped develop parks
including Enron Field, Camden Yards in Baltimore and Coors Field in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Enron has radio headsets that amplify sound for hearing-impaired
fans and a full-time stenographer to transcribe announcements for a
closed-caption display system. During breaks in the action, the
same board can be used to display scrolling stock quotes (a feature
appreciated by the millionaire players as well as the fans, no
doubt). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEYOND BASEBALL
</P>
<P>
   Fans are not the only ones enjoying the technology. At the park
in San Francisco, bouquets of satellite dishes pull down video
feeds from other games and store videos of opponents in a 750-disc
DVD jukebox. Remote-control video cameras record every pitch and
at-bat from multiple angles, to help players dissect and refine
their games. Computer-based simulators and exercise equipment keep
players in top shape. Some managers say that technology alone could
add a few extra victories per season.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be good for the fans _ the ones that pay
attention to the game, that is. In Houston, young fans can
entertain themselves playing Sega video games or watching a genuine
steam locomotive that appears to pull the retractable roof open and
shut. Boys of a more distant summer can try the video batting cages
or clock their fastballs with a radar gun. Detroit has a Ferris
wheel, a carousel and ``liquid fireworks'' _ a computer-controlled
water fountain that sends choreographed jets of colored water 120
feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay for all of that technology, clubs are raising ticket
prices sharply this year. In Detroit, a family of four can expect
to pay about $165 for an afternoon at the ballpark (four
average-price tickets, four small sodas, two beers, four hot dogs,
two programs and two caps _ carousel rides and Internet access not
included) .
</P>
<P>
   No wonder most parks have added cash machines, too.

GORE SAYS CLINTON HAS RULED OUT ANY PARDON FOR HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday that
President Clinton will not pardon himself for any possible crimes
committed in office or accept a pardon from his successor.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question at an appearance before the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, Gore said that Clinton had made his
views on the matter clear during the impeachment investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is way ahead of you on this,'' Gore said.
``He said publicly some time ago that he would neither request nor
accept a pardon, so that's the answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   The question arose following recent statements by Robert Ray,
the independent counsel, that he had hired additional prosecutors
and was actively considering whether to indict Clinton after he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray replaced Kenneth Starr as the investigator for matters
relating to Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky last October.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's remark Wednesday morning, Clinton has never
publicly addressed the question of a pardon. According to the White
House, the issue was raised during the House Judiciary Committee's
impeachment hearings hearings in December 1998. Charles Ruff, the
White House counsel, was asked by Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, if he
could assure the committee that Clinton would not pardon himself or
accept a pardon from a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Ruff replied.
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate among legal scholars over whether a
president can pardon himself. Some say that he cannot, on the
principle that a judge cannot preside over his own trial. Others
say that the pardon power in the Constitution is absolute and
extends to a president granting himself a pardon in advance of any
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   But mindful of the political firestorm that followed President
Gerald Ford's pardon of President Richard Nixon after Nixon's
resignation _ and Ford's defeat at the polls two years later _
politicians and legal scholars agree that it was unlikely Gore
would risk such a move to protect Clinton from any legal jeopardy.

THE LIZARD STRIKES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Netscape is back. It never really went away, of course. But more
than a year has passed _ at least a generation in Internet time _
since Netscape, the weakened Internet software company, was
acquired by America Online, leading to an exodus of top executives
and programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Now Netscape has released a preview version of its
next-generation browser software, Netscape 6.0. The final version
is not expected for about six months, but this first trial version,
which is available free for Windows, Macintosh and Linux-based
computers at www.netscape.com, at least indicates that Microsoft's
market-leading browser software, Internet Explorer, still has a
formidable rival.
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance that Netscape can recapture the desktop
browser market from Microsoft, given that Internet Explorer is very
good, is free and comes with almost every new PC. But Netscape and
AOL are betting that the future of computing resides on the Web,
not the desktop, and they have made the new browser so that it can
run on everything from cell phones to small Internet appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Version 6.0 is spunky, and it streamlines the display of Web
pages, which is what browsers are supposed to do. It was rebuilt
from the ground up using an open-source Web-page rendering engine
called Gecko _ named after a small, fast lizard _ and it is much
more nimble than its immediate predecessor, Netscape 4.7. (Netscape
had to skip Version 5.0 and go directly to 6.0 because Microsoft is
getting ready to release Internet Explorer 5.5, and Netscape wanted
to seize the high ground, numerically speaking.)
</P>
<P>
   Version 6.0 also has several novel and handy features, some of
which will appeal to America Online users. It handles multiple
e-mail accounts in one area of the screen, including AOL mail, and
it works with AOL's popular Instant Messaging services.
</P>
<P>
   It has a clever system of file tabs that keep current news and
information, not just links to current news and information, at
your fingertips. More on the new features in a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is prerelease software, which means that there
are lots of known bugs in the code. The test version I've been
using behaved pretty well most of the time, but there were
occasional flurries of ``blue screen of death'' Windows errors that
were probably a result of shaky code.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this preview version is for thrill seekers only,
and it is not a browser you want to rely on for the long term, at
least not until the final version is released next fall. If
crashing computers give you the fantods, wait for a version that
does not have a zero in it.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several interesting and entertaining new features will not
be added until the next preview release, like the ability to change
the look of the browser through the use of custom software
``skins.''
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, Preview Version 1 is a cheap, easy and relatively fast
to download, and after months of antitrust testimony and court
rulings that detailed the company's battles with Microsoft, it is
nice to see the Netscape banner still flying.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of a Faustian bargain made before AOL acquired
Netscape, however, AOL is still contractually obligated to bundle
Internet Explorer with its popular online software, now used by
more than 22 million people. It must be agony for Netscape and AOL
folks, especially now that the courts are on the verge of deciding
whether to make Microsoft unbundle Internet Explorer from Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious new feature in Version 6.0 is the addition of a
customizable stack of virtual file folders, called My Sidebar, on
the left side of the screen. It is basically a mini-browser inside
the main browser. Each folder can contain Web content, not just
links to Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   So one can click on the tab of the stocks folder and see current
stock quotes, or click on the news tab and see current headlines,
while the main browser window is displaying something else.
Netscape says hundreds of custom tabs are being created for things
like auctions, calendars, music files and news.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, Netscape 6.0 has some tricks that take
specific advantage of popular AOL features like instant messages
and buddy lists. If you are writing an e-mail message to your buddy
Waldo, and Waldo is logged on at the same time, a tiny icon appears
on screen. Clicking on the icon opens an instant chat session,
which can be a useful alternative to successive volleys of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Many people use one program to handle e-mail and another to
handle Web browsing. Netscape lets the user collect mail from
multiple e-mail accounts, including AOL mail, and display it in one
combined in-box. Some people prefer to keep business and personal
e-mail accounts separate, and they can do that with the new
browser, too.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has improved the search functions of the browser, in
part by adopting the Google search engine (my favorite) and in part
by integrating a search function into the main toolbar where one
would usually just type Web addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Another welcome feature is better management of Internet
cookies, the small programs that many Web sites insert into your
computer to track your activities. With Netscape 6.0, the user can
easily delete unwanted cookies and decide whether to accept new
cookies from each site.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most clever tricks of the new browser is the
AutoTranslate command, which, as the name suggests, automatically
translates the text on Web sites to and from English, which is
handy as the Internet spreads internationally.
</P>
<P>
   The AutoTranslate feature does back-and-forth translation for
English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Portuguese.
It does not always work well, but it works well enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand scheme of things, Netscape 6.0 is probably more
significant for the way it is being made, rather than for its
features. It is a creature of the open-source software movement, a
collaboration of hundreds of independent programmers around the
world. Other examples of open-source software include Linux, which
has emerged as the most viable challenger to Microsoft's Windows
operating system for corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying Gecko engine of Netscape 6.0 was designed to work
on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Linux and
Apple's Mac OS, and on a variety of different devices, like desktop
PCs, televisions (think AOL TV), Internet appliances (like the ones
Gateway is developing with AOL), handheld appliances and phones
(think AOL Anywhere). It is a crucial part of AOL's plan for total
world domination.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft has finally released Version 5.0 of
Internet Explorer for the Macintosh, a year after the Windows
version was released. It was worth the wait. The new rendering
engine is much faster than earlier versions (Microsoft's is called
Tasman, as against Netscape's Gecko). It has improved search
features and an Internet Scrapbook feature that allows users to
store not just links to pages, but the pages themselves. There is
also an Auction Manager that automatically informs you if you have
been outbid on an item on eBay, Amazon or Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   It is nice to see that the browser programmers have stayed just
as busy as the lawyers.

   DRAFT-RISKYPICKS _ During the NFL annual meeting last month in

of how to combat the off-the-field problems. At one point, Denver's
Pat Bowlen stood up and gave his recommendation. ``We've got to
stop taking these guys,'' he said. Will Bowlen's peers listen to
him? There is a long list of college football players who were
arrested during the past year and charged with an assortment of
offenses. NFL teams, if they are serious in their attempt to weed
out potential problem players, must decide how heavily to weigh
each incident. And many observers believe when the teams are faced
with the moment of decision _ the clock ticking as NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue stands at the podium, ready to announce their pick
on-the-field potential will count for more than potential
off-the-field problems. (Woods, Palm Beach Post). WITH CHART of

   DRAFT-RISKYPICKS _ During the NFL annual meeting last month in
Palm Beach, the owners and head coaches held a two-hour discussion
of how to combat the off-the-field problems. At one point, Denver's
Pat Bowlen stood up and gave his recommendation. ``We've got to
stop taking these guys,'' he said. Will Bowlen's peers listen to
him? There is a long list of college football players who were
arrested during the past year and charged with an assortment of
offenses. NFL teams, if they are serious in their attempt to weed
out potential problem players, must decide how heavily to weigh
each incident. And many observers believe when the teams are faced
with the moment of decision _ the clock ticking as NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue stands at the podium, ready to announce their pick
on-the-field potential will count for more than potential
off-the-field problems. (Woods, Palm Beach Post). WITH CHART of

UNION SUPPORTERS RALLY AT CAPITOL AGAINST NORMAL TRADE WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This story will be updated as needed)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Worried that doing business with China will crowd
American workers out of the global economy, thousands of union men
and women flocked to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to condemn the idea
of normal trade relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give China a blank check'' was one of the more popular
slogans of the day, appearing on many signs carried by
steelworkers, auto workers, government employees, teachers and
others who congregated on a sunny but brisk day.
</P>
<P>
   Full-trade status with China would allow that country's goods to
come into the United States as do goods from many other countries:
without high tariffs. In return, China would be obliged to open its
markets to a multitude of American goods.
</P>
<P>
   But as he rallied his troops, Teamsters president James Hoffa
sneered at the notion that China can be trusted. ``Let's keep China
on probation,'' he said. ``They've got blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, was scheduled to
speak, as was George Becker, the president of the United
Steelworkers, a union that has lost a lot of its muscle in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The union leaders and their followers hoped to pressure the very
lawmakers who do the people's business in the sprawling complex
behind them. Two Democratic members of Congress were to speak:
Reps. David Bonior of Michigan and Nancy Pelosi of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free traders are traitors,'' one sign read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell no WTO,'' read a T-shirt, a reference to the World Trade
Organization, whose meeting in Seattle last year spawned violent
protests. China's entry into the WTO is vehemently opposed by the
people who protested at the Capitol on Wednesday. The International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, two other symbols of the
worldwide economy, have also been the targets of protests in
Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol on Wednesday, the union sympathizers were
cheerful and smiling, photographing one another like ordinary
tourists, using the gleaming Capitol dome and the Washington
Monument as backdrops. Capitol police officers chatted affably with
the protesters and had to use their authority only to shoo
jaywalkers back to safety or chase picture-takers off perilous
perches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to help their exercise their First Amendment
rights,'' one sergeant said without sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   Those rights were invoked Wednesday by union leaders and members
of the rank-and-file who fear that normalizing trade relations with
China, as the Clinton administration would like to do, would cost
the United States jobs and self-respect. Among other things, the
demonstrators said, the Chinese would flood U.S. markets with cheap
goods turned out by prison laborers and exploited workers toiling
for next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Rally organizers had hoped for a crowd of 15,000. It was
difficult to get a good estimate on the vast Capitol grounds as
people came and went, chanting union slogans, but there were enough
people to fill a stadium, albeit a small one.
</P>
<P>
   For all the anger and anxiety vented Wednesday, anyone with a
sense of history could find reasons to take heart. The unions'
cause drew men and women, young and old, workers of light skin and
dark skin _ in other words, people not always united beneath the
same banner in years past.
</P>
<P>
   But there was poignancy as well in the chill air, as personified
by Mike Orange, a steelworker from Grove City, Pa. A trustee of his
union local, Orange has been making and shaping steel for 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his working days are winding down, and maybe it's just as
well, he said. The plant where he's worked all these years is a lot
quieter than it was in the old days, thanks to spin-offs and
downsizing and other features of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started there, it had about 2,400 workers,'' he
reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   And now? ``About 25.''

 &HT;    McCAIN DELAYS BILL ON INTERNET TAXES
 &HT;    550&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yielding to pressure from state officials and
traditional retailers, Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John
McCain, R-Ariz., Wednesday postponed a vote on his bill to extend
the federal moratorium on new Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advocates of increasing the tax burden on the public have
prevailed in having (the bill) removed'' from the committee's
agenda, McCain said. He promised to renew his fight later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's debate among committee members showed just how
tough that battle may be, as several fellow Republicans argued in
favor of allowing states to require online retailers to collect
taxes, just as traditional retailers do now.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas took an especially hard line,
warning that unless states continue to get large flows of revenue
from sales taxes, they will look to income taxes to fund schools,
police and other basic services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spilled some blood in my state to avoid having a state
income tax,'' she said. If consumers are allowed to avoid paying
sales taxes by shopping on line, ``I can see a drumbeat beginning
for a state income tax, which I am going to fight to the death,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on Internet sales taxes not only could harm states, but
would also undermine traditional merchants who collect and remit
sales taxes, she argued. ``A retailer paying taxes that support the
community should not have an unfair competitive disadvantage,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, McCain wanted Congress to permanently bar states
from requiring Internet-based retailers to collect taxes on
purchases, regardless of whether customers lived out of state. But
in recent months, he has faced stiffening opposition from state
leaders and traditional retailers who want their online and
mail-order counterparts to bear an equal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has backed off from a permanent ban,
pushing instead for a five-year extension of a tax moratorium now
set to expire in October 2001. Until recently, such an extension
seemed likely to speed through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Leavitt, the Republican governor of Utah and
chairman of the National Governors' Association, has coordinated a
campaign to get state, county and city officials to oppose a
lengthy moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the Commerce Committee on Wednesday, Leavitt
submitted a letter signed by 36 governors calling on Congress to
refrain from prohibiting states from imposing tax collection duties
on online companies, saying that would be unfair to Main Street
merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would put the federal government in the position of both
picking winners and losers,'' the governors said in their letter.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt's efforts have been bolstered by the lobbying muscle of
many traditional retailers, such as Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. and J.C.
Penney Inc.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, argued that ``if each state and local
jurisdiction attempts to impose its own business regulations and
taxes to it, the opportunities presented by this new economic
engine (the Internet) will be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt agreed the current patchwork of sales taxes ``is a
mess,'' but said states should be given a year or two to radically
simplify their tax rates and rules.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While McCain's committee was meeting, the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce was formally presenting its report to the
Republican leaders of Congress. Gov. James Gilmore, the Republican
governor of Virginia and the panel's chairman, handed over his
report to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker
Dennis Hastert on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was charged by Congress with making
recommendations on Internet sales tax policy. When it failed to
reach the prescribed two-thirds votes to make a recommendation,
Lott told Gilmore he would accept a ``report'' based on a simple
majority.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 11-8, the panel approved a plan to extend the tax
moratorium until 2006, repeal a 3 percent telecommunications excise
tax and provide tax exemptions for certain Internet-based
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, the leader of the majority voting bloc, said sales
taxes on online purchases are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states and localities are awash with cash,'' he said.
``There is more money that is being raised in terms of revenue in
taxation, more money that is being spent than has ever been before
in the history of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert praised the report and said he hopes to move bills
implementing its provisions ``early this year.''

CONFESSIONS OF AN ONLINE APPLESAUCE THIEF
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  NEW YORK _ I had been cheating Priceline's online grocery service
for months, and worse, no one seemed to care.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, it was just applesauce. A few months ago, with all but
one item on my list already in my shopping cart (along with my
2-year-old), I still needed applesauce. To get my prearranged
discount from Priceline, I had agreed to buy Musselman's. I scanned
the shelves. No Musselman's.
</P>
<P>
   As a Priceline veteran, I knew the rules: no Musselman's, no
discount. But instead I reached out, fingered the labels on the
applesauce, took a jar of Mott's and, coupon in hand, made my way
to the checkout register.
</P>
<P>
   I will not try to make excuses. It does not matter, for
instance, that I was planning to make potato pancakes for supper
and desperately needed that applesauce or that my daughter was
biting into an apple that had not yet been paid for and yelling,
``Get-me-Tic-Tacs-now-now-now,'' at a volume more typically heard
at a rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   My heart was pounding as I checked out. No one stopped me or
seemed to notice the difference. But I knew my violation struck at
the very heart of Priceline's business model, which is to pit
competitive manufacturers against each other by giving discounts to
shoppers who don't care what brand they buy. And I knew switching
brands meant that Musselman's was giving me a discount for buying
Mott's.
</P>
<P>
   I became a repeat offender a short time later when I took an
unauthorized can of Bumblebee tuna instead of the Starkist that I
had promised to buy. Then I substituted Glad sandwich bags for
Ziploc. Ruffles instead of Tostitos.
</P>
<P>
   The more I did it, the more guilty I felt. Then one night last
week, after consuming a large number of Ruffles, I found myself
unable to sleep. Was it guilt or the grease from the chips? I
cannot say. I only knew, the next morning, that I needed
absolution. So I phoned Kevin Goldman, a spokesman for
Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, he told me that Priceline was aware of my
behavior. The company keeps transaction logs to track the items
shoppers take home. After checking the logs for my purchases,
Goldman pointed out that I had failed to mention the time I took
Progresso soup after promising to buy Campbell's. (I had forgotten
that one.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't care?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do care,'' he said. ``At this time, it's not worth our
resources to spend the time to have the computer system go back and
flag every single person who takes the wrong soup and send them
e-mail about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is hard to know exactly whom I am cheating.
Priceline's discounts are subsidized in three ways: by
manufacturers, of course, but also by sponsors who offer half-price
tokens to shoppers who fill out marketing surveys and by Priceline
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline has not disclosed exactly how much of the money it is
spending to attract customers. But Goldman said the company hoped
to recoup much of the cost after it started to charge the
advertised $3 monthly service fee (which is being waived for now).
</P>
<P>
   Then Goldman asked me to please not do it again: ``Ninety-nine
percent of consumers obey our rules.'' He paused. ``You know,
Michelle, most people are honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, I needed help. So I phoned some medical professionals,
the sort of people who specialize in analyzing the behavior of
(let's not mince words) liars, sneaks and cheats.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing I learned was that my behavior is not as deviant
as I had feared. ``Many people are clearly and easily willing to
act out some minor kind of deception when the risk of getting
caught is not large,'' said David Nyberg, a professor of education
and medicine at the State University of New York at Buffalo and the
author of ``The Varnished Truth: Truth Telling and Deceiving in
Ordinary Life'' (University of Chicago Press, 1993). ``One-third to
one-half of all Americans in all subcategories admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   But I wouldn't cheat a live merchant. Why would I cheat
Priceline?
</P>
<P>
   ``The anonymity makes it easier to cheat,'' said Charles Ford, a
professor of psychiatry at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
and the author of ``Lies! Lies!! Lies!!!: The Psychology of
Deceit'' (American Psychiatric Press, 1996). ``When you cheat
Priceline, who are you cheating? The degree to which people will
tell the truth is to a large extent determined by the personal bond
they have to the individual they are dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, apparently, was that I clearly resented
Priceline and that I was acting out in the supermarket. But why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they make you feel cheap?'' Dr. Ford asked gently.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he mentioned it, I did resent that I had to draw
attention to myself by separating my Priceline purchases, slowing
the checkout line. And come to think of it, I had a few quibbles
with how arbitrary the service seemed. Some days, for example, it
would grant me discounts on peanut butter and jelly, but the next
time I would get only the jelly.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thinking led me to wonder if I could beat the
system. I phoned Goldman again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot beat the system,'' he said. (I think he was getting
a little sick of me.) ``When you say you want to buy an item, there
are these companies who make brands who want your business, and the
question is how much business do they want at this price at that
moment in time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One more thing,'' I said meekly. ``You know what makes me
angry? The way my ability to buy certain products, like fruits and
vegetables, is restricted. I can only buy those things on Priceline
if I agree to use half-price tokens, but I don't want to fill out
the surveys it takes to get the tokens.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said many distributors of produce did not compete by
brand so there were no manufacturers to give me discounts. ``But
you still want the apples, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   He knew I did. He had, after all, pulled my transaction logs and
knew that my family ate 10 or more apples a week. He probably even
knew that my daughter bit into at least one of those apples before
it was paid for.
</P>
<P>
   But what he might not have known (or was too polite to mention)
was that I also had misused Priceline tokens. A few weeks ago, I
had a token to buy Valencia oranges for 15 cents apiece. But
instead of taking the Valencia oranges, I picked up five of the
more luscious _ and, at 99 cents each, more expensive _ blood
oranges. The cashier didn't bat an eye.
</P>
<P>
   There, I feel much better. This confession stuff really works.

SOME ARE `MISSING' ONLY ONLINE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-month-old Krystava Schmidt was reunited with her
frightened mother, Christine Schmidt, on July 13, 1998, two days
after she disappeared from the family home in the Minneapolis
suburb of Mounds View. Police officers quickly located and arrested
the housemate who had driven Krystava to an unsuspecting relative's
house in nearby Mora, Minn., after squabbling with Schmidt's
brother.
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, however, Krystava is still missing. Numerous
sites on the World Wide Web feature the child's picture and the
plea published by her mother the day she disappeared that any
information about her be relayed to the Mounds View police. And
chain e-mail messages continue to slosh around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is serious,'' say the messages, which typically have 50
recipients or more. ``Please look at the picture at the bottom and
pass it on to as many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Mounds View police, this clash between
history and virtual reality shows no sign of ending. ``We're
getting 100 calls a week,'' said William A. Clark, the town's
police chief. ``In a resurgence this week, we also learned that
someone had e-mailed the plea to every police department in New
Jersey after adding information that the car had been seen there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the department often gets 30 or more e-mail messages
a week. ``They often are sent around midnight and tell us they will
forward the plea unless they get an immediate response saying it's
not true,'' he said. ``By the time we get in and see them, it's too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the inquiries, which come from as far away as China,
are costing his small force $96 a month in payments to the county
for extra phone services.
</P>
<P>
   Krystava's case is the most virulent dandelion in the Internet's
missing person's landscape, but there are others. The Marion County
sheriff's office in Ocala, Fla., continues to get calls almost
daily about Aaron Steinmetz, a toddler abducted from a family
wedding by his father in December 1998 and returned to his mother
two months later.
</P>
<P>
   Outdated missing persons reports are, of course, just one
example of the difficulty of controlling the spread of
misinformation on the Internet. But even the people burdened by
them are reluctant to criticize those passing them on too harshly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good sign that citizens are concerned,'' said James
Pogue, a Marion County sheriff's spokesman. Any such reports can be
checked with the local police or the National Center for Missing
and Exploited Kids (www.missingkids.com or (800) THELOST).
</P>
<P>
   Does Schmidt have any regrets about the long life of her
gripping plea? ``She's moved away, and we don't know where,'' Clark
said. Thankfully for his department, there is a big difference
between gone and missing.

 &HT;    HOUSE REPUBLICANS PROPOSE MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans offered their own version of a
Medicare drug plan Wednesday that relies on private insurance with
federal subsidies for the poor. The Clinton administration said the
plan doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP proposal is an alternative to a plan Clinton put forward
during his State of the Union message in January and heightens the
possibility a prescription drug benefit under Medicare will be
enacted this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal health program for 40 million elderly and
disabled Americans, does not cover prescription drugs, which are
covered by most major private health insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing the high stakes both sides have attached to a
prescription drug benefit, the GOP proposal was unveiled by House
Speaker Dennis Hastert along with key Republican members of the
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a balanced and responsible prescription drug plan
which permits market forces _ not regulations and price controls _
to offer Medicare beneficiaries more choices and lower drug
prices,'' said Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan, like the Clinton plan, would be open and voluntary
to all Medicare beneficiaries. It differs in two major ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Clinton plan, once it is fully implemented in 2009, would
cover half of all drug costs up to $5,000 for all beneficiaries.
The GOP plan would cover all drug costs that exceed a yet-to-be
determined amount.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the Clinton plan, prescription drugs would be covered
directly by Medicare, similar to doctor and hospital coverage.
Under the GOP proposal, the federal government would pay the
private insurance premiums of elderly patients with incomes 150
percent of less than the poverty level _ now $12,600 for an
individual and $17,000 for a couple.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan envisions that Medicare beneficiaries would pay
lower prescription drug costs because the insurance plans would be
able to make deals for reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this week by the Clinton administration
indicated that Medicare patients pay 15 percent more for drugs than
those covered by private insurers who have negotiated better
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would pump $300 billion of the projected federal
surplus over the next 10 years into the Medicare program, including
$160 billion for the drug benefit. In addition, Clinton would spend
$35 billion to offer a catastrophic drug benefit, which would cover
all costs above an undecided amount.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan would earmark $40 billion over five years
for the drug benefit and to help shore up the Medicare program,
which federal actuaries say will remain financially healthy until
2023.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton health policy adviser Chris Jennings said the
administration was ``disappointed that (the Republican plan's)
provisions don't match up with the rhetoric of how it's being
described.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said there were substantial questions about whether
insurers would offer prescription drug coverage and, if so, how
much the premiums would cost and how much of a benefit they would
provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it should be available and affordable to all. They
can't assure that anyone will have access to any benefit, let along
an affordable one,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   Horace B. Deets, executive director of AARP, the nation's
largest organization of Americans aged 50 and over, said the GOP
plan ``has merit and should be explored carefully and fully.''

`BEING DEAD': THE LIFE AFTER DEATH OF A PAIR NOT YET GONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celice and Joseph, middle-aged zoologists, revisit the desolate
beach dunes where they first made love 30 years earlier and attempt
an anniversary reprise. A drifter shadows them, bludgeons them to
death with a rock and takes off with the few possessions they'd
brought along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bodies were discovered straight away,'' the next chapter
unremarkably begins. Immediately come the whiplash words: ``A
beetle first,'' followed by this initial discoverer's struggle to
crawl out from under Celice and Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Other discoverers arrive: a gull pecking at Celice's shoes,
flies ``lined up like fishermen along the banks of the bodies' open
wounds,'' and crabs ``already laboring through their exaggerated
countrysides toward the corpses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Dead'' records the viewpoints of beetle, gull, crabs and
flies. It notes briefly the thoughts of the killer, of whom we hear
no more. Mainly it speaks of and for Celice and Joseph at the time
they met, through the years of their marriage, and on their last
day alive.
</P>
<P>
   It voices as well, weirdly, the point of view of their gradually
decomposing bodies during the six days before they are discovered
by the police. It speaks for the beach grass, the sand, the wind;
and pretty much for life, death and the universe at large.
</P>
<P>
   Restrain a natural impulse to dismiss this as mystic
pantheistics addled with goriness. Though not widely known in the
United States, Crace is one of Britain's most remarkable writers,
and has been for the past couple of decades. He is unique, as well.
Two inflated adjectives, but what they denote in tandem is that
Crace is a novelist able to precipitate large and cloudy themes
into slashes of a particular, revivifying rain.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Gift of Stones'' he brought close up the distant light
and melancholy sunset of a Stone Age people faced with the advent
of artificers in bronze. In ``Quarantine'' _ winner of Britain's
Whitbread Prize and a Booker finalist _ he wrote of a variegated
collection of desert refugees who spend 40 days as neighbors to an
annoying, seemingly hysterical young man: Jesus, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Prehistory, religion: Crace's allegories make disconcerting and
tangible fictions of impalpable realms. His humans set in
strangeness are not us; we might be them, though, if bent and made
strange.
</P>
<P>
   The realm of Crace's new novel is the strangest of all. It is
death, or more exactly, it is the life in death and the death in
life. For the former there are the flies' and crabs' assorted meals
_ for a moment we seem conjured into a sort of restaurant review _
and the minute day-by-day charting of the changes in the two bodies
on the beach. Not the bodies that were, but the bodies that still
are Celice and Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   What ought to be grisly is strangely not. Reverent, if anything,
and thanks to Crace's ability to set up human habitation in taboo
territory, almost beautiful. The Latin saying ``Nothing human is
alien to me,'' he extends to ``Nothing human is dead to me, not
even death.''
</P>
<P>
   While Crace is imparting life, even jaunty life, to dissolution
he is introducing death repeatedly into the knottily individual
lives of Celice, Joseph and those they know. Celice tells her
students that whereas single-celled organisms, dividing again and
again, are essentially immortal, ``death is the price we pay for
being multi-celled.'' She ends her slide lecture holding a
rectangle of white light on the screen and announcing: ``You're
dying now. Get used to it!''
</P>
<P>
   Crace, though, is not really after the stoic note of Thomas
Nashe's poem, ``I am sick, I must die,'' or William Dunbar's
catalog of death in ``Lament for the Makers.'' His novel,
alternating brief chapters about Celice and Joseph alive and their
dead bodies on the beach, is a series of variations that circle and
circle and ultimately hold both states in a kind of balance.
</P>
<P>
   The couple meet at a seaside cabin _ the country is never
specified but suggests, perhaps, a scruffy Australia in some near
future _ along with four other zoology students who are there for a
mix of study and carousing. Celice is gawky, but a recent seduction
has quickened her instincts: she is both sexually avid and sexy.
After casting about she fixes her sights on Joseph, quiet and
hard-working, his only flair a shiveringly powerful singing voice.
</P>
<P>
   While they are making love in the dunes, a badly placed lantern
or possibly a cigarette or maybe a stove not shut off (the weighing
of possibilities has the same peculiar ambling fascination as the
gait of the beach crabs) sets the cabin on fire, killing a student.
Love on the beach, death not far off.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later it will be the same intermingling. Love will
persist: Joseph's dying gesture is to clasp his dead wife's ankle.
Death will persist, as hand and ankle decay.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult, anyone could think, reading an account of Crace's
novels, particularly this one; and lofted at so strained an
altitude that oxygen must surely be lacking. But this overlooks the
paradoxes of his art.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he is an insidious storyteller. The encounter of
Celice and Joseph, their first lovemaking, the mix of
incompatibilities and attachments in their 30 years together, the
search reluctantly conducted by their estranged daughter _ her
repressed sorrow surges when she sees bone hand around bone ankle _
and even the progressive decay of dead flesh and organs: all these
things display an unlikely narrative springiness and zest.
</P>
<P>
   If the characters in Crace novels are ostensibly on high-flown
literary missions (dying, inhabiting prehistory, being God), their
flights swoop so near ground level, in fact, that they whip up
gravel, grass, gestures of startlement, and the smoke of human
cooking fires.

   SC-FLAG _ COLUMBIA _ So far, the battle over South Carolina's
flying the Confederate battle flag atop the Statehouse has been
fought in public rallies, newspapers and broadcasts. Wednesday, the
skirmish moves to a body that has a real say in the debate: the
state Senate. Senators will try to hammer out a compromise that
will move the Civil War emblem to a spot on the Statehouse grounds
and off the penny-colored dome. It's widely thought that state Sen.
Glenn McConnell holds the key to compromise. The Charleston
Republican, who owns a Civil War memorabilia shop, has been
steadfast in his support of the flag. Moderates, though, are
hopeful he'll be the one to offer a compromise deal that ultimately
will be sent to the state House. Another pro-flag senator said
Wednesday will be ``Armageddon'' in the already fiery debate. South
Carolina is the only state that flies the battle flag from its
Capitol dome, though Mississippi and Georgia have incorporated the
design into their state flags. Debate starts at 11 a.m. Wednesday
and could drag into the weekend if needed. (Manuel, Atlanta

   PRIVATE-PRISONS _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla., _ With a state prison

of the country's inmate population in Florida, though they do own
vacant land. Since the state has no laws on this issue, corrections
officials say that leaves the door open to private companies could
building new prisons for out-of-state inmates, tomorrow with
virtually no state regulation. ``It's ridiculous,'' said Sen. Tom
Rossin, D-West Palm Beach. ``Why do we want to bring (inmates) from
out of state into the state? We have enough of our own problems.''

&HT;     SENATE PANEL VOTES TO FREEZE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

   WASHINGTON _ A Senate panel approved an update of the Ryan White
care program Wednesday that would preserve San Francisco's $35
million annual share of federal AIDS dollars, defeating a move to
redistribute one-quarter of the city's funding to other places
where the epidemic is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Health, Labor, Education and Pensions Committee
unanimously approved a new $1.6 billion Ryan White program that
would freeze San Francisco's share of the money at within 2 percent
of the current $35.3 million for each of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan White program, begun in 1991, empowers the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services to pay for care and
medication for people with HIV and AIDS who aren't poor or sick
enough to receive Medicaid, but who don't have private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., predicted the full Senate would
approve the committee's bill, including the provision that protects
San Francisco's share of federal AIDS dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had predicted that San Francisco
would lose about $8 million in funding from the Ryan White program
unless Congress continues to provide the city with an exception to
the funding formula. Officials in Los Angeles are lobbying Congress
to end the exception, saying San Francisco is getting an unfair
share of federal AIDS dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Congress decided in 1996 to maintain funding levels for San
Francisco even as the lawmakers adopted a new funding formula that
would otherwise have cut the city's share.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Ryan White formula was no longer based on a city's
cumulative number of AIDS cases over the years and on the density
of AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Congress declared that funds should be distributed
based on the total number of people living with AIDS in the city.
Under that formula, cities like San Francisco where the disease had
spread earlier in the epidemic would have received less money.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would provide a new stream of money for rural
areas and mid-sized cities where the disease is spreading
_especially among women and minorities and would direct more money
for drug therapy and prevention. Local providers would retain
flexibility in deciding how the dollars should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   The reauthorization bill is a blueprint for how the money should
be spent. Congressional appropriations panels will determine later
how much money to actually earmark for the Ryan White program.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jim M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said the bill reflects how the
epidemic has spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a recognition that the problem of AIDS and HIV is
expanding out of urban and poor areas,'' Jeffords said. ``Now it's
widespread throughout the population. Therefore, it's important to
expand the accessibility of coverage to rural areas as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., also a member of the panel, said
she was disappointed that the new version of the legislation
eliminates a requirement to enroll a significant number of women
and children in clinical trials. The provision was dropped after
AIDS researchers at the Department of Defense and the National
Institutes of Health expressed concern that some mothers with AIDS
were being coerced to join clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still do not believe it is a wise move,'' she said. ``We do
have to reach out to women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan White program is named after the hemophiliac teenager
from Kokomo, Ind., who contracted the disease through tainted blood
and died in 1990 at age 19. The program serves about a half million
people each year and, since 1991, has distributed $6.4 billion to
states and local governments for local use.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ryan White program began in 1991, the focus was on
end-of-life care, such as paying hospital bills, providing meals on
wheels and paying for drugs like morphine and antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   When it was reauthorized in 1996, the Ryan White program was
refocused to provide new drug therapies that stall the onset of
AIDS. It also began enrolling women and children with HIV and AIDS
in clinical trials and focused on early diagnosis and treatment.

KICKING AND MOANING, THE LOUVRE GOES PRIMITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Stephane cq in 7th graf.) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Even in matters of artistic taste, it seems, French
presidents enjoy enviable power. Five years ago President Jacques
Chirac expressed the view that what was long called primitive art
should have a permanent place in the Louvre Museum. The Louvre
protested heatedly that it was not a universal museum, that
specialist collections should be housed elsewhere. On Thursday,
Chirac will open four newly renovated galleries of the Louvre
dedicated exclusively to art from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of disdain is over,'' noted Jacques Kerchache, a
renowned French collector of African art who is a close friend of
the French president. ```Primitive art' has finally entered the
Louvre.''
</P>
<P>
   Situated in the southern arm of the U-shaped museum, the new
galleries on the first floor of the Pavillon des Sessions are not
exactly in the heart of the Louvre. But they are accessible from
anywhere in the museum. And the idea is that, from now on, the 112
works of African, Asian, Oceanic and American art on display there
should be treated as the aesthetic equals of, say, the Egyptian,
Greek or Renaissance art elsewhere in the vast building.
</P>
<P>
   ``These galleries have been conceived for visitors to the
Louvre,'' Chirac wrote in an introduction to the catalog of the
collection. ``Literally `overexposed' to masterpieces of the most
varied styles and materials in other departments, upon entering
this beautiful installation, they will discover, I am certain,
works that can be compared to the purest treasures of the Louvre.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the Louvre has lost this battle, it is not ready to sue
for peace. Chirac's other dream was to create an entire museum
dedicated to the art of early civilizations. And this too should
come true. Late last year, a design by Jean Nouvel was chosen for a
new museum to be built at a cost of some $190 million along the
Seine on the Quai Branly beside the Eiffel Tower. That museum,
which will absorb the collections of the existing Museum of African
and Oceanic Art and the Ethnology section of the Museum of Man, is
to open in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent, says the Louvre's president, Pierre Rosenberg. So
what better moment, he suggests, for moving his unwanted lodgers in
the Louvre to a new home? ``No one would understand why visitors to
the Quai Branly Museum should be deprived of the major works on
display here,'' he wrote recently in the Louvre's magazine, adding
that the Louvre ``does not have a vocation for presenting the art
of all human civilizations.''
</P>
<P>
   So the issue may be reopened in 2004, even though by then
Rosenberg will have retired and Chirac may no longer be president
(though he is widely expected to seek re-election in 2002).
``Permanent is not necessarily eternal,'' said Stephane Martin, the
director general of the future Quai Branly Museum. ``What we have
in the Louvre is a political statement. Perhaps after the opening
of the Quai Branly Museum, the message will be clear and the Louvre
will not be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   For a good many unhappy curators at the Louvre, however, the
message in question is simply one of political correctness. For
them, the Louvre exists to present Western art from the Middle Ages
to 1840, plus the ancient civilizations that are at the origins of
Western art. They also note that, in contrast to the encyclopedic
approach of, say, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the
French tradition is to maintain a galaxy of museums with focused
collections, not least the Musee d'Orsay and the Georges Pompidou
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the new Louvre galleries, on the other hand, argue
that the incursion of ``primitive art'' is not the result of
political whim but rather of a campaign that began in the early
years of this century when the likes of Picasso and Brancusi found
inspiration in African art. In 1909, for instance, the poet
Guillaume Apollinaire said the Louvre should present ``certain
exotic masterpieces.'' He was later seconded by Andre Malraux and
Claude Levi-Strauss, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac has long admired African and Asian art. And in Kerchache,
he has a strong advocate not only for the new presentation in the
Louvre but also for the new Quai Branly Museum. Kerchache, who has
the post of scientific adviser to the new museum, personally
selected the works in the Pavillon des Sessions, selecting from the
existing collections in Paris, borrowing from some French regional
museums and foreign museums and acquiring a score of new works.
</P>
<P>
   The display opens with 46 African sculptures, starting with an
Egyptian stone figure dating from around the fifth century B.C.
that, Martin said, serves as a bridge from the Louvre's own
exceptional Egyptian collection. This section includes ivory pieces
from Sierra Leone, 13th-to-15th-century wooden figures from Mali,
two Benin bronzes and a remarkable multiheaded terra cotta Nok
sculpture from Nigeria that is at least 1,500 years old. Unlike
most of the African works, a wooden and metal sculpture dedicated
to the god Gou in Benin in 1858 can be attributed to a specific
artist, Akati Ekplekendo.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian section contains just six works because the Quai
Branly Museum does not plan to duplicate the Asian collection at
the Musee Guimet. Rather, it is focusing only on those regions not
influenced by the ancient Asian religions, like Indonesia, the
Philippines and Taiwan. One of the most surprising pieces is a
10-foot-high sculptured wooden figure from a village in Taiwan that
Kerchache saw many years ago and was able to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Oceanic works in the Louvre, which number 28, are mostly
from former French possessions in the South Pacific. A wooden
figure from Hawaii and a stone head from Easter Island are also on
display. From the Americas, along with pre-Columbian ceramic and
clay figures, mainly Aztec and Mayan, from Mexico, the 32 works
include Taino objects from the Caribbean and Inuit heads from
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   What is noteworthy is that in these galleries, designed by
Jean-Michel Wilmotte, the objects are presented as art and not
ethnography. In contrast, the Quai Branly Museum _ it has been
given this name to forestall arguments about ``primitive art'' _
will aim at a more comprehensive interpretation of the role and
context of the pieces on display and, in that sense, satisfy those
who believe in a distinction between art created as art and objects
made for, say, a religious use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Quai Branly Museum's public will be different,'' Martin
explained. ``People visit the Louvre as they might a temple, so the
idea here is to pay homage to the artists of four continents. Now
people can see Egyptian and Greek and pre-Columbian art in one day
in one place. But we're not trying to create a mini-museum here.
That's why we wanted Jacques Kerchache to pick the pieces. It is
his personal point of view that gives unity to the presentation.''

skin diseases.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Fighting the good fight, when your skin is your enemy
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Laurel Garner really believes her body
is a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The terrible blisters on her eye, thumb, back and gums have
popped out when she has been under intense emotional or physical
stress.
</P>
<P>
   A divorce, working two jobs, a car accident _ even the physical
stress of a tattoo _ resulted in horrible blistering that
eventually was diagnosed as a rare autoimmune disorder, pemphigus
vulgaris.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body sees my skin as an enemy,'' the Stuart, Fla., woman
says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not such a far-fetched concept.
</P>
<P>
   Garner's dermatologist, Dr. Marta Rendon, says at least 10
common skin disorders, including acne, dandruff and hives, are
either triggered by or worsened by stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know exactly how or why stress triggers these
diseases. And people don't have to have any psychological disorder.
It's just the way they deal with stress, how the stress affects
their body,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a patient who fell off his ladder at work and was out of
a job. His psoriasis came out after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendon, who practices in Boca Raton, Fla., says that stress
management, biofeedback and relaxation tapes can help patients
manage their outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus on giving them emotional support, explaining the
disease and the outcome, and giving them guidance. Sometimes, that
alone helps them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other dermatologists find stress management of little use in
controlling or preventing most skin disorders because, they say,
there are so many factors that lead to outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   There are psychological conditions _ where patients scratch
their faces excessively, for example _ where psychological
approaches are helpful, says Dr. Howard Green, division director of
dermatology for Intracoastal Health Systems in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``And biofeedback as a preventative can be good if there is a
strong correlation between emotional and physical stress and the
condition. But it's strictly individual. And it's usually not that
straightforward. I'd downplay that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Rosenberg, also a West Palm Beach dermatologist, had
a similar viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that a dermatologic condition needs that approach,''
he said. ``Biofeedback would be unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters Rendon: ``The issue is, it's very important to
recognize how stress affects your body and these diseases. Ones who
are severely affected might need stress management to deal with and
control their disease.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that she might approach diseases differently
than other dermatologists. For one thing, she is looking for a
therapist to join her practice, she said, so she can have a
``holistic approach, treating the whole patient.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she adds, ``There's plenty of data, especially on psoriasis
and eczema, that shows stress management affects the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Garner _ Rendon's patient of four years _ says she is
happy with Rendon's approach and has discussed controlling stress
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gives me such individual attention. If I'm hurting, she's
hurting. It's important to know she cares. The comfort she gives
you helps.''
</P>
<P>
   TOP 10 STRESS-RELATED SKIN DISEASES
</P>
<P>
   _ 1. Cold sores: painful blisters on the lips or in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   _ 2. Dandruff: common condition in which the scalp is dry and
scaling.
</P>
<P>
   _ 3. Hyperhydrosis: excessive sweating.
</P>
<P>
   _ 4. Pruritus: chronic itching that may be mild to intense, and
the scratch marks occasionally become infected.
</P>
<P>
   _ 5. Hair loss &AMP; Alopecia Areata (round areas of hair loss).
</P>
<P>
   _ 6. Acne: the general term for plugged pores, pimples, and
deeper lumps that may cause inflammation which, if severe enough,
can result in scars.
</P>
<P>
   _ 7. Eczema: a red, itchy inflammation of the skin characterized
by red skin patches, pimples, crusts, or scabs occurring alone or
in combination.
</P>
<P>
   _ 8. Psoriasis: an inflammatory skin condition characterized by
frequent episodes of redness, itching, and thick, dry, silvery
scales on the skin.
</P>
<P>
   _ 9. Hives (Urticaria): raised welts of various sizes on the
surface of the skin that are often itchy.
</P>
<P>
   _ 10. Rosacea: a skin inflammation characterized by a redness
that looks like a blush, pimples, knobby lumps on the nose, and
thin red lines due to enlarged blood vessels.

   TEST-PROTESTS (Great Barrington, Mass.) _ From the Berkshires to
Cambridge, brush fires of civil disobedience flared in classrooms
across Massachusetts on Wednesday, as hundreds of high school
sophomores, and dozens of fourth- and eighth-graders, boycotted the
first of nine days of statewide standardized testing. In a sign of
rising student and parent discontent with politicians' reliance on
such tests, the protests followed _ and exceeded _ similar
rebellions in recent months in Illinois, Ohio, Louisiana, Wisconsin
and Florida. Though most of the students in Massachusetts reported
to class as scheduled, they chose to write essays about their
opposition to testing rather than answer the questions posed. Some
of the students face disciplinary actions ranging from suspension
to having a failing test grade incorporated into their third
quarter marks. By Jacques Steinberg.

 &HT;    GORE: CLINTON DOESN'T WANT A PARDON
 &HT;    With GORE. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore told newspaper editors
Wednesday that there won't be any stories about presidential
pardons if he moves into the White House when Bill Clinton moves
out next January.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is way ahead of you on this,'' the
Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting informed the American
Society of Newspaper Editors at their annual meeting here. ``He
said publicly some time ago that he would neither request nor
accept a pardon, so that's the answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign spokeswoman in Nashville said the no-pardon
pledge came during impeachment hearings before the House Judiciary
Committee on Dec. 9, 1998. It was issued on Clinton's behalf by
then-White House counsel Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, asked Ruff whether he could assure
the panel that Clinton would neither grant himself a pardon nor
accept one from his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Ruff replied.
</P>
<P>
   While the president later prevailed in an impeachment trial
before the Senate, the question posed to Gore has recently assumed
an added dimension.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr as the
independent counsel investigating White House matters, is
considering an indictment of Clinton after he leaves office in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process has to be vindicated,'' Ray has told reporters.
``No person is above the law, even the president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's remarks led to a spate of questions for presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart at Tuesday's(cq) White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe, given the fact that the president paid the $90,000 fine
and did not appeal (U.S. District Court) Judge (Susan) Wright's
finding that he gave ``false, misleading and evasive answers''
under oath, and given Mr. Ray's statement ... can you assure us the
president will not pardon himself on or before January the 20th?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reporter asked whether Clinton ``had any discussion with
the vice
</P>
<P>
   president about a potential pardon situation, that you're aware
of?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not that I'm aware of,'' Lockhart responded.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart quipped that he was ``a little too young'' to recall
when Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon after Nixon resigned as
president in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Ford issued Nixon a prospective pardon for his role
in the Watergate scandal _ but not before he told the House
Judiciary Committee that ``the American people would never stand''
for such an act.
</P>
<P>
   Article II of the Constitution states that the president ``shall
have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the
United States, except in cases of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Constitution remains silent as to whether a president
may use his pardon authority to protect himself from prosecution
after he leaves office, whether by removal, resignation or the
conclusion of his elected term.

<P>
   Poor Proust! Lying in bed in a soundproof room swaddled in
layers of wool, gasping with asthma, trying to recapture with words
the lost sensation of his mother's kiss. But like Einstein, Marcel
Proust was, in his own way, a theorist of time and space. ``An hour
is not merely an hour,'' Proust wrote, ``it is a vase full of
scents and sounds and projects and climates.''
</P>
<P>
   Countless volumes have been written about the author, who died
in 1922. Proust's own novel, ``Remembrance of Things Past'' (often
referred to by enthusiasts as simply The Novel), is a very
autobiographical 3,000 pages long. A two-volume study by George
Painter, published in 1959 and 1965, is generally acknowledged to
be one of the finest literary biographies in English.
</P>
<P>
   But it is as if every generation has to ask its own questions of
Proust. In recent years there have been a number of books about
him, including ``How Proust Can Change Your Life,'' by Alain de
Botton; ``A Year of Reading Proust,'' by Phyllis Rose; ``Proust's
Lesbianism,'' by Elisabeth Ladenson; even a Proust comic book in
French, which sold 12,000 copies in the first three months after
its release.
</P>
<P>
   Now come two immense new biographies, both, as it happens,
called, ``Marcel Proust: A Life.'' One is by William Carter, a
professor of French at the University of Alabama at Birmingham,
published (at 946 pages) in March by Yale University Press. The
other (934 pages), by Jean-Yves Tadie, a professor at the Sorbonne,
is to be released in August by Viking.
</P>
<P>
   Both draw on material previously unavailable in English,
including the 22 volumes of Proust's letters assembled by Philip
Kolb. Kolb, who made the Proust letters his life's work, was
correcting the final proofs until a few days before he died in 1992
at 85.
</P>
<P>
   Proust's work has never gone out of print. What is it about
Proust that makes him of such enduring interest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Proust, we are going through a fin de siecle,'' said
Carter, his biographer. ``In the novel he really traces the effects
of modern inventions, machines of mass transit, on our perceptions
of time and space.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense contemporary interest in Proust ``may be some
connection with the age of the Internet, where everything seems
instantaneous and we have the perception we can communicate
instantly, but still, we are governed by the laws of time,'' Carter
said. ``It's exciting, but it causes anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Remembrance of Things Past,'' the narrator catches sight of
an aviator flying a plane and sees him as a symbol of the artist
with the power to conquer time and space.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said that the sexual themes in Proust's work also
contributed to the interest among contemporary readers. ``Proust
was the first novelist to explore the entire spectrum of human
sexuality,'' he said. ``Characters could be homosexual in the first
part of their lives and heterosexual later, or the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   The new biographies are only part of the Proust revival. In
England in January, HarperCollins published the final volume of the
English translation of Proust's letters. In April, Norton will
publish ``Proust's Way, A Field Guide to `In Search of Lost
Time,''' by Roger Shattuck, whose book title is based on a more
precise translation of The Novel's French title, ``A la Recherche
du Temps Perdu.'' The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
which has one of the world's largest collection of Proust's
letters, will be host for a Proust conference, along with the
Bibliotheque Nationale. Next fall in England, Harold Pinter's
``Proust Screenplay'' will be staged at the National Theater, and
in 2001, Penguin plans to publish a new translation of The Novel by
seven different authors.
</P>
<P>
   Proust is so popular these days that in San Francisco a
gathering of fans called the Proust Support Group has had to form a
second section because so many people signed up to read The Novel.
The Support Group also publishes a newsletter, ``Proust Said
That,'' with the author's observations on everything from drugs _
``It is easy to speak of the beauty of opium'' _ to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Proust Society of America, formed in 1998, also
has a reading group and celebrates Proust's birthday. Recipes from
the novel are served, including, of course, ``those squat, plump
little cakes called `petites madeleines' which look as though they
had been moulded in the fluted valve of a scallop shell.'' Last
year the society's newsletter printed what is thought, at 958
words, to be Proust's longest sentence, if not the longest sentence
in all of literature: ``Their honor precarious, their liberty
provisional, lasting only until the discovery of their crime; their
position unstable ...'' etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   The new biographies, based on the letters, annotated editions of
``Remembrance of Things Past'' and Proust's notebooks, which have
also become available, provide fresh insights into Proust's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a much fuller picture of the struggle he went through
to decide on the genre, and the story, of The Novel,'' Carter said.
``We know a tremendous amount more about his sexual development.
There were a number of letters his family didn't want published.''
</P>
<P>
   Proust was born in 1871, the son of a prominent doctor. His
mother, to whom he was famously close, came from a wealthy,
cultivated Jewish family. At the age of 9 he had his first asthma
attack while returning from the Bois de Boulogne.
</P>
<P>
   Previous biographers have depicted Proust as a hopeless neurotic
whose asthma was assuredly psychosomatic. Carter offers evidence
that Proust suffered from acute allergies. He also conveys an image
of the author that is different from the conventional one. Carter's
Proust is no wimp; rather, he is an authoritative presence who
served in the military and was a plucky duelist.
</P>
<P>
   Carter adds new details about Proust's sex life. In his youth,
Proust struggled with his homosexuality. In an effort to turn him
into a ``normal man,'' his father sent him to a brothel. But
Proust, Carter writes, was so chagrined that during his visit he
broke a chamber pot. Carter also depicts Proust's unsuccessful
adolescent attempt to seduce a Mme. Chirade. Proust loved many men,
including the composer Reynaldo Hahn and his own chauffeur, Alfred
Agostinelli, and Carter adds another, Jacques Bizet, son of the
composer Georges Bizet.
</P>
<P>
   Proust frequented the salons of the Belle Epoque, and there he
encountered the figures upon whom he would model his characters.
There was Comte Robert de Montesquiou, who became the Baron de
Charlus; Sarah Bernhardt, who became the actress La Berma;
Genevieve Straus and the Comtesse Elisabeth Greffulhe, who were
melded into the Duchesse de Guermantes. Proust based the character
of Swann on Charles Haas and Charles Ephrussi, founder and editor
of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts.

<P>
   Proust also heard the music of Saint-Saens and Cesar Franck,
which would become Vinteuil's famous sonata and septet in The
Novel.
</P>
<P>
   In his biography, Carter underscores Proust's long search for
the plot of his novel, and his deep discouragement. He cites
passages from Proust's abandoned work, ``Jean Santeuil,'' which
prefigured the themes of ``Remembrance'': ``a perfumed smelled in
that past time, a remembered light shining into our room, will
suddenly bring back so vividly, that it fills us with ...
intoxication, so that we become completely indifferent to what is
usually called `real life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Proust realized that the subject of his novel was his
own struggle to write. Carter cites a jotting from Proust's
notebook of 1908 in which he announces that he is finally ready
``to settle down to a fairly long piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter argues that by shifting from the third person in ``Jean
Santeuil'' to first person, Proust was finally able to write
``Remembrance.'' ``He was freeing himself to speak as the
persona,'' he said, ``as the voice which tells the story.'' The
Novel was published in successive volumes from 1913 to 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Tadie, the general editor of the Pleiade edition of Proust's
work and the author of ``Proust and the Novel,'' did not set out to
write a traditional biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proust had written against biography,'' Tadie said in a
telephone interview from Paris. Indeed, in his essay ``Contre
Sainte-Beuve,'' another precursor to his ultimate work, ``Proust
said that the man does not explain the work, he is not the same man
who writes the work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to tell you how the work was written from Proust's
life,'' he said. Tadie was able to interview a number of Proust's
friends, including Cocteau and the writer and diplomat Paul Morand,
who filled in some gaps about his life.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carter, Tadie was surprised by how hard Proust worked. ``I
had to see it to believe it,'' he said of the many drafts and
notebooks. Proust rewrote the novel's first page _ which begins
``For a long time I have been in the habit of going to bed early''
_ 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been perfectly happy with the first one,'' Tadie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tadie said he was also struck by the breadth of Proust's
learning in literature, science and history: ``You can find 300
names of painters in the drafts.'' Unlike previous biographers,
Tadie emphasizes the role that Proust's father, the doctor, played
in his life, and the way his father's theories are embodied in the
character of Dr. Cottard.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carter, Tadie delves into the complexity of Proust's sex
life. ``He was half sadist, half masochist,'' said Tadie, referring
to incidents in which Proust had rats killed in front of him so
that he could achieve sexual gratification. ``His attempts always
to go deeper and deeper in his work,'' he said, ``could be related
to his sadism.''
</P>
<P>
   Tadie also adds a name to the list of Proust's lovers, the
playwright Francis de Croisset. Tadie said he began to notice a
curious pattern in Proust's sex life, indeed in his everyday life
as well. ``He had to change partners every 18 months,'' Tadie said.
</P>
<P>
   Tadie said, though, that in the end he was not even sure that
Proust actually had sex with other men. ``The problem was, what
kind of happiness could Proust draw from a lover? Was it physical
or spiritual?''
</P>
<P>
   Proust's sexual pleasures may have been mostly solitary, he
said. Like Stendhal, who also wrote great love stories, Proust may
have finally been impotent. And his sex life may have been only an
extension of his loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He belonged to four minorities, Jew, homosexual, artist among
the upper class,'' Tadie said. ``Finally, he was also ill. Every
time he entered the house, people used to whisper about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tadie sees in Proust ``a lesson of courage.'' Loneliness, he
said, ``was the grammar of Proust's life.''

 &HT;    LEGISLATION FILED TO COMBAT SEXUAL SLAVERY
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects Wellstone's state to Minnesota in graf 2.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two senators who agree on little else introduced
almost identical bills Wednesday to crack down on the growing
worldwide problem of trafficking women and girls for forced
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Most people ``don't believe this could actually be happening
today, in the year 2000,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., one
of the most liberal members of Congress, who has formed an alliance
with staunch conservative Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Central Intelligence Agency estimates
that at least 700,000 women are tricked or kidnapped and taken to a
foreign country for forced prostitution each year. The CIA reports
that 50,000 women and girls are brought into the United States
annually for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Among other provisions, the bills would double the maximum
penalties for ``enticement into slavery and sale into involuntary
servitude'' to 20 years and adds the possibility of a life sentence
in cases involving death, rape or abuse of children.
</P>
<P>
   Victims, who are now often jailed or deported, would be eligible
for temporary visas, legal aid, and crisis treatment. To aid in
prevention, the United States would sponsor a public information
campaign abroad to warn women not to trust offers of lucrative jobs
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators differed on only one issue, U.S. sanctions
against countries that refuse to fight this crime. Brownback wants
to mandate specific sanctions, and Wellstone would give the
president more leeway.
</P>
<P>
   However, the two senators agreed to back whichever version
emerges from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Brownback said
he was hopeful that the panel would move soon, although no action
is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   A companion bipartisan bill is moving through the House.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists have said that no country has laws that
are tough enough to stop this modern sexual slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutions are rare, even in the United States, where some
traffickers in Florida last year were given only a two-year
sentence for holding a group of Mexican women, including a
14-year-old girl, under armed guard and forcing them to service
migrant workers in trailers converted to brothels.
</P>

Intelligence.''

 &HT;    Higher fuel costs cut into AirTran's profit
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sharply higher fuel costs pushed AirTran Airways'
profit down 5 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at Atlanta's second-largest carrier called the
results solid, adding they expect to begin a significant expansion
this year following two years of nominal growth as the company
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the company on a good operational and financial footing
it's our intention to start ramping growth up,'' Chief Executive
Joe Leonard told analysts during a Wednesday conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect 15 percent (seat capacity) growth starting in the
second half of the year for as far out as we can see,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said AirTran will probably add two new destinations from
Atlanta this year. He said it will continue to focus on Atlanta as
its primary hub and local market, although it has also added a few
non-Atlanta routes such as Philadelphia-Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, AirTran had a profit of $2.9 million, or 4
cents a share, down from $3.1 million, or 5 cents a share, for the
same period of 1999. Revenue rose 10 percent to $132.4 million, as
ridership gained 5.5 percent and yield, or average fare per mile,
grew 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth consecutive quarterly profit for AirTran, which
grew out of the former ValuJet and struggled to survive in 1997 and
1998. Leonard took the helm in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran's average cost of jet fuel zoomed to 90.4 cents per
gallon from 42 cents a year earlier, a 115 percent increase. That
pushed unit costs up 8.6 percent, although they declined almost 6
percent excluding the higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said Y2K concerns and ice storms also dragged down
first-quarter profits. He said the airline has experienced some
shakedown glitches with its new Boeing 717s, which are gradually
replacing AirTran's aging DC-9s, but added he remains happy with
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended the quarter with a lot of momentum,'' Leonard said.

IN MILAN, MINIMUM FURNITURE, MAXIMUM FUSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan, Britain)   By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ A wallop of sugar was added this week to the
frothy zabaglione that is the annual Italian furniture fair, where
hundreds of editors and thousands of buyers, manufacturers and
designers descend each year to test, compare, cheer and dismiss new
products and retreads of old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that the latest sleek samples of minimal elegance and
technological wizardry might not sufficiently wow the crowds, fair
organizers asked 14 international artists to provide a supplemental
jolt of novelty.
</P>
<P>
   So on Monday, the eve of the fair's official opening,
installations by Robert Wilson, Yoko Ono and Peter Greenaway, among
others, were presented within the splendid 19th-century Rotonda
Della Besana in the middle of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Each artist interpreted the theme of ``rooms and their secrets''
before an audience of 2,000 _ mostly Milanese hungry for
contemporary art. Luisa Agliatta, a design student from Zimbabwe
studying here, said she didn't mind waiting for an hour to get
inside. ``I'm willing to see anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty to ponder. In one corner of Wilson's
installation, a woman dressed like a character from Chekhov
staggered around a darkened space where columns had been
transformed into tree trunks. She reacted sometimes violently,
sometimes disconsolately, to a voice apparently from her past
speaking German.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway, the film director, flooded his space with water,
overflowing from about 10 bathtubs. Open suitcases also overflowed
with the stuff of everyday life: bottles, appliances, tennis balls.
A naked man sat in one tub while the room filled with steam.
</P>
<P>
   The smolderingly handsome Bosnian filmmaker, Emir Kusturica, was
there, too, re-creating an underground bunker from his 1995 film,
``Underground,'' the story of two friends who go into hiding for a
very long time only to find upon emerging that their homeland,
Yugoslavia, has disappeared, along with one man's wife. The
director imported truckloads of Serbian dirt, cabbages and onions
to his re-created bunker. ``There's no place left for secrets;
there's only the underground as a place to hide your agenda,'' he
said, when asked to explain its significance.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, Kusturica also performed with a rock band
(formed by his son) that provided the musical entertainment. One
observer quipped that it sounded like ``a bar mitzvah band.''
</P>
<P>
   Many viewers felt the entire installation, which runs through
May 7, was overegging the zabaglione.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's useless,'' said Achille Castiglioni, the legendary
designer who in his 80s remains a vital presence on the scene, as
he emerged with a shrug, unimpressed by a video installation
projecting images of two naked bodies struggling to fit into a
small cube.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's trying to be experimental but it makes no real point that
I can see,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The sideshow hardly seemed necessary, what with the Italian
furniture business thriving with roughly $101 million in sales to
the United States alone for 1999, an increase of about 6 percent
over 1998. About 2,300 exhibitors, all but 200 of them from Italy,
were expected to show new wares at this year's fair. Many were
groaning about sensory overload before the fair even opened
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the artists may have won hands-down when it came to
metaphor, the furniture designers were busy grappling with how to
make technology more human, and if not poetic then at least
practical.
</P>
<P>
   At the Milan fairgrounds, the Italian furniture company Edra was
once again in the forefront, presenting furniture upholstered in
hybrid materials: their shimmery waterproof linen, in fashion
colors, had a rain-slicker look. Other pieces were covered in a
wool injected with synthetic fiber that gave the fabric an almost
Naugahyde sheen.
</P>
<P>
   The shapes this year were appealing to the inner lounge lizard
in everyone. One sprawling sofa at Edra, called Flap, designed by
Francesco Binfare, recalled a squashed baseball mitt with fingers
that could be raised or lowered as back and leg rests.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was this sofa, or any one of the many
low-to-the-ground samples in evidence everywhere, that prompted the
architect Adam Tihany to complain that Italians have no
understanding of the American body. ``Don't they know that we all
have bad backs?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edra was not the only company that had a stake in technological
derring-do. Kartell, the plastics giant, was also on hand with a
love seat called Bubble Club by Philippe Starck. While pointedly
old-fashioned in look, with traditional rolled arms, the sofa took
advantage of the latest techniques in molding plastic. It required
a special rotational device to make a piece of plastic that large,
with a bit of comfy give in the seat. (No spindly aluminum legs
like they always have on plastic seating units in airports.) The
piece will cost $400 to $500 when it arrives in the United States
later this year, according to Kartell.
</P>
<P>
   Starck, wearing glasses with a Fendi tag still pasted to the
lens, noted that to be able to make a piece of ``such size and
durability for so little is a revolution; you can put it in your
salon or forget it for 100 years in your garden.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's kind of no style, coming from the collective
unconscious. I like that it's not `designed' by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Understated minimalism, championed by designers since the
mid-90s, is selling too well to dismiss. There was plenty of
minimal furniture on show, with only the slightest deviation from
years past: a little extra nub on the politely textured wool
upholstery at B&AMP;B Italia, for example, but bring your magnifying
glass to discern it. The company's sales are up more than 35
percent in the United States and so there were plenty of new pieces
by Antonio Citterio, the maestro of low-key elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of messing with the success of clean lines, many
manufacturers opted for saturated late-'60s colors borrowed
straight from Barbra Streisand's wardrobe in ``Funny Girl'' or
perhaps from Andy Warhol's silk-screen portraits.
</P>
<P>
   To assuage some apparent restlessness or perhaps just to attract
a younger crowd, B&AMP;B also reissued a newly hip '60s classic:
Gaetano Pesce's bright Up furniture collection, with its famous
bulbous high-back chair, resembling a Botero mother. The ottoman is
a round ball tethered by a bungee cord. The chair will be about
$1,729 in the United States. At the Satellite, a pavilion for
aspiring designers, it was a great hit with young talents trying to
catch some shut-eye between events.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cappellini tapped two young talents, Erwan and Ronan Bouroullec
from Brittany, who reinterpreted a native cloistered bed. The piece
also invoked Australian shuttered architecture, including
fire-watching towers, in its elevated ``treehouse'' style, with
framing in steel and paneling in lacquered birch plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a few architects were invited to punch up the
streamlined shapes. The company Driade asked David Chipperfield,
one of the master minimalists of London, and Kazuyo Sejima, known
among cognoscenti as the Rem Koolhaas of Japan, to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Sejima stretched farther than Chipperfield, who designed a
collection of regulation mahogany and aluminum home office
furniture. She created a five-piece sitting room with multipurpose
pieces that range from a black, tatami-inspired foam platform that
barely hovered above the ground, to a zany inflatable lime-green
slipcover for side chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, everyone has these very hard chairs to sit on,''
Sejima said. ``I wanted to find a cheap way to make them more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although still in prototype form (it emitted a few embarrassing
whoopee-cushion sounds when tested) the slipcover promised to be
poetic and inspiring. Artists, please take note.

A VERDICT FOR HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The verdict of a British judge on the libel suit filed by
Holocaust denier David Irving against Emory University professor
Deborah Lipstadt was a powerful denunciation of Irving's
distortions of history and his neo-Nazi attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Upholding the truth of what Lipstadt had written about Irving in
her book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and
Memory,'' High Court Justice Charles Gray said: ``I have come to
the conclusion that the criticisms advanced by the defendants are
almost invariably well-founded. Irving has significantly
misrepresented what the evidence, objectively examined, reveals.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's ruling does justice to the memory of the millions
murdered under Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime. It makes a lucid
distinction between truth and falsification. And in ruling that
Lipstadt's book did not libel Irving, Gray was moved to say not
only that Irving's misrepresentations of the Nazi genocide were
deliberate, but also that Irving is an anti-Semite, racist against
people of color, and a Nazi sympathizer.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has pondered the meaning of the Holocaust will
breathe a sigh of relief at Irving's failure to win his libel suit
in a British court, where the burden of proof is placed on the
defendants _ in this case the author and her publisher, Penguin
Books _ to prove they did not libel the plaintiff. Irving's defeat
may not vanquish the forces of revisionism or neo-Nazism, but, had
he won his case, the myth-makers who wish to efface the Third
Reich's crimes would have had a monstrous victory.
</P>
<P>
   That said, if the great treasure of open inquiry is to be
preserved, no court should have to decide a quarrel among
historians. Gray may be correct in ruling that ``Irving has for his
own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately
misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence.'' But when a
judge must judge a debate among historians, relying on testimony
from other historians, something of scholarly free inquiry is lost.
In this case, it was Irving himself who brought the debate to
court, but more honest historians should avoid repeating his error.

DEADLY LOOPHOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This nation's landmark 1968 gun-control law prohibits both
felons and persons who have been involuntarily hospitalized for
mental illness from buying handguns. The 1993 Brady law, which
requires a waiting period before gun purchases to screen out those
who are not eligible, did not address a major loophole in the 1968
law: Because of privacy concerns, police often have little, if any,
information about involuntary confinements of the mentally ill,
with the result that many deeply disturbed people have no trouble
buying guns. Closing that loophole should be a top priority in both
Congress and the state capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of this problem was made clear in a New York Times
series this week on rampage killers _ people who suddenly start
shooting others in a school, workplace, commuter train, or other
public site. The series looked at 100 such incidents and found that
half the killers had a history of serious mental illness, with at
least eight having been involuntarily committed. Repeatedly, the
Times found such people could buy guns easily because little
information is exchanged between mental health officials and
law-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, police send names of gun-permit applicants to
the state Department of Mental Health, which checks the records of
only public mental-health institutions near the applicant's home.
State Senator Cheryl Jacques, a member of the Public Safety
Committee, says this is inadequate. But, she notes, ``these are not
criminals we are talking about.'' She expects to confer with
advocates for the mentally ill to make sure any new legislation
protects privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts does have another line of defense against severely
disturbed people buying handguns _ the discretion that local police
chiefs have to deny permits to applicants they consider dangerous.
But this too is far from foolproof. Ideally, Congress should close
the loophole while protecting privacy. This can be done with a
tightly controlled national registry of the involuntarily committed
that would respond only to police requests for matches against gun
applications.

   ``Minnelli on Minnelli''
</P>
<P>
   Liza Minnelli. Angel. 24 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   A full orchestra, heavy on strings. A fading star. A comeback
concert that honors a dead daddy. ``Minnelli on Minnelli'' has all
the elements of great drama, and there is great drama on this disc,
recorded live at New York's Palace Theater in December. Some of
that drama comes from the material _ great songs from ``Gigi,''
``Meet Me in St. Louis'' and ``The Band Wagon.'' Some of it comes
from wondering whether Liza Minnelli, a hard-living 53, has
anything left in her bag of tricks. She does, and it's mostly the
tricks: the overly emotive phrasing; the sloshy vibrato; the
girlish giggles that flirt with hyperventilation. Still, with a
manly sextet providing serious support, she sells it. She even
turns the tables with a quippy ``I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore''
verse that skewers the gossips and critics, and her ``Trolley
Song'' is insistently hummable. Love Liza with a Z or hate her, you
gotta admit the girl's still here.

   ``Flying Saucer Blues''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Case. Vanguard. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Lonesome losers and acoustic blues go hand in hand. And few
songwriters know both as well as Peter Case. One-time leader of
'80s new wavers the Plimsouls _ lone hit: ``A Million Miles Away''
_ Case has spent the last 15 years exploring the gritty side of
America's barrooms, bedrooms and boulevards. On his seventh solo,
the folk troubadour delivers more autobiographical tales of
drifters, misfits and boozers than you'd expect from a 40-something
upstate New York native. But it's a familiar cast for Case, whose
most recent albums play like a grim soundtrack for the luckless.
What keeps Case's warts-and-all storytelling from becoming maudlin
is the lyrical wit at the core of his spare Dylanesque tales. It's
what cuts through his boyish vocals and Delta blues fretwork,
whether he's lamenting lost chances (``Coulda Shoulda Woulda''),
childhood innocence (``Black Dirt &AMP; Clay'') or Y2K angst
(``Paradise Etc.''). Overall, ``Blues'' is not as rich as 1998's
stellar ``Full Service.'' Similar pacing and structure handcuff
many of the songs here, and melody too often takes a backseat to
the lyrics. But for fans of road-ripe blues, these are merely bumps
along the way in a trip worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Case plays the Blind Willie McTell Blues Festival in
Thompson, Ga., on May 13. For details: 706-597-1000, or on the Web

 &HT;    Looking for things to do
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time to go out looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A house is thousands and thousands of individual parts that work
together to keep you comfortable and safe, and there's a good
chance dozens of those parts need maintenance, repair, replacement
or general sprucing up right now.
</P>
<P>
   Your job, now that it's warm enough to spend a few hours
outside, is to take a close look around the house to figure out
what needs attention and how badly. Once you've done a thorough
inspection trip, you can prioritize and give yourself a good to-do
list.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll list some of the important things you should check
and give you some tips on how to check them. We'll save tips on
correcting most of the problems you might find for another day.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn and lawn tools
</P>
<P>
   While walking across the lawn, notice the feel of the ground.
Freezing and thawing sometimes creates spongy soil. You also may
notice mole trails that appear as raised lines of grass.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawn care experts suggest running a roller over a spongy or
mole-damaged lawn. Others prefer an aerator that takes plugs out of
the soil to improve water and fertilizer penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Go with aeration if the lawn has a thatch layer more than 1/2
-inch thick. Thatch is the tightly intermingled layer of living and
dead stems and other plant parts that develops between the grass
and the soil surface.
</P>
<P>
   To measure the thatch layer, cut a plug of the lawn a few inches
deep with a shovel. You'll see how thick the thatch is by looking
at the plug from the side.
</P>
<P>
   You also may run across a few insect larvae buried near the
surface. You won't be able to do much about the grubs now, but make
note to deal with them in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   If you have small bare spots scattered around the lawn that were
green last summer, you may have a crabgrass problem. Larger bare
spots usually indicate bigger problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now's a good time to spread a pre-emergent crabgrass agent over
the lawn. It will kill the young crabgrass plants before they take
root firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Check your garden hoses for leaks and cuts. Attach a sprayer to
the end of the hoses, but leave the sprayer closed when you turn on
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Leaks at connections can usually be fixed by replacing hose
washers, but hoses with splits or breaks should be replaced to
avoid wasting water. Save the damaged hoses; you'll find lots of
uses for lengths of rubber tubing cut from an old hose.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a sprinkler system, turn it on and see if it's
working properly. If it has a timer, set the clock to trigger the
system to be sure it turns on and off when it's supposed to. An
elaborate professionally installed sprinkler system may need
attention from your irrigation contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Check your lawn mower if you haven't used it yet. Use a paint
scraper to clear any clipping residue stuck inside the mower
housing. Then scrape the inside of the housing with a wire brush.
</P>
<P>
   While cleaning, examine and tighten all the screws and bolts and
make sure all the switches, levers, pulleys and other control
devices are moving properly.
</P>
<P>
   Before you use your lawn mower, sharpen the blade, change the
oil, replace the spark plug, clean or replace the air filter and do
other maintenance tasks the owner's manual suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Also fire up your other lawn equipment _ weed trimmers, hedge
trimmers, power saws, etc. You may still be able to beat the worst
of the spring rush at repair shops if you find a problem soon.
</P>
<P>
   Decks, walks and drives, lighting
</P>
<P>
   Examine wooden decks and fences. You probably will wait for
spring rains to pass before cleaning and resealing your outdoor
wood, but structural repairs can be handled earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Check all joints and fasteners on the deck; they should be
secure and free of rust. Look for deck nails that are working
loose. You might want to replace them with screws. Are the posts
that support the deck showing any signs of decay?
</P>
<P>
   To see if your deck will need to be resealed this year, toss a
bucket of water on the deck when it is dry (no rain in about three
days). If the water beads, you're in good shape for this year. If
it soaks in, you'll need to apply a sealer.
</P>
<P>
   On your wooden fences, look for loose boards, popped nails,
``weep'' lines under nails, discoloration and rotting wood.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete walks and driveways and asphalt driveways naturally
develop cracks. Large cracks will have to be repaired to keep large
holes from developing, but whether you deal with hairline cracks is
up to you. Some people ignore them, although others insist that no
crack is a good crack.
</P>
<P>
   Look for a smooth, even black surface on an asphalt driveway. If
the surface is discolored or if pebbles clearly show, you probably
need to apply an asphalt sealer.
</P>
<P>
   On walkways, look for evidence that tree roots are lifting the
pavement. Roots can create dangerous breaks that will trip
unsuspecting walkers. Breaks are especially dangerous in winter
when they're difficult to keep free of snow and they're difficult
for pedestrians to see.
</P>
<P>
   Check any landscape lights you have running along the walks and
driveways. Turning the lights on for a daytime inspection may mean
resetting a timer or disabling a light sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Check the course of the wires leading to landscape light
fixtures. Are the wires in danger of being unearthed and exposed to
lawn mower blades?
</P>
<P>
   Check your porch lights and security lights. Turn them on and
look for burned-out bulbs or flickering fluorescent light tubes.
</P>
<P>
   After dark, check such things as motion sensors. Do the lights
come on as expected as you approach?
</P>
<P>
   Siding
</P>
<P>
   Paint on wooden siding deteriorates over time and must be
periodically replenished. Examine painted siding for peeling,
flaking, bubbling and powdering. Also look for rusting nails and
gaps around seams and openings or rotting and damaged boards.
</P>
<P>
   If your paint job has gone bad less than five years after the
last painting, seek advice from a seasoned professional before
repainting. You may need to correct some underlying problem to make
your next paint job last.
</P>
<P>
   Look for dark blotches or spots on the walls. If the spots fade
when wiped with bleach, you have a mildew problem.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum siding also deteriorates over time, although not as
quickly as paint. If your siding is more than 15 years old, look
for fading and chalking. If the original color layer has failed,
exposing unprotected metal, you need to act quickly to repaint it.
</P>
<P>
   Brick, like other sidings, can develop a salty white coating.
The white residue is caused by moisture passing through the brick,
so you must find and fix any leaks or sources of condensation that
may be causing moisture to make its way into the masonry.
</P>
<P>
   Windows, doors and air conditioners
</P>
<P>
   The points at which the frames of your doors and windows meet
the siding should be caulked to keep air from passing through
cracks around the frame. Caulk can harden and crack over time, so
check all the frames for problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also check the putty that holds the glass part of the window in
its wooden frame. Dry, hard, cracking window putty should be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The window frames themselves usually show stress at the joints
first, and all hardware and home-improvement stores sell metal
corner plates to shore up loose frames.
</P>
<P>
   While checking the airtightness of frames on your doors and
windows, don't forget the door of your attached garage. Keeping
some of the cold air out of your garage reduces the heat loss
through walls adjacent to the garage in winter and help. Sealing
the garage in summer reduces the cost of air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Check that exterior doors are equipped with sweeps, which seal
the area where the bottom of the door meets the threshold. Replace
broken or brittle sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully examine all locks and tighten any loose screws. Assess
whether additional locks are needed; good deadbolt locks should
protect all entry doors.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect all screens for holes. If you have the kind of screens
that are removed and replaced with storm windows in the winter,
check the screen frames to see if they need repair or painting.
</P>
<P>
   If you have central air conditioning, also inspect the outside
condenser unit. Leaves and other debris should be cleared before
the first use. Also trim shrubs or plants that crowd around the
condenser.
</P>
<P>
   The system should be inspected professionally once a year in
most cases. Check your owner's manual for tips on how often your
unit should be serviced.
</P>
<P>
   When you install window air conditioners, be sure they fit
snugly in the windows. If you find gaps around the unit or between
window sashes uses weatherstripping materials to seal them.
</P>
<P>
   Most units have a removable front filter. Check the filter
before turning on the unit, and clean it if necessary. If the
filter is frayed or otherwise deteriorated, replace it. Clean the
filter at least once a month this summer, or more often if your
owner's manual says so.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your clothes dryer is set to vent outdoors, and be
sure the vent cover is working properly. Clean accumulated lint
from the lint exhaust system.
</P>
<P>
   Roof and gutters
</P>
<P>
   The top is as good a place to start as any, so we'll start at
the chimney and work down.
</P>
<P>
   After a hard rain, go up to the attic to examine the underside
of the roof deck using a flashlight to check unlighted areas. Poke
with a knife or screwdriver to locate wet, darkened or
deteriorating wood on the ceiling beams or rafters. If you find
any, trace the moisture path back to its origin. This may be
difficult; the steeper the roof's pitch, the farther the moisture
can travel from its entry point to where it has collected.
</P>
<P>
   Next, turn off the lights and look for pinholes or cracks of
daylight in the roof surface. When you find the leak, measure its
location in relation to a reference point such as a chimney or vent
stack. This will help in locating it from the top of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the chimney if it passes through the attic. It
should be sound without deteriorating plaster or bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, start in the yard with a pair of binoculars on a strap
around your neck. Look with your bare eyes for problem areas, then
use the binoculars for a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   When looking at your chimney, check for cracks, missing bricks,
deteriorating plaster or signs of water damage. If you have a
chimney that runs up the side of the house, check its entire
length.
</P>
<P>
   Is the top of the chimney equipped to keep out birds or other
animals or is there evidence animals have entered?
</P>
<P>
   Check the fireplace damper and close it if you're through using
the fireplace for the season.
</P>
<P>
   On the roof, worn shingles may have dark spots where the
granules on their surface have washed off. Another sign of roof
problems are shingles that have curled at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   If your house has wooden shingles or shakes, check for curled,
warped and split shingles. Also look for stains from rusted nails
or shingles that have become loose. On slate or tile roofs, look
for breaks or loose roofing material.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing is the metal plating around chimneys, skylights, vents
and other holes through the roof. It should be flat and rust-free,
and the sealing material around its edges should be smooth and
intact.
</P>
<P>
   After looking up from the ground, position your ladder for a
closer look at the roof and the gutters.
</P>
<P>
   Check the gutters and look for evidence of leaks, rust and
depressions where water might collect. Also check for loose
connections between gutters and downspouts and for loose nails or
brackets.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, you can clean debris out of your gutters now or you
can wait until the trees near your house have shed their blooms and
seed pods later in the spring. Remember that even if your gutters
are screened, small plant debris will still get in, and you have to
occasionally remove the screens to clean the gutters.
</P>
<P>
   Spray the roof with a garden hose and make sure water coming out
of the downspouts is carried two feet or more from the house and
that the lawn slopes away from the house at least a little where
the water is released.
</P>
<P>
   Finally check out the hammock or patio lounger. By this time you
deserve an inspection that can be done from a prone position.

 &HT;    PIPELINE SAFETY AGENCY DEFENDED AS 'DEDICATED FEDERAL EMPLOYEES'
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite mounting criticism, the government's Office
of Pipeline Safety is staffed by ``dedicated federal employees''
who are determined to make sure oil and natural gas pipelines are
safe, a top Transportation Department official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley S. Coyner, head of the department's Research and Special
Programs Administration, which includes the pipeline safety office,
said the government has invested too little in ensuring the safety
of the lines.
</P>
<P>
   But she rejected statements made during a two-day ``National
Pipeline Safety Reform Conference'' this week that the office has
taken a lax approach in regulation of the hundreds of thousands of
oil and natural gas pipelines under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have are a core group of people who have made a choice
for public service, who are dedicated federal employees and who
have worked hard to prevent damage to the environment and damage to
people,'' Coyner said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not agree that the pipeline safety office has not
contributed strongly to ensuring the safe transportation of natural
gas and petroleum products,'' she added. ``I think the safety
record speaks for itself. There has been a steady decline in the
number of releases'' of gasoline, oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she did ``agree with them in terms that we must
give state and federal inspectors the tools they need to ensure
that pipelines are safe and that the funding levels are too low.''
</P>
<P>
   At the pipeline reform conference, environmentalists, community
representatives and state and local officials expressed skepticism
at the government's safety statistics and anger over accidents
involving pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was organized largely because of a gasoline pipeline
explosion that killed two boys and a teen-aged fly fisherman in
Bellingham, Wash., last year.
</P>
<P>
   A federal investigation of the accident is under way and,
according to speakers at the conference, several employees of the
owner of the pipeline, Olympic Pipeline Co., invoked Fifth
Amendment rights against self-incrimination when questioned by
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of conference speakers from Florida to Alaska warned of
environmental damage from pipeline spills and unseen leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration this week proposed new legislation to
improve pipeline safety and strengthen the authority of local and
state officials to police the lines.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was announced by Vice President Al Gore, the
expected Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pipeline safety legislation that the vice president has
proposed will raise the level of resources not only for the federal
government, but for states as well to make sure pipelines are
safe,'' Coyner said.

   More smoke than fire here, but Russell Crowe, the hunky,

the film's script cynically bashes George Bush's political stance,
its visuals pop with energy. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Happy, Texas'' (PG-13) _ A one-joke movie, and it's not a
good joke. Jeremy Northam and Steve Zahn play escaped convicts who
hide out in a small town, posing as a gay couple who stage beauty
pageants. What follows is a tepid romance between Northam and a
local beauty (who of course thinks he's ``harmless''), and some
funny shots of Zahn teaching toddlers to pose and dance. But it
wears out its welcome fast. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Minus Man'' (R) _ Not many pluses. An affable drifter
(Owen Wilson) moves to a small town and insinuates himself into the
lives of the residents. Trouble is, he's also a serial killer. The
idea of a compulsive killer as a freaky cipher who, if anything,
seems too normal is intriguing, but the film is as flat and
affectless as Wilson's performance. After a point, you kind of hope
Wilson will kill again, just to pick things up. Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Superstar'' (PG-13) _ Whaddya know _ a ``Saturday Night
Live'' big-screen transfer that doesn't bite. As the ebullient
Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher, Molly Shannon
delivers a memorable mix of adolescent brazenness and
self-mortification. It's clear the actress loves this character,
but she's never afraid to push the envelope of outrageousness,
whether talking baby-talk to her own breasts, or fantasizing that a
tree (or a handy stop sign) is her fantasy lover. Grade: B+

 &HT;    Much to `Like' (but women get no respect)

   &QR;  RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Water for Chocolate''
</P>
<P>
   Common. MCA. 16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The fourth album by Chicago-based rapper Common is probably the
first hip-hop album to come out this year that's really worth
buying. But there's an asterisk at the end of that statement.
Musically, ``Like Water for Chocolate'' is not unlike R&AMP;B singer
D'Angelo's atmospheric and involving current CD, ``Voodoo.'' Which
shouldn't be surprising considering D'Angelo and much of his
``Voodoo'' accompaniment _ Roy Hargrove on trumpet, ?uestlove on
drums _ appear throughout this similarly strong effort. Lyrically,
though, ``Like'' could take you back a beat or two. Particularly if
you remember the even-toned Common who joined rapper/singer Lauryn
Hill to craft the incredibly thoughtful take on abortion, ``I Used
To Love H.E.R.'' Here, there are occasional references to women
(``The Heat,'' ``A Film Called Pimp'') that are so offensive, even
the well-written and seemingly genuine paean to the fairer sex,
``The Light,'' doesn't smooth away those stings. Not completely,
anyway.

 &HT;    Trademark sound on a roll
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No Doubt vocalist Gwen Stefani was the ``it'' girl several years
ago. She and her band made a big splash with 1995's
multi-million-selling ``Tragic Kingdom,'' the quartet's third
album. Anticipation is high for this much-delayed follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   These Southern Californians got together in the late 1980s, and
their chronological roots show. The ska and new wave influences are
still as pervasive as they were on ``Tragic Kingdom.'' The grunge
hangover of the mid-'90s left audiences ready for No Doubt's
sprightly sound, and the band doesn't mess with success.
</P>
<P>
   From the punky chug of lead track ``Ex-Girlfriend'' to the
squiggly synthesizer unpinning ``Six Feet Under,'' No Doubt drags
new wave into the new millennium. If '80s nostalgia were all they
had, though, they'd never have bothered the charts at all. Tom
Dumont tosses off understated, inventive guitar riffs, the melodies
flow effortlessly and the rhythm section keeps everything moving
forward with abandon. Like Blondie before them, the boys in the
band rarely get the credit they deserve. Debbie Harry and Stefani
attract all the attention, but both were blessed with powerhouse
bands.
</P>
<P>
   Stefani gets plenty of attention for her lyrics, too. Her
honesty borders on too much information, but her unpretentious
soul-baring is one of her more endearing qualities. Still, do we
really need to hear, as she sings in ``Bathwater,'' ``I still love
to wash in your old bathwater''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Return of Saturn'' finds No Doubt more mature and worldly, but
surprisingly unperturbed by success. It's the sound of a band
that's just getting better at what it does.

 &HT;    Fried eggs
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was in culinary school, I learned the cheffy French
method of scrambling eggs: whisk them with cream in a metal mixing
bowl and then plate the bowl over a pot of simmering water,
whisking constantly until you end up
</P>
<P>
   with eggs so creamy, they're just this side of a custard. Hmm.
They are fancy, but to my American palate, eating these eggs is
like sitting down to a bowl of whole-milk ricotta when you really
want some 4 percent cottage cheese. Large curd, natch.
</P>
<P>
   I love scrambled eggs with large, loose, wavy curds. You get
these by pushing the eggs in the pan rather than whisking. Also,
water works far better than cream at giving the eggs the light,
soft consistency I crave.

 &HT;    McDonald doing music on his own via the Internet
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to poke fun at one-time Doobie Brother Michael
McDonald. His throaty vocals on hits such as ``On My Own'' helped
'70s rock artists (such as Sting) evolve into the kingpins of
today's jazz-influenced, adult-contemporary music.
</P>
<P>
   It was this sound that prompted Trey Parker, creator of the
irreverent animated television series ``South Park,'' to recruit
McDonald as perhaps the most unlikely participant in the bawdy film
``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut.'' In a moment of self-parody,
the singer/songwriter planted tongue firmly in cheek to record the
movie's closing tune, ``Through the Eyes of a Child,'' a gushy
ballad meant to skewer every closing credit anthem ever written.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little reluctant to do it, but when they told me it
was a spoof on artists like myself, it sounded kind of funny,''
McDonald says, calling from his car phone, somewhere on the road
between Nashville and his home in a rural suburb. ``My kids are
still not letting me live that one down _ but I don't even let them
watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridge to a new audience
</P>
<P>
   The ``South Park'' cameo was just the beginning of an unlikely
midlife resurgence for the 48-year-old McDonald, who is playing
Atlanta's Roxy tonight. After seven years without an album _ and at
a time when many acts his age are content cashing royalty checks _
the gray-haired singer has decided to try to shake up the music
business a bit.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald and actor Jeff Bridges have decided to start their own
label, Ramp Records. The company's first two releases: a
left-of-center album from Bridges (``Be Here Soon'') and a new CD
of R&AMP;B tunes from McDonald (``Blue Obsession'').
</P>
<P>
   ``We get these dark periods where everything sounds alike, very
formulated,'' McDonald says. ``Then a wild card pops up, such as FM
radio or Internet access, and the audience eats it up. Think about
the artists we grew up with. Who would have heard of Country Joe &AMP;
the Fish or Buffalo Springfield if not for FM radio? The Internet
will serve the same purpose. It's going to make young people privy
to a lot more artists.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era dominated by rap and hip-hop, McDonald has created a
sizzling R&AMP;B album in the tradition of Marvin Gaye and Stevie
Wonder. Fueled by the hot hum of a B3 organ, sassy horns and backup
singers who sound like the Sweet Inspirations, the album is
definitely out of step with today's radio playlists. But McDonald
hopes that Ramp Records, through an Internet presence
(www.ramprecords
</P>
<P>
   .com), can reach audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges' album, which McDonald helped produce, is certainly an
example of the kind of musical experimentation that rarely reaches
the mainstream. On the nine tracks (six he wrote himself), the
actor's voice wobbles from John Belushi sendup soul to artsy chants
borrowed from David Byrne. The lyrics also dwell on noncommercial
themes, from Bill Clinton's sexuality to self-doubt. But it was
Bridges' quirky approach that enticed McDonald to return to the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff, as a songwriter, impressed me greatly. I play on a lot
of records, and this doesn't sound a whole lot like anything else.
His songs have humor and intelligence. He brings a certain
unconventional taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Can two graying baby boomers change the music business?
</P>
<P>
   McDonald says he just hopes for one thing _ ``That the public
gets a chance to decide for themselves.''
</P>

 &HT;    Excitement awaits in caper flicks
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good caper movie is hard to find. Hard to make, too. That's
probably why pictures like ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' or this
week's new Paul Newman film, ``Where The Money Is,'' usually find
an appreciative audience. Here are a few more clever flicks about
clever folks whose only real fault is a weakness for taking things
that don't belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Topkapi'': Long before Tom Cruise dangled from the ceiling
in ``Mission: Impossible,'' this classic heist film pulled off the
same heart-stopping stunt. An international cast, led by Melina
Mercouri, Maximilian Schell and Peter Ustinov, teams up to steal a
priceless jewel-encrusted dagger from a well-protected Turkish
museum (the title comes from the name of the museum). Another bit
of larceny: Ustinov took the best supporting actor Oscar away from
favorites Stanley Holloway (``My Fair Lady'') and John Gielgud
(``Becket'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``How to Steal a Million'': Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole,
two of the most talented and beautiful people ever to grace a movie
screen, dabble in a little art thievery. The top-notch supporting
cast includes Hugh Griffith, Eli Wallach and Charles Boyer.
Director William Wyler, whose credits range from ``Wuthering
Heights'' to ``Ben-Hur,'' pretty much summed up the film when,
before shooting began, he noted, ``We may not have the best script
in the world, but we're going first class.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Gambit'': Shirley MacLaine had been given carte blanche to
choose her leading man for this glossy bit of fluff about a cat
burglar and a dancer who steal a statue from a reclusive
billionaire. Having just seen ``The Ipcress File,'' she chose
Michael Caine and thus was responsible for bringing him to
Hollywood. In her memoir, ``My Lucky Stars,'' she wrote that Caine
was, for all his partying, one of the hardest-working actors she'd
ever met. She also noted that, as he cut a swath through
Hollywood's female population, his major complaint was pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sneakers'': A surprising fizzle in theaters, this is just
the sort of neat-o movie that deserves a second life on video. A
ragtag team of techno-whizzes, who specialize in foiling security
systems, is sent on a government-mandated mission to steal a
mysterious black box. Robert Redford is the gang's smooth-operator
leader, with Sidney Poitier as his right-hand man, a former CIA
agent. Dan Aykroyd is appropriately dorky as a conspiracy geek;
David Straithairn is a blind audio genius; and the late River
Phoenix, playing a teenage hacker, shows some of what made him so
special. The director, Phil Alden Robinson (``Field of Dreams''),
fills the movie with countercultural humor and some
state-of-the-art fake-outs. In many ways, this is a better
``Mission: Impossible'' than the Cruise version.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Big Deal on Madonna Street'': Not all caper flicks are airy,
debonair affairs. Take, for example, this broadly comic Italian
picture, which focuses on a stunningly inept gang of burglars who
bumble their way through a store robbery. In a sense, the movie,
which nabbed a best foreign language film nomination, is a sendup
of the caper genre. But it works on more than just a satirical
level, in that it makes us care for its misbegotten would-be
thieves. Marcello Mastroianni, who plays one of the gang's leaders,
signed on mostly as a favor to his former theatrical colleague
Vittorio Gassman. The filmmakers figured that Mastroianni's star
power would give the film some needed box office insurance. Decades
later, Bob Fosse tried to remake it as a Broadway musical, but the
result was a resounding flop.

 &HT;    Eggs make a comeback
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Beat egg whites until stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've mastered this technique, you've got the foundation
for some of the world's most impressive dishes, from souffles, to
roulades, to meringues, to mousses, to angel food cakes.
</P>
<P>
   You needn't be intimidated. It's just a matter of timing.
Whether you use an electric mixer or _ if you've got the muscles
for it _ a hand whisk, what you are looking for is soft white peaks
with a satiny sheen that stand up when you lift the beater. If you
go overboard and whisk in too much air, the foam bubbles will burst
and the whites will have a lumpy, curdled appearance.
</P>
<P>
   A few other tips from ``The Good Egg'':
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use room-temperature eggs for greater volume.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When separating eggs, make sure no yolk gets into the white;
yolks contain fat, which can inhibit the foaming of beaten egg
whites. For the same reason, make sure the mixing bowl and beaters
are free of any grease.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add a pinch of cream of tartar to help stabilize the whites so
they won't lose their volume and smooth texture if slightly
overbeaten.

   Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven
to 400 degrees. Generously butter a 6-cup souffle dish. Sprinkle
lightly with bread crumbs, shaking the dish to coat evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the flour
and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in
the milk and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook, stirring
constantly, for 3 minutes more. Stir in the mustard, salt and
pepper to taste. Remove from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until blended. Whisk in a
little of the white sauce to temper the eggs, then add the
remaining sauce, whisking until blended. Stir in the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Place the egg whites in a large bowl, add the cream of tartar
and beat slowly with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.
Increase the speed to high and beat until the peaks are stiff and
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Using a rubber spatula, transfer about one-third of the egg
whites to the cheese mixture and gently fold in until blended. Add
the remaining whites to the cheese mixture and gently fold until
blended. Pour into the prepared dish.
</P>
<P>
   Put the souffle in the oven and reduce the oven temperature to
375 degrees. Bake until puffed and golden, 30 to 35 minutes. If you
like your souffle firm in the center, bake it for 5 minutes more.

<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 35
minutes Cooling time: 4 hours
</P>
<P>
   Egg yolks are used for the curd filling and egg whites for the
meringue in this twist on the classic lemon meringue pie. The
updated meringue technique is based on the American Egg Board's
recommendation for safe handling of egg whites. Look for the
premade crust in the baking aisle of your local grocery store, or
prepare as directed on a package of chocolate cookie crumbs.

<P>
   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>

</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon water
</P>
<P>
   Combine 1 cup of the sugar with cornstarch and salt in 4-quart
saucepan. Whisk in 1 1/2 cups of the orange juice and the lemon
juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture
thickens and sugar is completely dissolved, 10 minutes. Remove from
heat; whisk in butter. Stir in egg yolks and remaining orange
juice. Return to heat; simmer, continuing to whisk constantly,
until mixture is very thick, about 5 minutes. Pour into prepared
shell; cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine egg whites, remaining 1/2 cup
sugar, cream of tartar and water in top of double boiler. Cook over
simmering water, beating with portable mixer on medium speed, until
whites reach a temperature of 160 degrees, about 10 minutes. Pour
into large bowl; beat on high speed until whites stand in soft
peaks, about 2 minutes. Spread meringue on top of cooled filling,
covering filling completely.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 8-10 minutes, until meringue is golden. Chill until set,
about 3 hours. _From the Chicago Tribune

 &HT;    Protein source regains its spot at mealtime
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend, who's trying to lose weight and get her blood sugar
back in whack, came back from an appointment with her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to eat more eggs,'' she said matter of factly. ``At
least three times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's the kind of irony that hits you like a pie in the
face: doctors prescribing eggs. How are you supposed to take them:
with a vodka chaser, a chaw of Skoal and a quick spritz of Agent
Orange?
</P>
<P>
   Aren't eggs _ high in cholesterol and teeming with bacteria _
considered by health professionals the worst of the worst?
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Recent studies have shown eggs aren't nearly as hard
on the arteries as once believed. In ``Eating Well for Optimum
Health'' (Knopf), Dr. Andrew Weil writes that the inclusion of eggs
in the diet actually ``makes an insignificant contribution to serum
cholesterol'' but provides ``an important source of the scarce
essential fatty acids.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the bacterial threat, better inspection programs have
resulted in fewer cases of illnesses related to salmonella in eggs.
And pasteurized eggs will be test marketed on the East Coast this
spring, making raw eggs once again safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have been quick to make amends. Thanks in part to
high-protein diets like my friend's, egg sales are the highest
they've been in 15 years. There are even several new cookbooks
solely devoted to egg recipes, such as ``The Good Egg: More Than
200 Fresh Approaches From Soup to Dessert'' by Marie Simmons
(Houghton Mifflin). Imagine that. Stylish, guilt-free eggs for
dinner. Spaghetti with tomato sauce, fried eggs and prosciutto.
Life is good.
</P>
<P>
   To fully appreciate the myriad eggy virtues, we need to master a
few basic techniques. As anyone who cooks for a family knows, a
million things can happen to an egg once you crack it into a hot
pan, and everyone has a personal preference. For one of my kids I
poach eggs. For another daughter I have a proprietary system for
``frambling'' eggs _ starting them as fried eggs, then breaking the
yolks and tossing them into a gooey strata of yellow and white. The
third will eat any egg cooked any way in bubbling butter.
</P>
<P>
   Even the basic fried egg is protean. Cooked over a gentle flame
and never allowed to brown, it becomes the ideal candidate for over
easy _ the white soft and slippery, the yolk pale and gushy.
</P>
<P>
   Now turn up the heat and the white gets tough, its albumin
congealing quickly and unpleasantly, pocked with bubbles. But turn
up the heat full force, and the white browns, becoming the crisp,
lacy basket for an avatar of sunny-side-up perfection.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just a simple fried egg for breakfast. Eggs leaven
cakes and souffles. Eggs emulsify oils in sauce. Eggs are so
versatile the word ``versatile'' barely begins to do them justice.
Let's take a look.

 &HT;    Egg whites make this cake a lightweight
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Josephine Debnar of Roswel, Ga., fondly recalls
chiffon cakes popular in the 1960s and '70s, and asked for a
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to angel food and sponge cakes, chiffon cakes rely on
eggs for lightness and air. But they are the richest of the three
because they include oil, which is incorporated into the batter,
and then added to beaten egg whites carefully so the air whipped
into the whites is not lost.
</P>
<P>
   This basic cake is from the 11th edition of ``Better Homes and
Gardens New Cookbook'' and has been published here before.

 &HT;    Scrambled eggs
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Egg-in-a-Hole
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, my brother, Wayne, wouldn't lift a finger in the
kitchen, though as I recall he ate well and quite a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcia, make me an egg-in-a-hole,'' I still hear him pleading.
</P>
<P>
   But that was more years ago than either of us cares to remember,
supplanted only recently by a delightful discovery. Wayne now cooks
eggs-in-a-hole at his Roswell, Ga., home about once a week when
he's not on the road, but he also holds forth at the stove managing
a couple of hot skillets for a 36-egg-in-a-hole brunch in
Charleston with a dozen tennis-playing buddies every spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My secret is that I use more butter than anybody in the
world,'' he claims, a fact to which his wife, Mary, attests. ``I
put lots in the pan, then butter one side of the bread, then tear a
hole the size of a yolk in the bread.''
</P>
<P>
   The round-top squishy white bread goes buttered-side-up into the
skillet full of hot melted butter. Then he cracks an egg into the
hole and fries that side. When it's good and crispy, he flips it,
adds a few shakes of Tabasco sauce and salt and pepper, then pokes
a couple of holes in the yolk so it will cook through, and fries
until that side is crispy. ``Because I'm cooking so many, I cook
them the way I like them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot with Bloody Marys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get much better than that,'' Wayne says, noting
that his cooking secrets are the only secrets that he will divulge
about the tennis-week gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Fried egg sandwich
</P>
<P>
   Our grandmother was the first to make eggs-in-a-hole for us, but
Wayne was the one who appreciated the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I am not a particularly particular eater, but to me eggs
are simple: They should be white and yellow and never, ever brown.
An egg left to brown turns into a completely different animal to my
taste. It's like burning the toast. And since eggs are just about
as cheap as toast, you just have to give them to the dog or the
brother and start over.
</P>
<P>
   But a fried egg that stays white and yellow, now that is a work
of art. Many's the night I've feasted on my all-time favorite
sandwich, perfected after I learned how to fry a brownless egg:
</P>
<P>
   Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low
heat. Crack an egg into the pan and reduce heat to low. Sprinkle
with black pepper. Cook slowly until all the white is set and
bright white. Flip egg, then poke the yolk to break so it will cook
through. Top with a slice of Swiss cheese. Sprinkle with a teaspoon
of cold water, cover with a lid that leaves room for steam to
escape and cook 3 to 4 minutes or until yellow is cooked through,
cheese is melted and nothing is brown. Put egg on one slice of
white bread. Spread second slice of bread with 1/2 tablespoon
Miracle Whip salad dressing, swirl on about 1 teaspoon ketchup, add
a leaf of dark green lettuce, close sandwich and open mouth.

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Bluffton, S.C.
 &HT;    Palmetto State town booming, but charm remains
 &HT;    By Susan Soper
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUFFTON, S.C. _ Gone are the days when you could blow through
Bluffton en route to Hilton Head beaches and barely slow down. It's
no longer just a drive-through speed trap with quaint curb appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are discovering what we always knew we had _ and tried
to hide,'' says Babbie Guscio, a lifelong Blufftonian sometimes
called the mother of Bluffton (as well as social director, event
planner and owner of the Store). ``Bluffton is like what the gold
rush in California must have been like: `There's gold in them thar
hills!'''
</P>
<P>
   In the past couple of years, growth and development have gone
what some call ``berserk,'' and that means commerce can't be far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's all relative. S.C. 46, also known as May River Road,
which leads into the one-square-mile town (population 800) can't
compare with U.S. 41 heading north into Marietta, Ga. But Bluffton,
settled in 1825 as a summer resort on the banks of the lush May
River, is booming. (The town has recently annexed 22,000 acres of
undeveloped property, making it the fifth-largest and least
populated town in South Carolina.)
</P>
<P>
   There wouldn't be Wall Street Journal boxes in the grocery store
parking lot if there weren't bags of money nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the Talmadge Bridge from Savannah in 1926
was the first development to have a major impact on Bluffton _
ending trade by water in the riverside town and turning it into a
summer getaway. The nearby retirement community Sun City Hilton
Head has also had a big impact: It has brought to the area more
than 1,300 households of the 8,000 planned.
</P>
<P>
   While on one hand Blufftonians may groan that their peaceful
place is unalterably changing, their other hands are out to welcome
new settlers and visitors and accept their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get people coming from all over the world, timing their
arrival and departure so as not to get in the mess surrounding
Hilton Head,'' says potter Jacob Preston. ``People who want to see
what actual South Carolina is like. And they're usually pleasantly
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   While strolling through Bluffton we discovered ...
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Store has been in continuous use for almost 100 years,
over 20 of them as ``a stylish state of mind'' run by Babbie
Guscio. Find reproduction weathervanes like the red enameled goat
($140), objets d'art, costume jewelry, china, lamps. April through
September, fresh produce and homemade baked goods are sold in the
front yard. 56 Calhoun St. 843-757-3855
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eggs 'n Tricities is sometimes called ``the Bloomingdale's of
Bluffton.'' Items include a wooden bench ($750) _ a perfect perch
from which to watch the comings and goings at ``Eggs,'' a former
gas station filled with doodads (a cherry-painted lunch box, $31);
clothes (Flax, Bluefish, Marteeni); folk art (a carved wood
chicken, left, $40); and jewelry. 71 Calhoun St. 843-757-3446. &QR;  Red
Stripe Gallery is really an outdoor collection of motorcycles
serendipitously assembled from odds and ends by
builder-welder-artist Bill Sease. 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays. 59
Calhoun St. 843-837-2318. &QR;  Crossroads Fine Art &AMP; Framing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much development and new houses mean empty walls,'' says
Jon Nelson, assistant manager of Crossroads Fine Art &AMP; Framing.
``More and more people are finding us on their way to Hilton
Head.'' Original art, prints, gifts. ``Canopy II'' by Jon Nelson
($625). 107 Towne Center, Mellichamp Road. 843-757-5551. &QR;  Jacob
Preston Gallery, the former Bluffton Tabernacle, is now home,
studio and gallery to the Lowcountry's premier potter. If you stop
by for a soup tureen, bowl or platter and he's not around, don't
miss the note he leaves: ``Hello, I had to leave. Please help
yourself. Leave check or note. Thanks, Jacob.'' Semi-glazed and
oxided high-fire stoneware jar ($350). 10 Church St. 843-757-3084. &QR; 
Stock Farm Antiques Center houses several antiques vendors
including May River Designs (hand-painted red folk art lamp, $315),
with rugs, huntboards, rockers, porcelains, planters and art.
1263-B May River Road. 843-757-8046.If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From Atlanta, take I-75 south to I-16 east at
Macon to I-95. Go north on I-95 to Exit 8, U.S. 278, and follow
that to S.C. 46, Bluffton Road. The intersection of 46 and Calhoun
is the commercial and historic heart of Bluffton.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Generally, shops are open 10 a.m.-6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most stores are on one level, with few if
any steps.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: A few stores have parking lots; otherwise, park on
the street.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Area restaurants, filling stations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Heyward House, 52 Boundary St. 843-757-6293.Where
to stay
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any overnight accommodations in the one-square-mile
town yet, but chances are you will be heading for Savannah
(Convention and Visitors Bureau, 1-877-728-2662) or Hilton Head
Island (Visitor and Convention Bureau, 1-800-523-3373). Beaufort
and Charleston are also close enough for a day trip to Bluffton.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   As you pass through town, Squat 'n Gobble practically jumps into
the road at you, but if you're looking for more than Silver
Skillet-type fare, there are other spots to choose from.

Episcopal church is on the National Register of Historic Places and

 &HT;    Taking the breast cancer message to African-Americans
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Karen Jackson was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer
seven years ago, she emerged from the ordeal with not only a good
prognosis but a commitment to changing the future for other
African-American women. She realized that much more needed to be
done to decrease breast cancer mortality rates of African-American
women. While whites develop breast cancer at higher rates than
blacks, the death rate for African-American women is 22 percent
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, of Houston, founded Sisters Network Inc., a nonprofit
organization with 1,000 members (all breast cancer survivors) and
25 chapters across the country. Its national conference is in
Atlanta Friday through Sunday. Staff writer Patricia Guthrie spoke
with Jackson as she prepared for ``The Journey to Healing and
Wholeness'' conference.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lack of early detection of the cancer is one of the main
reasons given for the mortality disparity between black and white
women. But there are numerous educational campaigns about the
importance of getting mammograms and doing breast self-exams. Why
does early detection remain such a problem among African- American
women?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because as much as people think there is a lot of information
out there, it's not really getting to the people most in need.
There are numerous reasons for the disparity, such as not as much
access to what's available. Also, things are in place
institutionally that don't work for us. We know African-American
women are dying from breast cancer at an earlier age, yet the
recommended age for having the first mammogram is age 40. So, if
you're under 40, and you're African-American, and you feel a lump,
you will be told you're too young for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What more could be done?
</P>
<P>
   A: Making people aware. As a breast cancer survivor, and being
with an African-American group, African-American women do stop and
listen. They do hear the message as: `This could be you.' Early
detection does work, also, and we need to do more to help dispel
the fear that when you go in and find out about cancer, you die.
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters Network Inc. conference at the Renaissance Concourse
Hotel features workshops and panel discussions, Friday through
Sunday. $150 for three days or $100 for Saturday; includes
breakfast, lunch and banquet; register at the door. Information on
Sisters Network: 1-713-781-0255; Atlanta chapter, 770-469-0343, or

   Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to help you
locate it. But because of the volume of mail, we cannot track down
every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the column
will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag. Write
us at Buyer's Edge Find It,The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, P.O.
Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at buyersedge(at)ajc.com
(please include your name, the city you live in and daytime phone
number); or call 404-582-7642.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you find earring replacement backs? I used to find them
at beauty superstores, but no longer.
</P>
<P>
   _Sharon Hart, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Our back was to the wall, but we managed to find these
replacement earring backs at Michaels Arts and Crafts, at the
location in Mall Corners Shopping Center, 2131 Pleasant Hill Road,
Suite 200, Duluth (770-813-8328). Crafting Expressions makes a
variety of backs ($2.99 a package) including stainless steel or
gold butterfly styles as well as silver-and-plastic or
gold-and-plastic backs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where in metro Atlanta can I find Mr. Muscle? It is a very
good cleaner on stoves and grills. A friend of mine found it in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   _Addie Harkness, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: After a bit of searching, we flexed our muscles and came up
with Mr. Muscle, the oven and grill cleaner, at Atlanta Fixture &AMP;
Sales Co., 3185 Northeast Expressway, Chamblee (770-455-8844). A
19-ounce can is $3.98. Made by Drackett, a division of S.C.
Johnson, this cleaner is designed to work on cold surfaces. It
should not be used on continuous-clean or self-cleaning ovens, nor
should you let the product come in contact with floor coverings,
linoleum, copper, chrome, plastics or painted surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When stores advertise furniture, they very often show
artificial fruit on tables. It's a pretty, decorative touch, and I
would like to buy some apples and lemons, but so far, I can't find
any. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _Nancy
</P>
<P>
   Robinson,
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Now, your fruit will never go bad or be out of season. We
picked up our artificial fruit at Garden Ridge, 1887 Willow Trail
in Norcross (770-921-1833). In our 10-inch fruit bowl ($1.97) are
shiny red apples (88 cents each), a Golden Delicious apple ($1.98),
lemons (88 cents each), a large pear ($2.98) and frosted grapes
($3.88 a bunch).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find beignets, the little French doughnuts. We
had a little place here in Decatur that served them, but it went
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   _Ann Villwolk, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Beignets make a yummy treat, especially when served with cafe
au lait. The Cafe du Monde coffee stand in New Orleans has been
serving these tasty treats since 1862. A branch of the famous Cafe
du Monde is located at Underground Atlanta, 110 Lower Alabama St.
S.W. (404-681-2719). Three beignets are $1.45. There you can also
buy the beignet mix (28-ounce box, $2.75) and make your French
doughnuts at home. If you want to order the beignet mix via mail,
call 1-800-772-2927. Or visit the Web site at www.cafedumonde.com.
</P>
<P>
   Huey's, 1816 Peachtree St. N.W. (404-873-2037) also serves a
version of beignets. According to a spokesman, theirs are ``lighter
and fried in peanut oil.'' Three square beignets are $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About a year ago, I received a sample of a moisturizer for
oily skin from L'Oreal called ``Matify.'' It was an excellent
product, but I have not been able to find it in any store. Does the
company still make it?
</P>
<P>
   _Deborah Wilbanks, Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, L'Oreal no longer makes this particular
product. However, the company has come out with a replacement:
HydraFresh Moisturizer for oily skin (about $9). The moisturizer,
which is absorbed in a flash, is part of a skin-care regimen that
also contains a cleanser and toner (each about $5). It is available
at chain drugstores and mass market retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My family and I use Coast bath soap in the yellow wrapper.
Procter &AMP; Gamble says it doesn't make it anymore. I wondered if
anybody has a stock of it so we can buy it up.
</P>
<P>
   _Ed Woolbright, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are right. Procter &AMP; Gamble did discontinue the Sunspray
Scent of Coast soap in November. However, we stumbled on a cache at
Ingles Supermarket, 4815 Rockbridge Road, Stone Mountain
(404-299-0698) A pack of three bars of the deodorant soap is $1.89.

 &HT;    Day Spas: The Inside Story
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That collective ``ahhh'' you hear is from a team of 10
intrepid journalists who eagerly loaned our bodies to science _ the
science of relaxation. We fanned out from Kennesaw, Ga., to
Peachtree City, Ga., Atlanta to Lawrencub and a chair with
three-way massage feature, which feels great but is rather loud.
The treatment includes a paraffin wax dip, which is designed to
maximize the skin's ability to lock in moisture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE RESULTS: After an hour and 15 minutes of soaking,
sloughing, oiling and massaging in the capable hands of a young
woman named Susanne, my little piggies _ sporting Confucius Says
Coral from O.P.I.'s Far East Collection _ went ``oui, oui, oui''
all the way home. My peds felt downright silky, and my usually dry
heels felt soft as a baby's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Totally relaxing and satisfactory. I
l). Pregnancy massage ($65). A dozen facials including Aromatherapy
($70) and Sea Toning ($70). Sea Salt Glow ($45). Seaweed body wrap
($80). Spa manicure ($20). Sea spa foot treatment ($50).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE PRODUCTS: Skin care, cosmetic and aromatherapy products
used in treatments and sold here are generally formulated with pure
fruit, flower and herb essences. The Natural Body Spa Basics Face &AMP;
Body Care line is available. Other brands used and sold include
Aveda, the Thymes and Jurlique. There's a nice selection of Burt's
Bees products, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE AMBIENCE: Natural Body is known for its serene, New Age-y,
slightly funky atmosphere that is totally unpretentious. Lighting
is low; temperature just right; linens pristine. There's a peaceful
hush _ only the slightest hint of music in the background _
throughout the shop/waiting area and the treatment rooms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE TREATMENT: I tried the signature aromatherapy facial,
which included general cleansing, a hydrating masque and massage of
the face, head, neck and shoulders. Be aware that the one-hour
facial also includes ``extraction,'' shorthand for removal of the
gunk clogging up your pores. This can be slightly painful and is
controversial among some aestheticians because it can cause broken
capillaries, breakouts and scarring if done incorrectly. My
facialist asked lots of questions first, then used gloves and was
very gentle _ obviously well-trained.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE RESULTS: Floating for days afterward. My skin was left
soft, hydrated and with a pretty glow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE: A return trip is in order. Personnel
here are friendly in a quiet, gentle sort of way. Even though
Natural Body is also a store, there is no hard-sell when you leave
(despite the checklist of what you should be doing to your skin
each day). And the facial was unimpeachable.

   &QR;  HOURS: 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday-Saturday; 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SELECTED SERVICES : Hot stone massage ($85). Body massage ($65
for 60 minutes). Thermomineral mask facial ($89), pumpkin peel
($89). Seaweed wrap ($55), hydromassage tub (soak and massage
$57.50). French manicure ($21.50). Pedicure ($38). Body paraffin

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PRODUCTS: The spa has its own line of products for the face
and body. They also offer a variety of other lines as well as
candles and bath products.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  AMBIENCE: Contemporary with muted colors and subdued lighting.
A fountain flows in the lobby, where there is a check-in counter
and products displayed. The seats are comfortable and there is soft
music playing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE TREATMENT: Greeted promptly at my appointment time, I was
led to the cozy massage room. The stones _ actually lava that has
been tumbled perfectly smooth _ are kept in hot water. I was told
that this would be different from a more traditional Swedish or
sports massage in that it was more for relaxation than comfort for
sore muscles _ not as deep a massage as I was used to. First, I lay
face down and the massage therapist rubbed oil over my body to
allow the stones to move freely. Then he placed one stone, about 4
or 5 inches wide, at the base of my back and left it there to allow
the warmth to soak in. The stones varied in size from small pebbles
used on the face to about 5 or 6 inches across. After placing the
stone on my lower back, he proceeded to take a stone in each hand
and rub then across my back.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE RESULTS: The sensation of the warm, smooth stone gliding
across the oiled skin was wonderful and very relaxing. Some of the
stones were left in different places on my back while he smoothed
others along my neck and arms and legs. After I turned over onto my
back, he place one small, very cool pebble on each cheek and one
each on my chin and forehead. The small cool stones were very
soothing _ a nice contrast to the warm ones. For some reason, I was
very thirsty when it was over. No problem. I was greeted with a
cold glass of water on my way out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE BOTTOM LINE: At just about an hour, I felt like the
treatment was just a warmup. Unfortunately, he spent very little
time on my feet and none on my hands. More time spent rubbing the
warm, smooth stones over my feet would have greatly added to the
experience. Overall though, the treatment was very relaxing _
almost meditative.

<P>
   Park Place, 4505 Ashford-Dunwoody Road. 770-393-8303,
www.donshaw.com
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  HOURS: 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays; 9 a.m.-5 p.m.
Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SELECTED SERVICES: Spa Glow ($35). Seaweed Scrub with Vichy
Shower ($70). Seaweed Wrap with Hydro Tub ($70). Mud Wrap with
Hydro Tub ($70). Herbal Wrap ($35). Hydrotherapy Tub ($35).
Cellulite Treatment ($90). Aromatheraphy Steam Shower ($15). Single
Massage, one hour ($60).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE PRODUCTS: The spa has its own line of products for the
body and face. Mud is imported from Austria, seaweed from France.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE AMBIENCE: A sleek, functional spa, perhaps like one in
Sweden, done in wood and chrome. When I arrived, I was immediately
led to a tiny room to completely undress (save for a paper string
bikini bottom) and handed a short white terry robe and plastic
chartreuse shower slides.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE TREATMENT: Mud wrap with hydro tub. The combo of mud, heat
and wrap is designed to help break down toxic deposits and make it
easier for the body to flush them away. (Some people think wraps
help them lose weight and inches as well, but this is subject to
debate.) First, aesthetician Sheryl Kedziora slathered black,
mineral-rich Moor mud all over my body. Next, with my arms at my
side, she wrapped me tightly, like a mummy, in a plastic sheet,
then a solar wrap (cellophane with a rubber back) and finally a
blanket heated to about 60 degrees. After applying a moistened
towel to my forehead, she lowered the lights, put on music from New
Ager Ottmar Liebert and left me to relax and sweat for 20 minutes.
By the end, I was feeling a bit claustrophobic.
</P>
<P>
   After the allotted time, Kedziora peeled off the layers and led
me to a ``wet'' room. The warm hydrotheraphy tub uses massage
therapy to relax your body. I was handed a pair of gloves and soap
to wipe off the mud and left alone for 25 minutes. The finishing
touches? Avocado lotion for my body, a glass of icy mineral water
and a cup of energy mix.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE RESULTS: I felt quite relaxed after my treatment. And my
skin was soothed and softened. But I didn't lose inches or pounds
and frankly, I don't know if any nasty toxins were pulled out of my
body or not.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE: I would not do the mud wrap again. I
just didn't see or feel any benefits. But I would go to the spa for
a water massage, an aromatheraphy steam shower or for an hour
massage.

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE PRODUCTS: For face and body the spa uses MD Formulations,
YonKa and O.P.I. nail products.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE AMBIENCE: Traditional styling with touches of Southern
flair_ emerald greens, lace and magnolias. Greeted right on time by
Theresa for my 10 a.m. Wednesday appointment, I am led to the body
treatment room. Shell-like wall sconces glow with an amber hue,
new-age music plays softly in the background, and two aromatherapy
candles burn with a heavenly scent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE TREATMENT: I chose a European Seaweed Body Treatment
designed to tone muscles and remove toxins. Fearing that my
sensitive skin might make me look like lobster girl, I came by the
day before for a test patch _ which Theresa was more than willing
to do. At that time she thoroughly explained the procedure and
assured my modest self that although undressed, I would be covered
the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   She left me to settle in and returned with a knock. Undraping
only a small part of the body at a time, she slathered on warm
green seaweed. Then she wrapped a towel and mylar sheet around me
and tucked me in. She said to shout if felt at all claustrophobic,
which strangely I didn't. While in my makeshift papoose, Theresa
began massaging my face, neck and head pressure points. Slowly
pulling me up, she wrapped me in more towels and led me to the
shower across the empty hallway. I returned to a glass of water,
and fresh sheets on the table. I climbed in and after a knock, she
came in and smoothed lotion all over me.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE RESULTS: Relaxed? Beyond relaxed, I was mush. I couldn't
really feel the toxins taking mass exodus, but my skin did feel
smoother for a few days and I felt oh so pampered.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE: A spa neophyte, I was pleasantly
surprised with the whole spa experience. I have already made
another appointment _ this time for a massage.

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE PRODUCTS: Pevonia Botanica used exclusively for spa
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE AMBIENCE: This place makes the case for never judging a
spa by its cover. From the street it looks like a tiny house that
might serve as a spa only for Liliputians. However, the interior is
deceptively spacious and lush, the staff as down to earth as one
could hope.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE TREATMENT: First, I indulged in a manicure capped by a
paraffin wax dip. Once my cuticles were snipped and nail technician
Nhan Vu massaged my hands and forearms with a brisk exfoliating
scrub, I was ushered past a small, plush waiting alcove to a
treatment room for the wax mixture. The bottle green melted wax was
scented with fragrant oils and I was surprised at how good it felt
as I plunged my hands into the warm, liquid wax. After three quick
dips, my hands were immediately placed in plastic bags and Vu
whisked me back to her manicure table where she stuffed my hands
into hot mitts. After about 10 minutes, she slipped the wax off as
easily as if she were peeling off a pair of gloves. The wax, which
acts as a lavish moisturizer, made my hands feel postiively dewy.
For my second treatment, I had an aromatherapy scalp massage.
Massage therapist and foot reflexologist Sue Ann Schlesinger dimmed
the lights and left me in the room with the soft glow from a
perfumed candle and low music in the background. She'd instructed
me to undress from the waist up and slip under the covers of the
massage table. Oil scented with extracts including lavander was
massaged onto my neck and shoulders, then the therapist worked her
way to my head, slowly massaging my temples and scalp. After about
40 minutes of this coddling, I was left alone to dress, then
offered a glass of cold water.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE RESULTS: Wonderful. I felt as limp as a boneless cat as I
was led to a shampoo bowl where someone washed and blow dried my
hair.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE: As Arnold said, ``I'll be back.''

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE TREATMENT: The Sanctorum sound and aroma therapy, one hour
for $45. I am led into a large, forest green room upstairs and
seated in a gray leather chair that resembles an oversize,
ergonomically curved shoe insole. The spa director, Brooke
Robertson, hands me a pair of headphones, places a few drops of
``Tranquility Blend'' oil into an aromatherapy evaporator and pops
a CD into the player. As she leaves the room, I am enveloped in the
sounds of rain and thunder, and in the smells of lemon and
lavendar. Suddenly, I feel the thunder in my legs _ a series of
woofers within the chair is sending rhythmic vibrations directly
into parts of my body. Native American-style drums erupt, and I
feel their pulse in my neck and lower back. The visceral soundtrack
prods me with upbeat, insistent percussion, then later bathes me in
tranquil New Age keyboard washes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE RESULTS: Nirvana. (The state of mind, not the band.) The
vibrations warmed and soothed my neck, legs, back and other
stressed-out body points. The dramatic music focused my mind away
from work and traffic and I entered a floating, dreamlike state.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Anyone who has ever put on a CD to
relax after a hard day at the office will love this: It's like
being inside the music. Guest can arrange to bring their own CD,
but the spa recommends their own carefully orchestrated treatment.
So do I. This is one musical experience that will leave your body
and mind in complete harmony.

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  AMBIENCE: The decorating style is no-frills modern in white,
black and blue. The lighting in the main waiting area is rather
bright because of the light that streams in from the large
storefront windows. Black leather sofas are positioned opposite
product display cases along the front wall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE TREATMENT: I chose the sugar glow bath and massage package
called the spa retreat. The mixture (sugar, oil and bath gel)
exfoliates the skin, leaving it softened and moisturized. First, I
was led to a massage room where I put on a robe and slippers. Then
Melissa took me to the Vichy Shower Room where I stretched out on
an elevated table underneath a series of five shower heads. I
started out lying on my back and Melissa rubbed the mixture over
most of my body, rinsing it off with a strong stream of warm
water.Then she used the shower nozzles for a final head-to-toe
rinsing. Next, I flipped over to repeat the process. The scent of
rosemary was very pleasant and the roughness of the sugar granules
was invigorating on my skin. When she applied the mixture, the
massage techniques were so relaxing that her steady hand was a
welcome help when I had to get off the table.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 minutes later we went back to the massage room. I was
treated to a 60-minute massage as the sound of rain falling in a
thunderstorm played on a CD player.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE RESULTS: I was completely relaxed. I liked the tingly,
clean feeling I had after the bath and my skin felt soft from the
oils and lotions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE: The staff was very friendly and
helpful. The receptionist who answered my initial inquiry spent a
good deal of time with me on the phone, helping me decide what
service I'd enjoy the most. I would return for the same treatment,
something my sun-damaged skin would appreciate on a bimonthly
basis.

   &QR;  THE AMBIENCE: You wouldn't know the spa is right next to Key
Lime Pie's bustling retail store, it's so quiet, with walls draped
in heavy, neutral fabrics, dim lights, hot tea brewing and pastries
on the coffee table. New Age-style music is everpresent _
unfortunately, it was so loud in my treatment room I could barely
hear the therapist ask which aromatherapy scents I wanted blended
in my massage oil. My treatment room had exposed brick walls and
small windows open to let in the light. Would be a nice touch if
the spa were on a Tuscan hillside; unfortunately in this case, the
room overlooked (and I could overhear) a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE TREATMENT: A one-hour massage. Unlike many other spas, Key
Lime Pie doesn't outline a variety of treatments _ just a ``pure
full body massage.'' When asked why, the receptionist said ``you
just discuss it with your therapist.'' My therapist, however,
didn't offer me options (Swedish, deep tissue, etc.) but simply
asked why I had come in. I told him that basically I wanted a
massage, that my neck and upper back were tight. He said okay and
went to work, asking me if the pressure was alright. Because I've
had a lot of massages, I knew what I wanted, but had I been a
novice, I may have wanted more information up front.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE RESULTS: The massage was very good _ he had worked pretty
hard through some tight spots, but I felt relaxed,
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Good. Lots of pampering _ from people
bringing you water or tea to personalizing your own massage oil to
offers of the steam room and shower (complete with Aveda products)
after your session.

 &HT;    LABOR ACTIVISTS RALLY AGAINST CHINA TRADE PACT
 &HT;    By ALEC SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Capitol Hill echoed with shouts of ``No Blank Check
for China!'' as thousands of union activists Wednesday urged
Congress to oppose a landmark trade agreement with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary William Daley released a report
asserting that the measure, if approved, would benefit every state.
</P>
<P>
   The union demonstrators included members of the AFL-CIO, the
United Auto Workers, the United Steelworkers and the Teamsters.
Crowd estimates ranged from 5,000 to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   They are targeting the agreement, championed by President
Clinton, that would grant permanent normal trade relations to
China, whose trade status is currently subject to annual
congressional review. Clinton says the agreement, if approved by
Congress, would expand U.S. trade with China and pave the way for
its entry into the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions counter that the deal would benefit only corporate
interests and that hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs would be lost
to low-paid Chinese workers.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the
legislation the week of May 22, and the unions are determined to
round up enough votes _ mostly from undecided Democrats _ to defeat
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have enough votes to defeat it,'' said Teamsters
President James Hoffa, but he acknowledged that it will be a tough
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions oppose the trade bill because they believe that
China violates worker and human rights, shackles religious freedom,
pollutes the environment, and prohibits freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our workers are forced to compete with prison labor and
sweatshop workers making as little as 13 cents an hour. And while
we are losing hundreds of thousands of jobs, China is setting new
records for violations of human rights and polluting the
environment,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney told demonstrators at
a noontime rally on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared its approval when Sweeney added: ``Until there
is freedom of speech and freedom of association in China, until
there is freedom of religion and freedom to join unions in China,
there can be no permanent free trade agreement with China.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders spent the day lobbying members of Congress to vote
against the trade bill, focusing in particular on the undecided
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., spoke at the rally
and promised to carry organized labor's fight to his colleagues in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior is leading the effort in Congress to defeat the trade
bill. ``We're for an America that doesn't give the back of its hand
to people who work with their hands. With this agreement, some
people will get ahead. But the bottom line is that most of us stand
to get left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   He also asserted that China's current government does not
protect worker rights and personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rewarding a Chinese government that thumbs its nose at those
values would be the wrong choice for America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called the trade bill ``a 100% win for America.''
</P>
<P>
   In a White House statement released Tuesday, Clinton said
congressional rejection of the trade agreement ``would have
extremely harmful consequences for our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese will see rejection as a strategic decision by the
United States to turn from cooperation to confrontation, to deal
with China as an adversary,'' the president continued. He also said
rejection would embolden hard-liners in China's leadership. He
described them as ``the same forces most threatened by our
alliances with Japan and Korea, the same forces that want the
Chinese military to sell dangerous technologies and the same forces
that would pursue confrontation with Taiwan rather than dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the union leaders and several members of Congress said
Wednesday they believe that even if the deal passes, China will
renege on its share of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney noted that the United States has negotiated four trade
agreements with China, but he said ``China has repeatedly violated
all four agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior reiterated that theme as he asked the assembled crowd:
``Is it a 100% win for America when the Chinese government treats
the agreements they've already signed as if they're not worth the
paper they're written on?''
</P>
<P>
   The union activists are part of a coalition of group who will
stage anti-globalization protests in Washington through the weekend
as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank hold their
spring meetings. They are hoping to repeat the success of
protestors who disrupted World Trade Organizations meetings last
year in Seattle.

 &HT;    HEALTH CARE TAKES CENTER STAGE IN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    With GORE-PARDON. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What to do about the 44 million Americans who lack
health insurance emerged Wednesday as the latest battleground in
the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Vice
President Al Gore accused Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his
presumed Republican rival for the White House, of ``political
malpractice'' for proposing a tax credit of up to $2,000 a family
to help working people buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, finally Governor Bush said he wants to do something
about health care,'' Gore told the editors. He urged them to
carefully scrutinize the plan, which would cost the U.S. Treasury
about $40 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome him to the debate,'' Gore added. ``I hope he will
start by trying to enroll some of the hundreds of thousands of
uninsured children and families in his own state of Texas who have
no health insurance (and) who are legally eligible for it, but do
not have it because of the political malpractice of the Bush
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we believe what he says he would do nationally, when
we see what he has done as governor?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush made his second health care proposal in as many
days by announcing at a St. Louis campaign stop a $4.3 billion plan
to tighten the ``safety net'' for needy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's latest five-year proposal is aimed at helping uninsured
people in medically underserved and remote areas, such as
inner-city neighborhoods and rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult places to build a quality health care
facility are the very areas where the need is greatest and where
patients have the least ability to pay,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore remained mightily unimpressed, calling on the editors
to ``look closely at what Governor Bush proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been estimated that his plan costs about the same as
mine. Yet it covers about one-third as many people _ and only
one-tenth of the Americans who are uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked in St. Louis if he wanted to respond to Gore's attack,
Bush said: ``Not right now, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer brushed off the vice
president's comments, maintaining that the expected Republican
challenger has made progress in health care and the environment in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worse Al Gore is doing in the polls, the more he attacks
and misrepresents the governor's record,'' said Fleischer, buoyed
by new national surveys that show Bush once again taking the lead
against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon Al Gore will say he invented health care,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a broader plane, Gore, the presumptive Democratic
nominee told the editors that Bush ``wants us to believe he's
committed to issues like education, health care and the
environment. Let's face it. The Bush approach on these issues is a
headline without a story.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also said he would accept a
presidential-debate invitation from any newspaper editor attending
the convention. Tom Koenninger, the editor of the Columbian, a
small-circulation newspaper in Vancouver, Wash., promptly invited
him to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept,'' Gore said. ``But it's your job, not mine, to see
to it that Governor Bush shows up too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has challenged Bush to debate him twice a week, said,
``If he thinks it's a bluff, all he has do to is call it.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Fleischer said: ``We are looking forward to the debate
with Al Gore (later this year) on education, health care, taxes and
honesty and integrity in government.''

   Speaking on a broader plane, Gore, the presumptive Democratic
nominee told the editors that Bush ``wants us to believe he's
committed to issues like education, health care and the
environment. Let's face it. The Bush approach on these issues is a
headline without a story.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also said he would accept a
presidential-debate invitation from any newspaper editor attending
the convention. Tom Koenninger, the editor of the Columbian, a
small-circulation newspaper in Vancouver, Wash., promptly invited
him to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept,'' Gore said. ``But it's your job, not mine, to see
to it that Governor Bush shows up too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has challenged Bush to debate him twice a week, said,
``If he thinks it's a bluff, all he has do to is call it.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Fleischer said: ``We are looking forward to the debate
with Al Gore (later this year) on education, health care, taxes and
honesty and integrity in government.''

STILL JUST ONE JAMES BROWN, BUT AN AVATAR COULD RAISE DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Calif. _ In a single-story, wooden building about the
size of a mobile home, crammed ceiling to floor with wildly
expensive and exotic computer hardware and software, sits a group
of artists, animators and technicians trying hard to conjure up the
spirit of James Brown, the Godfather of Soul, circa 1963.
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven months the computer wizards of Digital
Domain, a company in Venice, Calif., that has made special effects
for films like ``Apollo 13,'' ``True Lies'' and ``Titanic,'' have
been trying to create a convincing, animated double of the
self-proclaimed Hardest-Working Man in Show Business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to make it definitively James Brown,'' said
Caleb Owens, computer generation supervisor of the project, as the
synthetic soul singer sprang to life on several nearby computer
monitors. ``It cannot just look like James Brown. It's got to have
the attitude, it's got to have the soul, got to have the truth that
is this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   While computer animation has become a mainstay of popular films,
television shows and commercials, the dizzyingly complex
application of refined, computer-generated imagery is pushing the
boundaries of what has been done before, Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have done computer-generated people before,'' said
Andre Bustanoby, the project's visual effects supervisor. ``We've
done it on Titanic. But this is taking it to the bleeding edge of
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   If the computer-generated rendering is finished on schedule, the
digital James Brown, complete with authentic yelps, grunts and
grimaces, will be installed in a interactive popular-music museum
that is set to open in Seattle on June 23. The 140,000-square-foot
museum, called the Experience Music Project, was founded by Paul G.
Allen, co-founder of Microsoft and now a major investor in new
media, and his sister, Jody Allen Patton.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the museum, which was designed by the architect Frank
Gehry, is being filled with exhibitions and artifacts that tell the
story of rock 'n' roll from its roots through its permutations _
rhythm and blues, jazz, grunge, soul, funk and hip-hop music. Key
among 1,200 artifacts on display, the museum's curators said, will
be 55 vintage guitars, including the white Fender Stratocaster
played by Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock in the summer of 1969, and
pages of handwritten lyrics by musicians like Hendrix and Kurt
Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual James Brown, an homage to one of the most celebrated
and innovative forces in soul, rhythm and blues, and funk music,
will reside in a section of the museum that will be called the
Artists' Journey. It will be a combination walking tour and motion
ride. Brown will appear to leap from a two-story billboard set to
look like part of a vacant corner of a New York streetscape. He is
then supposed to beckon visitors to follow him in something called
``Funk Blast'' as he belts out songs like ``Sex Machine'' and
dances as he did when he was 30.
</P>
<P>
   (The exact year Brown was 30 is in dispute. Brown himself has
said he was born in 1933, making him 30 in 1963, the year his album
``Live at the Apollo'' was released. But many other sources give
his year of birth as 1928. Digital Domain has accepted Brown's
statement.)
</P>
<P>
   The digital performer will take audiences to the throbbing heart
of funk music as he spins, jumps and does splits on a large
wraparound screen.
</P>
<P>
   To make the virtual James Brown believable, a crew from Digital
Domain flew to Augusta, Ga., Brown's adopted hometown, to take a
true measure of the man. While Brown performed with his band for
the Digital Domain artists and technicians, he was filmed from
multiple angles. Later, the minute details of his face were
captured with a handheld laser scanner, then reduced to the precise
computer language of ones and zeros.
</P>
<P>
   To capture the fancy footwork that was the trademark of vintage
James Brown performances, a dancer was used as a stand-in for
Brown's body.
</P>
<P>
   To replicate the precise mechanics of Brown's face, tiny balls
were affixed to his face at key points, like his jaw line, the tops
of his cheeks and the skin at the corners of his eyes for a common
special effects technique called motion capture, which recorded the
balls' movements. Once the information was digitized and plugged
into a 3-D map of Brown's face, Digital Domain had a working yet
still crude model of how his face actually moves.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also allowed Digital Domain to make a plaster cast of his
entire head, from which a highly detailed plastic bust was made. A
texture artist added levels of details a scanner cannot see, like
Brown's coloration and individual pores and fine lines in the skin.
Lifelike eyes and teeth and a pompadour were also fashioned and
added to the head. It sits, disembodied, in the wooden building,
now dubbed the Funk Bunker, on the Digital Domain complex in
Venice. The head is frequently used as a reference for the digital
James Brown face.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the artists and technicians laughed when they recalled
how Brown had said during one of the many scannings of his face:
``Ah, I know what you are trying to do. You're trying to clone
me.''
</P>
<P>
   To give the face lifelike qualities, the artists and technicians
in the Funk Bunker used highly sophisticated software that had been
meticulously programmed to mimic the movements of skin and the
muscle beneath the skin as the flesh moved over and around
substructures like bone.
</P>
<P>
   By studying old photographs and film of Brown's face in
performance, animators were able to adjust the data they received
from an older James Brown to create a more youthful one. For every
movement _ the furrow of a brow, the curl of a lip _ animators can
choose how much of that movement will be a direct translation of
Brown's real-life movements and how much will be extrapolated from
archival footage.
</P>
<P>
   The work is painstakingly done frame by frame, like the cells of
an old cartoon. But instead of drawing tables and pens and ink,
there are banks of Silicon Graphics workstations capable of
crunching several terabytes of data.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the bunker an artist was animating Brown's
tongue, which floated free from its face on a computer screen.
Nearby, someone else checked the dependency graph, a complex branch
of lines and tags that track the various relationships that parts
of the face have to other parts when a single element, like an eye,
is moved. Someone else worked on the merger of Brown's face with
the dancer's body, while others worked out the virtual camera
angles and lighting schemes to make it all work without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Joshua Kolden, the computer generation sequence
supervisor for the project, the digital James Brown's performance
has to be just as electrifying as the flesh-and-blood one _ all
without letting on that the museum version is actually powered by
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to wow people with the technology,'' Kolden
said. ``That's not the point. We want James Brown to be James
Brown, not an effect.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Chris Evert's 17-year career chasing the sun on the
professional tennis circuit brought her 18 Grand Slam singles
titles, made her a multimillionaire _ and has left her with damaged
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not alone,'' Evert says in the current edition of
``Florida Tennis,'' urging today's competitors to avoid making the
mistake of playing without protecting their eyes against
ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old blonde American, idolized by generations of
players who copied her baseline style, has pterygiums,
cataract-like growths in both eyes, from looking at the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This problem is the nasty little secret tour players don't
talk about much,'' Evert said. ``But lots of them suffer from
moderate to serious eye damage. I'm fortunate that mine haven't
moved over my pupils. That would obscure my vision and require
surgical removal.''
</P>
<P>
   Evert retired from playing in 1989, having won three Wimbledon
singles titles along with two at the Australian Open, six at the
United States Open and a record seven at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   She was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and her whole
family is involved in tennis. Her father, Jimmy, retired in 1997
from coaching at the local Holiday Park, where he instructed his
five children, Drew, Chris, Jeanne, John and Clare. Her mother,
Colette, is a club player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, when I started playing, we didn't have the
technology to make this problem avoidable,'' Evert said. ``Then, if
you wanted to be visually sharp, you couldn't wear sunglasses. They
were just too dark to see the ball well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can have it both ways. There are sunglasses on the
market that allow you to have total UV protection and excellent
performance on court.''
</P>
<P>
   Players now have the choice of wearing glasses or contact lenses
which enhance the eye's ability to see optic yellow objects, the
color of most tennis balls, while muting the other colors and
blocking 90 percent of UV rays.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Ericsson Open, in Key Biscayne, Fla., Wesley
Jessen, in partnership with Bolle, introduced their latest product,
available in both corrective and non-corrective lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour has finally gotten the message about hats,'' Evert
said. ``That took long enough. Next must be eye protection, but
without sacrificing performance. There is no more important
improvement you can make in your game than to protect your eyes.
They're your windows on court and you can't replace them.''
</P>
<P>
   Evert, formerly married to the British tennis player John Lloyd,
has three sons by her second husband, Andy Mill, an American former
Olympic skier. She oversees the Evert Tennis Academy, in Boca
Raton, Fla., and does television commentary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 she founded Chris Evert Charities, which has raised more
than $10 million to fight drug abuse and to assist neglected,
drug-exposed and abused children. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ You tell the French president to his face that he's
a hypocrite. You urge the Italian prime minister to boot the U.S.
Sixth Fleet out of Naples. You insist that Africa needs not
democracy but water pumps, and accuse Europeans of regarding
Africans as ``gorillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, it might be thought, the best way for one of the blackest
of international black sheep to set about returning to the fold.
But then, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was never one to go by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Libya is starting to mend its fences with the world, but in
typically idiosyncratic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For all its studied theatrics, his appearance at last week's
EU-Africa summit in Cairo was but the latest sign of a
rapprochement that has led the U.S. State Department to the verge
of lifting the 15-year ban on Americans travelling to Libya, and
seen a senior politician of Israel _ long regarded by Col. Gaddafi
as the root of all evil _ officially invited for talks in Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   So what on earth is happening? The answer is a mixture of hard
economics and, probably, the first intimations of mortality by the
``Guide of the Masses,'' who has led his country since the
overthrow of the monarchy in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   By Arab leaders' standards, Col. Gaddafi is a comparative
stripling at 58. But his health has not been good for several
years, Libya-watchers say. And while ``permanent revolution'' was
and remains his preferred modus operandi, it is unlikely to
guarantee a smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the first time since the launch of the Jamahariya or
``State of the Masses'' in 1977, he has been talking of the need
for Libya to have a formal head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest evidence that old attitudes in Tripoli were
changing was last year's handover of the two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, quickly followed by agreement to pay
compensation to the family of WPC Yvonne Fletcher, shot dead in
1984 by agents firing from within the Libyan Embassy in St. James's
Square, London.
</P>
<P>
   The results were swift: a lifting of U.N. sanctions, the
resumption of full diplomatic relations between Britain and Libya
after 16 years, and the possibility that the U.S., which still
demands that Col. Gaddafi definitively renounce terrorism and
weapons of mass destruction, might follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, long diplomatic isolation was starting to wear down
even the ever-truculent Col. Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   But the real pressure was economic _ the need to get foreign
investment flowing again into the Libyan oil sector, critical for
the revival of growth and the reduction of an unemployment rate of
more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, say Western diplomats, was the main factor in the Libyan
leader's seemingly most bizarre recent decision: the abolition in
March of a dozen ministries and the supposed transfer of their
power, as the revolution's ideology dictates, to the grass-roots.
</P>
<P>
   Since all the ultimate levers of power are in his hands, the
change will make no practical difference _ except in one way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the departments to go is the Energy Ministry whose
bureaucracy, foreign operators complained, was delaying the
allocation of new exploration and production permits. As a result,
oil revenues stagnated even though prices were rising, prompting an
enraged Col. Gaddafi to make an unscheduled appearance at the
General People's Congress, Libya's supreme legislative body, to
tear up the draft budget.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he appeared in similarly unpredictable vein at the
Cairo summit, and the message was the same.
</P>
<P>
   Libya may be inching towards the international mainstream, and
Col. Gaddafi, in his own fashion, may be mellowing. But if anyone
thinks he's turning into a soft touch _ forget it. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Congress on Wednesday denounced the International

   ``I don't care whether you're talking about a local government

<P>
   Saxton, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of the House
and Senate, said Republicans and Democrats in Congress want more
transparency in the two organization's decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our own representative to the IMF couldn't even tell us
exactly how decisions are made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Capitol, hundreds of people demonstrated against IMF
and World Bank policies toward poor nations. The lending
institutions' leaders are meeting in Washington this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, known formally as the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, provides long-term loans for
economic development projects in poor countries. The IMF arranges
short-term loans directly to countries in sudden economic crisis,
often imposing austerity measures on them in return for the aid.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the disappearance of millions of dollars in IMF loans to
the Russia, Saxton said the IMF and World Bank also need to improve
their ability to keep track of the money they loan to countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Russia last year, and it was obvious to anyone with
eyes that the IMF had done nothing to look after the money it
loaned to Russia's Central Bank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., accused the IMF and World
Bank of failing in their missions.
</P>
<P>
   By forcing many East Asian countries to cut back on social
spending and benefits to the poor, the IMF caused those nations'
financial crises of the late 1990s to ``last longer and hurt
more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF takes advantage of countries when they are most in
need, coercing them to adopt policies which will benefit the rich
at the expense of the poor,'' Stark said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stark, World Bank polices also resulted in lower
living standards. In addition, he said the bank's loans have caused
``massive'' environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Bank is focused on economic growth at any cost,''
Stark said. ``The fact that the wealth created goes to only a few
individuals while the vast majority of workers are forced to live
on less and less doesn't seem to matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark said poor countries, in attempting to meet IMF and World
Bank criteria, lower labor standards and discard environmental
protections. ``The flip side of the race for profits is the `race
to the bottom' in terms of workers' rights and the degradation of
our planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stark called on the two institutions to incorporate labor
standards and environmental protections in evaluating when to give
loans.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank spokeswoman Merrell Tuck said in an interview that
her organization and the IMF already have revamped their operations
to increase openness and financial accountability. She added that
the IMF and World Bank work with countries to ensure reasonable
labor conditions and environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of our organizations are committed to improving living
standards and helping the economies of poor countries develop,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and IMF are specialized agencies of the United
Nations and are primarily funded by developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hundred yards away from the hearing room, hundreds of
demonstrators demanded similar changes in the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two organizations are wreaking havoc on workers and
environments around the world,'' said Michael Jones, a demonstrator
from Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, one of a number of protesters dressed as a sea turtle,
was joined by several members of the ``radical cheerleaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest activities are being coordinated by a coalition
called the Mobilization for Global Justice, comprised of many of
the same groups that disrupted meetings last December of the World
Trade Organization in Seattle, forcing authorities to declare a
state of emergency and call out the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The protest groups are hoping to use human chains and other
tactics employed in Seattle to block intersections on Sunday and
keep finance ministers from attending a joint meeting of the IMF
and World Bank, which are two blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The police here have studied tapes of the Seattle demonstrations
and hope to avoid the melees that occurred there.

   (UNDATED) _ You tell the French president to his face that he's
a hypocrite. You urge the Italian prime minister to boot the U.S.
Sixth Fleet out of Naples. You insist that Africa needs not
democracy but water pumps, and accuse Europeans of regarding
Africans as ``gorillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, it might be thought, the best way for one of the blackest
of international black sheep to set about returning to the fold.
But then, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was never one to go by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Libya is starting to mend its fences with the world, but in
typically idiosyncratic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For all its studied theatrics, his appearance at last week's
EU-Africa summit in Cairo was but the latest sign of a
rapprochement that has led the U.S. State Department to the verge
of lifting the 15-year ban on Americans travelling to Libya, and
seen a senior politician of Israel _ long regarded by Col. Gaddafi
as the root of all evil _ officially invited for talks in Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   So what on earth is happening? The answer is a mixture of hard
economics and, probably, the first intimations of mortality by the
``Guide of the Masses,'' who has led his country since the
overthrow of the monarchy in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   By Arab leaders' standards, Col. Gaddafi is a comparative
stripling at 58. But his health has not been good for several
years, Libya-watchers say. And while ``permanent revolution'' was
and remains his preferred modus operandi, it is unlikely to
guarantee a smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the first time since the launch of the Jamahariya or
``State of the Masses'' in 1977, he has been talking of the need
for Libya to have a formal head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest evidence that old attitudes in Tripoli were
changing was last year's handover of the two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, quickly followed by agreement to pay
compensation to the family of WPC Yvonne Fletcher, shot dead in
1984 by agents firing from within the Libyan Embassy in St. James's
Square, London.
</P>
<P>
   The results were swift: a lifting of U.N. sanctions, the
resumption of full diplomatic relations between Britain and Libya
after 16 years, and the possibility that the U.S., which still
demands that Col. Gaddafi definitively renounce terrorism and
weapons of mass destruction, might follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, long diplomatic isolation was starting to wear down
even the ever-truculent Col. Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   But the real pressure was economic _ the need to get foreign
investment flowing again into the Libyan oil sector, critical for
the revival of growth and the reduction of an unemployment rate of
more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, say Western diplomats, was the main factor in the Libyan
leader's seemingly most bizarre recent decision: the abolition in
March of a dozen ministries and the supposed transfer of their
power, as the revolution's ideology dictates, to the grass-roots.
</P>
<P>
   Since all the ultimate levers of power are in his hands, the
change will make no practical difference _ except in one way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the departments to go is the Energy Ministry whose
bureaucracy, foreign operators complained, was delaying the
allocation of new exploration and production permits. As a result,
oil revenues stagnated even though prices were rising, prompting an
enraged Col. Gaddafi to make an unscheduled appearance at the
General People's Congress, Libya's supreme legislative body, to
tear up the draft budget.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he appeared in similarly unpredictable vein at the
Cairo summit, and the message was the same.
</P>
<P>
   Libya may be inching towards the international mainstream, and
Col. Gaddafi, in his own fashion, may be mellowing. But if anyone
thinks he's turning into a soft touch _ forget it. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly dawn in the Northeast on Thursday, ample sunshine
will increase readings close to seasonal levels. Winds will be
light, and the air will be dry. A wedge of cool air over the
Piedmont will provide an ideal dome to lift mild, moist air flowing
inland across the Southeast. Damp conditions are likely from the
western Carolinas to the Mississippi Delta.
</P>
<P>
   A few strong thunderstorms will soak sections of Florida,
bringing relief from the recent spate of brush fires. Abundant low
clouds will linger in the wake of low pressure over the Gulf
states. Warm weather will return to the Plains on breezes from the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with polar air over Canada will be active from the
Great Lakes to Montana. Mixed showers will dampen the border
region. A large disturbance from the Pacific will move inland with
showers from Central California to Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WATERSPOUTS
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, mariners around the southern and eastern coasts of
Florida were alerted to the potential for waterspouts. Between 3
yards and 100 yards in diameter, these short-lived whirlwinds
usually have winds less than 50 mph. Nevertheless, they pose a
serious threat to small craft. Unlike tornadoes, which are spawned
by severe thunderstorms, fair-weather waterspouts typically form
beneath ordinary cumulus clouds. Tornadic waterspouts, which occur
when tornadoes form over land and move over water, are much more
dangerous. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The area is known as America's Serengeti _ a vast Alaskan
wilderness providing a wildlife spectacle paralleled only in the
legendary national park in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   But BP Amoco, the giant British oil company that unceasingly
proclaims its environmental responsibility, is backing efforts to
have it opened up as an oil field.
</P>
<P>
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge bordering the Arctic Ocean
on Alaska's northern shore is perhaps the most pristine wilderness
area in the United States, and home to a spectacular range of
Arctic wildlife, from polar bears to musk oxen.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it is noted for the 130,000-strong Porcupine
River caribou herd, which every summer migrates in its entirety 400
miles towards the sea. It is the greatest wildlife display on the
American continent, comparable only to the Serengeti's vast herds
of wildebeest on the move.
</P>
<P>
   However, for 20 years oil companies have been keenly eyeing the
1.5-million acre coastal plain, the biological heart of the refuge
_ the caribou give birth to their calves there _ and an underground
continuation of Alaska's North Slope oil field to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline was built in 1976, to
carry oil to year-round ice-free ports on Alaska's southern coast,
the north-coast oil field concentrated on Prudhoe Bay has continued
to expand.
</P>
<P>
   It now provides 20 percent of home-produced oil in the U.S. The
adjacent coastal plain of the wildlife refuge, with its known oil
reserves, is seen by oilmen as a natural extension.
</P>
<P>
   Three efforts to have the coastal plain opened for development
have been defeated in Congress since 1980 and, with oil prices at
their highest for years, a fourth is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Its development is being supported by BP Amoco, which on its own
Web site describes Alaska as ``a place of unmatched wilderness and
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has lobbied for the development in Washington, and
is openly supporting Arctic Power, a lobby company based in
Anchorage whose sole purpose is to have the refuge developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worried about fuel prices?'' Arctic Power's publicity tells
Americans. ``ANWR (the refuge) equals 30 years of Saudi Oil.''
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco Alaska's vice-president for external affairs, James
Palmer, sits on Arctic Power's board, and the company agrees that
``we have supported the state of Alaska in its efforts to have the
status of ANWR changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says it does so because it believes the coastal
plain can be developed ``without detriment to the environment,''
but its claim is angrily rejected by a coalition of American and
Canadian environmental and socially conscious investment groups.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a serious concern for native peoples, in particular
the 7,000-strong Gwich'in people who have lived off the Porcupine
River caribou herd for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposing the oil plans have put down a resolution for BP
Amoco, calling for it to reject the idea of the refuge as an oil
field. The resolution is also supported by another influential
Washington group, the Sierra Club, and by Greenpeace and the World
Wide Fund for Nature from the U.K.
</P>
<P>
   The million-member U.S. Public Interest Research Group and
Trillium Asset Management, which claims to be the biggest fund
manager in the U.S. specializing in socially responsible
investment, are also key supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are particularly concerned about the Arctic
because climate change is proceeding there more rapidly than
anywhere else in the world, with the summer sea ice now retreating
to a greater extent than witnessed previously.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife such as walruses are already suffering because the sea
ice on which they have their pups is now on the surface of water
that is too deep for the walruses to catch shellfish that live on
the sea bed, on which they feed.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Browne, the chief executive of BP Amoco, has repeatedly
said the company accepts the reality of climate change and global
warming, and as a result has gained a reputation in recent years as
the most environmentally responsible oil company.
</P>
<P>
   But its position on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is
likely to dent that reputation considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Sullivan, the director of programs for the United
Kingdom branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said: ``BP Amoco
refuses to acknowledge publicly the damage that even exploratory
drilling would do in the refuge, let alone the impact of
large-scale oil extraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan added: ``It all comes down to this: multinational oil
companies already have access to 95 percent of Alaska's oil-rich
coastal plain. Can't this last 5 percent be left undisturbed?'' &QL;

<P>
   The area is known as America's Serengeti _ a vast Alaskan
wilderness providing a wildlife spectacle paralleled only in the
legendary national park in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   But BP Amoco, the giant British oil company that unceasingly
proclaims its environmental responsibility, is backing efforts to
have it opened up as an oil field.
</P>
<P>
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge bordering the Arctic Ocean
on Alaska's northern shore is perhaps the most pristine wilderness
area in the United States, and home to a spectacular range of
Arctic wildlife, from polar bears to musk oxen.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it is noted for the 130,000-strong Porcupine
River caribou herd, which every summer migrates in its entirety 400
miles towards the sea. It is the greatest wildlife display on the
American continent, comparable only to the Serengeti's vast herds
of wildebeest on the move.
</P>
<P>
   However, for 20 years oil companies have been keenly eyeing the
1.5-million acre coastal plain, the biological heart of the refuge
_ the caribou give birth to their calves there _ and an underground
continuation of Alaska's North Slope oil field to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline was built in 1976, to
carry oil to year-round ice-free ports on Alaska's southern coast,
the north-coast oil field concentrated on Prudhoe Bay has continued
to expand.
</P>
<P>
   It now provides 20 percent of home-produced oil in the U.S. The
adjacent coastal plain of the wildlife refuge, with its known oil
reserves, is seen by oilmen as a natural extension.
</P>
<P>
   Three efforts to have the coastal plain opened for development
have been defeated in Congress since 1980 and, with oil prices at
their highest for years, a fourth is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Its development is being supported by BP Amoco, which on its own
Web site describes Alaska as ``a place of unmatched wilderness and
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has lobbied for the development in Washington, and
is openly supporting Arctic Power, a lobby company based in
Anchorage whose sole purpose is to have the refuge developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worried about fuel prices?'' Arctic Power's publicity tells
Americans. ``ANWR (the refuge) equals 30 years of Saudi Oil.''
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco Alaska's vice-president for external affairs, James
Palmer, sits on Arctic Power's board, and the company agrees that
``we have supported the state of Alaska in its efforts to have the
status of ANWR changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says it does so because it believes the coastal
plain can be developed ``without detriment to the environment,''
but its claim is angrily rejected by a coalition of American and
Canadian environmental and socially conscious investment groups.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a serious concern for native peoples, in particular
the 7,000-strong Gwich'in people who have lived off the Porcupine
River caribou herd for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposing the oil plans have put down a resolution for BP
Amoco, calling for it to reject the idea of the refuge as an oil
field. The resolution is also supported by another influential
Washington group, the Sierra Club, and by Greenpeace and the World
Wide Fund for Nature from the U.K.
</P>
<P>
   The million-member U.S. Public Interest Research Group and
Trillium Asset Management, which claims to be the biggest fund
manager in the U.S. specializing in socially responsible
investment, are also key supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are particularly concerned about the Arctic
because climate change is proceeding there more rapidly than
anywhere else in the world, with the summer sea ice now retreating
to a greater extent than witnessed previously.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife such as walruses are already suffering because the sea
ice on which they have their pups is now on the surface of water
that is too deep for the walruses to catch shellfish that live on
the sea bed, on which they feed.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Browne, the chief executive of BP Amoco, has repeatedly
said the company accepts the reality of climate change and global
warming, and as a result has gained a reputation in recent years as
the most environmentally responsible oil company.
</P>
<P>
   But its position on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is
likely to dent that reputation considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Sullivan, the director of programs for the United
Kingdom branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said: ``BP Amoco
refuses to acknowledge publicly the damage that even exploratory
drilling would do in the refuge, let alone the impact of
large-scale oil extraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan added: ``It all comes down to this: multinational oil
companies already have access to 95 percent of Alaska's oil-rich
coastal plain. Can't this last 5 percent be left undisturbed?'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly dawn in the Northeast on Thursday, ample sunshine
will increase readings close to seasonal levels. Winds will be
light, and the air will be dry. A wedge of cool air over the
Piedmont will provide an ideal dome to lift mild, moist air flowing
inland across the Southeast. Damp conditions are likely from the
western Carolinas to the Mississippi Delta.
</P>
<P>
   A few strong thunderstorms will soak sections of Florida,
bringing relief from the recent spate of brush fires. Abundant low
clouds will linger in the wake of low pressure over the Gulf
states. Warm weather will return to the Plains on breezes from the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with polar air over Canada will be active from the
Great Lakes to Montana. Mixed showers will dampen the border
region. A large disturbance from the Pacific will move inland with
showers from Central California to Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WATERSPOUTS
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, mariners around the southern and eastern coasts of
Florida were alerted to the potential for waterspouts. Between 3
yards and 100 yards in diameter, these short-lived whirlwinds
usually have winds less than 50 mph. Nevertheless, they pose a
serious threat to small craft. Unlike tornadoes, which are spawned
by severe thunderstorms, fair-weather waterspouts typically form
beneath ordinary cumulus clouds. Tornadic waterspouts, which occur
when tornadoes form over land and move over water, are much more
dangerous. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ After nearly two years of scouring their collections
for artworks that might have been stolen by the Nazis, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and other
major U.S. museums are starting to reveal their findings. They are
taking different tacks, and some are closer to the full disclosure
they have promised than others.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the works could now more easily be claimed by heirs to
those who owned them before Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany
in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Met posted on its Web site (www.metmuseum.org)
a list of 393 paintings, drawn from the 2,700 European paintings in
its collection, whose ownership histories have any gap between 1933
and 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The list, which includes paintings by Matisse, Gauguin, Ingres,
Manet and dozens of others and can be cross-referenced with the
2,200 images of paintings already on the Web site, is an invitation
for people to come forward with information filling in the blanks
or with claims. As that happens and as the Met continues its
research, the museum will delete artworks that were not taken
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a very conscious decision to give as broad a list as
possible because we did not want to inflect the list with any
arbitrary criteria,'' said Philippe de Montebello, the museum's
director, testifying at a hearing on Wednesday in Manhattan called
by the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the
United States. ``We decided that a gap is a gap.''
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art, meanwhile, is providing more
information about fewer works. Calling its effort a work in
progress, it issued a list of 15 paintings drawn from about 500
European works that were acquired by the museum after 1933.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have included them because we do not yet know where they
were during all or part of the Nazi period,'' said the museum's
director, Glenn D. Lowry. The museum plans to post the list, which
includes such major works as Braque's ``Road Near L'Estaque'' and
Leger's ``Contrast of Forms,'' and the known provenance of the
listed works on its Web site (www.moma.org) by Thursday night. It
hopes to have digitized images of the paintings available on the
site by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry said the museum may expand the list as it does more
research on its holdings, and added that eventually it will post
its entire collection.
</P>
<P>
   Both men stressed that the lists were not rosters of suspect
pictures, but rather paintings about which crucial information was
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Two other museums also have gone pubilc with results of their
provenance research. On Monday, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston
said that it had found more than 200 paintings in its collection
with gaps in provenance between 1933 and 1945. But the museum
posted on its Web site (www.mfa.org) only seven works that are ``of
most concern'' because of their association with people implicated
in World War II-era looting or because of dubious transactions in
their history.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials said that they may add to the list and that
they plan to post information about all 1,500 European paintings in
the collection by December.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Art Institute of Chicago posted on its Web
site (www.artic.edu) a list of 548 works for which links in the
chain of ownership between 1933 and 1945 are either unclear or not
fully documented. The works are illustrated in color where
possible, but the Art Institute provides no details about
provenance except its acquisition dates.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the National Gallery of Art in Washington announced
that it had checked its 1,600 prewar European paintings and found
only one, ``Still Life with Fruit and Game'' by Frans Snyders, that
might have been looted by the Nazis. It placed information about
the painting on the Web (www.nga.gov).
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, after several highly publicized ownership claims
raised suspicions that many U.S. museums might own Nazi-tainted
works, members of the Association of Art Museum Directors pledged
to search collections for works taken illegally during the Nazi era
and never returned. Until recently, none of the association's 175
members, representing the largest art museums in North America, had
produced any results. Some critics of the museums had begun to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   But at Wednesday's hearing, which no doubt prompted the flurry
of action, William S. Singer, a Chicago lawyer who is the chairman
of the presidential commission's Committee on Art and Cultural
Property, praised the ``major movement'' made by museums since
1998. ``The ground has shifted from `we are examining our
collections' to full disclosure,'' he said. Now, he added, the
burden shifts to the claimants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the postings being so new _ and with only a handful of
museums producing them _ no one in the United States has claimed
anything in the listings. Still, at the hearing, Lawrence J.
Wheeler, the director of the North Carolina Museum of Art in
Raleigh, said that a painting by Lucas Cranach, a German
Renaissance artist, was stolen by the Nazis and recently returned
by his museum to two sisters in Austria had been discovered on the
museum's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   And Malcolm Rogers, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston said that since its postings went up on Monday some people
had volunteered some information, ``though I can't say any that has
been useful.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where British museums jointly published a list of 350
paintings with gaps in their wartime provenance, and where the
German government has a Web site (www.LostArt.de) listing more than
2,200 looted artworks, some claims have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, each museum director at the hearing promised
to keep searching for missing details on the provenance of art in
their collections. They also asked the commission to recommend the
appropriation of federal money for the task, which can entail
research in foreign archives. Smaller museums, which have tiny
curatorial staffs and few researchers, especially need aid, they
said.

 &HT;    OCEAN TEMPERATURE SHIFTING TOWARD STRONGER HURRICANES?
 &HT;    With OSCILLATE-DATA. For release Sunday, April 16.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year's Atlantic hurricane season, already
predicted to be more severe than normal, might be even worse than
expected because of a little-known Pacific climate condition,
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe that while the huge Pacific Ocean
weather-making machine is going through its cycles known as La Nina
and El Nino every five to seven years, a slower set of changes
called the Northern Pacific Oscillation (NPO) also takes place.
</P>
<P>
   And if their observations are correct, whatever the NPO lacks in
colorful Spanish nicknames, it more than makes up for in the bad
weather it causes.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologist Anthony Lupo of the University of
Missouri-Columbia says an analysis of hurricane records since 1938
indicates that worse-than-average hurricane seasons during La Nina
years _ like this year _ are even worse when La Ninas correspond to
NPO conditions that seem to be developing now.
</P>
<P>
   It's a complicated analysis, comparing three different sets of
weather data _ the NPO patterns between warmer and colder surface
waters, the similar shifts between El Ninos and La Ninas in
equatorial latitudes, and annual hurricane records.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the North Pacific's lazy shifts between states
called NPO-1 and NPO-2, phases that can last 30 years or more.
Nobody knows what drives the NPO changes. Some scientists think
massive ocean currents may push warm water around in a way that
causes a ponderous, ocean-wide slosh of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   Others think atmospheric conditions may be driving the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NPO is like a giant, long-lived El Nino,'' Lupo said.
``The first phase, NPO-1, is characterized by warmer surface
temperatures in the eastern Pacific (along the coast of North
America) and lower surface temperatures in the western Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   During the other phase, NPO-2, the reverse is true. Scientists
say that from about 1945 until the mid-1970s, the Pacific was in an
NPO-2 phase. Beginning in the 1970s, it shifted to NPO-1, and now
appears to have at least started to change back to NPO-2 again.
</P>
<P>
   Lupo and a student assistant, Grant Johnston, will publish their
analysis of NPO-La Nina-El Nino-hurricanes in an upcoming issue of
the National Weather Digest, a scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   They found that when colder La Nina conditions in the tropical
Pacific coincide with NPO-2 conditions in the north Pacific,
Atlantic hurricane seasons seem to be about one major hurricane
worse than average.
</P>
<P>
   During the 62 years covered by their analysis, La Nina episodes
in the Pacific corresponded to an average of 2.7 hurricanes that
qualified as category 3, 4 or 5 storms, from those with sustained
winds of 111 miles per hour to those with winds of more than 155
miles per hour, Lupo said.
</P>
<P>
   When La Nina episodes occurred during NPO-2 years, the average
number of major storms was 2.9. However, La Nina hurricane seasons
during the NPO-1 phase typically produced only 2.0 major storms.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency of El Ninos to suppress powerful hurricane activity
also seems to be enhanced by the NPO phases, according to Lupo's
data.
</P>
<P>
   Other atmospheric scientists reacted to the findings with
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pacific Ocean has a troubling tendency to be joined
together,'' said Eugene Rasmusson, a climate specialist at the
University of Maryland who has studied the El Nino phenomenon for
years. ``I'm not sure that the North Pacific Oscillations and the
El Nino patterns are totally independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, he said, a statistical significance test would have to
be applied to Lupo's data to determine whether he has spotted an
actually significant link or a coincidence.

 &HT;    Let's boil up them crawfish
 &HT;    By Jana Collier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's only one way to eat a crawfish _ at a party.
</P>
<P>
   And this Saturday, the folks at Waco Custom Meats &AMP; Seafood Inc.
will boil 600 pounds of the juicy mudbugs for Central Texans to
enjoy at the fourth annual Crawfish and Folk Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Though they do have more legs than something you'd normally try
to eat, crawfish are easy to cook and make a great focus for any
outdoor party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole fun of the thing _ the atmosphere and
everything,'' said Mike Mayfield, who owns the seafood division of
Waco Custom Meats &AMP; Seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Broadfoot of Houston, a veteran crawfish boiler, agrees.
``You have to have a party for crawfish,'' he said. ``It's just so
much fun that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark and my brother-in-law, Chip Saegert, recently held a big
crawfish boil at Chip's Houston home. They boiled 160 pounds of
crawfish, along with corn, potatoes and mushrooms, for about 50 of
their friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of having a crawfish boil at your house,
here's a guide from Mark and Chip and the folks at Waco Custom
Meats &AMP; Seafood.
</P>
<P>
   The crawfish
</P>
<P>
   Crawfish season runs from January to June, but the prime time
for the crustaceans is April and May. That's when the supply is
greatest and the crawfish are biggest.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the crawfish supply nationwide is significantly down,
primarily due to a poor yield in Louisiana. However, Waco Custom
Meats gets most of its crawfish from Texas farms, and those farms
are currently producing well, Mike said. How long those farms
continue to produce will depend on the heat and rain, he said,
noting that the price is up this year because of the low supply.
</P>
<P>
   Crawfish must be cooked live, so storing them properly is
crucial to a successful boil.
</P>
<P>
   At Waco Custom Meats &AMP; Seafood, which supplies crawfish to many
Central Texas restaurants, a special cooler was built just for
crawfish. The mudbugs should be kept at a temperature of 38 to 40
degrees _ cold enough to stay fresh, but not cold enough to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Mark and Chip bought their crawfish at a Houston grocery store a
few hours before their boil and stored them in ice chests until
time for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   To tell if a crawfish is alive or dead, pick it up before it's
cooked and look at the tail: If its tail droops when handled, it's
dead; if the tail curls under its body, its still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Some crawfish must be ``purged'' or cleaned before cooking, but
it isn't always necessary. Mike said most Texas farmers clean their
crawfish in aerated, fresh water tanks before shipping, so they do
not need to be purged. Crawfish that have not been cleaned, though,
will need to be purged to remove mud sediment, fish bait and other
impurities.
</P>
<P>
   To purge the crawfish, Mark said he rinses them first with clean
water and then sprinkles salt over them while still in the ice
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Most people boil their crawfish in propane-fired pots, which can
be bought at area hardware stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot.
For smaller amounts of crawfish, you can use a large stockpot on
the stove.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the pot, fill it about a half to three-fourths full
of water and add plenty of spices. At Waco Custom Meats, they use
Chef Geoffrey Michael's Cajun Red seasoning and the ultra-hot Swamp
Fire seasoning, both of which are sold at the store.
</P>
<P>
   Mark said he uses a large bottle of Zatarain's liquid shrimp and
crab boil and half of a large bottle of powdered shrimp and crab
boil for each pot he boils. He also adds one to two sticks of
butter, which he says makes the crawfish easier to peel, and about
5 lemons, halved.
</P>
<P>
   Many people cook corn and potatoes with their crawfish. Mark
also adds mushrooms, and Sondra Waits of Waco Custom Meats &AMP;
Seafood said she's seen people add whole garlic cloves. Some people
also add onions.
</P>
<P>
   Sausage and shrimp can be cooked with the crawfish, which is
nice for those who don't care for crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   Mark said he puts his vegetables in a mesh lingerie bag. This
keeps the vegetables from floating up to the top where they can
sometimes get too spicy. Depending on the size of the potato
pieces, you might want to add those first to give them a little
extra time to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Once the water in the pot is boiling and the spices are added,
throw in the crawfish and vegetables. The crawfish should cook
about 15 minutes. After they've cooked, Mark turns off the heat to
let them soak for another 15 minutes before serving.
</P>
<P>
   The place
</P>
<P>
   Crawfish should be eaten outdoors _ they're way too messy for
inside.
</P>
<P>
   At Waco Custom Meats' festival on Saturday, they'll have tables
set up outside for those who want to eat the crawfish there.
</P>
<P>
   My brother-in-law Chip actually built two large tables to set up
on his deck. He made them taller than most tables, so people could
stand and eat their crawfish as they were poured out on a
tablecloth of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The eating area should be well-stocked with paper towels and
napkins and extra seasonings for those who like their crawfish very
spicy.
</P>
<P>
   Having tables set up outside makes cleanup easy. Once the
party's over, just remove the leftover food and newspapers and hose
down the tables and ground.
</P>
<P>
   The munchies
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes crawfish, and, in particular, children are
often turned off by the idea of eating something that looks like
the star of last night's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   My 7-year-old Claire and 4-year-old Rachel finally tasted some
crawfish tails, but they certainly didn't eat enough to constitute
a meal.
</P>
<P>
   That's why many people add sausage or shrimp to the crawfish
pots. Chip and Mark also fried a turkey, which was a nice addition
to the party. Waco Custom Meats will have shrimp at Saturday's
festival, although it will be cooked in a separate pot.
</P>
<P>
   My sister, Shannon Saegert, assembled a large table of crackers,
vegetable trays and dips, along with praline bars and
crawfish-shaped cutout cookies, iced with red icing and decorated
with silver dragees for eyes. In addition, Shannon's friend, Betty
Broadfoot (Mark's wife), baked a batch of crawfish bread that
turned out to be the biggest hit of the party.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes
</P>
<P>
   Here's a basic recipe for boiled crawfish from the Texas Marine
Advisory Service and the Texas A&AMP;M University Sea Grant College
Program.
</P>
<P>
   BOILED CRAWFISH
</P>
<P>
   12 to 15 pounds of live crawfish
</P>
<P>
   1 package (3 ounces) crab and shrimp boil mix
</P>
<P>
   1 cup salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-gallon stew pot, bring water, crab boil, salt and pepper
to a boil. Add crawfish and boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat
and let crawfish soak for 10 minutes. Soaking allows the meat to
absorb flavors, so don't shorten the soaking time. Drain and serve
immediately. Makes 4-5 servings.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe for crawfish bread was the hit of my sister and
brother-in-law's party. Betty Broadfoot made it, following a recipe
from chef Emeril's cookbook Every Day's a Party. Crawfish bread is
a popular food at New Orleans' annual Jazz Fest, and those who had
been to Jazz Fest proclaimed this recipe exactly like that served
at the festival. You can buy packages of frozen crawfish tails for
about $6 a pound at Waco Custom Meats &AMP; Seafood.
</P>
<P>
   CRAWFISH BREAD
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups warm water (about 110 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups bleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped yellow bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds peeled crawfish tails
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pound sharp cheddar cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Monterey Jack Cheese with jalapenos, grated
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Combine yeast, sugar and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in the bowl
of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the warm water. With
the mixer on low speed, beat the mixture for about 1 minute to
dissolve the yeast. If the yeast mixture doesn't begin to foam
after a few minutes, it means it's not active and you will have to
start over with fresher yeast.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and 1 teaspoon of the
salt. Add it 1/4 cup at a time to the yeast mixture, mixing on low
speed until the dough lightly comes together. Increase the speed to
medium and beat until the dough pulls away from the sides of the
bowl, forms a ball and starts to climb up the dough hook.
</P>
<P>
   Coat a large bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil.
Put the dough in the bowl and turn it to oil all sides. Cover the
bowl with plastic wrap, set aside in a warm, draft-free place and
let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
Add the onion, bell pepper, the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and
the cayenne. Cook, stirring for 4 minutes. Add the crawfish and
cook, stirring, for 5 minutes until they are soft. Remove from the
heat, drain off any excess liquid from the pan and set aside to
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the dough from the bowl and turn it onto a lightly
floured work surface. Push it down, then using your hands, pat it
out to flatten it. Pick it up, dust the work surface with flour and
return the dough to the work surface. Roll it out to a
20-by-15-inch rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cheese in a medium-size mixing bowl. Sprinkle half
of the cheese over the upper half of the rectangle of dough,
leaving a 1/2-inch border. Spoon the crawfish mixture evenly over
the cheese. Top with the remaining cheese. Fold the other half of
the dough up over the filling, forming a half-moon shape, and pinch
the edges tightly to seal completely. Fold the edges over, seal
securely, and then crimp. Carefully transfer the dough to a baking
sheet lined with parchment paper. With a sharp pointed knife, make
three slits on top, about 6 inches apart. Brush the surface of the
dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the kosher salt and
black pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm,
draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the plastic wrap and bake the bread until golden brown,
30 to 35 minutes. Let cool slightly. Cut crosswise into 12 equal
portions and serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a great recipe for leftover crawfish tails from my
sister, Shannon Saegert. If you don't have leftovers, you can buy
packages of frozen crawfish tails.
</P>
<P>
   CRAWFISH FETTUCINE
</P>
<P>
   2 onions
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch green onions
</P>
<P>
   1 bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 stalks celery
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 sticks butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds crawfish tails
</P>
<P>
   1 jar picante sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Velveeta
</P>
<P>
   1 cup half and half
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces Fettucine
</P>
<P>
   Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Pepper and cayenne to taste
</P>
<P>
   Saute vegetables until soft. Add flour, parsley, crawfish and
spices. Cook 15 minutes. Add picante, Velveeta and half and half.
Cook fettucine separately and add to crawfish mixture. Top with
Parmesan cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This is another way to use leftover crawfish tails. If you don't
have leftovers, you can buy frozen bags.
</P>
<P>
   CRAWFISH CARDINAL
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons scallions
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup white wine
</P>

AT HIGH POINT, PUTTING ON WHITE GLOVES AND PEARLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ SEYMOUR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ The ladies who lunch made a surprise
reappearance at the International Home Furnishings Market, which
opened here last Thursday and closes tomorrow. Just as Minimalism
and Modernism are entrenched in the mainstream, the upper end of
the market took a swerve toward the traditional, glamorous looks of
the 1930s and '40s, offering a champagne complement to the dry
martini Deco modern that ushered out the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the world these days is beige and gray _ it's a
uniform,'' said Carleton Varney, a New York decorator, sitting in
the Kindel showroom, painted in his signature baby blue and azalea
pink. The inheritor of the 1940s decorator Dorothy Draper's grande
dame style, Varney was making his debut in High Point with a
22-piece collection of wood and upholstered furniture, along with
lamps, throws and pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Buatta invoked the spirits of Syrie Maugham and Elsie de
Wolfe with eight new pieces in his collection for John Widdicomb.
``Glamour is back,'' he said. ``The '80s was a bit more lush, but
this is a sparer '30s kind of thing that looks very new for the
21st century.'' The Buatta collection included a sexy button-tufted
sofa, a chinoiserie coffee table and an ottoman dressed in a
hulalike skirt of deep, bouillon fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the manufacturers believed their surging business in
classic traditional was being driven by newly wealthy
under-40-year-olds. ``We saw an e-commerce study the other day that
said that 50 percent of the furniture bought by young millionaires
is in traditional styles,'' Chris Plasman, president of Baker,
said. ``To them it's new.'' Baker, which has worked with modern
designers like Barbara Barry and Michael Vanderbyl, went
traditional all the way, with additions to its Stately Homes
Collection of British furniture and a new French Collection.
</P>
<P>
   The word livable replaced casual as many showrooms
metaphorically put on their white gloves and pearls. Even pretty _
a word all but banished from the fashion-oriented end of the market
in recent years _ returned in a cloud of marquetry inlays and silk
or silklike fabrics. At Mitchell Gold, a new bed was offered with
organdy slipcovers that were unabashedly pretty; at Baker a new
chest of drawers in the Stately Homes Collection was inlaid with
classical urns and floral scrolls; new tables at Harden's Forbes
collection were covered with marquetry balloons and playing cards;
Hickory Chair showed some of its new upholstery in a cheerful color
it called National Geographic yellow.
</P>
<P>
   The brighter, lighter colors matched the buoyant mood of an
industry that is experiencing a record run. ``It doesn't get any
better than this,'' said Jerry Epperson, a furniture business
analyst for Mann, Armistead &AMP; Epperson in Richmond, Va. ``There's a
level of euphoria that I haven't seen in a long time.'' In 1999,
the industry had its best year ever, with $61 billion in retail
sales; those figures are expected to grow by 3 to 4 percent in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of space dedicated to selling furniture here at the
International Home Furnishings Market is growing apace. Bagpipes
and a parade accompanied the opening of the 350,000-square-foot
Suites at Market Square showroom space at what is already the
world's largest wholesale market of home furnishings. With the
addition of the Suites, the market now has more than eight million
square feet of showroom space, and is to grow another 2.5 million
square feet by fall 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong business, most manufacturers are playing it
safe with designs that are at best variations of their own (or
competitors') proven winners. French styles _ translated into a
kind of Franglais for the American market _ were everywhere,
spanning the timeline from French Provincial to French modern. (One
of the nicest Francophone collections was at Lane, whose Boulevard
group brought the dark-wood-and-silver-hardware styles by Barbara
Barry at Baker and Thomas O'Brien at Hickory Chair to a mid-market
price level.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most startling French collection was Hemingway's
Paris, an addition to Thomasville's hugely successful _ $100
million in sales its first year _ Ernest Hemingway Collection.
Loosely inspired by Hemingway's penurious Paris years, the
collection featured a most un-Hemingway-like carved armoire, a
hand-painted bar cabinet and a cast metal bed with scrollwork
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   American and English 18th-century design, heavy on the carving
and hardware, were also back, often in overscale proportions
suitable for equally overscale new suburban homes. Stickley, which
built its reputation reviving its own Arts and Crafts designs,
allied itself with Colonial Williamsburg to bring out 35 pieces of
18th-century reproductions, including a huge bombe chest on chest
and a massive serpentine front chest of drawers. The architect
William Poole, known for his mini-mansion designs, weighed in with
his own collection for Hickory Chair. ``People have trouble finding
furniture to fit my houses,'' he said. His solution: king-size beds
and an 88-inch-tall pedimented bookcase.
</P>
<P>
   But sleek and modern furniture can still be found: two of the
market's handsomest collections were by Ralph Lauren and Michael
Vanderbyl. Lauren's furniture, made by Henredon, was the glossy
mahogany, chrome and leather Mercer Collection. Vanderbyl, whose
Archetype collection has been a hit for Baker, brought out a sleek
set of outdoor furniture in teak, aluminum and cloth webbing for
McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   For many manufacturers, however, style was not the biggest
talking point. That honor went to services like delivery times and
speed of manufacturing. The customer, once all but forgotten, was
talking back to manufacturers through focus groups, consumer
surveys, advisory boards and e-mail. New licensing programs, in
particular, were being touted as ways to reach customers more
directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers these days hold the power in this business,'' said
Bob Stec, president of Lexington Home Brands, which used to be
called Lexington Furniture. ``As consumers have more choices, and
less time, they're looking for a shorthand way to make a decision,
and that's what a recognizable name gives them.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so: licensed home furnishings, one of the fastest
growing categories in the licensing business, accounted for $4.7
billion in retail sales in 1999. The tables have even turned.
Thomasville not only licensed the Hemingway line of furniture but
allowed its own name to be licensed; Home Depot is presenting a
Thomasville line of kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the more promising licensed collections were allied with
HGTV veterans. Joe Ruggiero created a clean, livable collection for
Norwalk, and Chris Madden introduced a well-priced collection of
soccer-mom style furniture in comfortable washed-out green, rust
and gold. Tellingly, Bassett began test selling its Chris Madden
Collection directly to consumers in February, two months before it
was shown to retailers _ an almost unprecedented move in the
industry. (Things seen at this market normally take six months to
reach consumers.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and the growing number of dot-com sites have helped
to cut the distance between manufacturers and consumers, but
whether they produce furniture sales is still up for debate.
``We've seen four competitors get out of selling home furnishings
to consumers just this calendar year,'' said Doug Mack, chief
executive of Goodhome.com.
</P>
<P>
   But one Internet introduction was an immediate market hit. At
the back of the La-Z-Boy showroom, weary buyers stood three deep
for their turn in the Microsoft WebTV Plus Recliner, a plush
collaboration from La-Z-Boy and Microsoft. With a built-in tray and
keyboard in one arm and a drinks holder and storage compartment in
the other, the $1,049 recliner comes with a two-month subscription
to WebTV Plus, which allows people to watch television and surf the
Internet simultaneously on their television screens.

 &HT;    SOCCER NOTES: Clubs dealing with fans' deaths
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A week remains before the second leg of the UEFA Cup
semifinals. But it might not be enough time for the heated verbal
volleys from the chairmen of Leeds and Turkey's Galatasaray to cool
down. Both clubs still are dealing with the stabbing deaths of two
English fans in Istanbul last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   UEFA, the European soccer governing body, has delayed until
Friday a decision on admitting Galatasaray fans into Leeds' Elland
Road ground for next Thursday's return match. Five Turks have been
arrested in connection with the murders of two Leeds supporters
outside an Istanbul night club on the eve of the first leg.
Galatasaray, which won 2-0, has petitioned for a neutral site if
Leeds is granted its wish of barring visiting fans.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds Chairman Peter Ridsdale excoriated Galatasaray management
and threatened to pull his club out of the competition if it cannot
play at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been trying to find any means possible to get
through to the final without kicking a football,'' Ridsdale said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue should not be turned into a blood feud,''
Galatasaray chairman Faruk Suren responded.
</P>
<P>
   It might be too late already.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND: NEWCASTLE RUN ENDS
</P>
<P>
   Two goals Sunday by Gustavo Poyet, including the winner with 18
minutes to play, put Chelsea in the FA Cup final for the second
time in the last four seasons. Chelsea won 2-1 over Newcastle in
the semifinals. Alan Shearer set up Robert Lee for the equalizer on
a header in the 67th minute for Newcastle, which has lost in the
finals each of the last three years. Chelsea, which won the title
in 1997, plays Aston Villa for the cup May 20 in Wembley Stadium.
... Manchester United got four goals in the second half to edge
Middlesbrough 4-3 on Monday to go 11 points ahead of second-place
Liverpool in the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: DORTMUND PLUNGES DEEPER
</P>
<P>
   Only three years after winning the European Cup, Borussia
Dortmund is facing relegation from the Bundesliga after a 3-1 loss
to unheralded Unterhaching on Tuesday. Dortmund, losers of six in a
row, has not won before the Christmas break and is only three
points out of the relegation zone. ... Mehmet Scholl converted a
penalty kick with three minutes remaining Wednesday, and Bayern
Munich beat Freiburg 2-1 to regain the Bundesliga lead on goal
difference over Bayer Leverkusen. The latter drew 1-1 with Hansa
Rostock.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY: FEARS PROMPT TIME CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Fiorentina-Lazio match in Florence has been moved up
from the evening to the afternoon because of security concerns from
last season's match there. A Fiorentina fan was stabbed, about 20
people were injured, and Lazio fans set a train on fire as they
made their way to Tuscany. ... Juventus stayed three points ahead
of Lazio in Serie A play with a 2-0 win at Bologna on Sunday. Darko
Kovacevic came off the bench to score in the 88th minute, and
Massimo Paganin added an insurance goal in stoppage time. ... Inter
Milan's skid continued in a 3-0 loss at Udinese; Carlos Sosa
registered a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: UNEASE IN BARCA
</P>
<P>
   Tensions are mounting between Barcelona players and unpopular
manager Louis van Gaal after a horrible week that included a 3-1
loss to Chelsea in the Champions League and a 3-0 humiliation by
Mallorca in the Nou Camp in the Primera. Cameroonian Samuel Etoo
had two goals and an assist for Mallorca, which got a scare when
defender Miguel Angel Hadal suffered a collapsed lung during the
match. He was moved from intensive care on Monday. Barca stars
Rivaldo and Patrick Kluivert, egged on by the Spanish media, turned
up their criticism of van Gaal. ... Roy Makaay scored a hat trick
for Primera leaders Deportivo La Coruna in a 4-1 win over Atletico
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLAND: PSV'S LEAD IS 12
</P>
<P>
   A hat trick by Luc Nilis pushed PSV Eindoven to a 12-point
advantage in the Honor Division in a 4-0 win over Fortuna Sittard.
Nilis is bound for England's Aston Villa next year. ... Defending
champion Feyenoord is 16 points back in fifth place after a 2-1
loss to lowly Utrecht. The defeat prompted the immediate
resignation of coach Leo Beenhakker, who was set to step down at
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: TOLUCA QUALIFIES
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Jose Cardozo and Carlos Morales paced Toluca to a 2-0
win over Atlante on Saturday, and the club became the first to
advance to the Torneo Verano playoffs. ... Mexican national-team
legend Luis Hernandez, the subject of transfer rumors to the Los
Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer, had both goals Sunday when
Tigres blanked UNAM.

ATTORNEY: THOU SHALT NOT USE THE DIMAGGIO NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB PADECKY    
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In sports, an industry that spawns compliments as if they were
so many salmon swimming upstream, rarely is a pat on the back
refused. In fact, in many places it is demanded as a rite of
passage. It would be like gaining entrance, say, into a trendy
nightclub owned by Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the secret password?'' the bouncer asks the guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good. You may come in.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was with great interest that a very nice compliment was
refused last week in San Francisco. The Board of Supervisors voted
to name the city park where Joe DiMaggio learned the game of
baseball after the Yankee Clipper. The park is in the Italian
section of San Francisco, is heavily trafficked and, especially,
offers the imagination a marvelous daydream of young Joe running
across its sod. The honor would get a lot of action. It made sense.
</P>
<P>
   Not to Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's attorney. Morris told the
supervisors that if they went through with their ridiculous idea,
he'd sue. He saw their pat on the back as a slap to Joe's face. No
one treats Joe this way, Morris said in so many words. Joe deserves
better. This would be demeaning. As a modest suggestion, Morris
thought either the San Francisco Airport or the Bay Bridge should
be renamed after the Yankees center fielder who passed away 13
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The supes refused, confused. No one could quite figure out what
a bridge had to do with DiMaggio, other than the fact he traveled
over it. Or what SFO had to do with DiMaggio, other than the fact
he traveled through it. Plus, the murmurs went, who in their right
mind would want their name associated with THAT airport? It's bad
enough anyone has to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Why not rename the new Giants ballpark? It could be Joe DiMaggio
With Permission From Morris Engelberg Park.
</P>
<P>
   As you might have gathered by now, Morris guards the use of
Joe's name as if it were gold bullion. No one just walks away with
it.
</P>
<P>
   I might be even risking a lawsuit right now, just by using Joe's
name in this column without Morris' permission.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the heck with it ... Joe DiMaggio. Joe DiMaggio. Joe
DiMaggio. Joe DiMaggio. Joe DiMaggio. Joe DiMaggio. Joe DiMaggio.
Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   We certainly can all agree that Joe's name should not be
cheapened. Joe is an American icon so his name on lamp posts and
park benches and coat racks would soil his shine. There is a
certain standard, and we can all agree that it would be violated if
Denny's were serving Joe DiMaggio's Grand Slam Breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Joe was the last guy to call attention to
himself. Yes, he wanted to be introduced at banquets as ``the
greatest living baseball player,'' but that was hardly ego. That
was just the truth. From his baseball retirement in 1951 to his
death in 1999, Joe's longest recorded sentence was, ``Hey, how ya
doin'?''
</P>
<P>
   Greta Garbo never asked for an airport to be named after her.
Neither did Joe DiMaggio. Joe wanted to be left alone. We left him
alone. Nowhere is it recorded that on his deathbed did Joe turn to
Morris and say, ``Make sure they name the Pacific Ocean after me.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not Joe's style. He didn't care if a large piece of
architecture had his name on it. He wanted to be remembered as a
guy who played the game well. You can just bet Joe wouldn't have
threatened a lawsuit because San Francisco wanted to name his
boyhood park after him. He would have nodded, said ``Thanks,'' then
walked away, pulling the bill of his fedora over his eyes. He was
undercover more than some of the guys at the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Morris should remember the words he spoke at the time of
Joe's death from lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fought his illness as hard as he played the game of
baseball, with the same dignity, style and grace in which he lived
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dignity, style and grace, that's how we should be remembering
Joe DiMaggio today, not worrying that one day we'll be on the Joe
DiMaggio Bridge at 4:30 p.m., where there is anything but dignity,
style and grace on it.

 &HT;    CONGRESS EXPANDS CDC PROBE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional panel is expanding a probe of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to examine the handling
of funds to seek out 4 million people thought to be infected by
hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., sent a
letter last week to Surgeon General David Satcher seeking
documentation on how the Atlanta-based CDC is spending $13 million
allocated for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley said his panel ``is examining the apparent failure of
CDC'' to launch general education programs to alert people who were
transfused with tainted blood before testing could detect hepatitis
C in the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials responded Wednesday that the agency was conducting
a major effort to find and notify the infected individuals through
tracing records on blood transfusions. That ``look back'' is 90
percent complete, said Virginia Bales, deputy director for program
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are funding and implementing a fully comprehensive
strategy'' to combat hepatitis C, she said. She added that the
program is complicated and said, ``It's perfectly understandable
that we're not at a level of full understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Bales is leading the CDC efforts to respond to audits and
investigations that have followed controversies over evidence that
the federal agency misled Congress when it diverted funds budgeted
for chronic fatigue syndrome and the Hantavirus to other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's latest letter indicated continuing skepticism about
CDC's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be a diversion of funds and, on the surface,
that seems to be a pattern at CDC,'' said Pete Sheffield, a
spokesman for Bliley.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee has already received several boxes filled
with records on management of CDC, particularly the operations at
the Viral Division, whose director, Dr. Brian Mahy, was forced to
step down in the earlier controversies over spending. He is now a
senior biological research scientist, working ``exclusively'' on
writing for scientific publications, Bales said.
</P>
<P>
   The records collected so far indicate that Mahy and other top
officials at CDC spent a considerable portion of their time, as
much as 100 days a year, traveling. Travel for scientific meetings
has long been part of the agency's operations, but the requests for
documentation appear to be aimed at discovering whether there has
been abuse of the custom.
</P>
<P>
   Bales said that such extensive travel is necessary for top
scientists at the agency. ``Our scientists are in great demand
worldwide,'' she said. ``I'm out of town every week myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is also looking into the potential of
conflicts of interest involving private companies and the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In previous requests, Bliley's panel has sought Mahy's calendars
and notebooks going back to 1990 and records of communications
between Mahy and private companies since 1996. Last week, the House
investigators sought information on total spending for travel for
CDC since 1996 and a list of grants to pharmaceutical companies
since that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken some hits,'' Bales said, but the CDC is continuing
its top-to-bottom review. ``I see it as restoring trust in CDC,''

EUGENE O'NEILL'S SUSPICIONS WERE WRONG, REPORT SAYS: DRINK DIDN'T
KILL HIM 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.)   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eugene O'Neill, playwright of souls in search of forgiveness, is
given an absolution of sorts himself, in the pages of a medical
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to O'Neill's own suspicion that heavy drinking in his
youth caused the brain disease that crippled him later in life, a
new report Wednesday confirms that he died of a rare brain disease,
but says that alcohol was not to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The progressive deterioration of O'Neill's brain was due to a
rare genetic disorder, said Dr. Bruce H. Price, chairman of the
neurology department at McLean Hospital in Boston, and co-author of
an article in the New England Journal of Medicine. He said the
pattern of O'Neill's illness did not follow a typical path of
alcoholic brain disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad luck of the genetic draw that took him,'' Price
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The article, coming 47 years after O'Neill's death at the age of
65, is based on a new analysis of his medical records and autopsy,
and describes in detail the illness that stopped him from writing
during the last 10 years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill had long had a tremor in his hands, but it worsened
markedly in 1939, when he was 51. By 1941 he was having trouble
controlling a pencil, and his handwriting became shaky and so
cramped that a magnifying glass was needed to read it. Doctors
mistakenly diagnosed Parkinson's disease. In 1943, he finished the
play, ``Moon for the Misbegotten,'' and soon gave up writing,
abandoning his hope of completing a cycle of 11 plays.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, he began to have difficulty walking, feeding himself
and speaking. He choked on food and his own secretions, and became
prone to respiratory infections. During his last few months, he was
mostly bedridden. But his mind remained clear to the end.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1953, of pneumonia, in a hotel room in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Carlotta, requested an autopsy, because, she told one
of his biographers, ``I wanted to know what in the name of God was
the matter with this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the New England Journal article suggests that O'Neill's
autopsy results had never been released before, his wife gave the
full autopsy report to other biographers, Arthur and Barbara Gelb,
in 1960. The Gelbs summarized the findings in their 1962 book,
``O'Neill.'' Gelb, a former managing editor of the New York Times,
now oversees the scholarship program of the New York Times
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy showed that O'Neill never had Parkinson's disease.
Rather, he had a degenerative disorder, ``perhaps familial,'' the
report stated, that had progressively destroyed his cerebellum, the
part of the brain responsible for muscle control and coordination.
</P>
<P>
   The original autopsy report did not blame alcohol. But Gelb said
in an interview that O'Neill himself had always blamed his
``alcohol-ravished youth'' for his later illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sincerely believed it, and all his doctors at the time
believed it,'' Gelb said. He added that although he had read the
new report, he still found it hard to believe that O'Neill's
alcoholism had not contributed to his illness. ``That man, to his
own accounts, lived a life of dereliction,'' Gelb said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill had drunk so heavily as a young man that he had suffered
blackouts and delirium tremens, a severe form of alcohol
withdrawal. But by his 40s, O'Neill drank just occasionally, and
not heavily, and during his last eight years he did not drink at
all. He stopped, Gelb said, because a doctor had warned him that
alcohol would damage his brain, and he feared that he would become
unable to write.
</P>
<P>
   Price said he had always been drawn to O'Neill's plays, and
became curious about his long illness in 1988. He contacted Dr. E.
P. Richardson, a professor emeritus of neuropathology at the
Harvard Medical School, who had supervised O'Neill's autopsy, and
suggested that they re-examine O'Neill's records and slides, in the
light of more recent knowledge about brain diseases. Richardson
agreed; he died in 1998, after the work was done but before the
article was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Price obtained permission to reopen O'Neill's records from his
granddaughter, the actress Geraldine Chaplin, one of eight children
born to O'Neill's daughter, Oona, and the actor Charlie Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   Examining the slides of O'Neill's brain, the doctors confirmed
the original diagnosis, ``late-onset cerebellar cortical atrophy.''
They described the condition as ``idiopathic,'' meaning its cause
was unknown. And they also said the condition was completely
unrelated to the mild hand tremor that O'Neill had early in life,
which they attributed to a familial condition known as essential
tremor.
</P>
<P>
   Price said that the cerebellar damage on the slides was
identical to that found in two different conditions: a genetic
disease, or brain atrophy due to alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that O'Neill's medical history did not match the
typical pattern of cerebellar degeneration found in alcoholics,
because that condition usually develops in those who continue to
drink heavily. It is not known to occur as a delayed reaction in
people like O'Neill, who had quit drinking years or decades before
the symptoms developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way we think alcohol works on the central
nervous system,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Richardson thought it more likely that O'Neill had a
genetic disorder. Several genetic conditions affecting the
cerebellum have been identified during the past decade. But they
could not prove that O'Neill's condition was genetic because there
was not enough tissue left for DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no evidence that others in the family had the
condition, the doctors said it might have been due to a spontaneous
mutation that affected only O'Neill. They did not know whether he
passed it on. His daughter, Oona, had no symptoms, but whether his
two sons might have developed them is not known, because they did
not live long enough: Both committed suicide at relatively young
ages.

CURTAINS FOR DRAPERIES AS CONSUMERS LET THE SUN SHINE IN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gina Tarantino has sheer curtains, but she and her
husband never draw them.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do their neighbors, who roll out of bed naked each
morning, as unashamed as Adam and Eve. ``My husband tells me not to
put on my glasses,'' she said. Still, Tarantino, a 38-year-old
product designer, maintains that despite the view into the
neighbors' bedroom, there remains a real sense of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never run into each other on the street,'' she said. ``I
don't even know if I'd recognize them with their clothes on.'' In
fact, the curtainless situation has become a challenge of wills,
``It has almost become almost a war,'' Tarantino added. ``We're
both just waiting to see who's going to draw their curtains first.
Our parents tell us all the time that it's just like `Rear
Window.'''
</P>
<P>
   Trend watchers, note: It's curtains for draperies. Farewell to
billowing swathes of fabric. Goodbye to traditional decorating
moneymakers like valances, box pleats and chintz balloon curtains.
Industry experts confirm that consumers are balking at such heavy,
detailed window treatments _ not to mention their prices _ and
letting the light shine in.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   As they do, they're giving the neighbors a peek. Just look out
of any high-rise apartment building in Manhattan. From the
businessman in Hell's Kitchen whose neighbors have been treated to
nighttime views of him and his bed mates (male and female) to a
couple on Fifth Avenue and 16th Street whose lovemaking is a
midmorning feature for workers in a nearby building, the modest
tradition of the drawing of the drapes is waning.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jayne, a New York decorator, attributes it to an
evolutionary shift in what is and is not considered private.
``There was a time when closing the curtains every evening was a
routine, almost a ritual,'' he said. ``It indicated private time
and a sense of closing down for the evening. People aren't as
private as they used to be. They eat in the street and they talk on
their cell phones at any time, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, it was in vogue to jam operatically scaled curtains
into small rooms to bolster architecture that was undernourished.
Today, however, a clean minimal aesthetic reigns. Jayne pointed out
that the textiles people are using are very telling: voile, unlined
silk, open-weave cottons _ all an exhibitionist's delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become joyful scopophiliacs,'' said Charles Melcher,
the editor of ``Voyeur'' (Harper Collins, 1999), a book that shows
the furtive side of famous photographers. Today, cameras monitor
restaurant diners, pedestrians, even people undergoing plastic
surgery. Cinema-verite television shows like ``Blind Date'' capture
real life on camera. ``We are amongst a society filled with very
sophisticated voyeurs or lookers,'' Melcher said. ``With the
explosion of explicit images on TV and on the web, our eyes have
been trained in a way that didn't exist 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the trend toward sheer decor, as Melcher opines,
``allows us to see, and be seen, at a very safe distance'' or
merely reflects a new casualness in the way we live and entertain,
there is a visible lightening up in the generally heavyweight world
of window treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of sheer curtains have been growing steadily at about 5
percent a year, said Andrea Lillo, a product editor at Home
Textiles Today, a trade newspaper. ``People don't want anything
fussy or formal _ they want something airy and minimalist,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Foley, the president of CHF Industries in New York, one of
the world's largest ready-made curtain companies, estimates that
sheer and semisheer fabrics comprise 90 percent of the wholesale
market today, up from 50 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Products like the semisheer louvers called window shadings have
doubled in sales since they were introduced in the early 1990s;
purchases of once-trendy shutters, known as ``hard products,'' and
ready-made formal curtains are on the decline, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at ABC Carpet and Home, Saundra Smith, a customer,
grimaced as she flipped through swatches of chintz. ``The only
curtain I'll have in my home is one for the shower,'' she said. A
stay-at-home mother, Smith, 37, recently moved to a loft in Chelsea
where she installed only sheer shades, which she rarely closes. ``I
notice that all the lofts around us have no curtains in the windows
either,'' she said. ``And I just got the windows cleaned, so it
makes it even better.''

<P>
   Michael Sorkin, an architect and teacher, has no curtains in his
Greenwich Village apartment. ``I'm constantly flashing the
neighbors,'' he admitted. ``It's a way of making contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtainless living does create one problem. ``It's a struggle if
you want to sleep past dawn,'' he said. ``I have bags of those
masks that they give you on the airlines.''
</P>

   The New York designer Laura Bohn says of her clients, ``They'll
give up privacy any day before they'll give up a light airy
space.''

</P>
<P>
   Design magazines like Wallpaper rarely show windows swathed in
curtains. They are also getting harder to find in more traditional
shelter magazines. ``I think people are afraid of draperies because
when they're bad, they're very, very bad,'' said Dominique
Browning, editor of House &AMP; Garden. But, she added, ``When they are
good, they are beautiful.'' Her advice: only trust a master.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Hadley, the legendary New York decorator, after reviewing
the differences between curtains and draperies _ he never says
``drapes'' _ said that he prefers a simple window, often one with
no curtains at all.
</P>
<P>
   The English designer John Stefanidis took a similar tack in a
historic house in Providence, R.I., that is featured in the April
issue of Architectural Digest: curtainless windows _ all the
better, he explained, to showcase the bold neo-Classical details.

<P>
   If you're still set on the couture look and want to find it on a
budget, get thee to Target or Pottery Barn. The velvet curtains at
Target are $39 a panel; Pottery Barn's sell for $99.
</P>
<P>
   Celia Tejada, vice president of product design for Pottery Barn,
said that the chain's velvet line is still selling well _ but that
sales of sheer curtains are ``exploding.'' A 44-inch panel of
polycotton sheer is $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand drapes anymore,'' Gary Paul, an New
York architect, lamented. ``A drape is made to last, and there is
care involved in maintaining them. The idea of hanging something
that is made to last is competing with a society that is taught to
throw everything away.''
</P>
<P>
   But he too has opted for a fresher approach these days. He
recently designed a pied-a-terre for Derick and Suzanne Steinmann
that he referred to as ``pared down Park Avenue.'' In the formal
dining room are translucent Rogers &AMP; Goffignon linen sheers.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Many homeowners would simply rather spend their money elsewhere.
Leah Epstein, a stay-at-home mother living in Larchmont, N.Y.,
recently spent weeks looking at expensive window treatments
``because I started to feel like my life was a movie set,'' she
said, referring to a large picture window at her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I started to look at all the heavy chintz with the
box pleats, I started to panic,'' she added. ``My husband and I
would rather spend the thousands of dollars on a rug or an
antique.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Jones, a co-owner of La Regence on West 29th Street, one
of the few remaining workrooms in the city that make custom
draperies, said many of the younger clients don't plan to stay put
for for long enough to invest in permanent decor. ``I think they'd
rather spend that amount of money on something they can take with
them,'' she said, noting, however, that many of the sheer panels
she makes could cost just as much as heavy drapery or balloon
shapes: $600 to $800 for one window, prices she attributes in part
to labor costs. Gauzy Asian fabrics require hand finishing. Jones
employs eight finishers, compared with three just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Park Slope, Brooklyn, Nancy Polstein, 38, says old-fashioned
draperies ``feel stuffy and nasty.'' She's replacing the midnight
blue velvet ones with sari-inspired panels trimmed in gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern is that they are low maintenance,'' said
Polstein, an accountant who moonlights as a rock 'n' roll drummer.
``I'm really too busy to even care.''

YUGOSLAV STATE TV WITHDRAWS INVITATION TO OPPOSITION POLITICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In a bizarre reversal, Yugoslav state
television withdrew an invitation for an opposition politician to
appear on a live discussion show Wednesday night on the ground that
another opposition politician refused to appear.
</P>
<P>
   The official Radio Television Serbia at first canceled the
program altogether, less than an hour before it was to be broadcast
live, then went ahead with the broadcast, but without Zoran
Djindjic, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In a labored explanation by the announcer, the station said that
because another opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian
Renewal Movement, had refused to appear, ``we thought it would be
advisable to ask them again at another opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, who has not appeared on state television since 1994,
agreed to take part as an opportunity to win publicity for the
opposition, despite the topic of the program, ``The Fifth Column,''
designed to portray the opposition as traitors in the pay of the
NATO countries that bombed Serbia. Draskovic, who controls his own
television station, Studio B, refused to appear because he did not
want to let state television, ``which is a medium of state
propaganda, appear to be open and democratic,'' said one of his top
advisers, Ognjen Pribicevic.
</P>
<P>
   Coming just two days before a major opposition rally in Belgrade
on Friday, the incident made the government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic appear indecisive or even fearful of the impact
that Djindjic might make. Opposition officials assumed that state
television expected both opposition leaders would reject the
invitation to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, in an interview, Djindjic said he would
answer all criticisms and invite viewers to come to the rally
Friday ``to hear for themselves what these so-called traitors have
to say.'' The puzzle was less why he agreed to appear, he said,
``than why they decided to ask me.''
</P>
<P>
   The show went on with other scheduled politicians from each
party of the governing coalition: Vojislav Seselj, the leader of
the nationalist Radical Party; Nikola Sainovic of Milosevic's
Socialist Party (who has been indicted by the Hague tribunal for
his role in Kosovo); and Milovan Bojic of the Yugoslav United Left
party of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seselj said Djindjic was willing to come, ``but this would have
looked like the three of us were ganging up on this poor, lonely
Djindjic,'' and that Draskovic ``simply did not have the courage to
confront his opponents.'' He added that when the two opposition
leaders were ready to debate together, they should call, and
``we'll carry on this political struggle with the force of our
opinions through debate and not the lies and libels that Vuk
Draskovic indulges in.'' Draskovic, Seselj said, ``cannot be half
fish and half girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Bojic said that the two opposition leaders, saying they were now
united, had become a couple, and ``it would not have been within
the bounds of fair play simply to debate Mr. Djindjic.''
</P>
<P>
   But those explanations seemed lame, given that Djindjic was
quite happy to appear without his opposition rival, Draskovic, who
has himself not appeared on state television since he left the
federal government last year, during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The three politicians went on for two and a half hours to accuse
the opposition of being in the pay of Washington and attacked the
Serbs still in Kosovo for cooperating with the United Nations.

 &HT;    THREE MEXICAN AGENTS PROBING DRUG CARTEL WITH AMERICAN HELP
FOUND DEAD
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican authorities on Wednesday found the
battered bodies of three federal agents who were working with U.S.
law enforcement agencies to investigate a powerful drug cartel
along the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The agents were found dead in their car off a steep cliff along
a remote highway between the Baja California cities of Tijuana and
Mexicali.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths could be the latest in a long string of drug-related
killings of police and others investigating drug smuggling along
the border, especially in Tijuana, which is near San Diego, Calif.,
and Matamoros, which is near Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The agents' bodies showed no signs of gunshots and authorities
still don't know how they died, said a visibly upset Mariano Herran
Salvatti, Mexico's chief of federal anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference here Wednesday Herran said he couldn't be
sure yet if the agents' deaths were a message of intimidation. But
showing photos of bodies with massive head wounds, he praised the
agents' ``sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be stopped because of events like this,'' he said.
``We are going to redouble our efforts against drug traffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents were investigating the powerful Arellano Felix
cartel, an organized crime group that smuggles cocaine and other
drugs into the United States through the Tijuana area.
</P>
<P>
   The agents had been missing since Monday when they failed to
show up for an appointment in the border community of Otay Mesa,
Mexico, which is far from the area where their bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agents, Jose Patino Moreno, had requested more than
60 search warrants in the Tijuana area and other parts of northern
Mexico before he died, Herran said.
</P>
<P>
   The probe into the Arellano Felix organization was advancing
daily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Its most recent lines of investigation stemmed from the March 11
arrest of Jesus Labra Aviles, the alleged ``financial brain'' of
the Arellano Felix cartel, and the subsequent gangland-style
killing of Labra's lawyer, Gustavo Galvez Reyes, in Mexico City on
March 15.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the agents, Patino Moreno, was living in San
Diego for his personal safety while he worked on his investigation.
He was also living in San Diego because he was working closely with
agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI
who are also investigating the Arellano Felix group, Herran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start of our investigation and search for our
comrades we had the collaboration and support of the DEA and the
FBI,'' Herran added.
</P>
<P>
   The agents' deaths follow an execution-style killing Sunday of a
newspaper reporter on the opposite side the U.S.-Mexico border.
Pablo Pineda, who specialized in police corruption and drug
smuggling for the Matamoros newspaper La Opinion, was shot in the
head and dumped on the Texas side of the border. U.S. Border Patrol
agents found his body.
</P>
<P>
   The Tijuana area is notorious for scores of killings of federal,
state and local police who were targeted either because they were
honest and were investigating smugglers or because they were
corrupt and had crossed traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Tijuana has been plagued by almost daily violent
killings.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 27 Tijuana police chief Alfredo de la Torre Marquez was
machine-gunned to death while driving on a Tijuana avenue in broad
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   The killing occurred just days after President Ernesto Zedillo
visited the neighboring city of Mexicali and pledged to crack down
on organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Herran said state _ not federal _ authorities are investigating
the police chief's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Sanchez of Tijuana's College of the Northern Border, who
has studied public security in Baja California, said the state is
vulnerable to organized crime because of police corruption and a
lack of coordination between federal and state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Baja California is governed by the National Action Party, or
PAN, while the federal government is controlled by the dominant
Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mutually accuse each other of responsibility (for
violence),'' Sanchez said.

UNIONISTS PROTEST EASING OF TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 10,000 labor activists gathered at the US
Capitol Wednesday to protest the Clinton administration's proposal
to normalize trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 environmenalists arrived wearing bright-green sea
turtle costumes, in an expression of a belief that the World Trade
Organization is devastating the natural world. But for the most
part, the labor participants were focused exclusively on US China
policy, in contrast to the sweeping complaints of protesters
outside the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund across
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money,'' said Joe Teixeira, 42, a fork lift
operator from the Duro Finishing plant in Fall River, Mass. ``They
don't care about the little guys. Why would they want to deal with
a communist country? We're supposed to be the leader of the free
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal would normalize trade relations with China
for the foreseeable future, rather than require Congress to vote on
the trade status on a yearly basis, as it does now.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the measure argue that it would simply force China
to open its markets, saying the only US concession is the offering
of a constant, regulated trade accord.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the pact would undercut a labor force already
suffering from previous trade deals such as the North American Free
Trade Agreement. They also oppose the next step that the accord
would allow: China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting Congress on notice that the Teamsters Union is
100 percent opposed'' to the China pact, said the Teamsters general
president, James P. Hoffa said. ``We will do whatever it takes to
protect American workers and win this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration does not expect many, if any, of the
Massachusetts legislators to vote in favor of the measure. Both
Senator Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry have strongly favored
free-trade agreements, although neither has taken a position on
this measure yet.

CLINTON BACKS COLORADO GUN-CONTROL MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ President Clinton brought his gun-control campaign to
Ground Zero in the national debate over the issue, throwing his
support behind a statewide ballot effort that was prompted by the
worst school shooting in US history.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing here a week before the first anniversary of the
Columbine High School shooting, Clinton promoted a petition drive
to get an initiative on the November ballot that would require
background checks for firearm sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you're not alone; and second, America is listening. All
across America, people like you are speaking up,'' Clinton said at
a rally at the Colorado Convention Center that he estimated
attracted 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, several family members and friends of the victims
of the Columbine shooting in the Denver suburb of Littleton looked
on. The incident last April 20 in which two Columbine students
killed 12 young people and a teacher before turning the guns on
themselves shocked the nation and brought a sense of urgency in
some quarters of America for stiffer gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Columbine and other school shootings that have taken
place under his watch, Clinton said, ``I don't want any future
president to have to go to Columbine, or to Springfield, Ore., or
to Jonesboro, Ark., or to all the other places I have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough enough to comfort the families of our servicemen
and women who die in the line of duty,'' he said. ``Children have
no duties, except to their studies and their families. Our duty is
to protect their lives, and give them futures.''
</P>
<P>
   While applauding the effort in Colorado and in states like
Massachusetts, which recently instituted enforcing consumer product
safety rules for guns by banning so-called junk guns, requiring
child trigger locks and other devices to prevent children from
firing guns, Clinton argued that national legislation was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in America deserves these protections,'' he said.
``You deserve a national government that follows your lead, and
Congress is the only body that can provide the kind of national
approach we need to protect all the children in every state,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's visit here came just a day after he joined
Maryland Governor Parris Glendening as he signed a gun-safety law
requiring external trigger locks on new handguns sold in the state
beginning in October and built-in safety locks on new handguns sold
after 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's trip seemed to have more in common with the
struggle in Colorado than in Maryland's success.
</P>
<P>
   The group sponsoring the petition drive was founded after the
Colorado legislature defeated a bill that would have required
mandatory background checks on all firearm sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The group, called SAFE Colorado, which stands for Sane
Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic, was founded after the
Columbine shooting. Clinton has been highlighting efforts being
undertaken by the state to tighten gun control laws while being
frustrated over his own inability to get Congress to move on his
gun-control proposals. The group must collect at least 62,000
signatures by August to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been stalled since last May on a bill that would
promote child safety locks on guns, ban the importation of
high-capacity ammunition clips, bar juveniles from possessing
assault weapons, and prohibit youths with criminal records from
possessing handguns. It has deadlocked over the issue of background
checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a
Republican of Illinois, and Representative John Conyers of
Michigan, the committee's top Democrat, took steps to try to break
the logjam. They sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, urging him to
schedule a meeting to work out the House and Senate differences on
the gun provision. Clinton wants congressional leaders to act on
the legislation before they recess at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gun-show loophole is now a serious problem,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, an estimated 5 million attend more than 4,400 gun
shows across the country, according to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, Clinton was interrupted by a heckler concerned
about Iraq. Outside the convention center, a few demonstrators
protested Clinton's appearance and carried signs such as ``Gun
rights are human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Clinton said, ``It is true that even in Washington, not
every Democrat is for this legislation and not every Republican is
against it. This is largely a matter of political organization and
power among the opponents of this legislation...and a matter of
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later took part in town-hall meeting televised
nationally on MSNBC called ``Up in Arms: What Should Americans
Do?'' moderated by Tom Brokaw at Denver University.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw described Colorado as a state where the tension of the
old west meets the pressures of modern American. Clinton's
appearance in the state was rebuffed by the Repubican governor, who
refused to appear with the president at the rally or town-hall
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those tensions and the potency of the issue of gun
control, Clinton was optimistic. ``The fact that it's an election
year might help us to pass it,'' he said on the television program.
Clinton said all he wants is for America to be ``the safest big
country in the world.''

HAITI TO HOLD ELECTIONS IN MAY, US TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US officials have received assurances from Haiti's
president and its electoral commission that the country would hold
local elections on May 21 and seat a parliament in June, even if a
second round of runoff votes is not completed.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti, which has become extremely tense in the last two weeks
after several violent incidents, has been without a parliament
since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Wednesday the Clinton administration had hoped for a vote earlier
than May 21 ``but we have assurances that . . . the parliament will
be seated.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a parliament, Haiti cannot receive some of the financial
aid earmarked for it, the US official said.
</P>
<P>
   And if voting slides further in the year, it would come too near
the scheduled December presidential elections, in which former
president Jean-Bertrand Aristide is a favorite. Aristide also backs
the May 21 election date.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has agreed to send three or four electoral
experts to aid the commission, a second US official said. Technical
problems and political maneuvering led to delays in the vote, which
was first scheduled for last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming we now move forward, the other big issue is how to
keep the election from being the stimulus for violence between the
parties,'' the first US official said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington plans to send riot gear and transport equipment for
police, and officials have urged Aristide to speak out publicly
against the recent acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Anthony Lake, a US special envoy to Haiti, met with
Aristide in Miami to talk about elections and the recent violence
in Haiti, including the assassination of prominent radio journalist
Jean Dominique and the burning of the headquarters of an opposition
party. Lake also has talked with President Rene Preval and members
of the electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
   The US official said that the Americans have received agreement
specifically from Preval and members of the commission for the May
21 date and seating of the parliament on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Under Haiti's constitution, the parliament can be seated on only
two dates a year. One is the second Monday in June; the other is in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the second round of voting is past June 12, they said
they will find ways under the constitution to give parliament full
powers,'' the official said. ``This has been worked out between the
president and the electoral commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the chairman of the House International
Relations Committee, Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican,
called Haiti a ``narcostate'' at a committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face a grim future in our relationship with Haiti,'' Gilman
said. ``Without dramatic change, Haiti will become a criminal
organization shielded by the privileges of sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The first US official responded: ``Narcotics are a real problem,
and to deal with a real problem like narcotics, you need a
functioning government, you need a parliament. There's good news
ahead for that.''

 &HT;    Judge denies scope of legal strategy in Coke case
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal judge has weighed in on the confusion
created when four plaintiffs in the employee racial discrimination
suit against Coca-Cola retained a new lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story ruled Wednesday that Florida
attorney Willie Gary cannot participate in the settlement
discussions now under way between Coke and the attorneys who have
been handling the case for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came only a few hours after the four plaintiffs
explained to reporters that they hired Gary because of a lack of
trust in their previous attorneys, led by Cyrus Mehri.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship,''
plaintiff Gregory Allen Clark saidat a news conference. ``There
were insensitive responses to our questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a security officer, said that is why he and the three
other plaintiffs approached Mehri's legal team two weeks ago and
asked that an African-American lawyer be added. And they
specifically wanted Gary, a prominent attorney known for winning
large awards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clark said, he and two other plaintiffs received
letters from the Mehri team dismissing them as representatives of
the 2,000 prospective class members in the case. The class would
include current and former black salaried Coke employees in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I was discharged because I was seeking personal gain
over the class,'' Clark said. ``That is not true. ... This is not a
selfish move. This is a righteous move.''
</P>
<P>
   But the attorneys who have been handling the case of the eight
plaintiffs said they withdrew their representation of Clark and two
other plaintiffs for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   As prospective ``class representatives,'' each of the plaintiffs
are supposed to act in the best interest of everyone who could
benefit from a settlement or judgment. But Mehri's team said Clark
and the others did not do that.
</P>
<P>
   The falling-out may have been caused by a disagreement over how
a possible monetary settlement would be divided among the suit's
named plaintiffs and the prospective class members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish Mr. Clark and the others the best in their pursuit of
their individual claims,'' Mehri said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mehri's team is now pursuing a settlement on behalf of the four
plaintiffs who currently speak for the prospective class. As of
now, the four plaintiffs represented by Gary no longer speak for
the prospective class. Gary said he is only representing them as
individual plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gary also said he hoped to work with Mehri's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come to bring any disruption,'' Gary said at the
news conference. ``We wish all class members well and support the
class. ... Our fight is against Coke, not the lawyers in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Mehri's legal team concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with Mr. Gary that the common defendant is
Coca-Cola,'' said Byron Perkins of Gordon, Silberman, Wiggins &AMP;
Childs. ``Probably, we need to have a dialogue with Mr. Gary to
define what he means by work with, but certainly we will not do
anything to disparage his clients in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins' Birmingham-based firm was brought into the case Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What brings value with our participation in this case is that
our firm has extensive experience in representing plaintiffs in
both individual and class-action employment discrimination cases,''
Perkins said. ``The team that is participating in this case from
our firm has both black and white attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the plaintiffs sticking with the Mehri team
praised its efforts. Linda Ingram, a senior information analyst,
said the attorneys ``have represented the African-Americans of the
Coca-Cola Co. with the highest degree of integrity, professionalism
and concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed a year ago, alleges that Coca-Cola has
discriminated against African-American employees in pay, promotions
and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had no comment on Wednesday's developments,
has denied the allegations in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Clark, Gary is now representing former administrative
assistant Motisola Malikha Abdallah, former information systems
specialist Ajibola Laosebikan and assistant scientist Wanda
Williams. Williams, who was not dismissed by Mehri's legal team,
chose to join the other three plaintiffs who were.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Jones, a former Coke human resources manager organizing a
bus ``ride for justice'' to the company's annual meeting in
Delaware, attended Gary's news conference but said his presence
didn't indicate his preference for one legal team over the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the side of pushing Coke'' to settle the suit in a fair
and just manner for the employees, Jones said. If Mehri had called
a news conference, Jones said, he would attend that one, too.

CHINESE PRESIDENT VISITS ISRAEL AS U.S. PROTESTS AIRCRAFT DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Jiang Zemin of China flew into Israel and
a storm of controversy Wednesday as U.S. opposition to a planned
Israeli arms deal with his country overshadowed the first official
visit by a Chinese leader here.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, arriving at Ben-Gurion International Airport several
hundred yards from a rusting hangar that is home to an advanced
aircraft at the center of the controversy. For a year, technicians
from Israel Aircraft Industries have been outfitting a
Chinese-owned Ilyushin-76 with its advanced Phalcon airborne early
warning system. Crowned with an AWACS-style radar pod and crammed
with espionage gear, the droop-winged jet can monitor the movement
and communications of planes, ships and ground troops across 250
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is to hold talks Thursday with Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
who is flying home from a meeting at the White House, where
President Clinton reiterated Washington's objections to the sale.
In a suggested compromise that promises to satisfy neither
Washington nor Beijing, Barak is said to have told the Americans
that Israel would provide the Chinese with just one of the advanced
plane, although it had agreed to give them an option to purchase at
least three more.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. congressional leaders have threatened to cut military aid
to Israel in retaliation for the sale, which Pentagon officials say
could endanger United States forces in case of a Chinese
confrontation with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have adopted an almost defiant stance,
pointing to legal and ethical commitment to contracts. They also
noted that Washington did not object when Israel formally notified
it of the pending sale four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be put in a situation whereby we cannot act
without authorization from every country,'' Foreign Minister David
Levy said Wednesday morning on Israel Radio. ``Clearly we will not
do something that harms the United States. But at the same time,
the United States must understand that we are a country like every
other country and we are also working to further our interests,
just as it does _ even with China.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official stressed that Washington was
concerned not just by the Phalcon transaction, but also by the
entire ``developing defense relationship'' between Israel and
China. U.S. officials cite China's new J-10 jet fighter, which
defense experts say is based on an Israeli prototype developed with
U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis continue to argue that a closer relationship with
the Chinese military can help Israel dissuade Beijing from
supplying sophisticated weaponry to Iraq and Iran, despite
persistent reports that some Israeli-assisted Chinese arms
technology may have already indirectly found its way to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The experts also dispute a contention that Israel would be
supplying China an airborne surveillance system that it could not
obtain elsewhere. When Israel was negotiating for the contract, the
experts said, at least one European company, now part of a giant
British military contractor, BAE Systems, was also bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Israel cancels the deal today, with all that implies in
terms of our future interests, would other countries, especially
European countries, not fill this niche?'' Levy asked. ``There
should be no delusions here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's visit is planned as the culmination of a long courtship,
intended to open China to Israeli commerce and pry Beijing from its
once-staunch support for Israel's adversaries in the Arab world. In
a weeklong stay interrupted by day trips to Egypt and
Palestinian-governed Bethlehem, Jiang will visit Yad Vashem, the
Holocaust memorial, and the Western Wall in the Old City of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At his request, he will also tour software centers in Tel Aviv,
where China is seen as a prime market. But with the AWACS
controversy unexpectedly clouding the visit, Israeli officials are
scaling back economic expectations for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Even one Phalcon plane, at a reported $250 million, would
represent more than a doubling of annual Israeli sales to China.
Last year, two-way trade between Israel and China reached $520
million, with Israel exporting $190 million.
</P>
<P>
   Four Phalcon-equipped planes _ the price would come down to $230
million each, industry executives have said _ would together
represent one of the largest foreign contracts ever for Israel
Aircraft Industries. With 14,000 workers and $1.5 billion in
foreign sales last year, the state-owned company is the single
biggest employer and export earner in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not do anything which could upset or damage our
relations with the United States,'' Levy said. ``On the other hand,
we cannot tell the Chinese that our promises are not promises and
our oaths are not oaths or our signature is not a signature.''

CONSERVATIVES PROTEST GRASSROOTS.COM, LWV DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A deal between a Web company and the League of Women Voters is
being criticized by a conservative lobbying group, which wants the
government to launch a broad review of online political activities.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Grassroots.com, runs one of a new group of sites
that aim to draw in users with material about candidates and local
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sites &UR;  &LR;  earn revenue by charging candidates to
publish their literature or to forward e-mail to certain voters.
</P>
<P>
   Grassroots offers similar services, and in February it struck a
deal with the League of Women Voters to publish information on
local and national elections and to make use of the League's large
network of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the League received an ownership stake in Grassroots,
a for-profit company based in San Bruno, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The league said the deal was needed to obtain more money to
promote its online efforts, which also include a nonprofit known as
DNet. Other Grassroots backers including Knight Ridder Inc., the
big newspaper publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrangement with Grassroots has drawn objections within
the League and from other activists, who felt it could compromise
the League's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, they're auctioning off control of the public
agenda,'' said Scott Reents, president of the rival
democracyproject.org site in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives also groused at the league's arrangement. In a
complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission this week, the
National Legal and Policy Center alleges Grassroots' service
amounts to a ``commercial venture providing highly valuable goods
and services without charge to candidates,'' in violation of
elections laws.
</P>
<P>
   The center has been a frequent critic of Democrats such as
Hillary Clinton and the Teamsters Union. Now it wants the elections
commission to review an advisory opinion issued last October
approving the league's DNet activities. It said the approval
shouldn't apply to the league's for-profit ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Flaherty, the center's president, called the league's
actions ``a bait-and-switch'' and said he will seek fines and other
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the league and Grassroots denied there was
subterfuge and noted that the FEC last fall approved the actions of
a for-profit political Web site as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This complaint raises questions that have already been
answered by the FEC'' in the company's favor, said Craig Johnson,
the Grassroots' interim chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the sites are nonpartisan and offer equal access to
all candidates, he said, prohibitions on their corporate activities
shouldn't apply.
</P>
<P>
   Grassroots has raised about $35 million in venture capital from
investors including Knight Ridder. A Knight Ridder spokeswoman
didn't return calls seeking comment.

SENATE, BUCKING THE HOUSE, PROPOSES SHARING ORGAN TRANSPLANTS
NATIONALLY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md., Pa., Neb., Va., Fla., Tenn., Mass.)  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With support from the Clinton administration, the
Senate Wednesday took a bipartisan crack at breaking the political
deadlock over organ transplants, but the House of Representatives
remains committed to an entirely different approach.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are whether donated organs should be distributed
locally or nationally when they become available and whether
decisions about these scarce resources should be made primarily by
the private sector or the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate health committee Wednesday unanimously approved a
bill that would make it the national policy to reduce the
geographical disparities in the availability of organs for
transplant. The bill would establish a mediation system to resolve
disputes over organ allocation between the Department of Health and
Human Services and the private organization that runs the
distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the legislation were worked out by Sen. Bill
Frist, R-Tenn.; Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; and Donna E.
Shalala, the secretary of health and human services.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been arguing for years that organs should
be shared broadly throughout the country, with the sickest patients
generally given priority. The Senate bill would make that possible.
</P>
<P>
   Under the existing system, authority for organ distribution
rests with a private nonprofit organization, the United Network for
Organ Sharing. The country is divided into 62 localities. When an
organ becomes available, it is offered locally first. The waiting
period varies considerably by town and region.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, by a margin of nearly 2-to-1, the House passed a bill
that would have the effect of maintaining this system and
preventing national distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The main advocates of the House bill, Reps. Thomas J. Bliley Jr.
of Virginia, chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Michael
Bilirakis of Florida, chairman of the health subcommittee, both
Republicans, would not comment Wednesday on the Senate bill. But a
House staff assistant who has been following the legislation
closely said, ``We are still on opposite sides of the Grand Canyon
on this.''
</P>
<P>
   A Senate staff expert conceded, ``We have a long, long way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences are parochial and not partisan. In the House,
politicians from Virginia voted one way and those from Maryland the
other, regardless of party. The same was true with representatives
from Kansas and Nebraska and those from New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The determining factor is that large transplant centers like
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, the Lied Transplant Center in Omaha and
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center believe they would have
better access to needed organs from a national system. Smaller
transplant centers are afraid they will be put out of business by
the giants.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 278
hospitals in the nation perform organ transplants, and most of them
are relatively small. That has considerable influence on members of
the House, many of whom have small hospitals that perform
transplants in their districts or in adjacent ones.
</P>
<P>
   A political counterbalance to this could be the authority
exercised by Frist, who was a transplant surgeon before he was
elected to the Senate in 1994 and who founded a small transplant
center at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there are too few organs to go around, how we distribute
the organs that are available decides who will live and who will
die,'' Frist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The chief factors, he said, should be ``scientific data, medical
principles and equity.''

HOUSE OK'S HEATING OIL RESERVE FOR NORTHEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aiming to stop the heating oil price spikes that
afflicted New England homeowners this winter, the House of
Representatives Wednesday voted to create a government-controlled
reserve of heating oil in the Northeast that could be released
during ``severe'' price hikes or supply shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, drafted by Representative Edward J. Markey,
Democrat of Massachusetts, has the support of President Clinton,
but its Senate prospects are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Home heating oil prices nearly tripled within a few weeks this
year, thanks to a slowdown in OPEC production and because a mild
winter turned suddenly colder, creating strong demand at a time of
low inventories. Iced-in harbors also made it hard for tankers to
make deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The price hikes hit hardest in the Northeast, as the region
relies heavily on heating oil to heat homes.
</P>
<P>
   The new, 2 million barrel heating oil reserve would be in
addition to the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which
contains about 570 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The national reserve is intended to keep the nation running
during severe energy supply disruptions, generally interpreted to
mean wartime or a cutoff by foreign producers. Presidents have been
reluctant to release oil to manipulate market prices and give
consumers relief.
</P>
<P>
   Looser rules would guide the release of heating oil from the new
Northeast reserve. The president could sell oil from the reserve
into the market when there are ``severe'' price increases or other
emergencies affecting supplies in the region. Under the bill, this
winter's price spikes and low supplies ``would be a prime
candidate'' for triggering a release from the reserves, one
congressional aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, said the
reserve would ``do more harm than good,'' encouraging wholesalers
and distributors to keep stocks at low levels, so that the total
volume of heating oil on hand would not change. Moreover, ``the
high cost of operating the reserve would fall upon taxpayers and
consumers,'' the trade group said in a recent policy statement.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve would be managed by the US Department of Energy,
which would likely lease storage space in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the measure in a lopsided 416-8 vote, largely
because Texas lawmakers won a provision that requires the
government to buy oil from certain producers when prices plummet.
</P>
<P>
   As heating oil prices rose this winter, a variety of Northeast
lawmakers called on President Clinton to sell oil from the national
reserve, but he resisted. He took several other actions, such as
releasing emergency aid for low-income people to buy heating oil.
He also called on Congress to create a Northeast reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the idea in the Senate is uncertain. Senator Edward
M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has introduced a bill requiring
wholesalers to keep heating oil reserves at a certain level as a
cushion against shortages and price runups. Senators from New York
and Maine have proposed changing the mission of the national
reserves so that the president could release oil more easily. But
it is unknown whether Northeast senators can win votes from other
regions of the country.

 &HT;    Marvel's Stan Lee takes on Super role
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holy Switcheroo!
</P>
<P>
   Stan Lee, who helped spawn Spider-Man and a universe of other
superheroes for Marvel Comics, is leaping in a single bound to work
for DC Comics, his former arch-rival.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 77, will perform a makeover of Superman, the
Kryptonite-challenged Man of Steel. For decades at the helm of
Marvel Comics, Lee-inspired characters were often imbued with
all-too human foibles.
</P>
<P>
   The newly minted Superman will debut in a 12-part serial this
year. Other DC characters _ Batman, the Flash and Wonder Woman _
will also get the Lee treatment.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee relinquished the reins at Marvel, the company was
bought, sold and filed for bankruptcy. Two years ago Marvel
released Lee from a no-compete commitment. News of Lee's new job
caused a shake-up in the comic publishing world. But Dick Schwartz,
owner of the Comic Book Co. in Decatur, Ga., wasn't getting his
cape in a bind over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the old days when it was just DC and Marvel
putting out comics,'' he said. ``There are so many high-quality
books out there this won't make much of a difference.''

 &HT;    RENO MEETS WITH ELIAN'S MIAMI RELATIVES IN EFFORT TO END IMPASSE
 &HT;    EDS: Story will be updated later this evening after Reno ends
her meeting with the Miami relatives.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ After a day of false starts and confusion,
Attorney General Janet Reno jetted to Miami late Wednesday and met
with the Florida relatives of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez in a last-ditch bid to break the long-running stalemate
over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to do anything possible to resolve this,'' said
Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin. ``She realizes it's a
tall order, but believes she may be the one who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Miami relatives, who have complained
repeatedly that top federal officials have never listened to their
side of the controversy, called Reno's visit a ``good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, remained in the
Washington, D.C. area, where he has been staying at the home of a
Cuban diplomat since his arrival from Cuba last week. There were
unconfirmed reports that he might join in Reno's meeting with his
Miami relatives via telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez told supporters Wednesday that he has grown
exasperated with the repeated delays in gaining custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'I came here seven days ago, I came to get my boy, I
watch him on TV and they still haven't brought him to me,''' said
the Rev. Joan Brown-Campbell, former head of the National Council
of Churches, who met with Gonzalez Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris
Meissner, Reno arrived in Miami about 6 p.m. (ET) on a mission to
resolve the standoff peacefully, hoping to avoid sending federal
marshals to retrieve the boy in the face of angry Cuban exile
protestors. Justice Department officials have prepared a letter
ordering the family to turn the boy over _ perhaps as early as
Thursday at an airport north of Miami _ in case the family fails to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place at the Miami Beach home of Barry
University President Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, who hosted a
dramatic reunion between Elian and his two Cuban grandmothers in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his Miami relatives moved to O'Laughlin's home at
mid-day Wednesday in an effort to escape the tension surrounding
the family's tiny Little Havana home. Boisterous crowds of Cuban
exiles have staged an around-the-clock vigil outside the home for
much of the past week, and have vowed to form a human chain to keep
the boy from being removed.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 protestors jeered as Reno's motorcade pulled up to
O'Laughlin's home at 6:40 p.m., with some holding signs depicting
Reno with devil's horns. Miami Beach police erected metal fencing
to keep the demonstrators on the far side of a divided road in
front of the home, and dozens of officers patrolled the area.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have been unwilling to turn the boy over
without assurances that he would not be quickly taken back to Cuba.
They have also demanded that Elian be allowed to go home with them
after any initial meeting with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of events came after a failed attempt at a family
conference late Tuesday. About 11 p.m., officials from the powerful
Cuban American National Foundation announced that the Miami
relatives would travel to Washington Wednesday with Elian for a
meeting with the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, however, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzales,
backed out, saying that Elian feared his father and that the two
sides apparently misunderstood the terms for the meeting. Gonzalez
said he learned that Elian's father expected the Miami relatives to
turn the boy over before their meeting, and the Miami family
refused to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Although the quickening pace seemed to indicate the standoff
might soon be resolved, there was still a chance for further
delays. Without the family's cooperation, Reno was expected to send
the letter informing them when and where Elian should be turned
over.
</P>
<P>
   If the family failed to abide by the letter, Justice Department
officials said they would probably go to a federal court seeking an
order that they cooperate. It was unclear how long it might take to
obtain such an order.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives might also try a last-second court move,
perhaps asking the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
for an emergency injunction blocking the hand-over. The family's
appeal of their lawsuit in the case is pending in that court,
scheduled to be heard on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   It also remained unclear whether Juan Miguel Gonzalez would
remain in the United States once he is reunited with his son. He
has said he would be willing to stay pending the legal appeal if
the Miami family voluntarily turned over his son, and if an
entourage of Elian's teachers, classmates and others could join him
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   According to members of a team of mental health experts
appointed by Reno to help ease the boy's transition, Reno and INS
officials want both sides of the family to go to a secure, neutral
location for an extended reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``INS proposed that the families come together at a neutral
location without any outside people present and that they might
remain together for one or two weeks,'' Dr. Jerry Wiener told CNN.
Wiener and the other team members met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez
last weekend and briefly with Elian's Miami relatives on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian would see that some peace would be made, and the Miami
family would be able to continue to have a relationship with him,''
Wiener said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Miami family would cooperate remained to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Before Reno arrived, O'Laughlin made brief remarks to the press,
indicating that the family may be coming to grips with the
likelihood of losing their long battle to keep Elian in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family is becoming more reconciled in facing what
perhaps could be pain,'' O'Laughlin said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The biggest bull market in the history of the Nasdaq
stock market has given way to the fastest bear market ever, as
technology stocks have gone from stars to stumblers.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday's decline of 286.27 points, or 7.06 percent, to
3,769.63, the Nasdaq composite index is down 25.3 percent from the
high it set just over a month ago, on March 10. It was the sixth
worst day in Nasdaq history on a percentage basis, and left the
index at its lowest level since early January.
</P>
<P>
   A 20 percent fall from a peak is traditionally viewed as an
indication of a bear market, although that definition may be less
relevant now, given the unprecedented volatility of the market, in
which a stock can rise or fall rapidly within minutes, even without
any particular news regarding the company.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been some bad news from what have been the hottest
industries. ``We are starting to get information on technology
fundamentals that are coming in well below expectations,'' said
Douglas J. Cliggott, a stock market strategist for J.P. Morgan,
pointing to a slowdown in the rate of growth in factory orders for
communications equipment and to Motorola's warning that profits
from cellular telephone handsets will be disappointing. ``Here you
have a product that is becoming ubiquitous, and yet a leading
company is having trouble,'' he said. Motorola, traded on the New
York Stock Exchange, is down $35 to $116 in the two days since it
issued its profit warning.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Microsoft fell $4.50 to $79.375, trading at its
lowest level since June, after Richard Sherlund, an analyst for
Goldman, Sachs warned that a slowdown in personal computer sales
was affecting Microsoft's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The fall, if it continues, could help to slow the economy. ``The
more work the stock market does to cool off the economy, then
presumably the less work higher interest rates have to do,'' said
Joshua N. Feinman, an economist with Deutsche Asset Management.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has
cited the spending of stock market wealth as one reason for growth
so rapid that it has kindled inflation fears.
</P>
<P>
   Though technology stocks have been very weak, the Nasdaq decline
has not come at a time when all stocks are being pummeled. Since
the Nasdaq peaked on March 10, the Dow Jones industrial average has
risen 12 percent, although the Dow, after being up for most of
Wednesday, also turned down in late trading. Some parts of Nasdaq,
most notably the Nasdaq bank index, have even done well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this has been a case of the last becoming first, almost
overnight, and vice versa. Bed Bath and Beyond, a retailer, was one
of the worst performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 from the end of
1999 through the Nasdaq peak on March 10. It has been the best
performer since then. Network Appliance, a maker of computer
servers, was one of the best performers early in the year, but has
lost about half its value since then.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of this bear market, if that is what it should be
called, is also less pronounced because Nasdaq had run up so far,
so fast, before it began to slide. As a result, only those who got
in very recently have substantial cash losses.
</P>
<P>
   There may, however, be many such people. ``Judging by the margin
debt numbers, I suspect there are a lot of people who bought in
recent months, and are starting to really hurt,'' said Edward
Nicoski, a market strategist for US Bancorp Piper Jaffray. Those
figures, on the amount of money borrowed to buy stocks, began to
climb rapidly last October.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Nasdaq composite was twice as high as it
had been a year before _ a feat the market had never before
accomplished. Even with the latest decline, the Nasdaq composite is
still trading above where it was as recently as Jan. 6, little more
than three months ago. By contrast, in most of the previous bear
markets, a 20 percent decline cut prices to their lowest level in
at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly three decades since the Nasdaq market was
established in 1971, there have been just nine bear markets _
defined as a fall of at least 20 percent from a peak. The most
recent one, a 29.6 percent retreat in 1998, had set the record for
fastest fall as the index took just 30 trading days to drop 20
percent. The latest fall took 23 trading days.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's 1998 decline was part of a worldwide stock market
slide, and was soon reversed as the Federal Reserve, worried about
a world recession, began to cut interest rates. The Nasdaq
composite made up all of its losses, and was setting new highs
again, by the end of November, just three months after it fell 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just what has brought on the latest sharp fall is far from
clear. The Fed has been raising short-term interest rates, but it
began that process last June and was doing so as the Nasdaq doubled
from last summer through the peak last month, while new Internet
stocks doubled and tripled in their first day of trading. Many of
those once hot issues have fallen sharply. Akamai Technologies, an
Internet company, saw its shares more than quintuple to above $145
on the day it went public in October and peak earlier this year at
$345, but Wednesday they fell $15 to $92.75.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who were pouring record amounts of money into
technology-heavy mutual funds earlier this year are no longer quite
so eager, and in the latest week's report actually withdrew some
money, according to AMG Data Services. Many investors who bought
because prices were rising may have now fled.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that may have contributed to the current decline is
the looming deadline on Monday for paying last year's income taxes.
Traders who made a lot on Nasdaq stocks last year may owe large
amounts, with most of their gains taxable at higher ordinary income
rates because the 20 percent capital gains rate is available to
taxpayers in high brackets only for stocks held more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts looking for a silver lining noted that the
Nasdaq composite has still not fallen as far as it did during the
hectic action of April 4, little more than a week ago. During early
afternoon that day, the index had recorded a daily decline of more
than 12 percent, to 3,649, before rallying sharply to close at
4,149. ``It looks like a test of the climactic low,'' said Richard
McCabe, the chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Nasdaq market rallies from here, though, may depend
on the willingness of investors to bet more money on the so-called
``new economy'' stocks that are expected to prosper in the Internet
economy and that were bid up rapidly in 1999 and early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent decline, the Nasdaq composite is up 45
percent from its level exactly one year ago, while the Dow Jones
industrial average is up less than 8 percent. Those numbers reflect
just how unusual the market was during the past year, when large
established companies saw their stocks gain little or, in many
cases, decline, while younger companies with little in the way of
operating history and no profits caught the attention of investors
and soared.

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIRGIN-SUICIDES-FILM (Undated) _ In ``The Virgin Suicides,'' the
dreamy first feature film written and directed by Sofia Coppola,
five sisters, ages 13 to 17, who live in a leafy Michigan suburb in
the 1970s inexplicably and matter-of-factly kill themselves. Their
story, an unsolved mystery laced with lust, obsession, longing,
fantasies and gilded memories, is recounted 25 years after by a
neighborhood boy, now a rueful adult, who worshiped Therese, Mary,
Bonnie, Lux and Cecilia Lisbon from afar. Adapted from Jeffrey
Eugenides's lyrical 1993 novel, the movie might have been a
prurient wander through the bedrooms of its lovely nymphs, an
exploitative riff on teenage angst, or a cautionary drama _ think
``Five American Beauties, Interrupted'' _ with an earnest social
message. But what Coppola has made of it is a haunting metaphysical
celebration with the aura of a myth. By Graham Fuller. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SISKEL-EBERT-FILMS (Undated) _ Watching ``Siskel and Ebert at
the Movies'' was a bit like being fed intravenously: you never
tasted anything, but eventually you felt a kind of ghostly
satiation. The show's appeal derived less from its film snippets
and critical insights than from the banter between the cheery,
chubby Roger Ebert and the diffident Gene Siskel, a dour presence
with the silhouette of a roll-on deodorant. As a team, these two
Chicago newspapermen lacked the easy rapport of, say, Hope and
Crosby, or the bittersweet camaraderie of Laurel and Hardy. What
they shared was a chafing testiness _ a novelty among TV co-hosts.
Siskel died at the age of 53 in February 1999. Since then, his
chair has been warmed by the rumps of reviewers drawn from a
defective Gene pool. Sessions have tended to play out like first
dates: guest critics seem more intent on pleasing Ebert than on
engaging him. By Franz Lidz. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK-FILMS (Undated) _ Stanley Kubrick's death last spring,
followed by the release of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' revived a
long-running argument among critics and fans about whether Kubrick
was one of the most important contemporary filmmakers or merely
among the most self-important _ an avatar of cinematic perfection
or a cold, detached perfectionist. The debate shows no signs of
ending any time soon. Last month, Vanity Fair published a long,
passionate defense of Kubrick, and in particular of his widely
unloved last work, by his friend and sometime collaborator Michael
Herr. And beginning Friday, Film Forum will provide fuel for many
nights of heated cafe-table contention as it mounts a three-week
retrospective of the director's work. By A.O. Scott. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SILVERS-DANCE (New York) _ Sally Silvers calls herself a dancer
and a choreographer, but by many conventional measures she
resembles neither. She has never succeeded at an audition, or
joined a professional dance company, or started a troupe of her
own. Even so, Silvers exerts a palpable force within the downtown
dance scene, both as a performer of striking intensity and as a
creator of wildly original movement. Her newest piece, ``Storming
Heaven,'' will have its premiere on April 26 at the Kitchen.
Inspired partly by Luigi Nono, who was Italy's leading postwar
avant-garde composer,it chronicles a series of revolutions from the
Paris Commune of 1871 to the Zapatista rebellion that began six
years ago in Chiapas, Mexico. By Christopher Reardon. (Moved). WITH

<P>
   REAL-THING-THEATER (London) _ ``The Real Thing,'' which won
Jeremy Irons a Tony Award for best actor in 1984, is back on
Broadway this season, opening Monday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater
in Manhattan. The acclaimed revival originated last summer at the
Donmar Warehouse here and later transferred to a commercial run in
the West End. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JACOBI-THEATER (Undated) _ The truth about Derek Jacobi, one of
the most emotionally potent British classical actors of his
generation, is that he has never known how to take a bow. He
loathes being singled out for approval. To him it is a degrading
spectacle, a charade. In fact, his aversion proved so vexing to his
mentor, Laurence Olivier, that one day, after a performance of the
Peter Shaffer play ``Black Comedy,'' Olivier took his protege aside
and offered a fatherly reprimand. ``He said,'' Jacobi recalled,
```If you have pretensions of being a leading actor you must learn
how to take a curtain call.''' Audiences at ``Uncle Vanya,'' the
new Roundabout Theater Company production in which Jacobi makes his
first Broadway appearance in more than a decade, will easily spot
him during the curtain call: he's the one looking as if he'd rather
be doing his taxes. By Peter Marks. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-SOUNDS (Windhoek, Namibia) _ Every composer, conductor,
musicologist and critic ought to be forced to spend time in places
like West Africa. The shrinkage of stature would both alarm and
instruct them. By day there is the overwhelming silence of the
bush. At night one hears the community and the competition. Lions
moan in tall grass; hippopotamuses grunt in bursts of three as they
come from the water to feed on the rushes around you; baboons
engage in high-decibel argument. Each is saying to the bush, ``I am
here, and this is who I am.'' Anyone pondering the meaning of art
might give a listen to the birds and animals of the Okovanggo
Basin. The sounds they make are both warning and welcome, but
mostly they are acts of self-expression and thus self-preservation.
By Bernard Holland. (Moved).  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-FIDELITY-FILM (Undated) _ These days, everyone assumes that
the serious music fan is an arrested adolescent. Nick Hornby's 1995
novel, ``High Fidelity,'' captured the paralyzed mental state of
smart males whose emotional lives revolve around cultural product,
not people. Now his characters have been made into Hollywood
archetypes by the director Stephen Frears and the actor John
Cusack. By Ann Powers. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALTERNATIVE-COUNTRY (Undated) _ As Nashville, the music machine,
has become bigger and blander, Nashville the city _ along with its
kindred planet in Austin, Texas _ has become the center of an
increasingly diverse and intriguing array of American music rooted
in country with strains of folk, rock, bluegrass, rockabilly and
blues. At various times called Americana, alternative country, No
Depression or insurgent country, it's really too loose and untidy a
mongrel, or pack of vaguely allied mongrels, to fit into any real
niche _ certainly not the niche played on country radio. It's so
amorphous that No Depression magazine, the most clued-in
publication following the music, describes itself as ``the
alternative country (whatever that is) bimonthly.'' By Peter
Applebome. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROCK-FILMS (New York) _ A few weeks ago at the Pioneer Theater
in Manhattan, the director Amos Poe introduced ``The Blank
Generation,'' his rough-hewn documentary of early punk rock shows,
shot on 16-mm film in 1976 and rarely seen since. But the program
of rare punk and new wave films being shown at the theater,
including several weeks of the intimate, sometimes amazing series
called ``Nightclubbing,'' shot at CBGB (the Dealey Plaza of punk
rock) and other New York clubs from 1975 to 1980, substantiate
Poe's showy claim for the era. (The series will end on May 24.) By
Rob Tannenbaum. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   UNTRENDY-ART (New York) _ ``Greater New York,'' at P.S. 1
Contemporary Art Center, the newly annexed Queens outpost of the
Museum of Modern Art, is a spirited affair that rounds up enough
youngish artists (146 in all) to start a day camp. The 2000
Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art, despite its
broader, cross-the-country sweep, is similarly well-stocked with
unfamiliar names; its (97) artists do not include Jasper Johns,
Brice Marden or any other sacred cows. The latest art-world trend
is untrendy artists. By Deborah Solomon. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXIT-ART-CENTER (New York) _ Some art centers are born with
well-defined missions in mind and sizable budgets to help make
their most ambitious programming dreams come true. Others are
fueled more by can-do spirit and make-do inventiveness. In New
York, some seemingly well-financed places flounder or disappear
even after presenting good, memorable shows. And then there are the
offbeat, sometimes more impulsive art outposts that pop up and,
despite the odds, hang on for years and unexpectedly become
important, even treasured institutions. Exit Art/The First World is
one such irascible survivor. Now, with a retrospective exhibition
titled ``The End: An Independent Vision of Contemporary Culture,
1982-2000,'' the nonprofit arts center, which has become an
essential stop for professionals and enthusiasts alike. is
celebrating _ and dutifully analyzing _ its own history since its
founding 18 years ago. By Edward M. Gomez. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GREEN-ARCHITECTURE-SHOW (New York) _ ``Ten Shades of Green,''
the new architecture show at the Urban Center, should not just be
seen. It should be enacted into law. All those pols who march on
St. Patrick's Day each year would perform a public service by
lining up for this Green parade. Especially if non-attendance were
construed as a tacit attack on the right to breathe. The subject of
the show is sustainable architecture, energy-efficient buildings
that reduce air pollutants and cut dependence on fossil fuel. By
Herbert Muschamp. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   TV-MENTAL-ENGINEERING (Undated) _ ``Mental Engineering,'' the
low-budget PBS talk show, may be the only television show ever to
take aim at big business in the vast, gushy spot where it is most
vulnerable: advertising. Each episode dissects and deconstructs
four broadcast commercials, with its host, John Forde egging on his
guests with questions like, ``For most Americans, is money the
slave or the master?'' and, ``Do third world citizens see investors
as coming to help?'' By Karen Schoemer. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-CARTOON-NETWORK (New York) _ His name: Sheep. His creator: Mo
Willems, a New York University film major and onetime downtown
performance artist who had a dream of taking an animated
wool-bearer out of the barnyard and into the limelight. Willems,
32, and a phalanx of artists, writers and computer types, in a
bustling studio in SoHo, are now churning out the storyboards for
the first 13 episodes of ``Sheep in the Big City,'' which is to bow

   CHICAGO _ Consider the Braves exposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the cold of Wrigley Field, the NL Central bottom-dwelling
Cubs have found the worst in the Braves and pounced on it.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of three-run home runs by Shane Andrews cut to the core
of the Braves' pitching problems. Andrews' first homer beat Kerry
Ligtenberg on Monday. His second, in his next at-bat, helped beat
former Cub Terry Mulholland 11-4 on Wednesday. The Cubs won two
games in a row for the first time this season, and the Braves lost
two in a row for the first time. The Braves, who will lose their
first series of the season, are now 1-9 in their last 10 games at
Wrigley Field, with one more game to play today.
</P>
<P>
   In a repeat of his last outing against the Giants, Mulholland
gave up three more home runs and reeled in another loss. He also
compounded the doubts about keeping a 37-year-old journeyman in the
rotation. He is 0-2 with a 12.96 ERA and has yet to make it out of
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stunk. I flat-out stunk,'' Mulholland said. ``I'm
embarrassed to be out there throwing the ball like I'm throwing it
right now. It's not fair to the other guys on this club to put up
that kind of performance while they're busting their butts to try
to get back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   His outing overshadowed a big day from Chipper Jones. The third
baseman homered twice to give him three in the two-game series and
drove in all four Braves runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned the corner, I think, but it certainly takes some of
the luster out of it, not playing well as a team,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   After two trips through the rotation, the Braves still have some
pitching decisions to make. Their Band-Aid approach to the loss of
John Smoltz has resulted in 13 runs given up and two loses, and
they haven't had to worry about a fifth starter yet.
</P>
<P>
   The same possibilities they have for a fifth starter _ Bruce
Chen, John Burkett, Luis Rivera and, eventually, Steve Avery _
would seem logical for the fourth, if they don't look outside the
organization first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when we've had problems, we've fixed them,'' Jones
said. ``I'm sure it'll come internally. . . . It's weird, because I
feel like everybody is still getting used to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland said he had no business pitching the Cubs inside the
way he did in the first inning, when he surrendered a double to
Eric Young, a walk to Sammy Sosa, a single to Glenallen Hill and
the homer to Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   But that inning wasn't as tough to take as the fifth, when he
gave up four more runs, three on a three-run homer to Hill on an
inside fastball, after the Braves had cut the lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   His six home runs allowed is one more than Mulholland gave up in
16 outings for the Braves last season after arriving in the July 31
trade with the Cubs.

6-YEAR-OLD CAN'T MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taken at their word, Elian Gonzalez' relatives in
Miami canceled a long-awaited meeting with Elian's father in
Washington Wednesday _ which presumably would have hastened the
conclusion of an emotional international custody battle _ because a
6-year-old boy didn't want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in child development and psychology, however, agree that
no one as young as Elian is capable of understanding abstract
notions such as death, freedom, or permanence, much less the
complex concepts involved in life-altering decisions such as where
to live for the rest of his life or with whom.
</P>
<P>
   They warn that elevating a child's sense of self-importance to
such a high level, as often happens during divorces and other
custody disputes, can result in a psychic ``crash'' that leaves
lingering scars when a boy or girl inevitably realizes how little
power he or she really has. And that is only one aspect of
childhood development that specialists say the Gonzalez family in
Miami apparently either hasn't fully considered or doesn't
understand.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Catherine Snow heard that Elian's great
uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, had cited the boy's desire as the reason
for canceling the meeting with his father, she believed Elian
probably had expressed reluctance. She thought, however, that he
had reflected the sentiments instilled by the adults around him and
not necessarily his real feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Weiner found Lazaro Gonzalez's explanation ``bizarre'' and
``incredible'' because ``nobody with any proper knowledge or
appreciation of childhood would allow a child that young to make
such a critical decision.'' Mainly, he wondered if Elian's
purported veto was just a handy excuse for an adult looking for
one.
</P>
<P>
   Snow is a childhood-development specialist at the Harvard
Graduate School of Education, and Weiner, a psychiatrist, is one of
three prominent mental-health experts advising the federal
government on Elian's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cuban-Americans in Miami, along with Elian's family there
and their lawyers, have repeatedly urged federal officials to
consider the boy's desires when deciding his fate.
</P>
<P>
   Without discussing the politics of the case or offering opinions
about the eventual outcome, many of those interviewed Wednesday
suggested Elian's current guardians are behaving irresponsibly if
they believe a 6-year-old should have a say in either the custody
battle _ unless he provides evidence of abuse or some other extreme
behavior _ or the logistics of a meeting with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might ask them what they want in order to understand what
they're thinking, what their fears are and to determine how best to
help,'' said Aaron Lazar, a psychiatrist and chancellor of the
University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. ``But it's
not the basis for any adult making any decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazar, who also is executive director of the Center for Adoption
Research at his school, said it was ``disingenuous'' for Elian's
great uncle to place responsibility for the canceled meeting on the
boy. ``It's an inappropriate way to treat a 6-year-old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed Wednesday used similar analogies:
Every parent has experienced a child insisting he wants to stay
home from school, wanting only doughnuts for breakfast or making
some similar demand. And nearly every parent has simply said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might let your kids decide whether to brush their teeth
now or later, but it's the parent's responsibility to make the
serious decisions and set the boundaries,'' said Ellen
Pinderhughes, a professor at Vanderbilt University who studies
family socialization processes and has acted as a consultant in
custody cases.
</P>
<P>
   Pinderhughes said adults who have physical possession of a child
are sometimes advised by their lawyers to retain hold as long as
possible so their bonding increases, while the child's alienation
from the parent seeking custody grows. As a result, a child may not
to want to see his father, which could influence a judge or other
officials making a custody decision.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, judges involved in custody cases know that a
6-year-old's testimony has limitations and generally appoint a
guardian to advocate for the child's interests; the guardian
interviews the child, as well as others, before making a
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   A judge might interview a child as young as 9, but that is not
common. ``It's highly unlikely a judge would interview a 6-year-old
child directly,'' said Gerry Koocher, chief psychologist at
Children's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Gordetsky, a child psychologist who has been involved in
many custody cases, said so much of what a 6-year-old says is
influenced by the emotions of his immediate situation, and a child
that age can detect in subtle ways what is expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children at that age are very sensitive to what the adults
around him want them to say and feel,'' she said. That is
especially true of children who have experienced trauma and loss,
who frequently try to please the adults around them partly out of
fear that they will be abandoned yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans in Miami seem less certain than the
psychiatrists and behavioral specialists, however.
</P>
<P>
   At La Carreta, a popular Cuban restaurant on Calle Ocho, Little
Havana's best-known street until Elian arrived, many lunch-time
patrons had trouble Wednesday comparing the boy with other
6-year-olds or their own children.
</P>
<P>
   No child, the diners said, should make important decisions.
That's up to the parents or family. Yes, they inevitably added,
Elian should have a say in his future, if not the entire say.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Alzafe, an engineering firm executive and mother of a
16-year-old daughter, stressed that Elian's relatives must listen
to his fears, especially if they include fears of his father and
life in Cuba. Like many other diners, she said she did not believe
Elian's relatives have planted thoughts in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child is saying, `I don't want to go,' and you can see
it's traumatic for him,'' Alzafe said. ``You should listen to what
he's saying. You have to hear him out. If he's reacting in terror,
he's sending out a message. ... We all know this is a special
case.''

COMMENTARY: CLUELESS IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week he was an environmentalist. Now he's a health care
reformer. Who knows what rewriting of reality is yet to come?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's first speech on health care was delivered in
Cleveland on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will promote individual choice,'' he said. ``We will rely
on private insurance. But make no mistake: In my administration,
low-income Americans will have access to high-quality health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   That very morning The New York Times was out with a page-one
article by Adam Clymer that began as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has had one of the nation's worst public health records
for decades. More than a quarter of its residents have no health
insurance. The Mexican border is a hotbed of contagion. The state
ranks near the top in the nation in rates of AIDS, diabetes,
tuberculosis and teen-age pregnancy, and near the bottom in
immunizations, mammograms and access to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But since George W. Bush became governor in 1995, he has not
made health a priority, his aides acknowledge. He has never made a
speech on the subject, his press office says. His administration
opposed a patients' bill of rights in 1995 before grudgingly
accepting one in 1997, and fought unsuccessfully to limit access to
the new federal Children's Health Insurance Program in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Clymer's article was just as devastating. Bush may
be lip-synching the language of reform as he seeks to impress
independent and Democratic voters, but the reality in Texas is
tragic. According to a report by the state comptroller's office in
1998, ``Health conditions in the Texas-Mexico border are among the
worst in the U.S., so distressful that reports on health conditions
suggest a remote country in need of medical missionaries, not a
part of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has been notoriously backward when it comes to health
care. But if George W. Bush was at all concerned about that, he
didn't let on. His choice for state health commissioner, Dr.
William R. Archer III, would likely make a real health care
reformer ill. Example: Texas may be at the bottom of the national
heap in terms of health insurance coverage, but that's no big deal
to Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer wrote: ``Almost alone among health experts in Texas,
Archer minimizes the importance of the low rate of health
insurance, a protection that two-fifths of the state's poor
children lack. In an interview, he said he thought that while
`eventually we have to insure everybody,' he believed the uninsured
were still getting care.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure. Some do. They get sick and show up at hospital
emergency rooms. Of course, some wait too long.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's easy acceptance of this wretched method of delivering
health care mirrors that of Bush. Referring to a hypothetical
uninsured mother of two, the governor said in a television
interview last month: ``She's got accessibility, in my state at
least, to health care in emergency rooms and clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that wasn't the ``most affordable'' or ``the
smartest way to run a health system.'' But it was, you know,
access.
</P>
<P>
   Answering a question about health care on a Fox News program in
January, the governor said: ``You go to emergency rooms in my
state. ... They're full of people. They're full of people. There's
access.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said affordable insurance was his health care goal, his
``mission,'' but he saw the crowded emergency rooms in Texas as
proof that his constituents already had access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good. The governor appears to be clueless about
health care, both unaware and unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   In February, during a campaign appearance in Florida, Bush was
questioned by a woman who wanted to know what he might do about the
fact that her health insurance did not fully cover the needs of her
son, who had a chronic, life-threatening illness.
</P>
<P>
   According to The New York Times' Frank Bruni, Bush seemed
``stumped'' by the query. ``He sang the praises of medical savings
accounts,'' wrote Bruni, ``then acknowledged that it was too late
for the woman to start one and that he really had no specific
remedy for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the woman: ``I'm sorry. I wish I could wave a wand.''

 &HT;    Eds: Keven is cq
 &HT;    Fight witness may be Lewis' best defense
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Keven Brown walked out of the Cobalt lounge Super Bowl
night apparently minding his own business.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, he was pulling an attacker off a dying victim
and scattering people from an angry fracas on a Buckhead street.
Now he is a key figure in the slaying case against Ray Lewis and
may even be the best witness for the NFL star's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a burly security guard from Decatur, Ga., has been a
reluctant witness, refusing all requests for interviews by the news
media. But he has given authorities a chilling account of the
fleeting moments of a fight on Jan. 31 that left two Decatur men
stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   In those statements, Brown tells authorities he saw two men
attacking Jacinth Baker and two more fighting with Richard Lollar
just seconds before they lay bleeding on the street. But he told
police Lewis was not part of those scuffles. Brown's statements are
among dozens prosecutors have taken from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is one of only a few witnesses with no ties to either
party. And of those witnesses, he apparently saw the most.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, he could prove to be a valuable witness to the
Lewis defense team. But because he didn't see the beginning of the
altercation, he can't totally exonerate him.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown arrived at the scene, what he saw was chaos.
``Punches were being thrown, bottles swung,'' Brown said. ``It was
an all-out brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 34, said he could identify Lewis, having seen him when he
worked security for Atlanta Falcons players.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before he drove up on the fight, Brown encountered a
``very intoxicated'' Lewis staggering out of the Cobalt with his
arms around two women who were helping him walk down the street.
``He could barely talk or walk,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis assured Brown he was OK, adding that he was ``leaving in
the morning on the first thing smoking,'' referring to a scheduled
flight to Hawaii where the linebacker was set to play in the Pro
Bowl the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is charged with Reginald Oakley of Baltimore and Joseph
Sweeting of Miami in the stabbing deaths of Baker and Lollar. They
are scheduled to go to trial May 15.
</P>
<P>
   While Brown did not see Lewis involved in the deadly fights, two
other witnesses have told police they saw Lewis participate. Duane
Fassett, the driver of Lewis' stretch Lincoln Navigator limousine,
told police he saw Lewis ``throw a punch.'' And Jeff Gwen of Akron,
Ohio, a friend of the victims, told authorities he saw Lewis
fighting with one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   No witness has said Lewis held a knife. But under Georgia law, a
person can be convicted of felony murder if he is found to have
committed a felony that led to the victim's death. Lewis has been
charged with aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick I. Ozonu, a cab driver who drove up to the scene, said
he initially thought Brown was involved in the fight and blocked
his Honda so he couldn't get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turns out, he was the best guy,'' Ozonu said of Brown.
``Nobody else was helping.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ozonu said Brown told him that he tries to
avoid such situations because he had been shot in an incident years
before. Ozonu added that Brown likely will be a vital witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the one that could recognize those guys because he was
around them,'' the cabbie said.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the slaying, Brown spent four to five hours
inside the Cobalt. After leaving the club, Brown drove his Honda
eastbound down East Paces Ferry, screeching to a halt because a man
being beaten by two others ran out in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The closest victim to him, Brown said, was a ``little guy''
(Baker) being beaten by a man wearing a black fur jacket and being
kicked by another man. ``He wasn't putting up very much of a
fight,'' Brown recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he yelled at the men to stop fighting and then jumped
into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I got closer to the fight, I grabbed one of the guys and
shoved him aside,'' he said. ``I don't remember what that guy had
on and the only reason I remember the fur jacket is because I
grabbed him,'' Brown said. ``The other guys stopped and started to
run away.''
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds after breaking up the fight, Brown stood over
Baker who lay dying of stab wounds. Brown then looked up and saw a
mortally wounded Lollar stagger over to Baker and then tumble
backward to the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw a knife on the ground and overheard an
unidentified person say, ``I stabbed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown stayed at the scene, dialing 911. He reported hearing the
gunshots fired at Lewis' rented limo as it left the scene. A friend
of the victims, Marlin Burros of Decatur, has said he fired at the
limo as it sped away.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews found Lollar lying on his back on East Paces
near its intersection with Grandview. Baker was found lying
facedown.

ANTISEMITISM UP IN BAY STATE, ADL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In contrast to a national trend, the number of
anti-Semitic incidents in Massachusetts rose slightly last year,
according to a study by the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   But the escalating intensity of such incidents _ including
shootings in Los Angeles and Chicago _ and the virulent tone of
Internet messages has raised concern beyond the raw statistics, ADL
officials said at a news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone is getting more vulgar and more frightening,'' said
Andrew Tarsy of the ADL.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Massachusetts recorded 112 incidents, five more than
in 1998 and the fourth-highest total nationwide, according to the
study. Only California, New York, and New Jersey recorded more
incidents. While the state figure rose slightly, incidents declined
slightly nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The expressions of anti-Jewish bias included an incident in
September, in which an Agawam woman's car was covered with
swastikas and firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   Swastikas were painted on or burned into several public places
as well. An Andover teen burned one into a high school athletic
field; in Groton, someone scorched a swastika on the surface of a
public tennis court; and in North Attleborough, a swastika was
burned into the ground of a little league baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   Organized hate groups were found to be operating in the Bay
State, including the World Church of the Creator, which dropped
anti-Jewish literature in at least five towns, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Smith, a movement leader whose teachings include a
rejection of the Holocaust, targeted college newspapers in New
England and got an advertisement published at Fitchburg State
College, Emerson College, the University of Massachusetts at
Lowell, and UMass-Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't pranks and it's not just vandalism,'' said
Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly ``It's purposeful.''

&HT;     BUCHANAN URGES CONGRESS TO OPPOSE INCREASED CHINA TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patrick Buchanan, the likely Reform Party
presidential nominee, charged Wednesday that granting China normal
trading relations permanently would threaten American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that over the last two decades trade deals,
including those with China, have led to ``plants, factories, jobs
sent overseas. That means us borrowing. That means us selling out
our country.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined Teamsters President James Hoffa and five members of
Congress in a union rally on Capitol Hill aimed at persuading
Congress to vote against freer trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, referring to the strong lobbying by business
executives for more China trade, argued that ``the jobs of American
workers, the economic security of American families and the
economic independence of the American nation come ahead of the
stock options of the Fortune 500.'' The audience of several
thousand people cheered loudly.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative commentator also said the U.S. government
should not grant China permanent trade status until Beijing allows
its people more freedom and ceases to produce weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were there in the White House I'd tell (Chinese leaders),
`You stop persecuting Christians, you stop threatening my country
or you guys have sold your last pair of chopsticks in any mall in
the United States of America,''' Buchanan declared.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-free-trade candidate, who ran for president in 1992 and
1996, has joined with many AFL-CIO unions to fight the trade
measure proposed by President Clinton to give China permanently the
same low tariffs that the United States grants most other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979 Congress has reviewed China's trading status
annually, and each year, often after fierce debates, it has granted
the normal status to Beijing. Thus, Clinton's proposal would end
what has long been an annual rite of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa urged Congress to retain the annual review so it can
continue to threaten China with the loss of exports to this country
if it doesn't improve its labor and human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters leader, referring to Beijing's imprisonment of
labor activists and political dissidents, said, ``Let's keep China
on probation.''
</P>
<P>
   The China bill is expected to pass in the Senate, but its
chances in the House, which will vote first on it in late May, are
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that increasing trade with China would create
American jobs instead of losing them.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Roeder, spokeswoman for Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., a
strong supporter of the China bill, noted that ``22 percent of the
world's consumers are in China. The opportunities for (America's)
small businesses and medium-sized firms (to sell to the Chinese)
are astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents also say that if permanent trade status is not
granted, American business will lose out to nations that do grant
it to China. Beijing has said it will lower tariffs for the nations
that accept permanent trade relations with it.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. David Bonior, D-Mich., Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Joe Baca,
D-Calif., Christopher Smith, R-N.J., and Bernard Sanders, I-Vt.,
also spoke at the rally against permanently lowering barriers to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said large corporations are spending huge amounts of
money to lobby for more China trade. He warned the union members
who were preparing to lobby their own lawmakers that when they
approach the Capitol they should ``duck because there's money
flying all over the place.''

told a congressional hearing on the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of the House
and Senate, said Republicans and Democrats in Congress want more
transparency in the two organization's decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our own representative to the IMF couldn't even tell us
exactly how decisions are made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Capitol, hundreds of people demonstrated against IMF
and World Bank policies toward poor nations. The lending
institutions' leaders are meeting in Washington this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, known formally as the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, provides long-term loans for
economic development projects in poor countries. The IMF arranges
short-term loans directly to countries in sudden economic crisis,
often imposing austerity measures on them in return for the aid.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the disappearance of millions of dollars in IMF loans to
the Russia, Saxton said the IMF and World Bank also need to improve
their ability to keep track of the money they loan to countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Russia last year, and it was obvious to anyone with
eyes that the IMF had done nothing to look after the money it
loaned to Russia's Central Bank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., accused the IMF and World
Bank of failing in their missions.
</P>
<P>
   By forcing many East Asian countries to cut back on social
spending and benefits to the poor, the IMF caused those nations'
financial crises of the late 1990s to ``last longer and hurt
more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF takes advantage of countries when they are most in
need, coercing them to adopt policies which will benefit the rich
at the expense of the poor,'' Stark said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stark, World Bank polices also resulted in lower
living standards. In addition, he said the bank's loans have caused
``massive'' environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Bank is focused on economic growth at any cost,''
Stark said. ``The fact that the wealth created goes to only a few
individuals while the vast majority of workers are forced to live
on less and less doesn't seem to matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark said poor countries, in attempting to meet IMF and World
Bank criteria, lower labor standards and discard environmental
protections. ``The flip side of the race for profits is the `race
to the bottom' in terms of workers' rights and the degradation of
our planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stark called on the two institutions to incorporate labor
standards and environmental protections in evaluating when to give
loans.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank spokeswoman Merrell Tuck said in an interview that
her organization and the IMF already have revamped their operations
to increase openness and financial accountability. She added that
the IMF and World Bank work with countries to ensure reasonable
labor conditions and environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of our organizations are committed to improving living
standards and helping the economies of poor countries develop,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and IMF are specialized agencies of the United
Nations and are primarily funded by developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hundred yards away from the hearing room, hundreds of
demonstrators demanded similar changes in the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two organizations are wreaking havoc on workers and
environments around the world,'' said Michael Jones, a demonstrator
from Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, one of a number of protesters dressed as a sea turtle,
was joined by several members of the ``radical cheerleaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest activities are being coordinated by a coalition
called the Mobilization for Global Justice, comprised of many of
the same groups that disrupted meetings last December of the World
Trade Organization in Seattle, forcing authorities to declare a
state of emergency and call out the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The protest groups are hoping to use human chains and other
tactics employed in Seattle to block intersections on Sunday and
keep finance ministers from attending a joint meeting of the IMF
and World Bank, which are two blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The police here have studied tapes of the Seattle demonstrations
and hope to avoid the melees that occurred there.

&HT;     MISSING FROM THE CAMPAIGN: SPEECHES THAT STIR AMERICA'S SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, April 16)  &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By November we should know just about all we need
to know about the positions of Al Gore and George W. Bush on the
major issues that will help shape America's destiny in this new
century.
</P>
<P>
   We also should know much more than we do today about the
character, temperament and integrity of the two presidential
contestants. From their speeches, their debates and their reaction
to adversity, we will begin to see what our candidates are made of
and how they will react under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from all that, we should learn what their aspirations
are for themselves and our country. Where and how would each
candidate like to lead America during the next four or eight years?
Does he have a positive vision of America's future akin to those of
the greatest of our past presidents?
</P>
<P>
   Speech writers can provide a candidate or a president with
lyrical passages and messages of hope. Even Warren G. Harding, whom
most historians rate as our worst president, delivered an inaugural
speech in 1921 that was filled with flowery phrases and inspiring
prose.
</P>
<P>
   A speech writer cannot, however, set an administration's course
in time of crisis or infuse a president's backbone with steel or
his heart with kindness. Those attributes must emanate from the man
himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the current campaign, we have watched Gore barnstorm the
country like an old-time evangelist on the sawdust trail, shouting
his promise of a new birth of well-being for all who follow him. We
know from his performance thus far that he has a tendency to
exaggerate his past accomplishments and lay claim to some, such as
playing a key role in inventing the Internet, that were created and
perfected by others.
</P>
<P>
   We have watched Bush move swiftly from village to town to city,
claiming, with a self-satisfied smirk, a peerless record of
achievement as governor of Texas. But his claim, especially as it
pertains to education and the environment, is disputed by many
Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems that the presidential campaign already has
been under way for years rather than months, it may be too early to
discern which candidate _ by virtue of experience, knowledge,
veracity and a vision of the future _ is better equipped to become
the republic's 43rd president.
</P>
<P>
   Watching New York's then-Gov. Mario Cuomo from afar, Richard
Nixon noted a few years before his death that Cuomo understood the
``poetry of politics.'' He was right. Cuomo can soar on a rainbow
of eloquence as he contrasts the hope and the reality of the
American dream.
</P>
<P>
   He proved that when he keynoted the 1984 Democratic National
Convention and when he placed Bill Clinton's name in nomination at
the 1992 convention.
</P>
<P>
   Not many politicians, including presidential aspirants, possess
the innate ability to project what former President George Bush
dismissed as the ``vision thing'' and make it sound sincere. But
history will remember Bush as the man who was president when the
Berlin Wall tumbled down, when the Soviet Union disintegrated and
when Operation Desert Storm liberated Kuwait from the military
invasion of Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It also may remember Bush as a president who urged Americans in
all walks of life to sacrifice time and effort helping other
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may recall his words, composed by speech writer
Peggy Noonan, in his Inaugural address: ``I have spoken of a
thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that
are spead like stars throughout the nation, doing good The old
ideas are new again because they are not old, they are timeless:
duty, sacrifice, commitment and a patriotism that finds its
expression in taking part and pitching in.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither Gore nor George W. Bush has demonstrated an
ability to define the American experience and the American dream
with the eloquence of Cuomo, John Kennedy or Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, who learned on the Warner Brothers sound stages how to
project conviction and hope, was a master communicator who
described America as ``the shining city on a hill,'' a special
place chosen by the Almighty as a land of unfettered promise and
goodness.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan understood the need for oratory that lifted the human
soul above of the doldrums of everyday survival.
</P>
<P>
   And what words of Kennedy's have reverberated across the
decades? Those of his Inaugural address in 1961 when he declared,
``Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for
your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Woodrow Wilson, Kennedy left a legacy to generations that
followed him _ he reawakened in the soul of Americans everywhere
the hope and conviction that government is good and that politics
need not be practiced in a negative manner.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II it was said that Winston Churchill had
marshaled the English language as a mighty weapon to instill
courage and resolve into the people whose homes and places of work
and worship were being destroyed each night by German air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One of Franklin D. Roosevelt's great talents was his ability to
use his radio fireside chats to restore hope to millions of
Americans who had lost their homes and their livelihoods in the
Great Depression of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   America is not now standing with its back to a wall, fighting a
cruel enemy. But it is a country whose soul needs uplifting. That
should be a basic element of the presidential campaign.

COMMENTARY: HERE COME THE BIG PARADES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's capital is bracing for the springtime
Invasion of the Demonstrators. The corner outside my office is
patrolled by helmeted cops ordered to smile at marchers while
snarling traffic; barricades channel the flow of picketing,
chanting paraders; windows are being boarded up by nervous
restaurateurs.
</P>
<P>
   I love it. No dissident Chinese is allowed to protest in
Tiananmen Square, and no apathetic Russian can be moved to hold up
a sign in Red Square, but the streets around the White House are
filled with Americans espousing their causes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the banner of ``Mobilization for Global Justice,'' here
come anarchists allied with tree-huggers, prayer vigilantes,
foreign-debt cancelers, Luddite globophobes and gutsy human rights
activists. They seek to relive the battle of Seattle by disrupting
next week's sessions of the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   And look _ there are the 10,000 members of the AFL-CIO,
arm-in-arm in solidarity with 5,000 Teamsters, headed up toward
Capitol Hill to stiffen the sinews of Democrats who may be wavering
in their opposition to President Clinton's plan to reward
anti-union China with entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   That's only the beginning of the season's big parades. Next week
comes the Earth Day rally and celebration on the Mall, hosted by
the ABC newshawk Leonardo DiCaprio, possibly featuring Al Gore in
his latest earth-tone outfit, which would give George W. Bush the
opportunity to participate the week after in the gays' ``Millennium
March for Equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Militant matriarchs come next. The ``Million Mom March,'' with
Rosie O'Donnell at the anchor desk, will turn Mother's Day into a
rally for stringent gun-control laws. (Will the NRA counter with
its own parade of ``pistol-packin' mamas''?)
</P>
<P>
   My favorite demo, scheduled for May 7 _ between the Sundays
chosen by the gay Millennium Marchers and the Million Moms _ is the
``Million Mutt March.'' This is advertised (on metropets.org/mmm)
as the local part of ``a nationwide effort to promote adoption of
mixed-breed, older, and special-needs dogs, and help eliminate
canine discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Derrico, its organizer, informs me that 20 local animal
shelters will join with lovers of companion animals to help end the
stigma of cross-breeding. She never calls them mongrels (``dogs of
blended heritage'' is preferred) and does not expect a million to
show up, any more than Rosie expects a million moms. Maybe a
hundred or two sniffing around; it's just the alliteration every
march now needs.
</P>
<P>
   But one of my Bernese mountain dogs, Emily, is heartbroken.
Berners are purebred, said to be descendants of the breed that led
the Carthaginian general Hannibal's elephants across the Alps.
Emily was chairbitch of last year's Bark Ball, a black-tie
fund-raising event of the Humane Society, but because of her
pedigree feels unwelcome at the Million Mutt March. (I may bring
her to watch the marchers near the Capitol steps, if she will learn
to ``sit-stay.'')
</P>
<P>
   Is today's series of mobilizations different from the angry
``new mobe'' that sought to paralyze the government three decades
ago?
</P>
<P>
   In those days of Vietnam, troops in fighting gear patrolled our
streets. Bumper-to-bumper buses ringed the White House to form an
impenetrable barrier. A shrewd park service director denied the use
of Lafayette Park to the protesters by fencing it off, ostensibly
to repave the walkways with brick, a project the Nixon staff
managed to string out for years.
</P>
<P>
   No mood like that exists today. Some jerks will befoul the
demonstrations by breaking windows or taunting patient cops into
arrests, but the level of anger and resentment is of a different
order of magnitude. These cell-phoned crowds are activist but not
militant; today's ``mobe'' is no mob.
</P>
<P>
   So bring on the signs and graffiti that provide gainful
employment for camera crews. Make Loans Not War; Gay Bankers
Forgive Debts; Put That Pistol Down, Ma; Adopt a Mutt, Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you agree or not, or watch on TV or from the middle of a
traffic jam, take pride in Washington's peaceful parade of parades.
Be a playgoer at the thrilling street theater of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at curbside, Emily and I will urge on the outdoor
activists as they exercise their legs, lungs and rights. (Sit!
Stay.)

 &HT;    Clinton: Country's `duty' is to keep kids safe
 &HT;    By Ted Taylor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The battle to pass ``sensible'' gun legislation will be
a long and laborious challenge, President Clinton said here
Wednesday, but Colorado and other states need to set an example for
Congress in the ultimate goal of keeping the nation safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deserve a nation that follows your lead,'' Clinton told
about 2,500 people at a downtown rally for a proposed ballot
initiative to close the so-called gun-show loophole in Colorado
that would require background checks for all firearms sales at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Currently only federally licensed gun dealers are required to do
background checks on buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the initiative a necessary measure of prevention, not an
effort to remove guns from society, Clinton said it was up to
adults to take the lead in increased efforts to keep guns out of
the hands of people who shouldn't have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children have no duties but their studies and their
families,'' Clinton said. ``Our duty is to protect their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   According to SAFE Colorado, the gun legislation advocacy group
that introduced the initiative after the Legislature failed to pass
a similar bill this session, more than 80 percent of Coloradans
would support the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said such a background check should be of no concern to
law-abiding gun owners and dealers, adding that more than 95
percent of criminal background checks can be completed in an hour.
The checks that take longer than that have a rejection rate 20
times higher, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worth a little bit of inconvenience to save a few
thousand lives over the next few years,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, father of Columbine High School shooting victim
Daniel Mauser and the political affairs director for Sane
Alternatives to the Firearm Epidemic, said the people have sent a
message to the Colorado Legislature already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Legislature's failure to pass (the gun
legislation) really ticked off a lot of Coloradans,'' Mauser said
to resounding applause. ``Those feelings are going to provide us
with a lot of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado House Speaker Russell George, R-Rifle, said the bill
would not work because it put the burden on the citizen to get
approval before being allowed to take a gun home. He also said the
state could not afford the program.
</P>
<P>
   George said the initiative does not address those issues, but if
it passes, it will be up to the Legislature to figure out how to
make it work.
</P>
<P>
   The president spent about an hour at the Colorado Convention
Center and the SAFE rally before heading about five miles south to
the University of Denver where he taped a live town hall meeting
with NBC's Tom Brokaw before about 350 invited students and
dignitaries for the MSNBC cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined at the rally by Denver Mayor Wellington Webb
and state and national lawmakers, including U.S. House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from both events was Gov. Bill Owens, who supports the
gun-show legislation but had said he believed Clinton's politicking
fell too close to the one-year anniversary of the Columbine High
School shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Owens had plans to attend a similar panel discussion at the
university later Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember an issue that has been as volatile, as
emotional and hits as close to home as this one does,'' Brokaw told
the audience at Sturm Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech at the convention center was interrupted by a
protester who held a sign that read, ``Guns Do Kill Children.'' He
was quickly escorted out of the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Outside both venues, gun-rights advocates protested Clinton's
visit and the ballot initiative, saying it is just another move in
a long-line of government infringements on the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the insane movement to pass more
ineffective gun legislation,'' said Darryl Watson of Aurora as he
wrote on a posterboard outside the convention center. ``We have a
vast movement in our country to avoid personal responsibility and
it's time for that to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners,
the largest gun-rights organization in Colorado, said the
president's timing and ``him using (the Columbine shootings) to
pass a form of gun control is vampiric.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown helped organize the protest outside the convention center
that included a diverse group of gun-rights advocates including war
veterans, senior citizens and children.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Jon Widdifield missed a day of school in
Johnstown to be at the protest with his father and brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with what (Clinton) is trying to do with more
gun control,'' Widdifield said as he held a sign that read: ``A gun
with a lock is like a car with no gas: Useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention center, the invitation-only crowd cheered
wildly and gave thumbs up to Clinton as he arrived, just about on
schedule shortly after 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Weaver, 71, of Denver, said she wasn't a member of any
sort of firearms club or organization, but said she probably would
join the list of 3,000 members of SAFE after the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking them to take away any guns,'' Weaver said as
she awaited the president's arrival. ``We have no intention of
taking away guns, we just want people to be more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cole of Denver agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this infringes on their rights to own guns at
all,'' Cole said. ``It's merely an attempt to get a few more guns
out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Denver came a day after Maryland became the
first state in the nation to require built-in locks on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, the U.S. House approved a bill that would send
financial incentives to states that impose tough mandatory
sentences on criminals who carry guns.

 &HT;    Freaknik arriving, but how can you tell?
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the downtown sidewalk vendors aren't hawking
Freaknik T-shirts by now, then it's likely the annual weekend
dominated by traffic jams, loud music and black college spring
breakers will be nothing to waste film over, Atlanta police and
city vendors said.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed nothing heralded the arrival of the event Wednesday.
In years past, multi-colored T-shirts with Freaknik themes of all
persuasions swayed in the wind from vendors' carts along Peachtree,
Marietta and Alabama streets.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, you wouldn't even know Freaknik was coming unless
the media told you so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year will be worse than last year,'' said vendor I.B.
Ciss, who sells T-shirts, watches, sunglasses and other items from
a small cart downtown. ``Last year I bought 200 Freaknik T-shirts
and I sold two. That's not going to happen to me again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will probably be a Freaknik of some kind, but I don't
think we'll even notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown hoteliers echoed vendors' sentiments. Most said college
students had not made weekend reservations as in years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is gonna be a flop,'' said Julie Napier, the
guest services manager at the Super 8 Hotel. ``Last year was bad
and this is nothing like last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Napier said the hotel, with 231 rooms, was at 20 percent
capacity: ``In the past we've had at least 100 rooms taken by
now.''
</P>
<P>
   While Courtyards by Marriott manager Michelle Vann said a lot of
her hotel's business included spring breakers walking in at the
last minute, she did not foresee that happening this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we would have seen them by now or by Thursday
morning,'' Vann said. ``But we haven't seen anyone and we haven't
gotten any reservations. ``
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for a possible onslaught of pedestrians, MARTA
will re-route downtown buses in order not to interrupt Freaknik
foot traffic along Peachtree and other side streets. Trains will
run on the regular schedule, said MARTA spokeswoman Dee Baker. The
MARTA plan also could change if Freaknik fizzles.
</P>
<P>
   At least one competing event _ Kappa Fest 2000 in Galveston,
Texas _ will be held during what has traditionally been the weekend
Freaknik reigned.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently driving the partygoers away has been Atlanta's
clampdown in recent years on the cruising, lewd behavior and public
drunkenness that is Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   But if the city is suddenly inundated by scantily-dressed
college students dancing atop shiny SUVs, Atlanta police and MARTA
officials are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the T-shirt vendors are a good barometer,'' said
Atlanta Deputy Chief Wesley Derrick. ``But we have our plans in
place and we can always scale back if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Those plans include 12-hour shifts for officers starting Friday
and strict enforcement of the illegal parking, blocking
intersections, noise and hanging out of cars ordinances. Towing
will be the practice of the day, Derrick said, with at least 50
wreckers on stand-by for police in case things get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   All uniform officers will be on duty and more than 100
detectives will be in uniform, as well, Derrick said.

CONGRESSMAN BLAMES NASA MISMANAGEMENT FOR MARS FAILURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House's chief overseer of NASA on Wednesday
blamed mismanagement for two failed Mars missions but stopped short
of calling for changes in the space agency's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   An independent review of the missions, which both failed in
1999, concluded last month that they failed because of inadequate
testing, inexperienced staff, poor communication and insufficient
funds. But Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., said those
problems could have been avoided had management paid more attention
to tests, employee training and budget management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear: It is not our job, or our intent, to try to
run NASA from Capitol Hill,'' said Sensenbrenner, who chairs the
House Science Committee. ``But after reading these reports, I am
left to wonder: Who was managing them?''
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Dan Goldin, who is to appear before the
committee next month, has accepted responsibility for the failure
of the Mars missions, which cost $372 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner delivered his comments as he and fellow committee
members questioned Thomas Young, who led the independent panel of
18 experts who investigated the missions of the Mars Climate
Orbiter and its companion craft, the Mars Polar Lander.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the lawmakers focused on Goldin's previously announced
pledge that his agency would work ``faster, better, cheaper'' to
accommodate Congress' desire to reduce federal spending. Although
they endorsed his goal of streamlining the space program, many
lawmakers said Goldin might have been too hasty in launching the
Mars missions.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner, a proponent of Goldin's stated approach, said the
administrator might have lost his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster, better, cheaper was supposed to be a way of pushing
the technological and scientific envelope in order to make the
entire space program more responsive and more robust,'' he said.
``It must never become a cover for mediocre engineering, haphazard
testing and insufficient project management.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Texas, the committee's top Democrat, said
that faster, better, cheaper ``gives me a lot of concern'' in light
of Young's finding that workers on the Mars missions might have
bypassed necessary tests in an effort to keep expenses down.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, also expressed misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us believe in faster, better, cheaper, but is it
risking other problems?'' she asked ``Are we cutting too much?''
</P>
<P>
   NASA chief Goldin has conceded the lawmakers might be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warning bells are sounding,'' Goldin told workers last
month at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ``The
trend is very, very sobering and one we can't ignore. It says we
pushed too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Young, a retired aerospace company executive, told
the committee that NASA did ``cut too much'' in the areas of
oversight and testing before launching the Mars missions.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Climate Orbiter, which was to collect weather data, was
lost in September as it attempted to maneuver into orbit around the
planet. Young's panel, the Mars Program Independent Assessment
Team, attributed the failure to navigational errors caused by an
embarrassing mix-up between NASA and its contractor, Lockheed
Martin Astronautics, over whether they were using metric or English
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Mars Polar Lander lost communication with NASA
before descending toward Mars' surface. The assessment team
concluded that the lander most likely shattered on the frozen
terrain when a computer software flaw caused the probe's descent
rockets to shut down while it was still 130 feet above the surface.

   Book store shelves are groaning under the weight of ever more
design titles. Whether they're coffee-table fluff, scholarly
analyses or plain-spoken how-tos, they find buyers. Here are some
interesting new releases in the field, whether triumphs or
ambitious failures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marc Raeder, a German photographer, became fascinated and
repelled by America's outbreak of gated communities while he was
traveling in California during the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   His book consists almost entirely of his portraits of these
well-protected sites, all examples from outside either San
Francisco or Los Angeles. Many of the images are panoramas in which
fenced-off complexes back unsociably onto each other across
hillside after hillside.
</P>
<P>
   In Raeder's close-ups, the individual houses do seem a little
friendly, with their porches and balconies encouraging neighborly
interaction, but the lawn signs warn of armed-response alarm
systems, and what appear to be street lamps overhead are actually
surveillance cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the photographs is somehow distorted, so that
everything looks like a toy railroad accessory _ clearly Raeder is
criticizing these developments as small-minded and cheesy.
</P>
<P>
   Condemning sprawl is not a new idea, and this slim visual attack
won't convert anyone who doesn't mind a manned guardhouse down the
block.
</P>
<P>
   The book is an ideal gift for disaffected souls like teen-agers
who are (temporarily) stuck behind those walls.

   A visual encyclopedia on Frank Lloyd Wright sounds like an
enticing prospect, especially given his ever-shifting styles and
technological adventurousness over a seven-decade career _ not to
mention his complicated love life. One would have imagined this
book's spreads filled with anything from detailed drawings of
Prairie-style cantilevers to portraits of his many former wives.
</P>
<P>
   What Iain Thomson has assembled instead is a sometimes
amateurish collection of biographical notes and project
descriptions. He does mention hundreds of built or proposed
designs, as well as virtually every person important or tangential
to Wright's life, down to ex-brothers-in-law. But the text can be
skimpy _ a structure can receive as little analysis as ``an I-plan
house of rectangular interlocking spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   The photos, however, nearly make the book worth its relatively
low cover price. The interior shots don't seem to have been styled;
they show how owners of Wright houses really live with their
unyielding houses, furnishing them with lace-trimmed coverlets and
French provincial armchairs that would have irritated the purist
master. Equally informative are the exterior shots, mostly aerial
views, which give rare glimpses of what these forms must have
looked like when they were still little models on some awed
apprentice's desk.

   It's not easy following Dimitris Philippides into his deep
scholarly analysis of a few aspects of Greek decorative arts. He
focuses on how residential wall and ceiling ornaments evolved from
the 1700s to just before World War II, with an emphasis on how
Greece rediscovered and reinterpreted its design legacies after
winning liberation from the Ottomans in 1827.
</P>
<P>
   The text leaps from primitive to folk to high styles: from stone
hut facades carved with reliefs of fertility goddesses, to sea
captains' parlors lined with riotously colorful painted panels, to
the Athens, Greece, town house of the archaeologist Heinrich
Schliemann, where the murals appropriately show cupids excavating
ancient statuary.
</P>
<P>
   The assortment is appealingly quirky, and the illustrations of
little-known aesthetic traditions are handsome. Philippides'
speculations on why certain popular motifs evolved are among the
book's liveliest passages; were murals of knives slashing into
watermelons meant to suggest sexuality, which had been a taboo
subject under the repressive Ottomans, or did they just indicate
``a particular dietary weakness on the part of the owner''?
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the text will put off newcomers to the field,
however. It includes words like apotropaic and transhumant. Oddly,
Abrams is marketing the book as a coffee table survey of Greek
design that will ``provide ideas for incorporating that style into
today's homes.''

   This is a lovingly written tribute to working ranches and their

</P>
<P>
   Alan Hess tells of 31 sites with equal enthusiasm, be they stone
bunkhouses for actual cowboys or Will Rogers' mansion equipped with
Indian blankets and riding tack but located just off Sunset
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The prose is evocative and accessible, rich with anecdotes about
original owners who hung their wagon-wheel chandeliers with old
spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the cavelike ranch house, with glass enclosing the gap
between two boulders, he writes, ``The encircling balcony is where,
in the movies, a fistfight would send one combatant head over heels
onto a poker table while the ladies of the bordello upstairs draped
themselves over the railing to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   A quibble: why are there no interior shots for eight of the
featured projects, including some of the most intriguing cases,
built by celebrities like William Randolph Hearst, Jack London and
Joel McCrea? Were the spaces inaccessible, or just not photogenic?
</P>
<P>
   Another quibble: The photographer didn't always focus on
features that appealed to Hess. We are told but never shown, for
example, that in a 1930s dude ranch, ``tin cutouts of broncos and
saguaros ornament the knotty-pine wet bar at the pool house.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from these lapses, the book is a purely pleasurable ride
into them thar hills.

   William L. Price died suddenly of a stroke in 1916, just as his
Philadelphia-based architectural practice was hitting its stride.
He was 54, and his innovative work ended up largely forgotten. At
first, the firm specialized in residences, mostly in a Tudor or
Gothic vein. In his 40s and 50s, Price began winning prominent
commercial commissions like railroad stations and resort hotels. On
those jobs he tried out the era's new structural materials, like
reinforced concrete, and he developed a design repertory of
setbacks, buttresses and domed turrets that clearly prefigured Art
Deco.
</P>
<P>
   Price was also something of an affordable-housing dreamer; he
founded a short-lived utopian colony outside Philadelphia, where
residents as young as 5 could vote on decisions and a furniture
workshop helped pay the bills. By the 30s, dogmatic Modernists had
written Price out of the history books, and by the 70s his late
masterpieces like the Traymore and Blenheim hotels in Atlantic City
had been demolished.
</P>
<P>
   George E. Thomas is bringing Price's achievements back to light
with a rather plodding prose style and a trove of photographs from
the firm's archives (which the author purchased at auction in the
late 1960s). Repetitions mar the text somewhat: Thomas keeps
jousting with the long-dead dogmatic Modernists and defending
seemingly sleepy Philadelphia as the birthplace of ``the first
consumer culture.''
</P>
<P>
   More annoying, the essays that make up the book's first half
don't give page numbers for the plates that take up the second
half, so you have to keep flipping from index to plate to text.
Another sign that the volume was perhaps finished in a hurry is
that Thomas doesn't always mention whether a project still exists,
and if so in what condition. Price has almost, but not quite, been
as well served as he deserves.

CLINTON URGES GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES TO TAKE ISSUE TO VOTERS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A week before the first anniversary of the Columbine
massacre, President Clinton urged gun control advocates Wednesday
to override lawmakers' qualms about imposing limits on firearms and
take the issue directly to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't quit until you win,'' Clinton told about 3,000
supporters of a drive to get a measure on Colorado's November
ballot that would require buyers at gun shows to undergo the same
background checks that face firearms purchasers at licensed
dealers. ``In spite of all the attempts to put roadblocks in your
way, you must not be deterred.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the initiative movement was justified ``because the
Legislature wouldn't do it for you.'' Additionally, the president
said, success of the initiative movement in Colorado would be a
goad to Congress, where gun-control measures are stymied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other states will follow your lead,'' Clinton said. ``I hope
and pray Congress will follow your lead as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton belittled the contention of gun advocates, about a
hundred of whom demonstrated outside the Colorado Convention
Center, that requiring background checks at gun shows would be too
burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about you, but I think it's worth a little
inconvenience to save a few thousand lives a year,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun shows, long a target of control advocates, are an emotional
issue in Colorado because some of the weapons used by the two
teen-age shooters at Columbine High School were given to them by an
acquaintance who bought the weapons at guns shows.
</P>
<P>
   The young gunmen shot dead 12 fellow students and a teacher at
the suburban Denver school last April 20 before killing themselves
in what was the deadliest school shooting in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced by Tom Mauser, a leader of the initiative
fight and the father of one of the students killed at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movement is not about our tragedy,'' Mauser said. ``We
lose 12 kids a day to gunshots in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said 70 percent of background checks at gun shows could
be completed in minutes and 95 percent within a day. The remaining
5 percent ``should still be done,'' Clinton said, because the
difficult clearances were 20 times more likely to be rejected
because of a criminal record or other reason to deny the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited a federal study in which one-third of a sample of
weapons sold at gun shows were later used in serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also appeared on a live MSNBC special broadcast on gun
violence from the University of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   During the program, state House Majority Leader Doug Dean
pointed out that the young woman who bought the guns later given to
Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold would have passed
the background check that would be required by the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton countered that the young woman said she would not have
bought the guns if she knew she would have been subject to a
background check, but Dean said he did not ``buy her claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Thomas, the district attorney in the Columbine incident,
voiced support for closing the gun-show loophole.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Clinton spoke to supporters of SAFE (for Sane
Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic) Colorado. When legal hurdles
are cleared, the group needs 62,000 signatures to get the gun-show
initiative on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to be able to get 62,000 signatures in two hours if
everybody who is for this will sign up and go get the signatures,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Initial polls show strong voter support for such a measure,
despite Republican legislators' opposition and Colorado's
reputation as a pro-gun state.
</P>
<P>
   The measure rejected by the Republican-controlled Legislature
had the backing of Republican Gov. Bill Owens. He supports the
initiative but did not attend the rally and said of Clinton's
visit: ``I do hope that he doesn't politicize a Colorado issue and
get involved in something that ought to be up to Coloradans to vote
and agree on.
</P>
<P>
   Other local Republicans criticized Clinton's trip because of its
timing near the Columbine anniversary and the president's
willingness to inject himself into what they view as a state issue.
</P>
<P>
   When the president's visit was announced, state Senate Majority
Leader Tom Blickensderfer, who represents the Columbine area, said
that because Clinton ``is not real popular in the state'' he could
hurt the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won Colorado in 1992 but lost the state in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo, a Republican who represents the area
near the high school, said the timing of Clinton's visit was
``insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal juvenile justice bill, with a provision to require gun
show background checks in 72 hours, passed the Senate last May,
just after the Columbine shootings. A similar House-passed bill
would give only 24 hours for the checks to be run. It is just one
of several differing points that have frustrated attempts to
convene a House-Senate conference committee to work out a single
version of the competing bills.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton flew to Colorado, the White House distributed copies
of a letter that House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and
the panel's senior Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, sent to
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asking for
a conference committee to be convened as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The House members conceded ``there is not complete agreement''
on the outstanding issues, but ``we also recognize the need for
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday he almost certainly would sign a bill
supported by both Conyers and Hyde but wanted to make certain there
was a provision to keep guns from the small percentage of potential
buyers who do not pass background checks within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that we can't work this out,'' Clinton said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Watching Olympia Dukakis perform ``Rose,'' a
play-length monologue by Martin Sherman, will provoke an unpleasant
queasiness in anyone who has ever felt guilty about dismissing a
rambling grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   An 80-year-old Jew who grew up in the Ukraine, survived the
Warsaw Ghetto and the postwar attempt by the British to stem the
flood of refugees to Palestine, pursued the American capitalist
ideal and ended up running a hotel in Miami Beach, Fla., Rose has
lessons about the century to impart. But for all its picaresque
detail, her story resonates on the tired frequency of a lecture
about the wages of forgetting the past. If you are not of a certain
age, you may react to her as a child to a relative who has
overtaken one too many family gatherings: Yes, Grandma. Now can we
go out and play?
</P>
<P>
   The play, presented by Lincoln Center Theater, opened Wednesday
night at the Lyceum Theater on Broadway. It had a critically
praised run last year at the Royal National Theater in London,
where perhaps the message about the post-World War II American
experience as a soothing but pallid echo of life in prewar Europe
can be received more cheerily. But directed here, as in London, by
Nancy Meckler, the production has a finger-wagging quality. It
comes through in the writing of Sherman, an American who lives in
England, and in the performance of Dukakis, who doesn't seem to
have inhabited the character of Rose so much as seized on her to
make a point: Listen! This is good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's hard to fault the actress. Rose is, after all,
less of a real character than a construct, the symbol of a century
in which victims of atrocities in Russia and Germany are now
witnesses to, if not compliant with, their re-enactment in the
Middle East. This, anyway, is the sincere if not terribly original
perspective of Sherman, who offers it here with grave and intrusive
sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, best known as the author of the concentration camp
drama ``Bent,'' has put together his script so that from the moment
it begins, with Rose in ominous mourning for a murdered 9-year-old
girl, the signposts of a narrative meant to reflect back on itself
are marked in neon. Even if you miss one, the playwright makes sure
it redounds brightly. When Rose, the Holocaust survivor, in her
frivolous '40s, goes to live in a commune in Connecticut, she
describes the experience this way: ``We smoked a lot of dope and
talked about peace and love and noble things, and I did not mention
the last time I lived 12 to a room lest I blacken their
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose has had some colorful time of it! Cossacks and Nazis, sex
and marijuana, two dead husbands (each of whom she meets cute), a
shiksa daughter-in-law who becomes a militant Israeli, a gay
grandson, Atlantic City, Hollywood. God and godlessness, too; at
some point along a complicated and tragicomic life arc, she becomes
an agnostic. How could she not? She also becomes a comedian.
</P>
<P>
   She learned in childhood, she says, ``that Judaism's greatest
contribution to mankind was asking questions that can't be answered
and that the glory of the race has less to do with giving the world
Moses and Marx and Jesus and everything to do with the invention of
the phrase `on the other hand.'''
</P>
<P>
   This remark, offered early on, is with its presumed cleverness
telltale. Throughout the play, Rose's penchant for weary
wisecracking, or maybe just her mode of expression, rings false.
Either Sherman is talking through her, or else in the year it took
Rose to become fluent in English, she assimilated a lifetime of
Borscht Belt humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose if you have your first period and your first pogrom
within the same month,'' she says, ``you can safely assume
childhood is over.'' Ba-dum-bum. You'd hate to tell such a worthy
old woman that she's really not all that clever.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of many rugged obstacles for Dukakis. A play that
calls for its one performer not to stir from a bench at center
stage is, after all, one that commandeers an actor's tools.
Dukakis, sitting at the forward point of a down-raked floor and
working mostly with her eyes _ which can go from a tired glaze to a
pale burn in an instant _ makes a genuine connection with the
audience. Even if her accent isn't quite identifiable or her body
language doesn't describe a woman as feeble as Rose claims to be,
it's hard work she's engaged in: two hours of fierce remembrance in
physical repose.
</P>
<P>
   The tremulous quietude of Rose's life in her old age is one
thing the production makes absolutely vivid. Behind Dukakis, the
set depicts the spacious living room of the apartment Rose occupies
in the hotel she once owned. Sparely furnished, with an open door
barely visible in the dim background, it has a chair and a tall
cactus plant off to one side, against window blinds shut against
the shifting light of late afternoon passing to early evening. It's
all quite beautiful and lonely, an impression made more potent by
the muffled sounds of life periodically rising from the street: a
boombox, a siren, cars passing.
</P>
<P>
   The designers, at least _ Stephen Brimson Lewis (set), Johanna
Town (lighting) and Peter Salem (sound) _ have done wonderfully
subtle work.

<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ For months, a giant portrait of
Vietnam's revolutionary leader, Ho Chi Minh, stared out across a
central square at a billboard showing the American fashion model
Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glorious victory of communism will last 1,000 years,'' the
portrait of Ho Chi Minh proclaimed. Crawford's portrait, offering
for sale an expensive watch to count the hours, smiled enticingly
and said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of Crawford is gone now as this raucous, bustling
city _ still known to almost everybody as Saigon _ smartened itself
up to celebrate the high point of Vietnamese communism: What Hanoi
calls the liberation of the nation, after 30 years of war, from
foreign domination by the French and then the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago, on April 30, 1975, that the last fleeing
helicopter lifted off the roof of the U.S. Embassy and the first
tanks of the victorious North Vietnamese smashed through the gates
of the presidential palace a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Some 58,000 U.S. soldiers were dead, along with an estimated 3
million Vietnamese, military and civilian, both in the North and
South. The ruinous decade-long conflict known to Americans as the
Vietnam War, and to Vietnamese as the American War, was over.
</P>
<P>
   But in its way, a quarter of a century later, the war is still
being waged here, even though more than half the population of 78
million was born after 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh and the alluring faces of Western capitalism still
confront each other, emblems of communist Vietnam's celebrated past
and of a more complicated future it has not yet decided to embrace.
In the capital, Hanoi, a cumbersome, suspicious leadership still
hesitates between them, fearing to lose in the global marketplace
what it won, at such cost, on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the war is all over and they have the liberty and
independence and freedom they made such sacrifices for,'' said the
U.S. ambassador, Pete Peterson, himself a war veteran who spent six
years in a North Vietnamese prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the world has redefined those things,'' Peterson said.
``What is independence in the global economy? Now a country is more
appropriately graded on interdependence. And liberty from what?
Happiness today is defined by the individual. They couldn't have
assumed in their wildest imagination a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The military geniuses of the Vietnam War, the old fighters whose
ingenuity and perseverance defeated a superpower, seem to have been
overwhelmed by the challenges _ steep challenges by any measure _
that confronted them in building a new, independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   By fits and starts over the years they have let in some fresh
air, opening the economy somewhat and cautiously allowing more
religious and social freedoms. But now they seem to have paused at
a crossroads, uncertain, divided and stuck, gripping the reins of
political and economic control for dear life, almost frenetic in
their stasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting a war was easy,'' said a retired North Vietnamese
army lieutenant who now works for a private company in Hanoi and
wholeheartedly supports his government. ``I tell you, to fight is
easier than to manage. You cannot go too quickly. If you go too
quickly something can go wrong. Every official in a high position
says, in a very big voice, we have to do something. But when he
reaches that point he realizes how difficult it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Following their victory, the communist leadership, struggling to
unify a nation that had torn itself apart in war, tried
disastrously to implement a socialist economy throughout the
country even as the defeated superpower worked actively to lock
them out of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Carlyle S. Thayer, an Australian expert on Vietnam, calls that
first decade ``winning the war and losing the peace.'' Then in 1986
Vietnam embarked on an experiment in openness called ``doi moi'' _
fundamental renovation _ and the world rushed in briefly, in the
early 1990s, with more investment and aid than the country could
manage or absorb. And through the late 1970s and the 1980s, Vietnam
was also engaged in more warfare, as it occupied neighboring
Cambodia and fought off a punitive attack by China.
</P>
<P>
   Before that second decade had run out, Vietnam had lost its
chief patron and aid donor with the collapse of the Soviet Union;
foreign investors had begun to flee in frustration over the
bureaucracy, corruption and slippery legal system that crippled
their work; and conservative forces had raised a hue and cry about
the corrupting influence of ``social evils'' imported from the
free-thinking West.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in February, Vietnam's top communist leader, Le Kha
Phieu, warned once again that the battle with the West is still on,
though the arena is now the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to seek ways to completely wipe out the
remaining socialist countries and attack the movements for
independence, democracy and social progress,'' he said. ``We should
never relax our vigilance for a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under its vigilant leadership, Vietnam today seems like a nation
of bees buzzing inside a bottle, thrumming with repressed energy.
Many of the same difficulties that drove away foreign investors _
along with stifling limits on local business practices _ are
crippling the efforts of Vietnamese entrepreneurs. And an
insistence on government control of major industries serves as a
sea anchor slowing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government ever got out of the way here, this country
would put the rest of Asia to shame,'' said a Western economic
analyst who represents an international aid agency in Hanoi. ``Go
to the villages. Vietnam defines industriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   What he was talking about would amount to a revolutionary step
for the communist leadership, a redefinition of their victory 25
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While they wait and consider, said Peterson, ``there is probably
no developing country with such a vast void between potential and
realization.''

   The next difficult step for Vietnam in its reintegration into
the larger world is the signing of a trade agreement with the
United States that embodies the free-market prescriptions of the
International Monetary Fund. It would open Vietnamese markets to
perhaps $800 million a year in new investment and would send a
crucial signal that Hanoi is ready once again to do business with
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was initialed by trade negotiators in November but then
came to a dead stop as Hanoi began having second thoughts. Its
economic prescriptions challenged too many vested interests and
raised too many fears of a loss of central government control.
</P>
<P>
   And it roused a deeply held distrust of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a kind of vague fear that there is something between
the lines,'' said a Vietnamese economics professor, speaking of his
government on condition of anonymity. ``It's still a wartime
generation that is governing this country, and they do not
completely trust American intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from the United States are received with real warmth
today, both in the North and in the South. But that warmth does not
for the most part extend to their government.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hanoi now allows as many as 1,300 students to study in
the United States each year, it remains leery of their views when
they return, the economist said. ``They say, `You are coming back
from America so perhaps you have been duped.'''
</P>
<P>
   After so many years of war, and so many years of postwar
hostility, said Tom Vallely, director of the Vietnam program at the
Harvard Institute of International Development, ``I think it's
difficult and maybe impossible for them to believe you can have a
win-win situation with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades after the war ended, the United States
maintained a trade embargo, arguing that Hanoi was slow to provide
information on missing U.S. soldiers and that Vietnam was acting
aggressively by occupying its neighbor, Cambodia, from 1979 to
1989.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lifted the embargo in 1994 and established
full diplomatic relations the following year. U.S. investors, many
motivated by postwar sentiment, flooded in with what Peterson
called ``visions of grandeur'' that ended in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Today, trade between the two countries remains small, with
Vietnam shipping $650 million worth of goods to the United States
each year and U.S. companies selling $350 million in exports to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reminders of the costs of the American War:
continuing generations of babies born deformed because of the
effects of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange and continuing
generations of farmers and children who are killed and maimed by
unexploded bombs and mines.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These explosives, ranging from mortar rounds to antipersonnel
mines to buried 500-pound bombs, shift and rise to the surface with
the annual floods that torment the central provinces, frustrating
efforts to clear new farmland.
</P>
<P>
   But when the United States offered a $750,000 program of
mine-clearing and training several years ago, the Vietnamese
refused because it would once again cause uniformed U.S. soldiers
to be based on Vietnamese soil.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite these legacies of war, Vietnamese seem fascinated by the
United States. It sometimes seems the entire nation is studying
English, the language of international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And after two decades of postwar refugees, nearly 1 million of
whom are now in the United States, there is now a waiting list at
the U.S. consulate of thousands who have applied to immigrate to
join their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In a curious twist, the dollars sent home by these refugees, now
well over $1 billion a year, are one of the country's largest
sources of foreign currency _ a much larger contribution than if
these same people had remained in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a museum here that still displays the ``war crimes'' of
Americans, a young woman selling souvenirs made out of bullets took
a U.S. visitor aside recently to ask how she could emigrate to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its history, Vietnam has been the victim of its
geography, fighting off periodic invasions by its northern
neighbor, China _ most recently in 1979. During the American War,
the communists of North Vietnam found themselves leaning on China,
as well as on the Soviet Union, for support. Now, Hanoi may see the
United States as its necessary buffer against its big and powerful
northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``America now is an alternative to China,'' the Vietnamese
economist said. ``To counter the Chinese threat we must lean toward
the West _ not because we like the West, but because the Chinese
army is 2.5 million strong.''

   A young Vietnamese Foreign Ministry official recently enumerated

<P>
   He recalled that in the 1940s, Ho Chi Minh had made overtures of
friendship to the United States that were rebuffed.

diplomat said. ``It never wanted to be enemies with America.''

   Apart from China, only Vietnam is attempting the acrobatic feat
of creating a capitalist economy under the central control of a
communist government. Clearly, though, it is suffering from a
greater fear of heights.
</P>
<P>
   Though Vietnamese leaders insist that they follow no outside
models, they thrive on cautionary tales: the Soviet Union that
collapsed when it loosened its government's grip, Indonesia that
dissolved into disorder with the ouster of a strong leader, Asian
economies that imploded because of their dependence on the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis de Tray, the International Monetary Fund's senior
resident representative in Vietnam, says the country has its own
successful model to emulate in opening its economy _ the decision a
decade ago to end collectivized agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went from near starvation to the world's second largest
rice exporter overnight,'' de Tray said. ``And they did it with one
simple change, by letting farmers keep their own rice. If you lived
through this, why not just go ahead, guys, go for it. This is as
good an example as I've seen in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, despite Vietnam's current stagnation, it has
covered a good deal of ground in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago this was a country that did not even have the
vocabulary of trade, the vocabulary of a legal system, the
vocabulary of economics, the vocabulary of a central banking
system,'' he said. ``So why are they hesitating now to take the
next step?''
</P>
<P>
   With a per capita income of just $360 a year, Vietnam is one of
the poorest nations in the world, with nearly 80 percent of its
population in the countryside, most of them on the edge of poverty.
The government, whatever its political agenda, is clearly committed
to raising living standards, according to political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But with agriculture making up only a small part of national
income, the next liberalizations must come in a growth of private
enterprise in other sectors, foreign experts agree. At the moment,
medium or large-scale private companies make up less than 2 percent
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam needs to open up the domestic private sector to get
things going beyond photocopy stands and noodle shops, to get
people investing in small manufacturing businesses instead of just
providing a service to their neighbors,'' said Robert Templer, the
author of ``Shadows and Wind: A View of Modern Vietnam'' (Little,
Brown 1998).
</P>
<P>
   And, said one Vietnamese who owns a small business in Hanoi,
local bureaucrats who enforce scores of often ambiguous regulations
must undergo a fundamental shift in attitude. ``It has to be `do
whatever is not forbidden,''' he said, ``rather than `do only what
is permitted.'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But under Vietnam's political system, none of this is so simple.
</P>
<P>
   First, both Vietnamese and foreign experts say, the government
is hobbled by a decision-making process that demands consensus _
some say unanimity _ in a leadership with increasingly diverse
economic interests. Within government circles, it seems, a veto can
come from just about anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the government is not yet convinced it can carry out its
acrobatic balancing act, fearing that an open marketplace will lead
_ as Americans themselves often like to say _ to political
pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, every time the economy opens up a bit, it seems,
restrictions on free speech and political activity grow tighter and
political rhetoric grows harsher.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment of uncertainty, for example, almost no
nonofficial Vietnamese would allow their names to be printed in
this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Vietnam nowadays it is more free,'' said an army veteran in
Hanoi. ``But it is still not nice to put the names of people in the
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one small businessman in Ho Chi Minh City put it, with a
touch of bitterness, ``We have freedom here, but it is under
control.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a cozy refuge from the rain, six teenage boys sat in a tiny
arcade in Hanoi jumping and shouting in their seats as they played
war games on a row of computers.
</P>
<P>
   To the sounds of synthetic gunfire, the computers charted their
progress with exclamation points:
</P>
<P>
   ``Long was blown away by Ken's super rocket!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nam caught Ken's hand grenade!''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 25 years ago, boys their age were firing real rockets
and throwing hand grenades in North Vietnam's final assault on the
South.
</P>
<P>
   What did these postwar youngsters think of that? The question
was greeted with blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years ago?'' said one boy. ``Is that right?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the large majority of Vietnamese who were born after the
war, or who were only children when it ended, much of it apparently
seems, literally, ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just one of a whole series of events that they are
supposed to revere in school, but for many of them it doesn't have
any more specific meaning than the Vietnamese victories over the
Chinese in the 10th century,'' said Peter Zinoman, a professor of
Vietnamese history at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another reason for their disengagement,'' he added, ``is this
whole new culture of consumption that does sort of preoccupy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has seen little of the kind of political debate,
national soul-searching or artistic reconsideration of the war that
has helped the United States to try to draw lessons since the fall
of Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   In part this is because an unqualifiedly heroic version of the
war is essential to the legitimacy and authority of the Communist
Party. There is no disputing official propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   A result is that art, journalism and policy discussions remain
constricted by political boundaries as well as by a genuine respect
for the elderly heroes of the communist victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making compromises is something we have to do now,'' said a
Hanoi-based government official in his late 30s. ``We cannot make
our fathers feel so unhappy. They are our fathers. What can we do?
We must accommodate their thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   For younger Vietnamese eager to get onto the world's fast track,
he conceded, this delicacy can be maddening.
</P>
<P>
   ``As my father often says, `You didn't live under the French.
You didn't see how people were starving.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Other countries in the region are moving ahead now and
they are prosperous.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `They're in crisis.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Now they are emerging and they are moving faster than
we are. We should have taken advantage but we didn't take
advantage.'''
</P>
<P>
   The young official seemed ready to burst with frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Vietnam is doing now is toddling, like a child,'' he
said. ``So I say to them, `Why not try the adult method: firm, but
faster!'''
</P>
<P>
   As some Vietnamese like to say, 25 years is a long time in a
human life but a short time in history. Most people here agree that
change will come in its own good time.
</P>
<P>
   But without America's openness in discussing and digesting its
history, the future, when it does arrive, may indeed be the alien
visitor the country's leaders fear.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs that they may be losing control of their
own history. Tu Anh, for example, a company project manager who was
born in 1975, talked in surprising detail the other day about the
long-ago war.
</P>
<P>
   But her information did not come from textbooks or her elders.
The source she cited was a pirated copy of the movie ``Forrest
Gump.''

JAMES S. VORENBERG, 73; LAW SPECIALIST, WATERGATE PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS AND JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James S. Vorenberg, the former Harvard Law School dean, longtime
law professor, and associate Watergate prosecutor who helped
organize the legal team that took on the Nixon Administration, died
Wednesday, 48 hours after suffering a massive heart attack. He was
73, and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   An over-achiever even in circles filled with such people, Prof.
Vorenberg was a tall, lean criminal law expert whose occasionally
unconventional views drew praise even if they raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   But whether advocating legalized prostitution, as he did in a
1976 article, or creating a new holistic vision of the justice
system, as he did while director of President Lyndon Johnson's
Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice,
Prof. Vorenberg's weaving of the theoretical and practical usually
astonished his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was good at everything he did,'' Archibald Cox, the former
Watergate special prosecutor, said of Vorenberg Wednesday. ``He was
a combination of a thinker with a strong grasp of reality and an
ability to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his work under Cox, in the summer of 1973, for which
Prof. Vorenberg is perhaps best remembered, and the work he
remembered most fondly, said his wife, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Under Cox, who had known Prof. Vorenburg since he served as
president of the Harvard Law Review, Prof. Vorenburg was
responsible for pulling together lawyers from across the country to
conduct the Watergate case. He also did nearly all of the work to
create the vast organization such a legal effort entailed, Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   While that was not the most glamorous task, Cox said, it was
some of the most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the nuts and bolts, but it takes imagination,
responsibility, and judgment to put an organization like that
together,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his affiliation with the Watergate case, from 1965 to
1967, Prof. Vorenburg headed the Commission on Law Enforcement,
which concluded with a 10-volume, 2 million-word report in 1967
that even today serves as a model of research.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Katzenbach, the former U.S. Attorney General for whom
Prof. Vorenberg worked as a special assistant, said Wednesday that
the report Prof. Vorenburg produced stands out as a notable
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a truly extraordinary piece of work,''
Katzenbach said. ``If you read that report today, it would hold up,
and that's remarkable, 35, 36 years after the fact. There's very
little he or I would have changed today.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Vorenberg was born in Boston on January 10, 1928, the son
of Frank Vorenberg, a Boston merchant, and Ida (Muhlfelder)
Vorenberg. He was a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard
College, magna cum laude, in 1948, and of Harvard Law School, magna
cum laude, in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   After law school, he spent two years in the Air Force legal
department. He was one of a team of attorneys that successfully
negotiated for Air Force bases in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   From 1953-1954, Prof. Vorenburg was a law clerk to Supreme Court
Justice Felix Frankfurter before joining the Boston law firm of
Ropes &AMP; Gray. He became a partner in 1960. While practicing law, he
became a part-time instructor at Boston University Law School. In
1962 he took a full-time professorship at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in criminal and corporate law, Prof. Vorenberg was
appointed by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1964 as the first
director of the Office of Criminal Justice in the Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Such work was good training for the future. In 1981, while
serving as chairman of the Massachusetts Ethics Commission, he
became dean of Harvard Law School during a time of great tumult.
</P>
<P>
   Under his stewardship of the school, Prof. Vorenberg sat at the
middle of a furious crossfire between adherents and opponents of
the controversial Critical Legal Studies movement, which held that
the traditional approach to law preserved the status quo at the
expense of social justice. These ideological differences erupted
into bitter political battles over tenure votes in 1985, 1986 and
1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved it all,'' his wife said of his deanship. ``He is a
great politician and he really liked threading his way through the
factions. He loved being dean.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Vorenburg resigned as dean in 1989 to resume teaching,
which he continued until his death. He did so despite suffering
from Parkinson's Disease, diagnosed in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Vorenberg is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Vorenberg, of
Cambridge; three daughters, Jill Alberts of New York, Amy Vorenberg
of Concord, N.H., and Eliza Vorenberg of Los Angeles; two
stepchildren, Amy Troubh of Newton, Mass. and John Troubh of New
York; and ten grandchildren.

<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ For months, a giant portrait of
Vietnam's revolutionary leader, Ho Chi Minh, stared out across a
central square at a billboard showing the American fashion model
Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glorious victory of communism will last 1,000 years,'' the
portrait of Ho Chi Minh proclaimed. Crawford's portrait, offering
for sale an expensive watch to count the hours, smiled enticingly
and said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of Crawford is gone now as this raucous, bustling
city _ still known to almost everybody as Saigon _ smartened itself
up to celebrate the high point of Vietnamese communism: What Hanoi
calls the liberation of the nation, after 30 years of war, from
foreign domination by the French and then the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago, on April 30, 1975, that the last fleeing
helicopter lifted off the roof of the U.S. Embassy and the first
tanks of the victorious North Vietnamese smashed through the gates
of the presidential palace a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Some 58,000 U.S. soldiers were dead, along with an estimated 3
million Vietnamese, military and civilian, both in the North and
South. The ruinous decade-long conflict known to Americans as the
Vietnam War, and to Vietnamese as the American War, was over.
</P>
<P>
   But in its way, a quarter of a century later, the war is still
being waged here, even though more than half the population of 78
million was born after 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the war is all over and they have the liberty and
independence and freedom they made such sacrifices for,'' said the
U.S. ambassador, Pete Peterson, himself a war veteran who spent six
years in a North Vietnamese prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the world has redefined those things,'' Peterson said.
``What is independence in the global economy? Now a country is more
appropriately graded on interdependence. And liberty from what?
Happiness today is defined by the individual. They couldn't have
assumed in their wildest imagination a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Following their victory, the communist leadership, struggling to
unify a nation that had torn itself apart in war, tried
disastrously to implement a socialist economy throughout the
country even as the defeated superpower worked actively to lock
them out of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades after the war ended, the United States
maintained a trade embargo, arguing that Hanoi was slow to provide
information on missing U.S. soldiers and that Vietnam was acting
aggressively by occupying its neighbor, Cambodia, from 1979 to
1989.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lifted the embargo in 1994 and established
full diplomatic relations the following year. U.S. investors, many
motivated by postwar sentiment, flooded in with what Peterson
called ``visions of grandeur'' that ended in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Today, trade between the two countries remains small, with
Vietnam shipping $650 million worth of goods to the United States
each year and U.S. companies selling $350 million in exports to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reminders of the costs of the American War:
continuing generations of babies born deformed because of the
effects of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange and continuing
generations of farmers and children who are killed and maimed by
unexploded bombs and mines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these legacies of war, Vietnamese seem fascinated by the
United States. It sometimes seems the entire nation is studying
English, the language of international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And after two decades of postwar refugees, nearly 1 million of
whom are now in the United States, there is now a waiting list at
the U.S. consulate of thousands who have applied to immigrate to
join their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In a curious twist, the dollars sent home by these refugees, now
well over $1 billion a year, are one of the country's largest
sources of foreign currency _ a much larger contribution than if
these same people had remained in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is attempting the acrobatic feat of creating a
capitalist economy under the central control of a communist
government. Dennis de Tray, the International Monetary Fund's
senior resident representative in Vietnam, says the country has its
own successful model to emulate in opening its economy _ the
decision a decade ago to end collectivized agriculture.

NASDAQ LEADS FREEFALL IN MARKETS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index Wednesday continued its dramatic
plunge from a record high a month ago, falling 286.27 points as
nervous investors were again reminded how treacherous technology
stocks have become.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-laden Nasdaq, which closed Wednesday at 3769.63, down 7
percent, has shed a quarter of its value since March 10 when it
stood at 5,048. Wednesday's tumble was Nasdaq's second-biggest
point decline. It was set off by a report that Microsoft Corp.'s
revenues may soften due to declining sales of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   While Nasdaq has been taken a beating amid concerns that tech
stocks are overvalued, the laggard Dow has begun to gain ground in
recent weeks. But the Dow was unable to resist technology's
downward pull Wednesday, dropping 161.95 points, or 1.43 percent,
to close at 11,125.13.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow is still down 3 percent this year, its losses
amount to less than half of those suffered by Nasdaq, which has now
given back more than 7 percent of its value this year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nasdaq has become an extremely risky bet for mutual
funds and individual investors who have stuck with tech stocks as
they have deflated this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning that every time Nasdaq goes down, it doesn't
just as quickly go back up in this round,'' said Heydon Traub, an
investment strategist for State Street Global Advisers. Just as
worrisome, Nasdaq's swings have steadily widened as the index is
experiencing ``probably the most volatility we've ever seen'' in a
US stock market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traub said the average daily swings in Nasdaq _ up or down _ are
2.3 percent, three times the volatility seen in the early and
mid-1990s. The Dow's volatility has risen in tandem, to about 1.17
percent a day.
</P>
<P>
   And investors are feeling every move.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Syron, former president of the American Stock Exchange,
said tech-stock investors are beginning to see the inevitable
fallout of an industry that must suffer numerous losers in the
process of ascertaining which companies have the winning
technologies that will prevail in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the dot-coms. Some will do terrifically, and most of
them will go out of business,'' said Syron, chief executive of
Thermo Electron Corp. ``On average, investors will do fine but
they're going to lose their shirts on some'' companies.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers predicted more down days in the future for
technology stocks, many of which are still trading at levels not
justified by their current revenues or profits.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is virtually impossible to predict the future
direction of the stock market, Robert Mellman, senior economist for
J.P. Morgan in New York, said the growing uncertainty in financial
markets is certainly not good for an economy that is being
propelled by high demand from consumers who spending some of their
stock gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates uncertainty,'' Mellman said. ``People thought we
had a solid economy.'' But ``with the Nasdaq off very sharply over
the past couple weeks _ and I'd guess it'll go lower _ people
aren't so sure about the outlook for the second half of the year,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's fourth consecutive decline Wednesday pushed the index
far below the watershed 4,000 mark achieved with such jubilation
last Christmas on the way toward unprecedented gains for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Efron, co-manager of USAA Aggressive Growth, a $1.9 billion
mutual fund that is nearly half invested in tech companies,
speculated that institutional investors wary of sky-high stock
prices started the selloff and that individual investors have
followed. Others said selling has continued as fund managers have
had to raise cash to meet redemptions and individuals have had to
close out positions due to margin calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks were momentum stocks on the way up, and they're
also momentum stocks on the way down. It's brutal,'' Efron said.

   San Antonio-based USAA has been careful to warn investors that,
though tech stocks may pay off in the long-term, they are not for
the feint of heart. ``You're going to see gut-wrenching moves both
up and down, and you better be prepared for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, those unprepared investors are apparently bailing out of
big-name tech companies as well as vulnerable start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   What was unusual in Wednesday's drop was that the nation's
biggest technology companies all declined. Microsoft led the tech
giants' slide, losing $4.50 a share to $79.375. An analyst for
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., citing a slowdown in sales of PCs to
businesses, sheared $100 million from his estimate of revenues
expected in the fourth quarter for the world's biggest software
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Once Microsoft's fall began, none were spared: Cisco Systems
Inc. was down $5 a share; Intel Corp., down $8.875; Sun
Microsystems, down $7.875; Hewlett-Packard Co., down $10.8125; IBM
Corp., down $6.375; and, Dell Computer Corp., down $4.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last week, investors looking for safe harbors for their
money bypassed US Treasury bonds, which tumbled Wednesday for a
second straight day and instead snapped up higher-yielding bonds of
corporations or quasi-government agencies such as Fannie Mae. The
yield on 30-year US Treasury bonds rose from 5.75 percent to 5.82
percent, while their prices declined.

A MEETING WITH BUSH EXPOSES RIFT AMONG GAY REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also BUSH-HEALTH) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Thursday morning Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
will meet with a handful of representatives from what may be the
tiniest sliver of his party's electorate: gay Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While the votes of gays will not likely tilt the election, the
gathering, at Bush's campaign headquarters in Austin, is shaping up
as one of the more remarkable events of the campaign. That is in
part because many gay leaders have repudiated Bush's political
agenda and, from the other direction, many of the governor's
conservative allies have accused gays of promoting a lifestyle that
the conservatives condemn as an assault on family values.
</P>
<P>
   But what at first glance seems like an unlikely decision by Bush
to meet with about a dozen gay supporters _ this is the first time
a Republican nominee has convened such a session _ the event
underscores new realities about Republican politics and about the
maturation of gays as a force in that party.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they conceded that they expected to draw little support
from gays in November, strategists for Bush said that they
considered building relations with gays an important way to appeal
to moderate voters, much as Bush did with his recent criticism of
the National Rifle Association. A national survey of
self-identified gay voters in the 1998 election _ who made up 4
percent of the electorate _ found that 56 percent were Democrats,
20 percent Republicans and 24 percent independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this election is going to be decided by the gay
vote _ it's not going to be that close,'' said Fred Steeper, a
pollster for Bush. ``But by meeting with groups like gay
Republicans you appeal to those voters who highly value diversity
and toleration. The trade-off is there are others who would say you
are promoting the wrong type of lifestyle. It will help with some
voters and hurt with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Bush camp is ambivalent about how aggressively to
court gay support. Fearful, perhaps, of incurring the wrath of
conservatives, Bush campaign officials this week contacted
prominent conservatives to assure them that Bush was not about to
cave in to the agenda of his visitors on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they felt they needed to do it,'' Michael Ferris, a
leading conservative home school advocate, said of his call from a
Bush campaign official. ``I've been assured that there would be no
change in policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he expressed some concern about the meeting, saying:
``Someone demanding a right at the table because of their
homosexuality _ that's what bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   While some gay Republicans applaud Bush's entreaties, the
closed-door gathering has intensified a roiling fight in their
ranks over political strategy in general and, specifically, over
how much they should cozy up to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national organization of
gay Republicans that says it has 11,000 members, have taken a
combative approach: For months, the group criticized Bush's stands
on issues of consequence to homosexuals. During the primaries, the
group helped Bush's opponent, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had
met with the Log Cabin group but whose positions on issues
important to the organization were similar to Bush's _ and
unacceptable to many of the group's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But other prominent gay Republicans, including members of some
local Log Cabin branches, have pressed for a more pragmatic, and
conciliatory, strategy of working on the inside by backing Bush and
trying in a nonthreatening manner to persuade him to embrace their
positions. They accused the Log Cabin group of thriving on
publicity at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   By criticizing Bush, the Log Cabin leaders have found their
influence in the Bush campaign diminished. The meeting on Thursday
includes gay Republicans who are committed to supporting the
governor; national Log Cabin leaders were not invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are Republicans first; others are gay first,''
said former Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., who is gay. ``Some people
believe that a seat at the table is always progress no matter where
a candidate stands. Others believe that for the interest of
integrity you have to have some kind of gesture from a candidate
before you can be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson said he would attend the meeting because it was a good
first step, but ``no candidate ought to expect support from gays
and lesbians just from recognizing our existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the national Log Cabin group, Rich
Tafel, who has criticized Bush and who was excluded from Thursday's
meeting, warned that the participants should not be ``boosters of
the candidate irregardless of specific policy issues.'' He
questioned whether the participants would press the governor on
matters such as his position on discrimination in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tempting when the governor says, `Come to the mansion,
you're a supporter.' That's exciting,'' Tafel said. ``Some of these
people are thrilled at the idea of being power brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tafel said that he was concerned about Bush's mixed signals on
whether he would appoint openly gay people to his administration.
And he said that he had expected Bush to repudiate efforts by his
supporters to attack homosexuals when his campaign was seeking
support from conservatives during the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding at times supportive and at other times dismissive about
the session in Austin, Tafel said: ``They'll try to lay the ground
work to get a real meeting set up'' that would include Log Cabin
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Schmid, a former president of the Log Cabin club in
Washington who will attend the meeting, said it was a mistake for
Tafel and others to publicly criticize Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot attack one day and expect to be invited the next
day to meet with the candidate,'' Schmid said. ``The way you act
determines how you make progress. Do you want to do it through the
headlines or do it through hard work and positive, constructive
dialogue and patience?''
</P>
<P>
   Scott E. Huch, a vice president of the Log Cabin Club of
Northern Virginia, who will take part in the meeting, also preached
patience among those who are critical of Bush. ``We expect Bush to
be an expert on public policy issues that affect gay and lesbian
people,'' he said. ``But Bush is probably right about where you'd
expect somebody to be if there were an ordinary person who never
had to deal with this issue on a personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign, a gay political organization that has
endorsed Vice President Al Gore, said the meeting was critical.
``It's disingenuous to marginalize the meeting,'' said David Smith,
the group's spokesman. ``There is room for Bush to move to the
center. And if this group can make it happen, more power to them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the disputes among gay Republicans might reflect their
growing influence, several of them said the strains were troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay political movement has matured in this country,''
Gunderson said. ``But we're not very good at practicing the same
tolerance and respect that we preach.''

HARVARD LAW'S LESSIG TO TAKE POST AT STANFORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Lessig, the hot cyber-law specialist at Harvard Law
School, has told colleagues he plans to leave for Stanford
University this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The departure comes just as Lessig has become perhaps the
nation's most prominent commentator on law and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor cited one of his
articles in a decision overturning an online antipornography law in
1997. More recently, Lessig was drawn into an even more prominent
case: the Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, US District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson asked
Lessig to provide advice on how antitrust law applies to some of
the government's central charges against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The move was highly unusual and a sign of Lessig's prominence in
the field, analysts said. ``Courts will sometimes bring in experts
on isolated technical issues _ for example, how a chemical
composition works in a patent case,'' said Thane Scott, an
antitrust specialist at Palmer &AMP; Dodge in Boston. ``But judges
usually think of themselves as capable of resolving complex
questions of the law and social policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's recent book ``Code and other Laws of Cyberspace'' was
widely reviewed and well received. It warns that free speech,
privacy and other civil liberties on the Internet might be eroded
by the demands of electronic commerce. The Harvard professor also
writes a monthly column for The Industry Standard, a magazine that
covers electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Currently on sabbatical in Berlin, Lessig notified colleagues by
e-mail this week that he will head to Stanford, said Michael
Chmura, news director for Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig, 38, has been at Harvard since 1998. He is the Berkman
professor of law and member of the law school's Berkman Center for
Internet &AMP; Society, a research center that studies the development
and regulation of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His departure leaves the center with several other prominent
members, including faculty members Jonathan Zittrain, Charles
Nesson, Arthur Miller and Charles Ogletree. ``I think we'll be able
to take care of the gap'' left by Lessig, said Chmura. ``I'm
optimistic.''

MOB JUSTICE RAGES IN CAMBODIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: This story, sent and held Tuesday, is now released for
publication.)   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ What most unnerved Olivier de Bernon as
he faced a violent mob not long ago was the sight of a group of
Buddhist monks in their bright orange robes, laughing and pointing
at him.
</P>
<P>
   De Bernon, a French historian, had come across the crowd as it
was kicking and punching a young man accused of stealing a
motorbike. Without stopping to think, de Bernon stepped into the
crowd, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was already down and they were still beating him,'' de
Bernon said. ``At the beginning I had one leg shaking, a mixture of
fear and anger. I was so upset. I was so upset. I knew at once that
it was a lynching. They wanted to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a word being spoken, the crowd fell back at the sight of
the determined foreigner. And then, for the next two hours until an
ambulance arrived, de Bernon stood over the unconscious young man,
face to face with the crowd, a dozen passive police officers and
the group of giggling monks, who had not taken part in the attack
but found de Bernon's behavior so unusual as to be amusing.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of mob justice, often abetted by police officers who
say they find the lynchings and beatings a short-cut around the
vagaries of the courts, has become an epidemic in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of mob killings in the past year is one of many signs
of the failure of a justice system that the United Nations tried to
put in place here nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Critics both within and outside Cambodia say that the courts are
incompetent, politically subservient and thoroughly corrupt and
that well-connected people can commit the worst of crimes with
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has led most experts to agree that Cambodian courts
are unfit to conduct a fair and professional tribunal for the men
who led the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979, when more than 1 million
people lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When their guerrilla movement collapsed in the past two years,
most of the Khmer Rouge leaders retired, unchallenged, to quiet
lives in Phnom Penh and elsewhere. They include five former members
of the Khmer Rouge standing committee, prime defendants in any
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which has proposed an international court,
has reached an impasse with Prime Minister Hun Sen, who insists
that Cambodian prosecutors and judges dominate any tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   As this dispute continues, the spread of mob killings _ and the
number of ordinary Cambodians who support them _ offers its own
verdict on the quality of the judicial system: the lynchings have
become known as ``people's courts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `instant justice,''' said a foreign diplomat with long
experience here. ```Since there is no justice, I'll do it myself.'
And the police are often present and encourage people to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the fragility or even the nonexistence of any form of
a just system at any level. I think it also shows the frustration
of the people and the brutality of this culture, still. This is a
way to kill people very similar to the way the Khmer Rouge did it.
You don't need a gun; you can do it more cheaply.''
</P>
<P>
   Most discouraging to those who want to reform the justice system
is that many Cambodians seem not to see the difference between the
workings of a court system and the rule of the mob.
</P>
<P>
   When de Bernon returned to his office in Phnom Penh, where he is
based, he said, his Cambodian staff _ like the monks who had
watched him _ found his behavior peculiar. They tried to educate
him: ``But he was a thief,'' de Bernon recalled them saying.
``People were upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent example of this blind spot in Cambodia's
development is a new campaign by Hun Sen _ at least partly aimed at
impressing foreign critics _ to whip the judiciary into line by
executive fiat.
</P>
<P>
   In what he called an anticorruption campaign, he ordered the
police to re-arrest scores of suspects who were released without
trial or freed before their sentences were complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government respects the independence of the courts,'' the
prime minister said, ``But we cannot allow bad people inside the
court system to act improperly.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of attitude is at the nub of the dispute over a trial
of Khmer Rouge leaders, said Demelza Stubbings, a representative of
the London-based human rights group Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to be in charge of a tribunal of the Khmer
Rouge?'' she asked. ``Is the government going to tell the court to
try them again if it doesn't like the results?''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, experts here say, the outcome of any Cambodian-run
trials would be decided before they start. In what some people see
as a test case, one Khmer Rouge commander was tried last year for
killings committed after the group was driven from power. He was
found guilty; the trial took one day.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of these convictions by fiat is the debilitating
fact of life in Cambodia that people with power, influence or money
almost always go free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phrase `culture of impunity' has become almost a cliche,''
said the New York-based group Human Rights Watch in a recent report
on the justice system. ``The problem ranges from the failure to
prosecute Khmer Rouge leaders to hundreds of more recent unpunished
crimes committed by current government authorities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, their bodyguards, members of the military,
village leaders and their goons, well-connected brothel owners and
anybody with the money to pay for freedom _ rarely are any of these
punished.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been arrested in a grenade attack at an opposition
rally three years ago in which at least 17 people were killed and
more than 100 injured. No one has been arrested in more than 100
political killings that followed Hun Sen's coup in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When soldiers shot dead nine fishermen suspected of stealing
cows, the investigating judge told Human Rights Watch that she had
not taken any action on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about my safety because the case is connected to the
police, local authorities and the military,'' the investigator
explained. ``The police and the commune chief are OK, but the
military might be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if any of these cases were to reach a courtroom, the
administration of justice remains primitive.
</P>
<P>
   Most educated people _ including judges and lawyers _ were
executed during the Khmer Rouge period. Many of the survivors fled
as refugees in the 1980s, when Cambodia was occupied by Vietnam.
Real legal education has only begun here since the United Nations
tried to restore a civil society in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many judges have little or no legal education and
many have not been taught basic principles of justice.
</P>
<P>
   It is a paradox that Hun Sen has formally acknowledged the
inability of the courts to try the Khmer Rouge, while insisting
that they conduct the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people kill robbers in the streets is that they
have no trust in the courts,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   It was into this world of topsy-turvy ``justice'' that de Bernon
stepped the other day. The representative in Cambodia of the French
school of Asian affairs, l'Ecole francaise d'Extreme-Orient, he has
lived in Cambodia for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than two minutes it was clear that nothing would
happen to me,'' he recalled. ``I understood rapidly that none of
them was upset, enraged, angry. They were just giving way to their
bad instinct. Just because I was there I spoiled something, a
self-allowance beyond normal behavior. Physically I was nothing,
but I think I broke a game.''
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, he said, someone from the crowd would
approach the man on the ground and give a little kick or lift his
eyelids with a key to see whether he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood next to him, two hours, and when they came sometimes
to play with the body I interfered, gently, saying nothing,'' de
Bernon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he spoke to a member of the crowd only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I said was to a boy who kicked his head with
his heel,'' he said. ``I had a very bad glance at him and I called
him in Khmer, `You are a chicken with white ears.' A coward.''

<P>
   Did Ben &AMP; Jerry's sell out, or is the Ben &AMP; Jerry's culture
invading the corporate world? A scoop of each, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a four-month process that had some twists and turns, Ben
&AMP; Jerry's Homemade, the quirky ice cream company that made social
consciousness central to its strategy, said Wednesday that it had
agreed to be acquired by Unilever, the global giant that owns the
Breyer's and Good Humor brands, for about $326 million in cash, or
$43.60 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The deal seems to pave the way for Ben &AMP; Jerry's to continue its
maverick ways. The company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of
Unilever, with a separate board that will include Ben Cohen and
Jerry Greenfield, the founders of Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders will be rewarded,'' said Ben &AMP; Jerry's in a
statement. ``Ben &AMP; Jerry's employees will be protected; the current
social mission of Ben &AMP; Jerry's will be encouraged and well-funded,
which will lead to improved performance in this area, and an
opportunity has been offered for Ben &AMP; Jerry's to contribute to
Unilever's social practices worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the deal, which the board approved at 2 a.m., both
companies said that Ben &AMP; Jerry's would continue as it always had
and that Unilever, which is based in the Netherlands, would commit
7.5 percent of Ben &AMP; Jerry's profits to a foundation and agree not
to reduce jobs or alter the way the ice cream is made. Unilever
will also contribute $5 million to the foundation, create a $5
million fund to help minority-owned businesses and others in poor
neighborhoods and distribute $5 million to employees in six months,
said Perry D. Odak, chief executive of Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cohen will work on evaluating Unilever's
involvement in activities like protecting the environment. A bit of
Ben &AMP; Jerry's attitude, in short, is being transferred to a $45
billion company, affirming the principles that Cohen and Greenfield
have advocated since they started their company in a Vermont gas
station in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I would have preferred for Ben &AMP; Jerry's to remain
independent, I'm excited about this next chapter,'' said Cohen in a
statement, which included lyrics from the Grateful Dead song
``Scarlet Begonias'': ``Once in a while you get shown the light in
the strangest of places if you look at it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen will also work on developing products that will bear the
Ben &AMP; Jerry's name. Such branching out was proposed by several
possible buyers of Ben &AMP; Jerry's, which is known for high-fat ice
cream in flavors like Chubby Hubby and Cherry Garcia. On Dec. 2,
the company said it had received ``indications of interest'' and
would be weighing them.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Greenfield, both 49 and friends since seventh grade,
spent the early years railing at ice-cream giants like Pillsbury,
which has since been acquired by Diageo and manufactures
Haagen-Dazs. Both Haagen-Dazs and Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream
distribute Ben &AMP; Jerry's, although the three are rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's went public in 1984 and, from a fiscal point of
view, had been a disappointment to investors. Until December, the
stock had hovered around $17. Wednesday, it gained $8.125 a share
to close at $43.0625.
</P>
<P>
   The deal replaces one in which Cohen, together with Unilever and
a venture-capital group called Meadowbrook Lane Capital, would have
taken Ben &AMP; Jerry's private for $38 a share. The board agreed to
that plan on March 23, but the deal was derailed by an all-stock
offer, also at $38 a share, from Dreyer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, we won big-time,'' said Terry Mollner, a
Meadowbrook principal and a founder of the Calvert group of
socially responsible mutual funds. ``Unilever has agreed to
something called the social mission process.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this process, Antony Burgmans, a co-chairman of
Unilever, said his company discovered early in its negotiations
that it and Ben &AMP; Jerry's had a similar vision. ``Unilever prides
itself on the way it does business worldwide,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Burgmans, who also announced Wednesday that Unilever would buy
Slim-Fast Foods Co., the diet-plan maker, in a deal worth $2.3
billion, said the company had paid ``full price'' for both
Slim-Fast and Ben &AMP; Jerry's. ``These two brands fit into trends,''
he said. ``One is about vitality, and the other is about enjoyment
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Burgmans said he did not
expect a return on the investment in Ben &AMP; Jerry's for three years,
said Jeffrey G. Kanter, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ``For
two years, there will be no layoffs,'' Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Ben &AMP; Jerry's shops around the country, who had
watched the process anxiously, said they hoped their businesses
would remain intact. ``I wish the company could have stayed
independent,'' said Rosanne Haggerty, executive director of Common
Ground Community, which operates a Ben &AMP; Jerry's in Manhattan and
plans to open three more. ``But I'm cheered that they have created
a mechanism to not just preserve the values that have made Ben &AMP;
Jerry's special, but to expand them. In a strange way, this could
be a validation of all those quirky values.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan to take Ben &AMP; Jerry's private came apart when Dreyer's
offered $38 a share in a stock swap. ``The board felt they had no
choice but to let all three groups put their best offers on the
table yesterday,'' Mollner said, adding, ``We think it's horrible
that a company has no choice but to sell to the highest bidder or
get sued.''
</P>
<P>
   Odak described Niall Fitzgerald, the other Unilever co-chairman,
as arriving for a meeting with a knapsack on his back, an
appearance that seemed to play well with Ben &AMP; Jerry's management.
``He talked for three hours about all the sustainable-agriculture
programs they have,'' Odak said. ``We were very, very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the negotiations, Richard Goldstein, head of Unilever's
North American operations, made a move to convince Cohen of the
role he could play at Unilever. ``He said, `Ben, do you realize the
opportunity you have here to help this company grow in its social
commitment?''' Mollner recalled. ``Ben looked back at him and
realized, This man is sincere.''

COURT GIVES RUIZ CHANCE AT HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than the date of his meeting with Evander Holyfield changed
for John Ruiz Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling that surely stunned undisputed heavyweight champion
Lennox Lewis's handlers, Judge Lewis Kaplan ordered the champion to
either vacate the World Boxing Association portion of the title or
fight Ruiz prior to his previously scheduled April 29 bout with
Michael Grant at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   When Holyfield and Lewis met in their rematch earlier this year,
both sides agreed that the winner's next opponent would be the
WBA's No. 1 contender or its highest-rated available fighter. Lewis
had no interest in a second fight with then-No. 1 challenger Henry
Akinwande, however, and when the WBA subsequently removed Akinwande
from the No. 1 spot for inactivity and inserted Ruiz, Lewis
continued to ignore the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Lewis signed to face Grant in a fight that is being
widely anticipated because Grant is considered by most to be the
best of the crop of young heavyweights. Lewis's people tried to
convince Ruiz to step aside until July before meeting Lewis in
London but promoter Don King chose to press his claim on an
immediate shot at the WBA belt and put together a better than $1
million payday for Ruiz to meet Holyfield in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   At the time it was unclear if the Ruiz-Holyfield fight would be
for a world title or merely be considered an elimination bout to
name a new No. 1 WBA contender. That is until the organization
itself announced it would not strip Lewis if he agreed to fight the
Holyfield-Ruiz winner immediately following the Grant bout.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis agreed but also sued King claiming he had been defrauded
into signing a contract that forced him to fight the WBA's No. 1
contender first. King countersued claiming breach of contract.
Wednesday Kaplan ruled Lewis was free to fight who he wanted but if
it was not Ruiz first, Lewis had to vacate that portion of the
title. That effectively turned the Ruiz-Holyfield fight into a WBA
title bout because they are the No. 1- and No. 2-rated heavyweights
in that organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's handlers declined to step aside as asked because they did
not believe the promised July fight would ever come off and King
continued to press the issue in court until he got himself a
victory that could make Ruiz, who is from Chelsea, Mass., the first
New England heavyweight to fight for a world title since Tom
McNeeley was stopped by Floyd Patterson more than three decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the biggest blunder in boxing history,'' crowed
Norman Stone, Ruiz's manager. ``Lewis is the one who took Johnny to
court originally and now the court ruled in our favor. This is
unbelievable. It's something you wait your whole life for _ the
opportunity to fight for the heavyweight title.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz was vacationing with his family in Florida when his cell
phone rang and he heard Stone screaming on the other end. At first
it was difficult to be sure what the news was but when it became
clear, Ruiz took it in his usual understated fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road so I'm glad it all came out well,'' said
Ruiz, who would become the first Hispanic heavyweight champion in
boxing history if he can defeat the 37-year-old Holyfield. ``The
thing is I definitely want to fight Holyfield. If it's for a title,
all the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the judge went with us but I'm still looking at it
just as a fight with Holyfield. That alone would be a tough fight
and a big thing. If it's a title fight, all the better. That's been
my dream ever since this started.''

NEW BOSS DIGS RIGHT INTO CONTROVERSIAL HIGHWAY JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New Big Dig chief Andrew Natsios plans to review the
performance of the project's lead contractor in coming weeks, as he
moves to restore confidence in Massachusetts' management of the
highway construction.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a sharp contrast with James J. Kerasiotes, his ousted
predecessor, Natsios also pledged Wednesday to flood the media and
public with information about the giant highway project, which is
expected to cost close to $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be bored by the amount of information'' Natsios said
after a meeting with business leaders. ``They're going to have more
information than they're going to want to print.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said he will await a report by consultants
O'Brien/Kreitzberg before deciding whether to end or alter the
state's long relationship with Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, the
$150-million-a-year management consultants on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is premature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bechtel came under attack from Federal Highway Administrator
Kenneth R. Wykle Tuesday, who suggested that the firm deserves
greater scrutiny for failing to reveal a $1.4 billion cost hike in
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios may face pressure to impose new oversight on Bechtel.
Some have called for a project management organization to be hired
by the state to oversee the contractor. According to a former Big
Dig employee, O'Brien/Kreitzberg has been seeking the work for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios also announced he has assembled a team of state
specialists in personnel, accounting and construction would help
him quickly take over its management.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios was appointed Massachusetts Turnpike Chairman Tuesday by
Governor Paul Cellucci, who fired Kerasiotes for intentionally
concealing cost overruns. The Big Dig has been managed by the
Turnpike since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Several Kerasiotes aides will follow him out the door. Two of
Kerasiotes' closest aides, Jodi d'Urso and James McGrail, will
leave this week, a source said. Project director Patrick J.
Moynihan, a Kerasiotes loyalist, is expected to leave within
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios had been serving as Administration and Finance
secretary, but increasingly tackling Big Dig fiscal problems
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios first learned he might be put in charge of the nation's
largest public works project Friday, when he attended a regularly
scheduled meeting with Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, already distancing himself from Kerasiotes in
public, laid out how he might deal with the situation if Federal
Highway Administration called for Big Dig management heads to roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little taken aback by some of the options he
presented,'' Natsios said. One was, essentially: ``Grab your hard
hat, Andy, you're in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said he eventually hopes to meet with Kerasiotes, but,
``Tensions are kind of high right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsios Wednesday delivered a speech on the state's economic
condition, which he had written before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But before and after his speech, he accommodated the horde of
reporters hungry for indications of how Natsios plans to take
control of a project whose managers the Federal Highway audit said
had engaged in an ``unconscionable'' effort to conceal the growing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff could be too large
and experienced for him to control, Natsios seemed confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my seventh management job,'' he said. ``In a number of
jobs, people told me the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said his priority will be people. He said he will ``hire
better people than me'' and tell them to take responsibility for
their actions and ``keep me informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether employees will be fired, he said, ``That is one of
the first thing I will look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said he had dealt with several Big Dig managers in his
role as secretary of Administration and Finance. Though they were
``adversaries,'' he said, ``I was very impressed with their
diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would know more when the full O'Brien/Kreitzberg
analysis comes back, in about three weeks. ``It's a very political
situation now on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he may bring some management or accounting practices
employed by state government _ but not by authorities like the
Turnpike _ into use. He was not specific.
</P>
<P>
   He also said cities and towns looking for highway and bridge
money will not suffer further because of the Big Dig's $1.4 billion
cost increase. ``There's a five-year capital plan for the state. It
has not changed,'' Natsios said.
</P>
<P>
   He is seeking a meeting on Friday with US Department of
Transportation officials to go over the audit in more detail,
including clarification of a suggestion that the project might be
better managed by the Massachusetts Highway Department.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the last word has been heard on Big Dig cost,
Natsios said no. ``We don't know how much this thing is going to
cost exactly,'' he said. But the official state estimate of $13.1
billion is as good any, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Kerasiotes, who usually arrived at engagements with a
bevy of aides, Natsios walked to the front of the room alone.
</P>
<P>
   He said the water heater at his home broke Tuesday, so he got
his second cold shower in two days. The first, of course, came when
Cellucci called to tell him he was now in charge of the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep much last night,'' Natsios said.

GORE QUESTIONS BUSH'S CREDENTIALS AS REFORMER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his harshest and most comprehensive critique of
his Republican rival to date, Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday
questioned Gov. George W. Bush's self-annointment as a ``reformer
with results'' and said that if Texas was Bush's model for what he
would do as president, he had no credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps saying he's a reformer with results,'' Gore said in a
speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``Where are
the results? They're not in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a series of policy speeches in which Bush had
ventured into traditionally Democratic issues, Gore said that Bush
was pretending to care about issues like health care, education and
the environment but that his record in Texas showed he had done
little on these fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we believe what he says he would do nationally when we
see what he actually has done as governor?'' Gore asked. ``This is
about something more than public policy. It is about credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech seemed to betray some concerns in the Gore campaign
about Bush's potential to make inroads with traditional Democratic
voters as well as suburban swing voters with his proposals on
health care, education and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   And they come on the heels of a couple of recent polls that show
Bush with leads of 5 to 9 points over Gore, a point that Bush's
aides made in responding to the criticism. ``The worse Al Gore does
in the polls, the more he attacks and misrepresents Governor Bush's
record in Texas,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's recent policy initiatives have prompted the Gore campaign
to intensify its critique of Bush's record, painting Texas as a
near-Third World backwater where children are poorly educated and
go without health insurance, and where chemical polluters control
environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also cast himself as the one who would ``take on the
special interests'' as he renewed his call for overhauling the
campaign finance system. Describing his plan for an endowment
financed by corporate and individual donors and distributed to
congressional candidates without regard to party, Gore told the
audience: ``The views of the donors will have absolutely no
influence on the views of the recipient. In this way, we can break
the connection between the giving of money and the gaining of
influence in these election contests.''
</P>
<P>
   But in discussions later in the day with contributors, Gore was
quick to offer reassurance that at least until the system is
changed, their money will not go unwanted _ or unspent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight fire with fire,'' the vice president promised 25
people, each of whom gave $25,000, at a Democratic National
Committee luncheon at the home of Tom Downey, the former
congressman from New York and now a lobbyist who is one of Gore's
closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon was Gore's second of the day. At the first, held at
the Westin Fairfax Hotel, the same Embassy Row building here where
Gore grew up as the son of a senator, Gore was the drawing card for
about 30 people whom the Democratic National Committee hopes will
contribute to a May 24 gala for the party.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel luncheon was hosted by Terry McAuliffe, President
Clinton's top fund-raiser, who is organizing the gala as a tribute
to the president, although the vice president will be the chief
beneficiary. McAuliffe said he hoped the gala would raise $7
million, which is about half of what the Republican National
Committee has said it would raise at its own gala on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   In an unlikely pitch to his well-heeled listeners, McAuliffe
vowed: ``The Republicans are going to have a beautiful, black-tie
event with candelabras and wine and champagne. Ours is going to be
a barbeque from Tennessee and Arkansas.''

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Where the Money Is,'' though undemanding and not very
ambitious, is a pleasing enough entry in the caper comedy
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   It's got Paul Newman in the tried-and-true, scamp-with-a-heart
mode we've always enjoyed, from ``The Hustler'' to ``Cool Hand
Luke'' to ``Butch Cassidy'' and ``The Sting.'' It's got Linda
Fiorentino sending up her ``Last Seduction'' femme fatale image
with uncharacteristically adorable warmth.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have a whole lot else going for it; but then, this
modest little charmer doesn't really need more.
</P>
<P>
   Newman is legendary bank robber Henry Manning. Fiorentino is
nursing home attendant Carol Ann McKay. They meet when he fakes a
stroke to get out of prison and is put in her care.
</P>
<P>
   She rightly suspects that the catatonic codger is pulling a fast
one. But he's good; no matter how hard she tries to get a rise out
of him, Henry remains impassive in his wheelchair. Unmoved by loud
noises and lap dances, Henry is finally forced to come to when
Carol dumps him in a river. Now they can get down to business.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Carol is frustrated by her dead-end job and
marriage to her high school sweetheart, a working stiff named Wayne
(Dermot Mulroney). She thinks Henry _ who was only ever caught
because of a freak power failure that trapped him in a bank vault _
can help them pull off a robbery that will change their boring
lives. The old pro, of course, has no intention of hooking up with
these amateurs. But when his own escape/retirement plans head
south, he seriously reconsiders the eager nurse's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, her marriage isn't the greatest, she's impressed by
him, and despite Henry's awesome self-control, he !ital!is played
by Paul Newman...
</P>
<P>
   The movie's only really noteworthy element is Newman's
concentrated stillness in the early scenes; he's virtually playing
dead, or at the very least comatose, and he's still the most
charismatic guy in the room. When Henry wakes up, Newman
essentially falls back on the understated gruffness he's been
working so well in his old age. And in those parts, he's
!ital!still the most charismatic guy in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorentino craftily earns her share of attention, too. She
invests Carol's larcenous determination with a becoming innocence.
The woman doesn't have a mean bone in her body, she'd just like a
little more, well, something out of life. Fiorentino understands
that Carol is, first and foremost, a kook, and pitches her attempts
at manipulation accordingly. And by keeping her sincere, the
actress makes the character funny without turning her into a fool.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Marek Kanievska, a Brit who was evidently so
traumatized by studio interference with his last feature film,
``Less Than Zero,'' that he's stuck to TV and commercials for the
last 13 years. Consequently, every moment of ``Where the Money Is''
has a lovingly handmade feeling to it. Though it's hardly the most
clever heist story, that quality does make it one of the sweetest _
which may not mean money in the bank, but it's worth something. &QL;

 &HT;    Risky business: The drafting of bad boys
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was, in the opinion of former
Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson, one of the most thorough pre-draft
investigations in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins didn't just look at tape of Cecil Collins playing
football or examine a pile of his workout statistics. They spent a
week in his hometown. They talked to high school teachers. They
scoured court records. They learned all about the failed drug
tests, the break-ins at women's apartments, the expulsions from two
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   And then they drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, with Collins sitting in Broward County Jail as
merely a footnote to the NFL's recent off-the-field problems _ two
others players, Ray Lewis and Rae Carruth, are charged with murder
_ the league is looking for ways to prevent its nearly 2,000
players from producing such headline-making incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Among the suggestions: If you don't want bad apples, don't pick
them. Not in the first round. Not in the fifth round. Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bowlen, owner of the Denver Broncos, believes league action
such as punishment for off-the-field conduct can only go so far.
The true solution, he says, rests with teams _ the owners, coaches
and general managers who often are willing to overlook warning
signs and give the players jobs in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think as an organization, you've got to pay more
attention to players' conduct and reputations before you bring them
in,'' Bowlen said. ``I think more often than not, when you take a
chance on a player of questionable character, you're making the
wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   During the NFL's annual meeting last month in Palm Beach, the
owners and head coaches held a two-hour discussion of how to combat
the off-the-field problems. At one point, Bowlen stood up and gave
his recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stop taking these guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Will Bowlen's peers listen to him? For that matter, will he
listen to himself? Or will a eye-popping time in the 40-yard dash
continue to leave teams blind to other problems?
</P>
<P>
   The first test will come this weekend. The 65th annual NFL
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a Lawrence Phillips in this draft,'' analyst Joel
Buchsbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a long list of college football players who
were arrested during the past year and charged with an assortment
of offenses _ domestic violence, assault, bribery, phone scams, an
infamous shopping spree and, in the case of a 260-pound Kansas
defensive end, an attempt to climb through the drive-through window
of a Taco Bell to get a chalupa.
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams, if they are serious in their attempt to weed out
potential problem players, must decide how heavily to weigh each
incident. And many observers believe when the teams are faced with
the moment of decision _ the clock ticking as NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue stands at the podium, ready to announce their pick _
on-the-field potential will count for more than potential
off-the-field problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone will always give the superior athlete with rare
ability chance after chance,'' Buchsbaum said. ``That won't
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But New York Giants coach Jim Fassell insists it has.
During an ESPN ``Outside the Lines'' special, Fassell said:
``Sometimes the guy is such a great player and stuff, you know, you
might turn your back a little bit to it. But I think people are
starting to realize you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps their most interesting test of whether Fassell is right
will come in the form of three former Florida State players:
receivers Peter Warrick and Laveranues Coles and kicker Sebastian
Janikowski.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski, dubbed the Polish Cannon because his thick thighs
can help launch a football 70 yards, has earned a reputation for
being a loose cannon when the sun sets. He is banned from two
Tallahassee nightclubs. He missed curfew during Sugar Bowl week in
New Orleans. And after the season, when a roommate was arrested
outside a nightclub in Tallahassee, Janikowski allegedly dropped a
couple $100 bills in the lap of police officer _ a move that earned
him a felony charge of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   His draft fate: The Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams are
considering taking him with the 31st pick, which would make him the
first kicker selected in the opening round since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's stock has dropped in recent months. He once was
expected to be the top pick in the draft. Now there is talk that he
won't be one of the top three picks. The reason isn't a sudden
concern about off-the-field incidents _ from paying $10.70 for
$244.38 of clothing at Dillard's to an arrest after a confrontation
with police in a McDonald's parking lot in Tampa _ but rather
questions about his size and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for pure speed, you don't take him,'' one
NFL scout said. ``You take Coles.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to perhaps the biggest character question in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone calls him ``Trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least they used to. His mother gave him the nickname when
four days of labor ended and the doctor told her, ``This boy is
gonna be trouble.'' But these days, Coles is asking friends and
family to drop the nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just call me L.C.,'' he said. ``I want to put that behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles, reached at his mother's house in Jacksonville this week,
said that for most of his life he didn't live up to his nickname;
that he carried a 3.0 grade-point average in high school; that he
is a good person; that he just made some bad decisions while at
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   When he was kicked off the team after the Dillard's incident,
FSU officials cited prior problems _ misdemeanor battery for
hitting his father's ex-wife; violating team curfew before the Duke
game; threatening a woman at a bowling alley and accepting a plane
ticket from an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Coles denies some of the problems happened _ the bowling alley
incident, the violation of curfew and the plane ticket. He says
that when he ``mushed'' his father's ex-wife's face against a car
window, he was defending his mother. And as for the Dillard's
incident, he calls that ``a stupid mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like everything that has happened I brought upon
myself,'' he said. ``There's nobody to blame but myself. But
whoever takes me will get a good player _ and a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   This much is indisputable: Whoever takes him will get a fast
person.
</P>
<P>
   He is the fastest player in FSU history. Faster than Deion
Sanders. Much faster than Warrick. Coles was timed at 4.16 in the
40 during his FSU career. In March, on the slippery floor of a
gymnasium, he ran a 4.35 _ shortly before Warrick ran a 4.63.
</P>
<P>
   It was these kind of numbers that Dr. Lauren Langman, a
professor of sociology at Loyola University in Chicago, had in mind
when he predicted that the NFL owners, despite what was said in
Palm Beach, won't slam the door shut on players with off-the-field
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like the day when Vince McMahon announces that the
WWF no longer is going to fix matches,'' he said. ``If the people
who gathered there did that, they wouldn't get the best players.
Are the owners thinking about doing something good for society or
are they concerned with making money?''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are looking for a fast receiver. But, following
their owner's character-counts edict, the team reportedly crossed
at least 10 players off their list of possible draft picks. It is
unclear whether Coles was among the rejects. It is clear he won't
be going to Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers refused to even meet with
Coles at the Indianapolis scouting combine _ a move that adds to
Bucs coach Tony Dungy's reputation for doing more than talk about
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone can play for me,'' Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   Coles says that when he is playing for someone else, he plans to
make Dungy and the Bucs pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to light them up for three scores someday,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He would love to end up staying in Florida. And although the
Jacksonville Jaguars have a history of steering away from players
with problems, he says they have shown interest. So have the
Oakland Raiders, the franchise that has embraced bad behavior. And
then there is that other team in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like him,'' Dolphins director of college scouting Tom
Braatz said.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation is that Coles will drop into the second round.
Would the Dolphins, who don't have a first-round pick, dare use the
53rd overall selection to take him? What if he falls further?
</P>
<P>
   Last year they decided that despite all they knew about Collins,
the cost of adding him _ a fifth-round pick and a relatively small
salary _ made it worth the risk. And although new coach Dave
Wannstedt refuses to comment on Coles, he seems to leave the door
open to another controversial draft day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no surprises when we picked a couple guys late _
and I emphasize the word late _ with character issues,'' Wannstedt
said. ``Now, is that what we want to do? Obviously you never want
to draft a guy who is going to be a problem for your football team,
the organization and the community. But to stand up here and say,
'We're never going to draft a guy who's had a problem in the past'
... I can't say that. I can just tell you that it's not something
we want to do.''

BUSH UNVEILS LATEST PART OF HEALTH PLAN; GORE ATTACKS PREVIOUS
PROPOSAL 

</HEADLINE>

and CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore heaped scorn on Republican
George W. Bush's long-awaited health care plan Wednesday, calling
the Texan's proposal ``political malpractice'' and another attempt
to gloss over his record as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's attack came as Bush unveiled another piece of his health
care plan in St. Louis, proposing that the federal government
expand community and migrant health centers for low-income and
uninsured Americans and to assure that doctors are sent to
communities short on medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier in Cleveland, the Texas governor waded into the
health care debate by outlining a $39.6 billion package that is
built largely on providing tax credits to help America's working
poor buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush announced his health care proposals a week after flying to
Pennsylvania to outline his plan for cleaning up the environment.
Both issues, long considered the home turf of Democrats, have been
at the center of Gore's campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington early Wednesday, Gore told a meeting of newspaper
editors that Bush has failed to push initiatives that could change
Texas' first-place ranking among the 50 states in air pollution and
49th in the percentage of children with health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   About one in four Texas children are not covered by health
insurance, Gore said, ``because of the political malpractice of the
Bush administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said Bush calls himself ``a reformer with
results'' but has little to show. ``Where are the results?'' Gore
said. ``They're not in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``wants us to believe he's committed to issues like
education, health care and the environment,'' Gore told the
American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``Let's face it. The Bush
approach on these issues is a headline without a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday in St. Louis for a response to Gore's new
criticism, Bush said: ``Not right now, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer defended the governor's record,
saying Texas health care has improved during his tenure. ``The
worse Al Gore is doing in the polls, the more he attacks and
misrepresents the governor's record,'' said Fleischer. ``Pretty
soon, Al Gore will say he invented health care.''
</P>
<P>
   After vetoing a patients' protection act in 1995, Bush two years
later signed several bills that included patients' rights, but not
a provision allowing patients to choose their own doctors. In
addition, a measure allowing patients to sue their insurance
companies became law without his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Bush fought in 1999 to limit the number of Texans allowed to
participate in the Children's Health Insurance Program, then
yielded to state lawmakers' demands that it be made available to
children from families whose incomes are twice the poverty level.
More than 400,000 children are eligible to participate in the $179
million program, but no one knows how many will enroll.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who has made health care a centerpiece of
his campaign for the White House, has proposed spending $146
billion over the next decade in an effort to provide health
insurance coverage for all children.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, Bush proposed Wednesday that the federal
government spend $3.6 billion over the next five years to create
1,200 new community and migrant health centers, which would bring
the total number to 4,200 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult places to build a quality health facility
are the very areas where the need is greatest _ and where patients
have the least ability to pay,'' the Texas governor said. ``For
these Americans, community health centers are the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the community centers, which were used by more than 11
million people last year, save about $6 billion a year in
emergency-room visits, hospital stays and other medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the end what counts is not just saving money. What
counts is saving lives,'' he said during a visit to St. Louis'
Grace Hill Family Health Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also called for changes in the National Health Service
Corps to assure that doctors are sent to the areas most in need.
And he proposed the establishment of a ``Healthy Communities
Innovation Fund'' to provide $500 million in grants to pay for
local pilot projects targeting specific community health needs.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of Bush's new proposals would be about $4.4
billion over the next five years. That would be in addition to a
$39.6 billion health-related package he laid out on Tuesday in
Cleveland. The centerpiece of the earlier package would provide
$34.7 billion in tax credits to help America's working poor buy
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This week marks the first time that Bush has made health care a
central focus of the presidential campaign that he officially
launched last June.

IMF PAINTS ROSY ECONOMIC PICTURE BUT WITH CAVEATS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TRADE-PROTESTS) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The final strains of the financial virus that
toppled emerging market economies have dissipated, allowing the
world economy to regain its health and to grow at its fastest pace
in more than a decade, the International Monetary Fund said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, the monetary fund
forecast that the global economy, led by the persistently robust
growth in the United States, would expand at a rate of 4.2 percent
in 2000, its fastest pace since 1988. IMF economists estimated that
growth would taper off slightly in 2001 to 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund, based in Washington, warned that several things
cloud that rosy outlook, including lopsided growth among countries,
currencies that appear to be out of whack with one another and high
stock prices in some countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The fund said that the United States needs to engineer a soft
landing for its economy, that Europe must not kill faster economic
growth with rising interest rates and that Japan needs to put some
zest in its ``fragile'' recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence of a strong rebound in the global economy has
continued to accumulate in recent months and the momentum of the
recovery from the 1997-98 slowdown has proven much stronger than
anticipated,'' IMF said. ``At the same time, considerable
uncertainty remains about the sustainability of the expansion in
some countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which monitors the world's macro economy and makes
loans to poor and middle-income countries, sounded a strong note of
caution about the United States. Though the fund estimated that the
United States will grow at a faster-than-average rate of 4.4
percent this year and 3 percent next year, it cited signs of
financial excess that could derail the expansion and wallop the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Overvalued stock markets, the widespread use of credit, record
low savings rates and a giant gap between the amount the United
States spends on goods abroad and the much smaller amount that
foreigners spend on U.S. goods create worrying ``imbalances'' that
could make any economic downturn in this country sharper than it
would otherwise be, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely scenario for the U.S. economy is a soft landing
in which the expansion slows before picking up again, IMF said. But
it also cited a less likely set of events in which an increase in
inflation, a 25 percent drop in stock prices and a 20 percent dive
in the value of the dollar combine to bring U.S. growth to a sudden
halt _ a hard landing. In that case, worldwide economic growth
would be a full percentage point lower, the fund estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very high valuations, particularly in the technology and
bio-tech sectors, continue to pose the risk of a large market
correction and a sharper economic slowdown'' in the United States,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the fund's economic outlook came just before the
formal beginning of the annual spring meetings at the fund and its
sister agency, the World Bank. Financial ministers from around the
world will arrive in Washington this weekend to review the
performance of the fund and the bank, which together seek to
maintain economic stability and alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings have attracted a much larger than usual response
from groups wary of globalization, especially some nongovernment
organizations that support environmental, religious and third-world
development causes. Protesters said they will attempt to shut down
the meetings because they accuse the two agencies of supporting
corporations over poor nations and rampant free-market capitalism
over sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
   From the IMF's perspective, the meetings are in some respects
less stressful than they have been in the past. Many nations that
receive IMF aid, including long-slumping Russia, are performing
better than expected, meaning that the fund is in the position of
raise its growth estimates rather than lowering them as it has had
to do in recent years.

PSYCHO SATIRE SURPRISES EVERYBODY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They said it couldn't be done. They said it shouldn't be done.
</P>
<P>
   But they've done it: made a movie out of ``American Psycho,''
Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel about young Wall Street money mover
Patrick Bateman, whose contempt for all things inexpensive is
mirrored by his evolution into an insane serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says the Sherman Oaks-bred provocateur Ellis himself.
``I never thought that a movie would be made of 'American Psycho.'
And I never thought it would be made by a woman, and a feminist,
and someone who's about to have a baby. If you'd told me that 10
years ago, I would've said, 'You're lying, you're teasing me, stop
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the novel was basically a satire of the 1980s greed
culture, early excerpts of ``Psycho's'' clinically deadpan
descriptions of detached sadism and brutal torture proved so
shocking that the book's original publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster,
declined to release it. When it did come out as a Vintage
Contemporary (which has since gone through 33 more printings),
``Psycho'' was excoriated throughout the media, by women's groups
and in all places where gentlefolk put forth opinion, usually by
people who hadn't read it.
</P>
<P>
   But some did read it, and even got the joke. Among these were
filmmakers Mary Harron, the director of ``I Shot Andy Warhol,'' and
Guinevere Turner, an actress who wrote and produced the lesbian
dating comedy ``Go Fish.'' Both women with impeccable feminist
credentials, they wanted to make this supposed misogynist
monstrosity into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. But as you might imagine, it was not easy in any
way, shape or form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't want to make another serial killer story,
but I did want to make a social satire about the late '80s,'' says
Harron, a former music journalist whose baby girl is due in two
weeks. ``I thought 'American Psycho' caught the mad obsessiveness
of the period very well. It had always seemed, to me, a time when
people went crazy over restaurants, clothes, buying things ... What
the book did that I thought was clever was to take this madman and
have him sort of represent the psychosis of the age.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But regardless of whether you found it comic or
repulsive, adapting such a bloodthirsty work from the printed page
to the more immediate medium of cinema required a certain, ah,
surgical precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when you're looking at a book that was surrounded
by so much controversy when it came out, we had to really think
about how to get away from that,'' notes Turner, who co-wrote the
film's screenplay with director Harron and plays one of Bateman's
victims in the movie. ``I think the book was unnecessarily
criticized when it came out, but that was because people were
blinded by all the violence. It's just that Bret took it too far,
and I'm sure that, since my and Mary's careers have been all about
feminist work, it was very strategic for the producers to have us
on the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Until it wasn't, but more on that in a moment. Indeed, the two
women were determined to tone down the novel's more
stomach-churning violence (a good example: a nail gun is only seen
in the movie, not used). They also finessed Bateman's brutal sexism
into more generalized, gender-neutral misanthropy, while all the
time maintaining the piece's scathing critique of the money
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts were a revelation to Christian Bale (``Velvet
Goldmine,'' Steven Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun''), the young
British actor whom Harron was convinced early on would be her
perfect Bateman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't read the novel when it first came out, but, like most
people, I knew about the controversy but had only been informed
about the extreme violence of it and nothing of the satire,'' Bale
explains. ``So the screenplay was a complete surprise to me because
it just wasn't what I was expecting of 'American Psycho' in the
slightest.''
</P>
<P>
   Enthused, Bale threw himself into capturing Bateman's deranged
mindset and pumping up his body into the appearance-conscious
monster's idea of the perfect physical specimen.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how hard he worked it, the handsome Brit was no
Leo. Shortly before the planned start of ``American Psycho's''
production, word leaked out of the Cannes Film Festival that
Leonardo DiCaprio, then hotter than any other actor in the
universe, was interested in Bateman as his ``Titanic'' follow-up
role.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally enough, Lions Gate, the small Canadian company that
was backing the $10 million project, was eager to pony up $21
million for the superstar. Harron, however, was not similarly
smitten. She refused to helm the project she'd been nurturing so
carefully without Bale. Other directors, most notably ``Wall
Street'' sensationalist Oliver Stone, were soon circling the
production, while Harron's team was left out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was snatched away for, like, six months, and Mary and I
read about it in the papers like almost everybody else,'' Bale
recalls. ``All I know was that it was our movie, and suddenly there
was the idea to make it a massive-budget movie. Mary said no, so
she was kicked off it as well, but we just stubbornly kept talking
as if we were going to still make it anyway. It was infuriating,
but I still don't know to this day what really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, DiCaprio opted to make ``The Beach''
instead, in which he played a role that, ironically, was in many
ways as off-putting as Patrick Bateman. But infinitely dumber.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of rumors why (DiCaprio) didn't do it,''
Turner notes with a snarky smile. ``One such rumor is that Gloria
Steinem met with him and asked him, for the good of all 13-year-old
girls in this country, not to make this film.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what we got from it, aside from lunatics approaching me
and asking me if I could get their scripts to Leo, was just a lot
of publicity and a lot of hype,'' Turner happily adds. ``And Mary
got to make the exact movie that she wanted to make.''
</P>
<P>
   All, apparently, was forgiven between Lions Gate and the Harron
camp by the time ``Psycho'' filming got under way in Toronto last
year. But that was not the case between the production and Canadian
critics of the book. It seems one of the nation's actual serial
killers, Paul Bernardo, had read ``American Psycho,'' and even
though protests against the film took a characteristically polite
tack _ letters to newspapers as opposed to bullhorn-wielding
throngs _ many contracted locations balked at letting the film
company onto their sites.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it took the good old U.S. film rating authority,
the MPAA, to dependably place the final hurdle in ``Psycho's'' path
to a theater near you. They gave Harron's initial cut a
commercially deadly NC-17 rating. Perversely, though, It wasn't
anything about the chainsaw chase or poleax sequence that upset the
American censors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but think that the ratings board felt that they
had to do something, had to some way put a stamp on this movie
because of the controversy surrounding it,'' Bale says. ``So it was
just a matter of which scene would they pick. How typically
American that it was a sex scene.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a more commercially viable R rating, Harron had to
trim 17 seconds and half a two-syllable expletive out of a
menage-a-trois scenario that Bateman orchestrates with a pair of
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm offended, personally, because I'm also acting in the film
and I get killed in a three-way sex scene,'' Turner cracks with
mock indignation. ``They didn't want to edit that at all!''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of offensive: Now Lions Gate is offering actual shares
in the movie that can be bought through the online Hollywood Stock
Exchange (HSX.com). That's a new marketing wrinkle, and a pretty
ironic one to be connected with a picture that comments on today's
overwrought investment culture by making fun of one recently past.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of that, the principles are pleased with the result
of the long, bloody struggle to bring ``American Psycho'' to the
screen. Understandably, though, they're still a little nervous
about how the film will be received _ though not necessarily for
the reasons you might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, some fans of the book have complained that the
movie's not violent enough,'' Bale notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it might still be too much for some people, although I
hope it's not,'' Turner adds. ``But I'm also afraid that, since
it's called 'American Psycho,' people are going to walk away
saying, 'Well, it wasn't that scary,' and they're going to miss the
fact that it's supposed to be a satire.''
</P>
<P>
   But the man who first unleashed Patrick Bateman on an
unsuspecting world is sanguine _ in the non-sanguinary meaning of
the word _ about the way the movie has turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a totally faithful adaptation would have been
ruinous for this movie,'' author Ellis acknowledges. ``There are a
lot of things in that book that I don't particularly want to see or
hear or have to sit in a theater and deal with. Reading a book and
going to a movie are two completely different things. I don't
really want to see some of the violence in that book re-created for
the screen.''

   ``Keeping the Faith'' is a movie about a priest and a rabbi and
a corporate executive. The priest and the rabbi are never on a
rowboat, although they do tread water on numerous occasions. Edward
Norton plays the priest and also makes his directorial debut here.
And while the film has all the marks of an actor's vanity project _
it's too long and is often weighted down by too much talk _
``Keeping the Faith'' has much to recommend it, starting with the
pleasure of watching Norton the actor at work.
</P>
<P>
   Norton plays Brian Finn and Ben Stiller is his childhood friend,
Rabbi Jake Schram. The two energetic young men stride through
Manhattan's Upper West Side wearing black leather jackets and
acting as if they have the keys to the kingdom. (Father Finn does
say that if God had hired him, He would have had the world made by
Thursday.) Their messages from the pulpit come off as stand-up
homilies, full of wacky references to pop culture. (``God is a lot
like Blanche DuBois ...'')
</P>
<P>
   For Father Finn, celibacy is part of the job description, but
Jake must deal with the ``Kosher Nostra,'' temple mothers anxious
for their daughters to wed a handsome rabbi who wears expensive
tailored suits with his yarmulke. Jake is not a particularly good
dater. His ease in front of his congregation evaporates when he's
alone with a woman. (Stiller makes for perfect casting here.)
</P>
<P>
   Enter (or re-enter, as it were) Anna Reily (Jenna Elfman). Anna,
Jake and Brian were childhood chums who did everything together
before Anna's family moved to California when she was 13. Anna now
works as a corporate fixer (``I talked McDonald's out of the
McOyster'') and she's temporarily in New York to work her magic.
Her spell extends to the boys_ who still consider Anna the coolest
woman they've ever known, even though they haven't seen her in some
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   This sets up the classic romantic comedy love triangle, but
``Keeping the Faith'' is smarter than most films in the genre.
Written by playwright Stuart Blumberg, a Yale buddy of Norton's,
the film is particularly adept at examining the ways faith and love
intersect. Spirituality has rarely been treated so seriously in a
film this light, as the three main characters confront their own
personal crises of faith. (Brian: ``I was really starting to think
I had a few things worked out there.'')
</P>
<P>
   Factor in engaging turns from Norton, Stiller and Elfman (sort
of playing the anti-Dharma here) and you have the makings of a
sweet, warm-hearted movie. Two things, though, sour the
appreciation a bit. Blumberg, a playwright, has an ear for good
dialogue, but that's about it. The film is dull visually, a product
of a couple of first-timers who don't have ideas about what to do
with a scene that doesn't spotlight people talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the Faith'' is also a good 20 minutes too long, its
characters taking forever to act on the things they (and the
audience) long ago figured out. When Ben Stiller looks into the
camera as Jake and says, ``This could take a while,'' it's not a
plot point. It's a warning. Any movie that has a karaoke finale
where everyone sings Barry Manilow's ``I'm Ready to Take a Chance
Again'' and !ital!stilldoesn't end has a problem. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is democracy valuable on economic grounds alone?
</P>
<P>
   As thousands rally in protest against the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund as the agencies begin their annual
spring meetings in Washington, that question takes on particular
importance.
</P>
<P>
   One provocative answer is proposed by Amartya Sen, the 1998
Nobel Prize winner in economics and the master of Trinity College
in Cambridge, England.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Development As Freedom'' (Knopf, 1999), Sen
argues that the economic value of democracy should not be judged on
its contribution to economic growth. Rather, democracy should be
sought as an economic end in itself, just like higher incomes.
Freedom is essential, he argues, to a full life.
</P>
<P>
   As appealing as this thought is, Sen may sound to some a little
defensive about the economic value of freedom. If he is, the reason
may be that in the past couple of decades, democracy has taken it
on the chin in certain economic circles. Many largely authoritarian
developing economies, like South Korea, Singapore, Chile and China,
grew rapidly while democratic developing nations like India did not
fare as well.
</P>
<P>
   The general argument is that democracies usually stress
investment too little and social spending too much. They have
difficulty controlling inflation and defending currencies, thus
chasing away foreign capital. Moreover, when economists subject the
performance of democracies to rigorous statistical analysis, they
find no significant relationship between democracy and growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen and others may be trying too hard to accommodate these
studies. And the protesters in Washington, who essentially want
international financial institutions to be more accountable to a
broader range of the world's citizens, may have a stronger point
than is generally acknowledged. As economists look more closely,
the case for democracy's contribution to the economy looks stronger
precisely because these governments must take into account the
needs of most of their people.
</P>
<P>
   As one reads deeper into his book, Sen clearly agrees. He wants
it both ways _ that democracy is good for both psychic and material
well-being _ and he increasingly looks correct.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, we should be clear about what the statistical
analyses of democracy actually say. Economists may not be able to
show that democracy contributes to growth, but the same research
cannot demonstrate, with any statistical significance, that
authoritarian governments on average produce faster growth, either.
</P>
<P>
   Further, as Dani Rodrik of the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University points out, the economic
performance of authoritarian nations is either very good or very
bad.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the economic growth of most democratic nations
occupies the middle ground _ reasonably strong and usually stable.
If we had to choose blindly in which country we would prefer to
live, any person interested in a decent income would choose a
democracy over authoritarianism because a much higher proportion of
them perform well.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by two young economists, Jose Tavares of the
University of California at Los Angeles and Romain Wacziarg of
Stanford University, adds weight to the case for democracy. In
particular, the research, as yet unpublished, finds that democratic
nations invest significantly more on average in human capital _
essentially, education. Most economists argue that such development
of human capital is critical to economic growth over time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wrinkle. The study also finds that many authoritarian
governments invest more in plants and equipment than do
democracies. As a result of such physical capital investment, some
_ mostly a handful of rapidly growing nations in Southeast Asia _
have achieved greater economic gains.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it is true that authoritarian governments invest more in
physical capital _ and there are some technical reasons to doubt
the evidence _ democracy has the edge in the long run.
Authoritarian governments may be better at making the large initial
investments in infrastructure and basic manufacturing that help
start growth. The dictatorial Southeast Asian regimes might well
have succeeded in important part by emulating existing Western and
Japanese technology. Even the Soviet Union performed well for
several decades through focused investment in such well-tried
sources of growth as large steel and oil facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But over time, democracies will produce more diversified ideas
and the freer flow of information required to move to a more
advanced stage of development. Consider how rapidly India is
growing, and how pre-eminent its computer software industry is.
Democracies also generally have less tolerance for elite social
groups or monopolistic organizations that maintain a stranglehold
over innovation and markets.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we emphasize too little how democracy stimulated the
United States' own economic growth through early demands for
thousands of corporate charters, which made competition possible,
guaranteed access to property for most citizens, and the
revolutionary development of a free and mandatory education system.
Today, the United States is even willing to take the measure of
Bill Gates in an antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would any other nation in the world challenge its leading
technological businessman?'' asks Rodrik. Some authoritarian
nations, from Korea to Chile, are also becoming more democratic as
they grow, but it remains to be seen how completely they have shed
the controlling habits of their dictatorial past.
</P>
<P>
   As we enter an information age, human capital will become all
the more important, and so will democracy. How to create and
process new ideas will further displace physical capital as the
determinant of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   So, contrary to the claims of some experts who look down their
noses at the Washington protesters, these groups may not be facing
backward at all. Some of them may be naive, but their demand for
recognition of a broader range of human needs may be more critical
to good economic policy today than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes democracy is troublesome, and democracy can be managed
as poorly as other forms of government. But the founding fathers
issued similar warnings about the United States burgeoning
democracy 200 years ago. Over time, it worked best.

KEEPING FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE, BUSH MAKES ANOTHER BILLION-DOLLAR
PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story, eliminated earlier, is now restored; see also
BUSH-GAYS) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For the second day in a row, Gov. George W. Bush on
Wednesday kept his campaign focused on health care, touring a
community clinic and proposing to spend an additional $4.3 billion
over five years to expand health care services to the needy in the
inner cities and remote rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican visited the Grace Hill Neighborhood Health
Center, located in a traditionally Democratic area of Missouri. He
then announced his proposal flanked by doctors and nurses, black
and white, creating another campaign tableau showing him with
members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society resolved long ago to provide a safety net for
those in the most desperate circumstances _ a safety net that
includes income support, housing assistance and health services,''
Bush said, a day after he proposed that $41.6 billion be spent
across five years in tax credits, tax incentives and vouchers to
help lower income Americans buy health insurance and their own
homes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the governor added a few more proposals, for a $3.6
billion increase over five years in federal aid to create 1,200 new
community and migrant health centers to serve inner city and rural
residents without health insurance. He also proposed a $500 million
fund to make grants for pilot programs that try to address
particular health problems, like diabetes. And he called for some
changes in the operation of a federal scholarship program that
places physicians in areas short of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Bush had largely been silent on health care
issues. But the latest proposals are part of a sustained drive by
the presumptive Republican presidential nominee to try to eat into
the traditional Democratic advantage on issues like education and
health care, which have moved to the forefront of public concern in
a time of peace and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   With experts questioning whether Bush's centerpiece initiative
for the uninsured _ tax credits of up to $2,000 _ would be
sufficient to help low- and moderate-income families buy health
insurance, Vice President Al Gore went on the offensive against
Bush, asserting that hundreds of thousands of Texans lack health
insurance ``because of the political malpractice of the Bush
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose campaign has been pointing to Texas' grim statistics
on public health issues and its high number of residents without
health insurance, accused Bush of posturing on issues of public
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants us to believe he's committed to issues like
education, health care and the environment,'' Gore said in an
appearance in Washington before newspaper editors. He added, ``We
need the nation's reporters and editors to challenge every
assumption and question every proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked as he was shaking hands with members of his audience
whether he had any response to Gore, the Texas governor refused to
be drawn into the fray, telling a reporter, ``Not right now, thank
you.'' Though he plans to hold a news conference Thursday, Bush has
not taken questions in two days in an effort to keep attention from
being diverted from his health care announcements.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, to reply. ``The
worse Al Gore is in the polls, the more he attacks and
misrepresents Governor Bush's record,'' he said. ``Pretty soon Al
Gore will say he invented health care,'' he said, alluding to
Gore's remark last year, in which the vice president took credit
for developing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said they were delighted to see Gore having to
fight back on issues on which the Democrats have traditionally
dominated, and they were heartened by the governor's slight rise
ahead of Gore in several recent national polls, although in each
case his lead was within the margin of sampling error. Fleischer
said Bush would continue making policy speeches throughout the
spring.

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKS KEEP THEIR CORE TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In that murky never-never land, somewhere between New
Jersey and Long Island, the New York Jets were sending away their
very best football player. Like most teams in most towns, the Jets
were officially starting over.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the Bronx, the only thing that seems to change is the
height of Andrew Giuliani as he soars upward, toward the Yankee cap
on his father's head.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't pay attention to the subtleties, it could still be
the 20th Century, with the bunting flapping in the breeze for the
home opener, Joe Torre feigning serenity, and the sun and wind
playing havoc with the visiting left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   And when it really mattered, there was good old Paulie and good
old Bernie and good old Tino whacking the ball, and good old
Mariano inflicting another demoralization on the Texas Rangers,
8-6.
</P>
<P>
   It's been happening so long that it could get to be boring,
except that sports fans tend to admire excellence, and so do the
players who perform it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get tired of winning,'' said good old Derek Jeter,
who precedes the aforementioned good-olds in the lineup. ``There's
a lot of tradition here, a lot of memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing is that a good chunk of tradition and memories
are still going around in a Yankee uniform. Nobody has dealt Bernie
Williams for a bunch of callow youths out of Florida State. Nobody
is cutting David Cone or Paul O'Neill to fit a salary cap, or
justify a youth movement. Nobody has underestimated Tino Martinez,
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is a throwback, and that's important to fans,'' said
Brian Cashman, the 33-year-old general manager. ``I can trust
people's track record. I don't believe players just suddenly turn
old at 37.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bad old days, Yankee domination should have been the
subject of a congressional anti-monopoly hearing. Now, stability
seems almost refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the alternative. Jets' fans got used to seeing Keyshawn
Johnson catch the ball over the middle, with a linebacker about to
clobber him on the spinal column. Then the Jets' new owner lets
Johnson get away to save money and accumulate draft choices, some
of whom might even turn out to be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman does not claim to understand the economics or the mind
set of football, but he has heard the Dallas Cowboys geared up for
another championship era by trading Herschel Walker for bodies and
draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to make a change,'' Cashman said. ``Look at
the great trade Doug Melvin made for the Rangers. He couldn't keep
Juan Gonzalez, so he got some good new players. That happens in
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Football is driven by shared network television money that
allows a Tampa Bay to sign a Keyshawn while baseball is rendered
inequitable by local television money. Plus, Cashman said, the
Yankees' longevity is a tribute to five straight leaps in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the king in his counting house has not made a grievous
error in a very long time, although the Yankees do practice
attrition. Letting John Wetteland walk after 1996 did not hurt
because Mariano Rivera was ready. They already miss Joe Girardi and
Luis Sojo, considered expendable after last year. But in Yankee
Stadium, the center continues to hold, and it feels all right
because there is not a certified jerk among them.
</P>
<P>
   The players appreciate their own continuity, but they also
understand mobility, particularly if it makes them rich, or
enhances their own home-town team. Martinez, with his roots in the
Ybor City section of Tampa, had his own take on the enrichment of
Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was great,'' Martinez said after the game. ``I'm a
Buccaneer fan. I loved it. I'm sorry, but he's a big-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could not admire a man signing for millions? But the Yankees
manage to get rich and stay put. This will be the eighth season in
the Bronx for O'Neill, the eighth full season for Williams and the
fifth for Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all professional hitters,'' said Jeter. ``They know
they don't have to hit a home run. They are content to hit
singles.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be fun to be a Yankee fan. There was Bob Sheppard,
managing to sound dignified on his 50th opening day despite the
witless sound effects blasting from the loudspeaker. There was good
old Zim, his fertile noggin secure behind a brand-new fence in
front of the dugout. And there was the mayor, stiffing potential
voters and donators upstate in order to sit with his kid in the
cold for the long game, and watch his guys win on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose in November, Giuliani won't be mayor much longer.
His team does not have term limits, and does not appear to be going
away.

UNILEVER SCOOPS UP BEN &AMP; JERRY'S FOR $326 MILLION IN CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben will still be around, and so will Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   So will the plaque that marks where the two boyhood chums
started the ice cream company that quickly became as much a symbol
of Vermont as the Green Mountains themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But their company, Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc., long a purveyor
of counterculture capitalism along with such flavors as Chunky
Monkey and Cherry Garcia, will now be part of the world's largest
consumer products conglomerate. Wednesday, Unilever said it was
buying Ben &AMP; Jerry's for $326 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   That left Ben &AMP; Jerry's fans in Vermont and beyond asking
whether the quirky company's commitment to social causes _ perhaps
its most important brand asset _ would survive.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of promises accompanying the deal, Unilever said it
would.
</P>
<P>
   The global giant that boasted $45 billion in sales last year of
brands that range from Lipton tea to Dove soaps, promised to keep
Ben &AMP; Jerry's operations and offices in Vermont, to maintain
employment at present levels for at leat two years, and to keep
employee benefits at current levels for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever also agreed to contribute at least $1.1 million a year
from pretax profits on Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream sales to a
foundation that supports causes selected by founders Ben Cohen and
Jerry Greenfield, from literacy to world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, currently the company chairman, and Greenfield, who
retired from active involvement several years ago, also will retain
management roles, Unilever said. Neither founder was available for
comment. Friends said Cohen had taken the day off for meditation.
</P>
<P>
   A Massachusetts-based socially conscious investment group that
earlier worked with Cohen and Unilever to take Ben &AMP; Jerry's
private rather than sell to another bidder, Dreyer's Grand Ice
Cream Co., said it played a key role in winning these commitments
and applauded Unilever's willingness to sign them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to understand not only the marketing purposes of the
Ben &AMP; Jerry's social mission but the purposes of the mission
itself,'' said Terry Mollner, chief negotiator for Meadowbrook Lane
Capital, the group that included founders and board members of Body
Shop, Rhino Records and Calvert Group Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   In what some saw as the most unusual of the list of promises,
Unilever agreed to form an independent 11-member board to monitor
how well these conditions are being met.
</P>
<P>
   Eight members of this oversight panel are to be named by
existing Ben &AMP; Jerry's management, one by Unilever, and two by
Meadowbrook Lane Capital. A Ben &AMP; Jerry's spokeswoman said the
agreement gives the two Meadowbrook Lane members the right to sue
Unilever if other conditions aren't met.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Ben &AMP; Jerry's plant in Waterbury, Vt., where the
company offers factory tours, some visitors Wednesday received news
of the takeover with dismay. ``Being owned by a big corporation
takes all the thrill out of eating their ice cream,'' said Doug
Darrow, of Worcester, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to see how it all sugars off,'' said Tim Shea,
at the Lake Champlain Chamber of Commerce in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch company whose brands also include
Gorton's fish filets and Wisk detergent, agreed to pay $43.60 a
share for Ben &AMP; Jerry's after rival Dreyer's, based in Oakland,
Calif., boosted its bid to $38 a share to counter the venture that
Cohen, Meadowbrook Lane and Unilever formed in March.
</P>
<P>
   With only $300 million in capital behind them, Mollner said, the
Meadowbrook Lane group backed out after the Dreyer's move. ``We
felt we couldn't win a bidding war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately _ and by coincidence, a spokesman said _ Unilever
also announced Wednesday an acquisition on the other end of the
calorie scale. It said it was buying SlimFast Foods Co. for $2.3
billion, also in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Florida-based SlimSoft, which with sales of $611 million last
year held 45 percent of the US market for weight-loss drinks, was
the bigger catch. But the Ben &AMP; Jerry's sale grabbed far more
public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of this company's success has been this community
responsiblity, this rural Vermont flavor they bring to the
business,'' Unilever spokesman John T. Gould Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Cohen and Greenfield from the day they opened their
first shop in May 1978 in an abandoned gas station on Church Street
in Burlington, this mission ``has become an important part of the
brand, the heritage,'' Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street welcomed the deal, bidding up Ben &AMP; Jerry's shares
$8.125 to close at $43.0625. Unilever PLC shares traded on the New
York Stock Exchange closed at $28.75, up 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever got ``a powerhouse'' in Ben &AMP; Jerry's, said analyst
Jeffrey Kanter of Prudential Securities in New York. Kanter said
the acquisition would allow the European-based conglomerate to
enter the US premium ice cream market on sound ground. Unilever's
US ice cream brands now include Breyer's, Good Humor and Sealtest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helps Unilever fill in a part of the category where they
weren't contributing,'' said Eric Katzman, analyst for Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co.

   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of steelworkers, truck drivers, auto
workers and other union members rallied on Capitol Hill and swept
through the halls of Congress on Wednesday in a show of muscle
intended to block a trade agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
   Their message, conveyed by union leaders and rank-and-file
members who came from as far away as Michigan and Nebraska, was
that trade was working for American corporations but not for
American workers.
</P>
<P>
   While the immediate issue is whether Congress should approve a
deal negotiated by the Clinton administration to bring China into
the World Trade Organization, the rally was also a forum for a more
diffuse anxiety about economic globalization and its effects on job
security at home and on poverty, the environment and human rights
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a long-term campaign to make the global
economy work for working families,'' John J. Sweeney, the president
of the AFL-CIO, told the thousands of placard-waving union members
assembled on the west side of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The day served to kick off a series of demonstrations planned by
a diverse coalition of groups for much of the next week around
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the WTO, those institutions have come to embody, to
their critics at least, the perils of placing corporate and
financial concerns ahead of ordinary people in managing the
increasingly free flow of money, jobs and goods across borders.
</P>
<P>
   Many union members attending Wednesday's rally said they were
not against trade in general and were not naively demanding a
return to a simpler, more secure world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, they are only opposed to a deal with a
country that does not respect workers' rights and would stop at
nothing, in their view, to steal away from the United States jobs
that are the backbone of the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking our leaders to keep our jobs in our country is not
living in the past,'' said Jim Brookins, a quality control
technician and local union official who traveled here from Rayland,
Ohio. ``It's preparing for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the trade deal with China said the unions were
misguided and that the best route to a stronger economy and more
security for workers was to open up new markets for American goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few thousand people bused to Washington today by AFL-CIO
labor bosses can't change the fact that the sky is blue, the earth
is round and trade is the key to the United States creating 20
million new jobs and the lowest unemployment in four decades,''
said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., a Republican who is helping lead
the push to win approval for the China deal in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to counter the unions' message, the administration
released a Commerce Department study showing that every state would
benefit from increased trade with China. And Gen. Colin L. Powell,
the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, endorsed the agreement,
saying that among its other benefits it would be in the nation's
best security interests.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's agreement with Beijing on the terms under
which China would join the WTO is likely to be ratified by the
Senate, but its fate in the House is unclear. Both parties are
split to some degree, and the outcome hinges largely on the votes
of about 75 undecided Democrats.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among them is Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, whose district
encompasses the heavily unionized Akron area. Sawyer voted to
approve the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 over union
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon Sawyer got a visit from a union delegation
that included Dave Prentice, a pipefitter at a Goodyear Tire &AMP;
Rubber plant in Akron.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing passes, it will hasten the deindustrialization
of the United States,'' Prentice said after the meeting, which
union officials said had been encouraging from their perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The union members said Sawyer had assured them that he would
vote against the trade deal unless there was an accompanying bill
that would call for sanctions if China violated labor or human
rights. Some Democrats are trying to develop such a bill in the
hopes that it would allow them to vote for the trade deal without
giving up the leverage that trade privileges have provided to send
a signal to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer's aides said he was not available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The tangled politics of the issue were on full display
Wednesday. Labor leaders were putting most of their pressure on
Democrats, warning that failure to back the union position on the
China deal could lead to a lack of support for the party from labor
in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters invited Pat Buchanan,
who is seeking the Reform party's presidential nomination on an
anti-trade platform, to speak at a separate rally they held
Wednesday _ a clear warning to Vice President Al Gore, who has said
he would renegotiate aspects of the agreement with China if he is
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, helping Gore reach the White House and
helping the Democrats regain control of the House are crucial to
advancing the union agenda in coming years, raising questions about
how hard the unions are willing to push to block the trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the president took this time to bring
forward this trade agreement because to some extent it does split
us,'' said James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters. ``It should
not have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The police no longer offer estimates of the size of crowds at
political events in Washington, and it was unclear whether the
rally attracted the 15,000 people cited by the unions.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders worked hard during the past month to round up
workers to attend Wednesday's lobbying effort, but union members
said it did not take much to persuade them to come.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the impetus to participate was their regret at not
having fought harder in 1993 to stop approval of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, which workers in the most affected industries
consider to have been a disaster for American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   During a break between visiting congressional offices, Ralph
Falls Jr., a teamster who drives trucks for a bakery in Reading,
Pa., , said he had friends who lost their jobs when a bleach
factory near his house closed and moved its operations to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA was supposed to help create more jobs and it took away
more jobs,'' he said. ``China will do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies of the economic effect of NAFTA have generally found
that it created fewer jobs than its proponents had claimed and
killed fewer jobs than its critics have asserted. But backers of
the trade deal with China acknowledged that they have to do a
better job of selling its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supporters of trade with China and open markets have to become
more sensitive to the anxieties caused by the pace of change, which
unfortunately are disproportionately and inaccurately blamed on
trade,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never had the case been stronger for jobs and weaker for
dislocation than an agreement in which we don't open our market one
bit and China opens its market dramatically,'' Sperling said.

FTC   REPORTED CLOSE TO SETTLEMENT IN HUGE OIL INDUSTRY MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Okla., Texas)  By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government is on the verge of
announcing a settlement of its large antitrust case that has
blocked BP Amoco PLC rom completing its $30 billion acquisition of
Atlantic Richfield Co., people involved in the case said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission met in a closed-session hearing
Wednesday afternoon to consider a recommendation from the staff to
settle the case after the two companies agreed to sell one of the
crown jewels of the deal _ ARCO's large oil and natural gas
holdings in Alaska _ to Phillips Petroleum for about $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the meeting, the agency was described as being
close to announcing a final resolution of the case, people involved
in it said. They said the delay was necessary to enable the
companies and the agency to complete work on what were described as
relatively minor aspects of the settlement. The agency is expected
to file a final consent decree with a federal district court soon,
permitting the completion of a deal that will reshape the landscape
for oil production in Alaska and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition of ARCO by BP Amoco was announced a
year ago and came under immediate skepticism from antitrust
officials because of the enormous consolidation in the oil
industry. In the months leading up to the deal, Exxon announced its
intent to buy Mobil, BP had acquired Amoco, and Texaco entered into
a marketing venture with Shell. The proposed acquisition of ARCO
would make BP Amoco the world's third largest oil company behind
the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Exxon Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   Following 10 months of review, the FTC filed a lawsuit in
February to block the acquisition on the grounds that it was
anti-competitive and violated the Clayton Antitrust Act. When the
Commission's lawyers filed for an injunction to block the deal from
being completed, it became the largest corporate acquisition to be
challenged by the federal government in history.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the proposed acquisition could lead to
significant increases in the price of crude oil for refiners in
California and other West Coast states, where prices at the gas
pump far exceed the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Together, BP Amoco and ARCO control about 70 percent of oil
production in Alaska, although under a pact with the state, the
companies agreed to reduce their control to about 55 percent. By
shedding ARCO's Alaska assets once the deal is completed, BP Amoco
will continue to control about 40 percent of Alaska production.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had responded that the suit was without merit and
that they had no control over the price of crude oil, which they
said was not set by production in Alaska but by the world market.
They also said that the deal had held the promise of reversing a
trend by increasing production in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to challenging the deal for its possible
anti-competitive effects on Alaskan production, the government also
contended that it would enable BP Amoco and ARCO to manipulate the
price of oil futures. The companies control a major crude oil
marketing hub in Cushing, Okla., that is used to store West Texas
intermediate crude, the most actively traded futures contract on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of the agreement with the Federal Trade Commission,
ARCO will sell its pipeline holdings in Cushing to Teppco Partners
for $355 million.
</P>
<P>
   Once the FTC announces its decision, there will only be one
remaining possible obstacle to closing the deal. That issue, Exxon
Mobil's recent lawsuit against BP Amoco and ARCO, was also moving
toward resolution Wednesday. Exxon Mobil, the third largest
producer of oil in Alaska, had tried to block the sale of ARCO's
Alaska properties to Phillips.

SENATE PANEL OKS COMPROMISE 
ON ORGAN TRANSPLANT REGULATION &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Wednesday signed off on
a Senate bill calling for broader sharing of the country's scarce
supply of organs for transplant while allowing medical
professionals to write transplant policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve consensus in a highly charged
field where we have not done as well as we might have in the
past,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, a former heart and lung transplant
surgeon who brokered the compromise he hopes will end a two-year
power struggle over who should decide who gets a transplant and who
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of negotiations, Frist, R-Tenn., finally reached
agreement with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and U.S. Health and
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Hours later, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee passed his bill unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   The bill clarifies the roles that the federal government and its
private contractor, the United Network for Organ Sharing, should
play in running the country's transplant system, and sets up an
outside committee of transplant experts to settle any disputes
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala will appoint all 21 members of the committee. Seven of
her choices will represent Health and Human Services; seven will
come from 12 recommendations submitted by the United Network for
Organ Sharing; and seven will come from 12 recommendations by the
Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of demanding that organs be shared
nationally, the bill requires that the transplant system ``seek to
reduce disparities'' in who gets a transplant based on where they
live or which hospital they choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be the most important public health bill
we'll pass this year,'' Kennedy said after the 18-0 vote. ``Organs
are really a national treasure, and in our society of equity and
fairness, we have an enormous responsibility'' to ensure an equal
chance of getting a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 69,000 patients are waiting for transplants of a heart,
liver, kidney or other organs. This year, only 20,000 organs are
expected to be donated. About 5,000 will die waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, organs are first offered to patients
in the geographical area where they are collected, even though a
sicker patient may be just a few miles outside that boundary. The
Frist-Kennedy bill encourages broader sharing by eliminating
geography as a serious barrier to transplant, along with
socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   If passed by the full Senate, the bill would proceed to a
conference committee to be reconciled with a House bill passed last
week. President Clinton has threatened to veto that bill, which
would give sole authority over transplant policy to the United
Network with little government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the Senate bill is ``a day-and-night improvement''
over the House bill and would ``provide a sound foundation for
moving toward a better, fairer organ transplant system for
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Network for Organ Sharing, which last week applauded
the House bill, said Wednesday that it hopes the Senate will pass
the Frist-Kennedy bill so the debate can move to the conference
committee and a quick resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see this thing over,'' said Mark Rosenker, managing
director of the network's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenker said too much time has been spent in the two-year fight
between Health and Human Services and his group, taking attention
away from the more important question of how to increase organ
donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that same effort were focused in organ donation awareness,
and in advancing the science of transplantation, perhaps this
incredible gap of supply and demand would be much closer,'' he
said.

NOT QUITE PSYCHO ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2{ stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' difficult, scandalous
novel ``American Psycho'' is about as good as it could conceivably
be. Intelligent, wickedly witty, faithful to the spirit and much of
the well-written letter of the book while judiciously paring down
its shocking violence to digestible, ``Scream'' movie levels, it's
a genuinely exemplary job.
</P>
<P>
   What we learn from this, however, is that ``American Psycho'' is
a book that defies filming.
</P>
<P>
   Close as director Mary Harron and co-screenwriter Guinevere
Turner come to capturing Ellis' demonic, satirical essence, their
version of this most visceral of contemporary psychological studies
feels stubbornly studied, dryly intellectualized.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any alternative probably would have been worse. You
may recall the firestorm that greeted the novel's release in 1991.
While the point of the piece was to make fun of (and some serious
comments about) the dehumanizing money madness of the Reagan era,
Ellis' central conceit _ that young Wall Street types were so
twisted by greed that there was no real difference between them and
serial killers _ was presented in such minutely described, gory
detail that the book was irreparably branded as snuff pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian filmmaker Harron's first feature, ``I Shot Andy
Warhol,'' was, like ``Psycho,'' obsessed with unhinged New York
scenesters. But it also had a strong, if unconventional, feminist
viewpoint, and she certainly brings a similar perspective to this
testosterone-poisoned project. Rather than the treatise on cutting
up women it could easily have become, the movie is all about male
panic at its silliest.
</P>
<P>
   And like the book, the film insinuates that the travesties its
unreliable narrator Patrick Bateman commits could be all or
partially happening in his head.
</P>
<P>
   The young British actor Christian Bale (``Empire of the Sun'')
plays appearance-obsessed Bateman. He makes more money than he
knows what to do with (one of the story's better gags is that we
never learn what he actually does for a living), but is completely
paranoid about how he's perceived in the professional pecking
order. He keeps confusing interchangeable dark-suited colleagues
with others, and is often mistaken for different people himself.
Life is mainly about looking perfect, possessing the best business
cards and making restaurant reservations (the eating part, for
these ego gods, is optional).
</P>
<P>
   Bateman's fiancee (Reese Witherspoon) is as obtusely
self-involved as he is, so she's naturally oblivious to her true
love's emerging murderous tendencies. She might know that he's
having an affair with a co-worker's coked-up bride-to-be (Samantha
Mathis), but she's probably cheating with someone in their
incestuous, overprivileged circle, too. Meanwhile, Bateman keeps
telling his adoring secretary (``Boys Don't Cry's'' Chloe Sevigny)
to wear better clothes.
</P>
<P>
   One night Bateman, well, baits, then murders, a bum in an alley
_ and is quite pleased to learn that he can. A hated business rival
(Jared Leto) gets taken out next. Having finally found his outlet
for individual expression, Bateman organizes increasingly elaborate
_ and deranged _ torture/murder scenarios. And you know he's a
sadist because he prefaces his rampages with extended commentaries
on the deep inner meanings of Phil Collins and Whitney Houston
songs.
</P>
<P>
   This is all as dark and archly funny as it sounds. But somehow,
the whole thing, if you'll pardon the expression, cut deeper when
you had to visualize it in your mind (it was a sneaky, disturbing
way of making readers identify with Bateman, while the film medium
creates a distancing safety zone).
</P>
<P>
   Part of the disjuncture here is due to Bale's performance. Not
that it's bad _ and it's certainly committed _ but it's at least
partially misjudged. He plays Bateman manic and jittery, which is a
justifiable choice; that's probably how the guy looks to others.
But the play is pitched from his point of view, and he inarguably
sees himself as a paragon of cool perfection. The character's whole
dramatic arc is from confident psychopath to uncertain psychotic;
starting that journey already nervous, Bale doesn't seem to go all
that far.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how astute and careful an adaptation of ``American
Psycho'' this film, quite admirably, may be, going way, way, way
too far is still what the story is all about. &QL;

NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE RESTRUCTURES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the Japanese
telecommunications monolith that has restructured over the last
year to become more adaptable and profitable, announced further
plans to better position itself for an explosion in demand for
Internet-related services.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new three-year strategy, the company said on Wednesday
that it intended to post consolidated profits of 1 trillion yen, or
roughly $9.43 billion, in the fiscal year that will end on March
31, 2003. That is about 43 percent more than its earnings for the
fiscal year that just ended, and it includes NTT's affiliates, the
mobile phone provider NTT DoCoMo Inc. and the NTT Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan was long on vision and short on details, which the
company acknowledged. ``There is nothing of substance here written
in this report,'' said Junichiro Miyazu, president of NTT. ``But it
shows we must start thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's former telephone monopoly restructured in July into two
domestic fixed-line subsidiaries, NTT East and West. It did more
restructuring in November, announcing plans to cut 21,000 jobs from
the two subsidiaries over three years.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is still facing a sharp decline in demand for
fixed-line, voice-transmission services, its basic business, while
consumers clamor for the mobile phone and high-speed data
transmission services that fall under the purview of its big
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Including Internet services that are provided over mobile
terminals, Japanese use of the Internet will surpass that of the
United States by March 31, 2001, company officials said on
Wednesday. Japan is now second only to the United States as the
world's largest user of the Internet, and NTT DoCoMo is outfitting
all its mobile phones with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The company also continues to wrestle with its labor force,
which remains bloated and overpaid by Japanese standards. On
Wednesday, it pledged to replace the traditional, seniority-based
compensation system with a more merit-based plan.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would reallocate 27,000 employees from NTT
East and NTT West to other subsidiaries where growth is higher.
``Mobility of people, this is a must,'' Miyazu said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts who follow NTT said they were paying little heed
to any of the company's plans because of the highly politicized
atmosphere surrounding the telecommunications industry in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is threatening to take Japan to the World
Trade Organization, contending that government regulation favors
NTT and demanding a reduction in the fees that NTT competitors pay
for phone connections in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take anything the company says right now with anything
more than one grain of salt,'' said Makio Inui, a
telecommunications analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney.

   NEW YORK _ Investors jettisoned technology stocks Wednesday,
driving the Nasdaq composite index down 7.06 percent, or 286.27
points, to 3,769.63. The slide was the sixth largest in percentage
terms and the second largest in points in the index's history.

<P>
   Much of the money being pulled out of technology shares shifted
into old economy stocks during the day, but the buying was abruptly
halted in the final hour, transforming a 1.22 percent advance in
the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average into a 1.43 percent
decline. The Dow closed down 161.95 points, at 11,125.13. And the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index plummeted 33.42 points, to
1,467.17.

   The Nasdaq has now fallen 25.3 percent from its peak on March

   ``People are fleeing the tech sector and throwing the money at
what they were castigating two weeks ago,'' said Thomas Rath, a

   No development stood out as a cause for the latest wave of
selling. But analysts said contributing factors may have been the
slide in Microsoft's shares after a leading stock analyst lowered
his revenue expectations for the company; a battering of Motorola's
stock on Tuesday, and again Wednesday, after the company warned of
slower growth; some unusually pointed comments by a Federal Reserve
governor about the need to keep raising interest rates; uncertainty
over upcoming government reports on inflation, and some investors
raising cash to meet Monday's deadline for paying their 1999 income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were also pressured by margin calls, with some traders
giving up on losing positions and others selling stocks to raise
cash to maintain their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long overdue re-evaluation in the new-economy stocks,''
said Alfred E. Goldman, chief strategist at A.G. Edwards in St.
Louis. But it's not a bubble being burst, he contended, just a
fairly normal downturn that ``reduces excesses and complacency''
and should prove generally beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   After the close, Advanced Micro Devices announced first-quarter
profits that surpassed the most optimistic forecasts, and its stock
climbed sharply in late trading. Wall Street has been expecting
strong profits, especially for technology companies, during the
reporting season that is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this week's carnage, analysts said some stability might
emerge in coming days if technology stocks are seen as bargains and
earnings reports, like that of Advanced Micro Devices, meet or
exceed expectations. Some, in fact, said that the stock-market
declines would slow the economy and reduce the Fed's inclination to
raise interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, ``is obviously achieving his
goal of compressing price-earnings ratios and bringing down prices
of technology'' shares, said Paul McManus, senior vice president of
Independence Investment Associates in Boston. ``There might be the
outside possibility that he might not have to raise rates again.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Dow sank 161.95 points Wednesday after being up as
much as 138.37 points, its technology components accounted for
virtually all of it. Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and IBM were its
biggest drags while Microsoft was the fifth biggest.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the Dow's 30 components ended with gains, paced by
American Express, one of the many winners among financial stocks in
the session.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final-hour slump in the blue chips and other
old-economy stocks, some portfolio managers who had favored those
over technology were hoping that the playing field was becoming
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers who are suffering with good-quality stocks can
finally breathe again,'' said Hersh Cohen, a value-oriented
portfolio manager at Salomon Smith Barney. ``The laggards have
picked up. It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen added that he thought relatively few investors,
especially those in mutual funds, have yet to realize the severity
of the damage to their portfolios and that he would be ``amazed''
if there was much of a rally in the market generally within the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of a possible shift in emphasis was that a PaineWebber
analyst began coverage of Ford and General Motors, calling the
former a ``buy,'' the latter ``attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnover was heavy, with 1.9 billion shares traded on Nasdaq and
1.18 billion on the New York Stock Exchange. Advancing issues on
the Big Board beat declining ones by a slim margin, 1,526 to 1,481,
with 56 issues making new 52-weeks highs and 45 new lows.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, April 9,

Socialist Realism Moves to the Web.

<P>
   In fact the magazine, a voice of liberal anti-Communism,
formally broke with the Socialists in 1936 and in the heyday of
Stalinism provided an outlet for Eastern European writers defying

MICROSOFT STARTS NASDAQ'S DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a day, blame it on Richard Sherlund, Wall
Street's leading Microsoft analyst. He trimmed his first-quarter
revenue estimates for the big software maker, and Microsoft's stock
price fell sharply on Wednesday, taking the Nasdaq market and the
shares of most technology shares with it.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., did not reduce his
earnings estimate for Microsoft, and he kept the company on
Goldman's recommended list.
</P>
<P>
   But his warning of lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter _
results that Microsoft will report on April 20 _ was seen as a
signal of a general slowing in the growth of the personal computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund revised his revenue estimates for Microsoft to $5.75
billion during the first three months of this year, down about 3
percent from his previous estimate of $5.95 billion. The slippage,
he said, was attributable to slower-than-expected growth in
Microsoft's mainstay personal-computer software products _ the
Windows operating system and Office suite of productivity
applications.
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft's revenue in those basic lines appeared to
have grown in the 8-to-10 percent range in the first quarter
instead of the 10-to-12 percent range that the Goldman analyst had
earlier predicted. His revision, he said, came after consulting
with his firm's other computer analysts and studying corporate
buying trends.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in the quarter, Sherlund said, was largely
attributable to the lack of purchases of new software by
corporations, which account for more than 35 percent of the overall
PC market. A key reason for the corporate slowdown, Sherlund said,
was the ``lingering lockdown'' in computer purchases related to
concerns about Year 2000 problems. The Y2K hangover, he added,
extended through February, though he added that things did seem to
have picked up in March.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate demand for servers, the hub computers that serve
up Web pages, e-mail messages and data on computer networks was
still brisk, as Internet-driven demand remained strong. And
Microsoft's fast-growing server business, Sherlund said, should be
up sharply for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the corporate market, from desktop PC's to
mainframe computers, appears to have been sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   The industrywide implications? ``Look to PCs and mainframes for
problems,'' Sherlund said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the industry is giving off contradictory signals. On
Wednesday, Advanced Micro Devices, which makes microprocessors,
chips that determine a computer's power, announced earnings that
were almost double Wall Street's expectations, along with record
revenue that topped $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The slow-growth picture, Sherlund admitted, may be contradicted
on April 18 when Intel reports its quarterly results. Its sales of
chips in the PC market for the quarter may be up 15 percent or
more. Yet, more than an indication of robust PC sales, Sherlund
said, that may be attributable to PC makers, who suffered from chip
shortages at the end of last year, adding to their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see is a Microsoft-centric view of the PC industry,''
Sherlund said.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst has had that view for some time. He was the analyst
assigned to cover Microsoft for Goldman in 1986, when the
investment bank handled Microsoft's initial public offering. His
career and reputation on Wall Street hinge on his astute analysis
of Microsoft. Last year, Sherlund was selected by Institutional
Investor magazine as the ``first team'' PC software analyst for the
sixth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund did not reduce his quarterly earnings estimate of 41
cents a share because he says the earnings reduction of 2 cents a
share from lower revenues will be offset by increased income from
Microsoft's sizable investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the first quarter, Sherlund remains optimistic about
Microsoft. New product sales should fuel higher growth, he said,
and Microsoft's antitrust case should shift to the appeals stage by
the second half of the year. And, he added, Microsoft's prospects
on appeal can only improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've focused on for the quarter is a transient issue that
seems mostly behind the company,'' Sherlund said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares closed down $4.50 a share, at $79.375. Its
shares are down 32 percent from its recent high on Dec. 30.

PRESIDENT PUSHES GUN CONTROL MEASURE
</HEADLINE>
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With the anniversary of the shootings at Columbine High
School a week a way, President Clinton came here on Wednesday to
intensify his public campaign for tighter gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any future president to have to go to Columbine
or to Springfield, Ore., or to Jonesboro, Ark., or to any of the
other places I have been,'' Clinton said at a downtown rally,
rattling off some of the sites of recent shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough enough to comfort the families of our servicemen
and women who die in the line of duty,'' he said. ``Children have
no duties, except to their studies and their families. Our duty is
to protect their lives and give them futures.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also appeared in a televised town meeting organized by
MSNBC in which the sharp divisions on the issue of guns became
clear. The president made his pitch for more regulation, while
local politicians, police officers and prosecutors weighed in on
both sides of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Kirklin, a student who was wounded in the school shooting
in the Denver suburb of Littleton on April 20, 1999, was one who
spoke against more restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see guns jumping off the table and shooting
people,'' Kirklin said, urging more of a focus on troubled people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lent support to a proposed ballot measure in Colorado
that would require unlicensed dealers at gun shows to run
background checks of gun purchasers within three days. Clinton has
been pressing for similar legislation in the Congress to close the
so-called gun show loophole, but it has become mired in gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally staged by gun control advocates, Clinton said on
Wednesday that Colorado could send a strong message to the rest of
the country by endorsing such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do this, you will give so much energy to people who
have been sitting around in other states like yours, thinking it
was a hopeless battle, thinking they couldn't win,'' he said. ``If
you do this, you will give enormous impetus to our efforts in
Congress to try to provide national protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in both parties are seeing next week's anniversary
of the Columbine shootings as an important marker in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, seeking to show that they also are moving on
a politically powerful issue, rushed a measure to a vote on Tuesday
that would reward states that adopt tougher sentences for gun
violators.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican National Committee chairman,
accused the Clinton administration of ``campaigning on the backs of
national tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at ground zero of the gun debate,'' said Arnie Grossman,
a leader of a Colorado group called Sane Alternatives to the
Firearms Epidemic that is pushing for the ballot initiative. ``We
did not choose to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the president's speech, gun advocates protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this society, everyone needs to be armed,'' said Kyna
Cheek, a college student who joined about 100 others. ``The
teachers should have been armed in Columbine. As a woman, I need to
be armed in case I'm on the wrong side of town and some guy bothers
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, there appears to be little likelihood of a quick
compromise. Different proposals passed by the House and Senate have
yet to be reconciled in conference, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said that there was
no use in convening such a meeting with parties so far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., urged Hatch in a strongly worded joint letter on Tuesday
to convene a conference meeting to resolve the dispute. But by
Wednesday, that apparent harmony was gone and Hyde, chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, and Conyers, the committee's ranking
Democratic member, were sniping at each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton, Hyde criticized House Democrats for
avoiding ``any compromise on gun safety legislation.'' Hyde offered
a proposal that Bruce Reed, the president's domestic policy
adviser, dismissed as a step backward.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers issued a press release accusing Hyde and his House
Republican colleagues of capitulating to the National Rifle
Association in making his latest legislative offer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. _ The blue test booklet, stamped with
the imprint of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and distributed on
Wednesday morning to 10th-grade classrooms throughout the state,
contained a lone essay question that students had two hours to
answer: describe why a supporting character in a favorite novel was
essential to the plot.
</P>
<P>
   But Jake Levin, 15, a sophomore at Monument Mountain Regional
High School in the state's northwest corner, decided instead to
vent his fury at the high-stakes tests sweeping the country. He
closed the booklet, pulled out six sheets of looseleaf notebook
paper and wrote an essay about how a standardized exam could never
measure the breadth of his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone in his defiance.
</P>
<P>
   From the Berkshire mountains to Cambridge and south to Cape Cod,
brush fires of civil disobedience flared in classrooms across
Massachusetts on Wednesday, as several hundred 10th graders, and a
handful of fourth graders and eighth graders boycotted the first of
11 days of statewide standardized testing.
</P>
<P>
   The state will use the tests to compare the performance of one
school with another, and identify students in need of better
attention. But next year, the stakes will rise considerably, with
sophomores required to pass English and mathematics tests as a
condition of graduation.
</P>
<P>
   State boards of education and legislatures across the country
are increasingly mandating such tests as a measure of what students
have learned _ by 2003, Massachusetts will be one of 26 states that
requires students to pass at least one standardized test to
graduate. Wednesday's protest was the latest, and largest,
indication of rising discontent among students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   In February, at least 200 Illinois students boycotted new state
English and math exams, deliberately filling in wrong answers. And
in recent months, parents, teachers and students have rallied and
railed against new standardized tests in Wisconsin, Ohio, Louisiana
and Florida, among other states.
</P>
<P>
   Some have taken their complaints to the courts, where they have
argued that such tests discriminate against poor and minority
children, as well as students in vocational and special-education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from parents, Wisconsin officials last
year repealed a requirement that students pass a new state test to
graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Levin is one of 36 sophomores who skipped the test here on
Wednesday and one of at least 300 public school students statewide,
according to interviews with principals and student organizers. He
likened his protest to those against the Vietnam War. And as a role
model, Levin cited his father, now a toy store owner, who was
almost expelled from the Putney School in Vermont for shouting
anti-Vietnam slogans at Sen. Robert F. Kennedy during an appearance
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a youth, and now I'm young,'' Levin said. ``We're
speaking out for what we feel is right and going against the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with several classmates, Levin had been stoking the
statewide protest for weeks, through a Web site they started:
www.scam-mcas.org. (For the record, ``scamcas'' stands for Student
Coalition for Alternatives to the Massachusetts Comprehensive
Assessment System.)
</P>
<P>
   The protests _ staged inside and outside more than a dozen
schools, as well as on the steps of City Hall in Cambridge _ were
peaceful, though not without consequence: 25 students at Arlington
High School, 20 miles northwest of Boston, were punished with
three-day suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   And at least 12 students at nearby Brookline High School were
immediately awarded grades of ``0.'' Those scores will be factored
into their third quarter averages, unless the students succeed in
``buying back'' the grade with a five-page paper to be presented to
their principal on Brown v. Board of Education and other landmark
Supreme Court education cases.
</P>
<P>
   The largest protest was at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School,
about 100 miles east of here and near Harvard, where 120 students
boycotted the test, many of them assembling in the school
auditorium for a teach-in that featured representatives of the
American Civil Liberties Union and an anti-testing group called
FairTest. The adult involved insist they have followed the
students' lead in protesting the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such widespread insurrection, Cambridge school
administrators had chosen to permit the event and had leveled no
punishment, on the condition that students did something
constructive during the period in which the test was given. Though
principals at some schools said they would grade the students'
alternate essays and projects, none of the work will be considered
valid by the state. The schools themselves are not expected to be
penalized by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts tests, scheduled intermittently from now
through the end of May and totaling nearly 20 hours, were designed
to assess students' knowledge in math, science, English and social
studies through multiple-choice questions and essays. The
protesters, who promised to boycott all 11 days of exams, variously
described the tests as too long, too focused on memorization at the
expense of critical thinking and too pivotal, considering that it
will soon be impossible to get a high school diploma without a
passing grade.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things young people are taught in this
country is that everybody is different and these differences should
be both accepted and respected,'' Daniel B. Elitzer, 16, an ``A''
student at Monument Montain, wrote in his alternate essay on
Wednesday. ``Different people learn in different ways. Why should
all students be assessed the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   But Abigal Thernstrom, a member of the state board of education,
said it was entirely appropriate for the state to erect one hurdle
over which all students must jump, and she said that the new tests
were fair. She said that the length of the tests, however onerous,
gave students ample time to show their abilities and that it was
not too much to ask every 10th grader to be able to interpret a
passage written on the level of Dickens or to explain how to solve
a geometric problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are asking for is knowledge that any student who wants
a high school diploma worth the paper it's written on should
have,'' said Thernstrom, a senior fellow at the Manhattan
Institute, a conservative research group. ``All other measures are
subjective.''
</P>
<P>
   State education officials emphasized that the boycotters
probably represented less than 1 percent of the 68,500 sophomores
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   But with their efforts on Wednesday, the students won the
admiration of at least one federal official, Sen. Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota, who called the boycotters ``bold and very courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, a political science professor, says he would not have
gotten into his alma mater, the University of North Carolina,
solely on the basis of his College Boards _ his score was under
800, out of a possible 1,600. He has introduced legislation that
would penalize states financially if they relied solely on tests as
graduation criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Such legislation is unlikely to pass, in a climate where
Republican officials, in particular, have been eager to show voters
they are holding schools accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the student protesters' biggest champions on
Wednesday were their principals. Never mind that those schools with
the largest percentage of boycotters _ virtually one out of every
four sophomores at Monument Mountain skipped the test _ will
probably plummet in the state rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a very good job with the boycott,'' said Marianne
Young, the principal of Monument Mountain, who moved here from
Vermont this year. And then, as if giving a final grade, she added:
``Excellent work!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of steelworkers, truck drivers, auto
workers and other union members rallied on Capitol Hill and swept
through the halls of Congress on Wednesday in a show of muscle
intended to block a trade agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
   Their message, conveyed by union leaders and rank-and-file
members who came from as far away as Michigan and Nebraska, was
that trade was working for American corporations but not for
American workers.
</P>
<P>
   While the immediate issue is whether Congress should approve a
deal negotiated by the Clinton administration to bring China into
the World Trade Organization, the rally was also a forum for a more
diffuse anxiety about economic globalization and its effects on job
security at home and on poverty, the environment and human rights
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a long-term campaign to make the global
economy work for working families,'' John J. Sweeney, the president
of the AFL-CIO, told the thousands of placard-waving union members
assembled on the west side of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The day served to kick off a series of demonstrations planned by
a diverse coalition of groups for much of the next week around
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the WTO, those institutions have come to embody, to
their critics at least, the perils of placing corporate and
financial concerns ahead of ordinary people in managing the
increasingly free flow of money, jobs and goods across borders.
</P>
<P>
   Many union members attending Wednesday's rally said they were
not against trade in general and were not naively demanding a
return to a simpler, more secure world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, they are only opposed to a deal with a
country that does not respect workers' rights and would stop at
nothing, in their view, to steal away from the United States jobs
that are the backbone of the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking our leaders to keep our jobs in our country is not
living in the past,'' said Jim Brookins, a quality control
technician and local union official who traveled here from Rayland,
Ohio. ``It's preparing for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the trade deal with China said the unions were
misguided and that the best route to a stronger economy and more
security for workers was to open up new markets for American goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few thousand people bused to Washington today by AFL-CIO
labor bosses can't change the fact that the sky is blue, the earth
is round and trade is the key to the United States creating 20
million new jobs and the lowest unemployment in four decades,''
said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., a Republican who is helping lead
the push to win approval for the China deal in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to counter the unions' message, the administration
released a Commerce Department study showing that every state would
benefit from increased trade with China. And Gen. Colin L. Powell,
the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, endorsed the agreement,
saying that among its other benefits it would be in the nation's
best security interests.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's agreement with Beijing on the terms under
which China would join the WTO is likely to be ratified by the
Senate, but its fate in the House is unclear. Both parties are
split to some degree, and the outcome hinges largely on the votes
of about 75 undecided Democrats.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among them is Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, whose district
encompasses the heavily unionized Akron area. Sawyer voted to
approve the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 over union
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon Sawyer got a visit from a union delegation
that included Dave Prentice, a pipefitter at a Goodyear Tire &AMP;
Rubber plant in Akron.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing passes, it will hasten the deindustrialization
of the United States,'' Prentice said after the meeting, which
union officials said had been encouraging from their perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The union members said Sawyer had assured them that he would
vote against the trade deal unless there was an accompanying bill
that would call for sanctions if China violated labor or human
rights. Some Democrats are trying to develop such a bill in the
hopes that it would allow them to vote for the trade deal without
giving up the leverage that trade privileges have provided to send
a signal to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer's aides said he was not available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The tangled politics of the issue were on full display
Wednesday. Labor leaders were putting most of their pressure on
Democrats, warning that failure to back the union position on the
China deal could lead to a lack of support for the party from labor
in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters invited Pat Buchanan,
who is seeking the Reform party's presidential nomination on an
anti-trade platform, to speak at a separate rally they held
Wednesday _ a clear warning to Vice President Al Gore, who has said
he would renegotiate aspects of the agreement with China if he is
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, helping Gore reach the White House and
helping the Democrats regain control of the House are crucial to
advancing the union agenda in coming years, raising questions about
how hard the unions are willing to push to block the trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the president took this time to bring
forward this trade agreement because to some extent it does split
us,'' said James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters. ``It should
not have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The police no longer offer estimates of the size of crowds at
political events in Washington, and it was unclear whether the
rally attracted the 15,000 people cited by the unions.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders worked hard during the past month to round up
workers to attend Wednesday's lobbying effort, but union members
said it did not take much to persuade them to come.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the impetus to participate was their regret at not
having fought harder in 1993 to stop approval of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, which workers in the most affected industries
consider to have been a disaster for American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   During a break between visiting congressional offices, Ralph
Falls Jr., a teamster who drives trucks for a bakery in Reading,
Pa., , said he had friends who lost their jobs when a bleach
factory near his house closed and moved its operations to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA was supposed to help create more jobs and it took away
more jobs,'' he said. ``China will do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies of the economic effect of NAFTA have generally found
that it created fewer jobs than its proponents had claimed and
killed fewer jobs than its critics have asserted. But backers of
the trade deal with China acknowledged that they have to do a
better job of selling its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supporters of trade with China and open markets have to become
more sensitive to the anxieties caused by the pace of change, which
unfortunately are disproportionately and inaccurately blamed on
trade,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never had the case been stronger for jobs and weaker for
dislocation than an agreement in which we don't open our market one
bit and China opens its market dramatically,'' Sperling said.

JURY REJECTS INNOCENCE OF SHEPPARD IN 1954 MURDER
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ohio, Calif.)  By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than four decades after a Cleveland jury convicted Dr. Sam
Sheppard of murdering his wife in a case that transfixed America,
another Cleveland jury rejected his son's efforts to prove that his
father was innocent and had been wrongfully imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Wednesday was a victory for prosecutors who
argued that Sheppard was an adulterous playboy who bludgeoned his
wife to death to get out of an unhappy marriage. The prosecutors
belittled DNA testing that pointed to a window washer as the real
killer.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was also a setback for Sheppard's son, Sam Reese
Sheppard, who has been trying for 10 years to clear his father. The
doctor was originally convicted in 1954 and served 10 years in
prison. In 1966, he had the case overturned by the U.S. Supreme
Court on the ground of prejudicial pre-trial publicity. Sheppard
was found not guilty in a second trial but died four years later.
He always contended that a ``bushy-haired'' intruder had beaten his
wife to death in her bedroom before knocking him unconscious. The
case became the basis for the television series ``The Fugitive''
and the movie of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Reese Sheppard said that the prosecutors had been
``venomous'' in their portrayal of his father and that their
motivation was political, calling them ``a younger generation of
prosecutors trying to protect the honor of its elders.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard's lawyer, Terry Gilbert, said the prosecutors' strategy
had clearly been to turn the case into another trial of Dr.
Sheppard, attacking him ``even more aggressively'' than in the
first two trials, even though this was a civil rather than a
criminal proceeding and the roles were reversed, with the son as
the plaintiff and the prosecutors as the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   A major difficulty for Sheppard was that he had to prove to the
jury, in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, that his father was
innocent, a task that requires a higher burden of proof than simply
showing that he was not guilty of murder.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury had found the father innocent, his son planned to
file suit and seek damages in the Ohio Court of Claims for wrongful
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated less than three hours after a trial that
lasted more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard, 52, of Oakland, Calif., maintained his composure as
the verdict was announced, but Gilbert, his lawyer, cried openly.
</P>
<P>
   At a short news conference after the verdict, Sheppard said,
``The Sheppard family may be bloodied, but we are unbowed. We've
been unbowed for 45 years. We'll be unbowed for all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, William Mason, stressed evidence that the father
had been having an affair with a laboratory technician, telling the
jury in closing arguments on Tuesday that Sheppard was a ``playboy
of the Western world'' who killed his wife, Marilyn, to get out of
an unhappy marriage, particularly after he learned she was
pregnant. ``He humiliated her in public,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason theorized that the murder weapon, which in the earlier
trials was said to be one of Dr. Sheppard's surgical knives, was a
bedside lamp. The police did not find a lamp in the bedroom, and no
murder weapon was ever introduced at any of the three trials.
</P>
<P>
   Mason also raised questions about Sheppard's motivation in
bringing the case, suggesting he was only interested in the money
he could win. ``It may just be,'' Mason said to the jury, ``that
you are being asked to award the killer's son for the killer
bludgeoning his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The basis of Gilbert's case was that DNA testing of bloodstains
found in the bedroom of the suburban Cleveland home where Sheppard
was killed clearly showed that they did not belong to either Dr.
Sheppard or his wife, and therefore there must have been a third
person in the room who committed the murder. That person, Gilbert
argued, was Richard Eberling, a window washer who was later
convicted of the murder of a wealthy widow, Ethel Durkin, and who
was found with a ring that belonged to Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor dismissed the DNA testing as ``mumbo jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert then pointed out to jurors that the DNA expert under
attack by the prosecutors, Dr. Mohammed Tahir, was the same expert
the Cuyahoga County Coroner's office had hired as a consultant to
help set up its own DNA laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Eberling died in 1998 in prison, where he had been serving a
life sentence for the unrelated murder. A witness who had once
worked with Eberling, Kathleen Dyal, testified that he had
confessed to her that he killed Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   One of the abiding mysteries is why the prosecutors fought so
hard. Privately, some of them had said earlier that they now
believed Sheppard was innocent and that Eberling was the real
killer. But decades after the murder, the case still divided
Cleveland, and Sheppard and his supporters maintained that some of
the earlier generation of prosecutors had brought pressure on the
current team of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Francis Sweeney, who was an assistant prosecutor in
Sheppard's second trial, is now a justice on the Ohio Supreme
Court. He voted unsuccessfully last year to block Sheppard's
lawsuit from going forward in court. Despite his involvement in the
earlier case, he declined to recuse himself.

THE HIGH ROAD TO HUNZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 16) 
 By EDWARD WONG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We sat in the Internet cafe of the desert oasis town, mulling
over the politics of this Silk Road region. His name was Surkat,
and he wanted to make sure that his American guest knew a few
things: His people were descendants of Turkic clans who had settled
in this arid land 1,200 years ago. They worshiped Allah. Most
important, they wanted independence from their Chinese rulers.
</P>
<P>
   I met Surkat while I was waiting to check my e-mail in Kashgar,
one of the most remote cities in western China. The young man had
piercing green eyes that revealed his Central Asian lineage. He and
his people were Uighur (pronounced wee-gur), the most populous
ethnic group in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
   They had built Kashgar, which seemed little changed from the
days when silk and spice caravans plodded through en route to the
Roman Empire. Donkey carts trundled past us in the warm summer
night. Thick-bearded men wearing skullcaps and sheathed daggers
haggled for melons at dusty roadside stands. Marco Polo apparently
witnessed such sights, as did spies and mercenaries engaged in the
19th-century Great Game between Britain and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Kashgar's aura of timelessness was an illusion. The three
Internet cafes near my hotel were an obvious sign of modernity. So
was my conversation with Surkat, which revealed how 20th-century
politics, particularly the clash between nationalism and ethnic
loyalties, had imprinted itself on the hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   I should not have been surprised. After all, Kashgar lay at one
end of the Karakoram Highway, one of the highest roads in the world
and an engineering feat born of modern politics. Built in the 1960s
and '70s by thousands of Chinese and Pakistani engineers, the
930-mile road symbolized the close ties between the two nations.
More than 400 builders had died carving it out of mountain flanks
in this remote corner where peaks in the Pamir, Karakoram and
Himalaya ranges soar over 26,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Near the other end of the highway lay Islamabad, capital of
Pakistan. The country was created in 1947 when the departing
British declared this part of their colony a Muslim nation separate
from India. That violent split down the ``line of control'' still
reverberates today, as India and Pakistan battle over the mountain
state of Kashmir. In consolidating its territory, Pakistan also
annexed once-independent kingdoms now divided by the Karakoram
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fighting in and around Kashmir, I planned to travel last
August for two weeks along the highway, catching local buses, jeeps
and trucks from Kashgar to Gilgit, a town in northern Pakistan.
From there, I would leave the road to head west toward the lawless
border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The journey was one leg of a three-month overland trip I was
making from Hong Kong to New Delhi. My motivation was partly to
trace the footsteps of my father, who lived in western China for
much of the 1950s while serving in the People's Liberation Army. I
was producing a documentary film on those years when he embraced
Communism under Mao Zedong in hopes of forging a better future for
his homeland. (He later became disillusioned with the revolution
and left for Hong Kong.)
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he arrived in Xinjiang, my father said, Chinese
and Uighur troops had fought together near the border to repel
Russian soldiers. But the people of the region had a long history
of bucking Chinese imperial rule. In recent years, Uighur
separatists have set off bombs in Beijing, more than 2,000 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Kashgar certainly felt closer to Istanbul. The yellow-tiled
minarets of the Id Kah Mosque dominated the central square, while
kebab grillers huddled in the building's shadow. Women draped head
to toe in brown cloth drifted like phantoms through the streets.
Alleyways led through a sprawling bazaar where blacksmiths hammered
away at horseshoes, and merchants sold everything from gold
necklaces to dyed silk cloths to dried reptilian carcasses (for
medicinal purposes). On Sundays, thousands of people converge in a
frenzied market filled with the cacophony of loud bartering and
bleating animals.
</P>
<P>
   After witnessing the shopping orgy, three travel companions and
I began our journey on the Karakoram Highway. I had met Vanessa, a
French expatriate, and Kevin, a British backpacker, in southern
China. A friend from home, Dune, was traveling with me for one
month. We tied our backpacks to the roof of a bus that ascended to
Karakul Lake, nestled high in the Pamirs. Floods had washed away
parts of the highway, and our driver was forced onto narrow dirt
tracks several times.
</P>
<P>
   By the lake, horse-mounted Kirghiz herdsmen led chains of camels
across the windswept plateau. The white crown of 24,760-foot-high
Muztagata loomed as the backdrop. A family with three children
invited all four of us to sleep in their yurt in exchange for $7
and a cheap Walkman that Dune had brought with him. Our hosts
boiled salted tea and cooked up a pot of warm noodles. Before
climbing under thick blankets that served as her bed, the mother
kneeled on a wool rug and prayed facing Mecca as a sharp wind
whistled beneath the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Dune and I said goodbye to Vanessa and Kevin,
who decided to stay in China. We caught a Pakistan-bound bus from
the one-street Tajik town of Tashkurghan, where Pakistani traders
regularly stopped to buy pungent Chinese liquor. The bus passed
three military checkpoints and slowly climbed up to the Khunjerab
Pass, which at 15,500 feet was high enough to induce altitude
sickness. In a local dialect, its name translates to Vale of Blood,
a reference to the days when bandits plundered merchant caravans.
These days, there was a bit more security: a Pakistani guard with
rifle and black beret waved our bus into his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   We briefly enjoyed a view of snow-capped peaks that stretched
away in every direction. Then we descended from the heights of
China to one of the most dramatic gorges in the Indian
subcontinent. The highway here had been blasted from the side of a
sheer cliff wall. A chasm plunged down to the Hunza River, which
churned with glacial melt.
</P>
<P>
   At the border post of Sust, we squeezed into a minivan for the
ride into the legendary Hunza Valley, where glaciers tumbled to the
roadside and farmers tended to their apricot orchards. Myths abound
about the origins of the valley's fair-skinned, blue-eyed
villagers. The wildest rumors claim they were descendants of a lost
branch of Alexander the Great's army, and that they live well past
100 years. Some said that the valley was the inspiration for the
mythical Shangri-La in James Hilton's novel ``Lost Horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   While the men wore the muted knee-length shirts and loose
trousers common throughout Pakistan, the women sported bright
pillbox hats and eschewed the face coverings seen in more
conservative villages. They sat on rooftops watching over apricots
drying on blankets. Children waved to our van as it sped by.
</P>
<P>
   We checked into the austere Batura Inn outside the village of
Passu, at the valley's northern mouth. The white building stood on
a bank of the Hunza River and across from the serrated cathedral
peaks of the brown massif called Tupopdan. Our room was not quite
as breathtaking: its bare concrete walls resembled those of a
monastic cell, and we had to enter other guests' quarters to use
their squat toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's owner, Izutullah Baig, told me that he built his lodge
in 1974 to house Chinese laborers working on the highway. Ali
Qurban, a schoolteacher whom I met in the village, also recalled
those days with nostalgia: ``I was just a little boy when they
came,'' he said. ``They came to us and said Mao this and Mao that.
Mao was great. And I believed them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Passu is known among travelers for its trekking. Our first
excursion took Dune and me to overlooks with sweeping vistas of the
jagged white ice of Passu and Batura Glaciers. The latter is one of
the largest glaciers in the world outside of polar regions,
stretching for 35 miles. In 1976, it crept to the edge of the
highway and ground up a Chinese-built bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we scrambled over two wooden suspension bridges
that crossed high above a roaring river. While we stepped gingerly
on the swaying planks, villagers scurried across with bundles of
firewood strapped to their backs. The path took us over a ridge and
down to the Karakoram Highway, where we spent the night at the
Shipsper Inn.
</P>
<P>
   As in other budget guest houses throughout the valley, flies
buzzed through the spartan rooms. The inn's owner and consummate
chef, Azim Shah, proudly declared that he had fought against the
Indian army in the state of Punjab in 1965, and in Bangladesh in
1971. Even in the relatively sheltered Hunza Valley, people talked
about the cease-less conflict with India as if it was destiny.
Children here played at war by mimicking gunfire and pretending
they were mowing down Indian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Dune and I hitched a ride on a brightly
painted truck to Karimabad, informal capital of the valley. Houses
dotted lush hillsides laced with irrigation channels. From the
lofty perch of Baltit Fort, the rulers of Hunza once presided over
their domain. Then in 1974, the Pakistan government forced the last
ruler of Hunza, called the Mir, to hand over his powers to the
modern nation-state, a move that still elicits resentment
throughout the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Dune rode down to Lahore to fly back to the United States, and I
spent the next two days on a punishing trek up to a lookout called
Hon Pass, at 15,000 feet. I camped one night in Ultar Meadow, an
amphitheater of peaks where shepherds watched over grazing flocks.
At night, avalanches roared down white slopes, rumblings from the
ice-lined bellies of mountain gods.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath blue skies, Hon Pass yielded a panoramic view of the
valley. The Hunza River glinted silver in the morning sunlight.
Jeeps careered down the highway as it snaked between villages. But
it was the pristine white mass of Rakaposhi that dominated views to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said the 25,560-feet peak was one of three mountains
in northern Pakistan that spirits of the sky had fashioned into
their homes. On this morning, wisps of clouds floated across their
lairs, shielding them from human eyes. I decided then that that
high kingdom would be my final stop in the Hunza Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, I concluded that Rakaposhi base camp seemed
too glamorous a name for the chilly, wet pasture at the foot of the
mountain. There were no international climbing teams. There were no
brightly colored expedition tents. There wasn't even a view.
Rainclouds had shrouded all the surrounding peaks. The only sight
was steaming cow patties along a stream bank.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the ``truly special place'' that one Australian
traveler had told me about? Was this the same mountain that had
left me breathless at Hon Pass?
</P>
<P>
   I had hiked up a grueling 4,900 feet from the village of Minapin
only to find a stone hut. A man named Muhammed Ali lived there
every summer, renting out tents and cooking meals for climbers.
</P>
<P>
   We quickly set up my tent as a light shower started. I lay
inside reading V.S. Naipaul and listening to raindrops spattering
on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   When darkness fell, I pulled on a wool hat, gloves and rain
jacket and walked over to the hut for dinner. Muhammed was stirring
a pot of dal while six other men sat on blankets around a fire,
boiling tea and rolling flat loaves of chapati bread. They had been
mining for black quartz for several weeks in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men tried tuning a small radio to a news broadcast.
Between the crackling of static, the announcer informed us of the
latest fighting near the Indian border. Muhammed leaned over and
told me how his 25-year-old brother had recently joined the army to
do honor to his country. But less than two months ago, a single
bullet struck him in the head during a battle. He was killed
instantly, and now only memories and a village plaque remained to
tell of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammed's voice trailed off as he dished out the dal. I
finished my dinner in silence, staring at the play of our shadows
on the wall. After a last round of tea, the miners curled up in
their blankets, and I walked outside to my tent.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape had been completely transformed during our meal.
The clouds had lifted from Rakaposhi. A full moon hung in the sky,
bathing the meadow and the peak in an unearthly silver light. The
blue face of the mountain gazed down at me.
</P>
<P>
   The world up here seemed to exist entirely apart from the roads
and villages of my recent travels. From deserts to mountain
terraces, the highways that crisscrossed those lands were forged
from human motivations like trade and politics and revolution. No
matter how astounding, such paths went on until they arrived,
inevitably, at conflict. Above it all, Rakaposhi and its sister
mountains bear witness.
</P>
<P>
   The Basics
</P>
<P>
   U.S. citizens need visas to enter China and Pakistan. Travelers
may contact the Chinese Consulate in New York at 520 12th Avenue,
New York, N.Y. 10036; (212) 330-7410, fax (212) 502-0245,
www.nyconsulate. prchina.org, and the Consulate of Pakistan, 12
East 65th St., New York, N.Y. 10021; (212) 879-5800, fax (212)
517-6987, www.paktrade.org.
</P>
<P>
   Because I speak some Mandarin, I found it easy to talk with
people in China. My companions managed to get by, even though most
Chinese do not speak any English. Those in the tourism industry
know at least a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, I found that many people could speak English
because they are taught it in school. Those working in tourism
speak it quite well.
</P>
<P>
   The Karakoram Highway is open during the summer and blocked by
snow most of the rest of the year. Even in summer, floods and
landslides can close off parts of the highway for weeks. Kashgar is
hot but bearable in summer, and the Hunza Valley is cool.
</P>
<P>
   Food and Lodging
</P>
<P>
   On the average, I spent less than $10 a day on food, board and
transportation while traveling the Karakoram Highway. The lodgings
were mostly budget guest houses, and I ate at street stalls and
small restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In Kashgar, I stayed in a dorm room in the Seman Hotel, once the
Russian Consulate. In Tashkurghan, I stayed in the basic Ice
Mountain Hotel. Budget guest houses with beds for as little as $1 a
night are common in villages in the Hunza Valley. These include the
Batura Inn and Shipsper Inn in Passu, Old Hunza Inn in Karimabad,
the Hoper Hilton Inn in Hoper and the Diran Guest House in Minapin.
I did not have any problems getting a bed on the spot (making
reservations can be hard because most villages don't have
telephones).
</P>
<P>
   In Xinjiang, Uighur food consists mostly of hard bread called
nan, lamb shish kebabs and pilau, a sweet rice dish. Chinese
restaurants can also be found in towns. In Pakistan, flat bread
called chapati and fried lentils called dal are the most common
dishes.

COALITION CHARGES THAT ADMINISTRATION POSITION WOULD ADVANCE STRIP
MINING 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of 21 environmental groups complained
to President Clinton on Wednesday that the administration was about
to side with the coal industry and undercut a federal court
decision that would restrict the strip mining of Appalachian
mountaintops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask you to ensure that no federal agency takes any action
that would compromise our clean water laws by allowing the
continuation of dumping of millions of tons of mining waste into
our waterways,'' the group declared in a letter to Clinton after a
meeting with administration officials. At the meeting, the
environmentalists said, the officials clearly signaled a threat to
the court ruling last October.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, which Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., denounced as
the potential death knell for the region's mining industry, Chief
Judge Charles H. Haden II of U.S. District Court in Charleston,
W.Va., found that the state had for years violated federal mining
and clean-water laws by permitting the blockage of hundreds of
miles of vital valley streams with the waste from mountaintop
mining.
</P>
<P>
   State and industry officials defended the dumping as permissible
and well controlled under mining and clean water laws. But a group
of West Virginia residents and environmentalists successfully sued
by complaining that communities in the mountain hollows were being
devastated by the blockage of waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, state officials and union lobbyists sought to block the
ruling in a rider to a bill last year. The plan was dropped after
the White House warned that the president would veto the bill if it
included the rider. But now, the environmental groups say, the
administration appears on the verge of reversing that support of
Haden's finding, which is currently under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the critical next step in the appeals process, the Clinton
administration is scheduled to file a brief on Monday. At a meeting
on Tuesday with Department of Justice legal specialists, the
environmental groups concluded the brief would undercut the
mountaintop decision, the environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined to discuss the likely contents
of the appeal brief but contended that the issue was more
complicated than suggested by the warning letter to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are considering seriously a variety of legal approaches to
take to this and haven't definitively decided yet,'' Lois Schiffer,
the assistant attorney general for the environment, who met with
the groups on Tuesday, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of the letter to the president, Schiffer said, ``We think it
misses that what we are doing is really interpreting two
complicated and interrelated statutes in a way that protects both
the environment and jobs.'' She referred to the laws controlling
surface mining and clean waters. ``We of course would prefer a
negotiated settlement here and we worked very hard at it,''
Schiffer said, ``but we're not likely to be there by Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups said Haden's ruling covered both laws and
that talk of a negotiated settlement seemed to be an attempt at
circumventing the decision or easing its effects.
</P>
<P>
   Haden shocked the coal industry in criticizing the ``mountaintop
removal'' technique of mining, as it is known in law, in which coal
near the surface is scooped up by mammoth machines after earth and
rocks covering it are dynamited and bulldozed away. ``If there is
any life form that cannot acclimate to life deep in a rubble pile,
it is eliminated,'' the judge said, in ordering the West Virginia
authorities to curb much of the waste dumping into waterways. ``No
effect on related environmental values is more adverse than
obliteration.''
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups said they feared that the
administration, in an election-year attempt to protect jobs, would
revive earlier arguments of the Army Corps of Engineers and other
federal agencies that the the waste dumping is legitimate under
current law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was very discouraging,'' said Joan Mulhern,
legislative director for the Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund. ``It
would be ironic if a week before the 30th anniversary of Earth Day
the administration decides it's okay to blow the tops off of
mountains and bury streams and rivers to get coal.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Cuff, legislative director for Friends of the Earth,
said that should the administration side with the coal industry,
environmental groups would pursue the issue into the presidential
campaign and seek a firm endorsement of Haden's ruling from Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to the president, the environmentalists declared,
``We ask that you protect the environment and communities in
Appalachia, not the coal industry.''

SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATORS REACH COMPROMISE ON CONFEDERATE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a breakthrough that seems likely to end a lengthy
and racially charged debate, the South Carolina Senate voted
Wednesday to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Capitol
dome and place a smaller version in a less prominent site on the
statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours earlier, the state House of Representatives
passed a bill making South Carolina the last state in the union to
enact a holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The King
Day bill passed with no real debate in the House on an 82-35 vote.
Because the Senate had already passed a similar bill, the measure
is now almost certain to be enacted after differences on wording
are worked out and Gov. Jim Hodges signs it.
</P>
<P>
   The flag issue has been much more divisive and has convulsed the
state's political culture for years, as black and white residents
argued over whether the Confederate battle flag is a symbol of
slavery and oppression, or of a noble Southern heritage. But the
compromise proposal passed Wednesday on an overwhelming 36-7 vote,
reflecting months of pressure from business and political leaders,
and an economic boycott of the state by the NAACP. Many
legislators, both black and white, who swore just weeks ago that
they would never approve this compromise changed their minds
Wednesday, saying they were acting in the best interests of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires one last technical vote by the Senate on
Thursday and will then go to the House in a week or two. David
Wilkins, the House speaker and a supporter of the flag, has
introduced a similar measure there, and many senators said they
were confident this compromise would pass in the lower chamber.
Although the measure could still unravel, the support for the
compromise by hard-line senators on both sides of the issue seemed
likely to smooth its eventual passage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, which leaders of both sides acknowledged
they found distasteful, the rectangular Confederate battle flag
would be removed from the dome and from the two legislative
chambers. A square version of the flag, which was used by the Army
of Northern Virginia in the Civil War, would fly on a 20-foot pole
next to the 30-foot monument honoring the Confederate dead that
stands in front of the capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The flag would stand between the monument and the Capitol.
Although it would be more prominent to those walking in front of
the statehouse, it would no longer fly in a position of
sovereignty, visible through much of the capital city. Reflecting a
concern that other Confederate monuments might also come under
attack, the measure also requires that no Confederate or
African-American history monuments on public property throughout
the state be removed or altered, and no public area named for any
historical figure can be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise proposal has been opposed by the NAACP, but in
the debate over the bill Wednesday, most of the black legislative
leaders who have been fighting the flag said they reluctantly
decided it was an acceptable way to end the divisiveness. It may
not spell an immediate end to the boycott, but supporters said they
hoped the NAACP would eventually come around once they saw the
measure was supported by the black legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I love the NAACP, I love South Carolina even
more,'' said Sen. Darrell Jackson, a black Democrat from Columbia
who has led the anti-flag forces. ``I'm doing what's best for the
state of South Carolina. Because 25 years from now, my sons will be
rearing their families in this great state. And maybe they will
look back and say, thank God for the men and women who had courage
to do right thing, although it wasn't a popular thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the white leader of the flag supporters, Sen. Glenn
F. McConnell of Charleston, said that while he loved seeing the
flag atop the statehouse dome, he had come to the conclusion that
moving it was the best thing for the future of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're acting because we all know the reality of where we
are,'' said McConnell, whose vote on this matter carries enormous
weight among the flag supporters. ``Like General Lee when he was
confronted with Appomattox and said, `There's nothing left for me
to do than get terms from General Grant.' It is very difficult,
extremely difficult for us on our side to vote to move that flag.
And it has been equally difficult for our brethren on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag first ascended the dome in 1962 during the centennial
observances of the Civil War, and several speakers during
Wednesday's debate noted that Wednesday is the 139th anniversary of
the day the war began in the waters off Charleston. The presence of
the flag, which stayed up in the 1960s as a gesture of defiance to
the Civil Rights movement, had engendered a passionate and often
bitter dispute over the origins of the war, exposing the vast
differences in the perception of history between blacks and many
whites.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually the pressure to move the flag extended well
beyond the black community. Almost every business group and
religious organization in the state urged that it come down, both
on economic and moral grounds. Mayor Joseph P. Riley of Charleston
recently led a widely publicized 120-mile protest march from the
seacoast to Columbia. Scores of sports and cultural events, along
with many conventions, canceled their plans to come to South
Carolina because of the boycott.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The seven senators who voted against the plan were all white,
and several bitterly accused their colleagues of selling out.
Senator Harvey S. Peeler Jr., a Republican from Gaffney, warned
that race relations in the state would worsen if the flag comes
down.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John E. Courson, a white Columbia Republican who keeps
the Confederate battle flag in his office near a bust of Gen.
Robert E. Lee, said the soldiers monument was the best place to
honor the flag, allowing the state to finally proceed with a less
divisive future.

LOS ANGELES PLAN FOR 11 SCHOOL DISTRICTS SEEKS LOCAL CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a move intended to increase local control of
education and improve student performance, the sprawling Los
Angeles Unified School District has voted to reorganize itself into
11 semiautonomous subdistricts, each with its own superintendent,
as part of a broader effort to head off more radical proposals for
breaking up the nation's second-largest public school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting here in a situation in Los Angeles where if we
don't turn around this system within the next 18 months, we're
going to be looking in the face at vouchers or breakup,'' said
Caprice Young, one of the seven school board members who voted
unanimously on Tuesday for the reorganization, which was proposed
by the district's interim superintendent, Ramon Cortines.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which officials hope to have in place by the
start of the new school year on July 1, the system's 790 schools,
35,000 teachers and 700,000 students would be reorganized into
subdistricts of 60,000 to 77,000 students that would have wide
latitude over most decisions. In addition to being under the
supervision of a general superintendent, each district would have a
local parent-community advisory council, but the elected citywide
board would still set overall policy.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for shrinking the district's 2,000-person central
office by more than 800 positions, and transferring many of these
employees to the new local districts, each with 50 to 75 schools.
About 300 jobs would be eliminated through retirements, voluntary
departures and elimination of vacant jobs. Officials project
savings of $46 million from the district's $7.7 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles schools have been plagued by a variety of
problems, including severe crowding, dismal test scores, disputes
over bilingual education and polls showing a widespread lack of
public confidence. At the same time, the system is facing
contentious contract negotiations with its teachers union, and on
Tuesday the board voted to approve a 6 percent raise, with merit
pay for teachers who improved their students' scores on
standardized tests. The union is seeking a 21 percent raise and
bitterly opposes merit pay.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines, a former schools chief in New York City and San
Francisco, was chosen last year to head the district temporarily,
pending a nationwide search for a permanent superintendent. But
since taking control in January, he has moved aggressively to
reorganize the district and has placed new emphasis on improving
reading skills. Cortines will appoint the district superintendents
from a list of finalists recommended by local community panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan gives local district superintendents the authority
to make decisions by giving them control of their budget,''
Cortines said in proposing the plan last month.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of groups advocating a formal breakup of the
district said Cortines' proposal fell short.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Thomas, co-chairman of Finally Restoring Excellence in
Education, a citizens' group that is backing a ballot initiative to
create two new independent districts in the San Fernando Valley,
said: ``Local control would still be at the whim of every new
school board. It's a nice try, but it doesn't go far enough.''

ETHNIC PROFILING IS RULED INVALID IN POLICE SEARCHES
</HEADLINE>
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a potentially far-reaching decision
contradicting a 25-year-old Supreme Court opinion, a federal
appeals court has ruled that in most circumstances, law enforcement
officials cannot rely on ethnic appearance as a factor in deciding
whether to stop someone suspected of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals declared on Tuesday that because of the growth in the
Hispanic population in the region, ethnicity was an irrelevant
criterion for law officers to stop a person, unless there was other
very specific information identifying the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S.
attorney's office in San Diego said the ruling would not affect
their policies, since they did not rely on racial profiling, but
some civil liberties experts said the opinion could have a
far-reaching effects on actions ranging from stops at the border to
traffic stops in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant decision because every law enforcement
agency came to believe race was one of the factors they could use
in stopping people,'' said Michelle Alexander, an expert on racial
profiling with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern
California. ``This puts an end to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hubacheck, a public defender in San Diego who
represented one of the men who appealed their arrest and
conviction, Lorenzo Sanchez-Guillen, said: ``We quite regularly get
cases where ethnicity is cited as a factor in why someone was
stopped. This case will be frequently cited in motions and appeals
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The case involved three Mexicans who were stopped in the desert,
about 115 miles east of San Diego, by Border Patrol officers acting
on a tip in 1996. The three were found to have two large bags of
marijuana, a handgun and ammunition. They were convicted of various
drug and weapons charges, served sentences and have been deported.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol had cited five factors in the decision to stop
the three, including a U-turn just before reaching an immigration
checkpoint, other suspicious behavior and their Hispanic
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal, the men argued that when the officers relied on
their ethnic appearance, they violated their Fourth Amendment
protections against unreasonable search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-4 vote, the court upheld an earlier decision that the
Border Patrol was justified in making the stop, but it firmly
rejected ethnic appearance as an acceptable criterion. The judges
said that officers must have very clearly defined suspicions before
stopping people in most circumstances, and that ethnic appearance
generally did not pass that test.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion contradicted a Supreme Court ruling that said it was
generally justifiable to use racial appearance as one such factor.
The appeals court majority said it was diverging from that earlier
opinion because the huge increases in the Hispanic population in
the border region required a change in the way the law was applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decide no broad constitutional questions here,'' the
majority wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the judges added, ``We conclude that, at this point in our
nation's history, and given the continuing changes in our ethnic
and racial composition, Hispanic appearance is, in general, of such
little probative value that it may not be considered as a relevant
factor where particularized or individualized suspicion is
required.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said that it was unclear whether the Supreme Court
would agree with that reasoning, but that it appeared likely that
it would eventually be tested. The defense lawyers in this case
said they did not plan any further appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a significant change from what the Supreme Court said
25 years ago, and though it's a plausible distinction, it's
uncertain whether it's one the Supreme Court would accept,'' said
David Sklansky, an expert on racial profiling at the University of
Southern California at Los Angeles law school.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit covers the states of Alaska, Arizona,
California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

PRESIDENT WILL NOT REQUEST OR TAKE PARDON, GORE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Tightens lead, adds Bush quote at end of story) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton will neither request nor accept a
pardon from his successor for any possible crimes committed in
office, Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question at an appearance before the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, Gore said Clinton had made his views
on the matter clear during the impeachment investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is way ahead of you on this,'' Gore said.
``He said publicly some time ago that he would neither request nor
accept a pardon, so that's the answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's remark Wednesday morning, Clinton has never
publicly addressed the question of a pardon. The White House said
the issue was raised in the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment
hearings in December 1998. Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, asked Charles
Ruff, the White House counsel, if he could assure the committee
that Clinton would not pardon himself or accept a pardon from a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Ruff replied.
</P>
<P>
   The question of a presidential pardon arose after recent
statements by Robert Ray, the independent counsel, who said he had
hired additional prosecutors and was considering whether to indict
Clinton after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray replaced Kenneth Starr last October as the investigator for
matters relating to Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky. The independent
counsel's office reported to Congress in 1998 that it believed
Clinton had committed perjury, obstruction of justice and witness
tampering in the Lewinsky affair. Most scholars contend that there
is no legal or constitutional bar to pursuing criminal charges
against Clinton when he is no longer protected by the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said earlier this
week that Clinton would not pardon himself before he left office to
escape prosecution by Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the president and vice president said today that they
did not know of any conversations between the two men about a
possible pardon.
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate among legal scholars over whether a
president can pardon himself. Some say that he cannot, on the
principle that a judge cannot preside over his own trial. Others
say that the pardon power in the Constitution is absolute and
extends to a president granting himself a pardon in advance of any
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   But mindful of the political firestorm that followed President
Gerald Ford's pardon of President Richard Nixon after Nixon's
resignation in 1974 _ and Ford's defeat at the polls two years
later _ several scholars and commentators said it was unlikely that
Gore would risk such a move to protect Clinton from any legal
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not proper to do it,'' said Akhil Reed Amar, a law
professor at Yale Law School. ``Yu can't be a judge in your own
case. It's a long-standing principle of Anglo-American
jurisprudence.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Amar added, ``it just doesn't pass the smell test.''
</P>
<P>
   Amar and other scholars said that if Clinton was to pardon
himself, Congress could find that action an impeachable offense,
although he would likely do it in the final days of his term in
office.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore did not absolutely rule out granting Clinton a
pardon, such a prospect is remote, several observers said. And even
if he did offer Clinton a pardon, Clinton could refuse it because
it would imply an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said he understood that Nixon's acceptance of his pardon as
a confession of sorts, but Nixon said it meant no such thing and
maintained his innocence after his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lacovara, who served as counsel to the Watergate special
prosecutor in 1974, said he took the statements of Gore and
Clinton's lawyers and spokesmen with a bit of skepticism. No one
can predict the political climate after the November election or
the public reaction should Ray charge Clinton with crimes next
year. Gore's statements Wednesday could quickly become, to use the
Watergate-era word, ``inoperative,'' Lacovara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were signals by Ford and Nixon, right up to the time the
pardon was issued, that neither of them had an interest in a
pardon,'' Lacovara said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of a pardon for Clinton, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential nominee, said
through a spokesman Wednesday that ``President Clinton has already
said he will not seek a pardon, and I take him at his word.''

 &HT;    Lanny Wadkins recalls key moments on Champion Course at PGA
National
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ If you want a quick primer on the
history of golf on the Champion Course at PGA National, just spend
a few minutes with Lanny Wadkins.
</P>
<P>
   Wadkins serves as a walking time line for the two most
significant events played on this course _ the 1983 Ryder Cup and
the 1987 PGA Championship. He was a central character both weeks
with decidedly different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, he hit a sand wedge to within 1 foot on the 18th hole
to ensure the Americans would not become the first team in Ryder
Cup history that failed to win on home soil.
</P>
<P>
   How memorable was that shot? ``I remember I kissed the divot,''
said Jack Nicklaus, who was the United States' captain.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Wadkins was walking down the adjacent 10th
fairway in a playoff with Larry Nelson for the PGA title. That
finish wasn't as memorable for Wadkins as he missed the green with
an 8-iron, then a 6-foot par putt to lose to Nelson in the
highest-scoring (and hottest) PGA ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as a good result and a bad result,''
Wadkins said. ``They were both pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadkins gets one last chance to play The Champion, starting
today, before the PGA Seniors' Championship leaves PGA National
after this week. But before looking ahead, here's a look back:
</P>
<P>
   THE 1983 RYDER CUP
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup matches didn't figure to provide much drama when
they were held Oct. 14-16. The Americans had won six matches in a
row and hadn't lost the biennial competition since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   But the '83 Ryder Cup was competitive from opening day, with
Europe taking a 4 1/2-3 1/2 lead. The Americans tied it at eight
points after Day 2 heading into the 12 singles matches, supposedly
the U.S.'s strength.
</P>
<P>
   With Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer winning their matches early
and Seve Ballesteros earning a tie with Fuzzy Zoeller after a
brilliant 240-yard, 3-wood from a bunker on the 18th hole, it
became obvious to Wadkins his match with Jose Maria Canizares _
they were the day's third-to-last pairing _ was going to play a key
role in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Canizares had a one-up lead through 15 holes when he hit his
approach shot at the par-4 16th hole into the water and Wadkins had
a 12-foot birdie putt. Canizares hit his ball out of the edge of
the lake and holed a 30-foot par putt, then Wadkins missed his to
keep the Spaniard in front. At No. 17, Wadkins made a 6-foot par
putt to keep his match alive.
</P>
<P>
   After Wadkins hit his second shot at No. 18 came word that Tom
Watson had beat Bernard Gallacher, meaning the United States had
clinched at least a tie to retain the cup with the
Wadkins-Canizares match the lone one remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we would have tied if I lost, but that's kind of like
kissing your sister when she's ugly,'' Wadkins said.
</P>
<P>
   With teammates and the captains from both squads lining the 18th
fairway, each player prepared to hit their vital approach shots.
Canizares, playing first, hit his wedge a little fat and it landed
on the front edge, about 30 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad at myself, because I knew how important that shot
was,'' Canizares said. ``I always aim at the flag, but there I just
hit it on the green.''
</P>
<P>
   With the hole 72 yards away, Wadkins reached for his sand wedge.
The notorious fast player didn't allow much time for the pressure
to build any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of on automatic at that point,'' he said. ``One of
the best things I do is play quick when I get that much pressure, I
don't have a lot of time to think about what the consequences are
if I screw up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably as nervous hitting that shot as any shot in my
life. It was not just for me, it was for a lot of other guys, I
know Nicklaus didn't want to be the first captain not to win on
American soil.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball went directly at the pin and plopped a mere 12 inches
away as the American players started hugging and kissing each other
in a wild celebration scene that was so uncommon for professional
golf at the time. Wadkins pumped his right fist, then later used
that hand to congratulate Canizares after he missed the long birdie
putt and the Americans had clinched another Ryder Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the highlights of my career,'' Wadkins said.
</P>
<P>
   THE 1987 PGA
</P>
<P>
   Every player remembers the 1987 PGA Championship for two things:
Sweltering temperatures and awful greens that conspired to produce
the highest winning score (287) in the 42 years the PGA has been
contested by stroke play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It truly wasn't a putting contest,'' Nelson said. ``Except for
the last hole.''
</P>
<P>
   A Wadkins held the first-round lead after a 68, but it was
Bobby, Lanny's younger brother. Lanny shared the halfway lead with
Raymond Floyd before he shot 74 and entered the final round a shot
behind Mark McCumber and D.A. Weibring.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than a half-dozen players with a chance to win
on the back nine Sunday, with Nelson, both Wadkins, McCumber,
Weibring, Scott Hoch, Don Pooley and Ben Crenshaw in the mix. Lanny
Wadkins
</P>
<P>
   moved into a share of the lead with a birdie at the par-3 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was one shot back until he appeared to get a huge break
at the par-3 17th, according to Wadkins. ``Nelson had about a
25-footer at 17 and he asked Crenshaw to move his coin,'' Wadkins
said. ``He pulled his putt, it hit the coin and went into the
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly true, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never pulled it,'' he said. ``The greens were so bad, I told
my caddie I needed to roll it right over his dime. It was one of
those putts that actually went right where I aimed it. The ball
rolled right over the coin, It stayed right on line and it didn't
knock it off line.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Wadkins came to the 18th fairway tied with Nelson for
the lead, knowing a birdie would earn him his second PGA 10 years
after he had defeated Gene Littler in a playoff at Pebble Beach.
This time, there would be no 18th-hole magic. Wadkins' sand wedge
landed 25 feet from the pin and he two-putted for the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have had the replay of the '83 shot.'' Wadkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff started and ended on the 10th hole, which at the
time was a nondescript par-4 (it has since been changed to a
par-5). Both players hit the fairway and had short irons to the
green.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's approach ran through the green and finished in the
rough. Wadkins punched an 8-iron that hit on the edge of the green
and it kicked into the rough. Nelson's chip rolled about 12 feet by
and Wadkins was faced with a 6-footer before the putting contest
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry made and I missed,'' Wadkins said. ``It was pretty
simple.''

SEEKING RESOLUTION, RENO MEETS WITH ELIAN'S MIAMI RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno arrived in
Miami on Wednesday evening and met face to face with Elian
Gonzalez's relatives here to try to persuade them to hand him over
peacefully, hoping that she might bring an end to a volatile
custody fight that has smoldered since November.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, the country's highest law enforcement official, met with
the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other family members at
a neutral site _ the , gated Miami Beach home of Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, president of Berry University.The Roman Catholic nun
opened her home to a January meeting between the 6-year-old boy and
his grandmothers from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ``is planning to work out a resolution,'' said Myron
Marlin, a spokesman for Reno, in a meeting with reporters in
Washington, D.C., Wednesday afternoon. ``She realizes it is a tall
order, but believes she may be the one who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be a true last-ditch attempt at winning
cooperation from the family, which has resisted previous appeals
from Justice Department officials to work out a peaceful plan for
handing over the boy. Doris Meissner, the U.S. immigration and
naturalization services commissioner, accompanied Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was expected to offer to use her plane to fly Elian's Miami
relatives to meet with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in
Washington and arrange an eventual reunion.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno and Gonzalez family members met behind closed doors,
Justice Department officials held off delivering a letter to the
family that would have required them to hand the boy over to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Wednesday night that if there
was no progress in the talks between Reno and the family, she was
prepared to hand the family that letter Wednesday night. Before the
talks, officials had said the letter demanded the handover of the
boy as early as Thursday morning. .
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear, as they talked, if the child's reunion with
his father would take place soon, perhaps later this week, or if it
the meeting would turn out to be just one more delay.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to have Elian and his Miami relatives travel to
Washington to meet with the boy's father Wednesday morning fell
through late Tuesday night when the boy said that he did not want
to go, said Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel Gonzalez came to the United States expecting to be
given custody of his son,'' said Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for
Elian's father. ``He has been here for seven days and Elian is
still in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The custody standoff has grown more tense almost from the minute
Elian stepped on dry land. He was found floating on Thanksgiving
Day in an inner tube in the Atlantic after his mother and 10 others
drowned in a failed crossing from Cuba. The boy's Miami relatives
and much of the Cuban exile population in South Florida have
refused to send him back to a communist dictatorship that his
mother died to escape. But the boy's father has insisted on his
son's return and many people, especially outside Miami, agree that
he has the right to speak for his child.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez requested that he, his wife, Angela, their
daughter Marisleysis and Elian leave their house in Miami's Little
Havana on Wednesday _ and the throngs of demonstrators and dozens
of reporters and camera crews _ for the less stressful atmosphere
of O'Laughlin's waterfront home on Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sensed a need to have some space,'' said O'Laughlin,
later adding that Elian seemed much at ease there. Elian and his
Miami relatives apparently planned to stay the night, if not
longer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the family seemed resigned to handing over Elian,
she said: ``I think the family is becoming more reconciled and
facing what, perhaps, could be pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said Elian's relatives were not talking about handing
over the boy Thursday, and would wait to hear what Reno had to say.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the family was joined at the nun's house by two of their
lawyers. As of late evening, Reno had not spoken with reporters
about what was said in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If family members expected to be free of the demonstrators who
have gathered outside their home for months, they were
disappointed. '
</P>
<P>
   Police stood in front of demonstrators as Reno arrived and
police cars lined the streets and surrounding areas. Two police
boats patrolled a canal behind the house.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, the crowd swelled to about 400 and became
more agitated. Demonstrators chanted a rhyme in Spanish, ``Reno,
you coward! Miami is on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, the demonstrators had been just steps away,
but on the beach, demonstrators were much farther from the house.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the demonstration, Ramon Saul Sanchez, staged a
sit-in on one of the main causeways linking the beach to the
mainland when rafters from Cuba were sprayed with a water cannon by
the U.S. Coast Guard last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez said only that ``the plan is that we pray. We pray
that the family can come together and work it out among themselves.
That would be the best thing for for them, for the boy, and the
community.''

PAIR UNITE TO SELL BONDS ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They are 26 and 28, friends since their undergraduate
days at MIT. One is a bond guru. The other has already built and
sold a Web company, for $100 million. Together, they're taking on
Wall Street's bond giants, in a bid to become the eBay of
fixed-income trading.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Robertson and Sam Choi are launching their company,
Visible Markets, in downtown Boston, with big-name venture backers.
Fresh from Amazon.com and Lehman brothers, they are the first in
the business to try to bring complex mortgage-bond trading to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the realm of day traders. Visible Markets will be an
auction site for big investors, like mutual funds, banks and
brokerage firms _ not for individual investors. The institutions
that deal in mortgage securities trade $16 trillion of them a year.
That's about the size of the equity markets combined. And it's more
than the outstanding debt of the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The sector is as arcane as it is big.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage-backed securities are bonds that banks and mortgage
companies create when they sell home mortgages in the secondary
market, for example. The biggest reason they're not yet traded on
the Web, bond experts say, is because of their complexity.
</P>
<P>
   But big investors seem ready to make the leap _ as long as
there's enough activity on the site that they can get good prices
on their trades.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Feeney, who oversees $1.6 billion as a partner and senior
fixed-income portfolio manager with Boston Partners Asset
Management, said online bond trading is becoming a valid option.
``The name of the game is to obtain the best price for a
security,'' he said. ``As pricing, trading and execution improve,
the client benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, if a big investor wants to buy a $20 million bond, calls
are made to several brokers. The buyer waits to hear back, then
picks the best price, makes the trade and files paper trade slips.
</P>
<P>
   Visible Markets says it can reduce the transaction time
significantly, and ease the paperwork. The buyer would go to the
site and set a time for an auction that day. Potential sellers
would then have time to research the bond for sale and log in for
the auction. The transaction gets done with the click of a button
and all the accounting paperwork would be sent electronically to
the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   Visible Markets has hired 45 people, among them some well-known
bond veterans. Stephen Boxer, a bond manager for State Street
Global Advisors, joined the firm as marketing chief after hearing
the founders' pitch to lure State Street as a client. Other new
hires hail from ABN Amro, Merrill Lynch and Boston's Independence
Investment Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a recruiting machine,'' said Bill Kaiser, a general
partner with Greylock Management, the Boston venture capital firm
that's putting $9 million into Visible Markets, in its first formal
round of financing. The sense of urgency is key, he said: ``If you
don't move fast, you're roadkill.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who is chief executive of Visible Markets, couldn't
get venture funding from Greylock for his first business. When he
started PlanetAll in Cambridge _ an online datebook and address
book _ in 1996, he said, ``We had to go to about 100 VC firms.''
Ultimately CMGI Inc.'s (at)Ventures fund gave him the nod.
</P>
<P>
   With PlanetAll's success under his belt _ he sold the company to
Amazon.com for $100 million in stock, which is now worth about $500
million _ Greylock was happy to comply this time. Robertson stayed
in touch with Kaiser from his last go-round, and the venture
capitalist admits to a soft spot for his fellow MIT alumni.
</P>
<P>
   And Robertson did something unusual. He put up $3 million of his
own money in this round of financing.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kaiser, ``A lot of guys wouldn't necessarily be putting
their money where their mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has a dozen employees out taking their broker's
exams. The firm is awaiting approval for its own broker/dealer
license and hopes to be live by the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They need to move fast. The top Wall Street shops got together
in 1998 to back TradeWeb.com, an online exchange for Treasury
bills, notes and bonds. The biggest bond traders in the business,
Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and and Credit
Suisse First Boston, have done $1 trillion of trades on the site
since. The group is testing government agency bonds now. But
they've not yet ventured into mortage-backed bonds. Bloomberg,
whose system is widely used by bond investors, also recently
launched an online bond trading program.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kaiser, ``If you can be known first, then it's that much
harder for the next one to be successful.''

RANGERS YANKED BACK TO FAMILIAR REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This time, at least the plot was better, filled with
twists and intrigue in almost every inning. Unlike six months ago
in the playoffs, the Rangers did battle the New York Yankees and
did score runs.
</P>
<P>
   But the ending was still the same. The Rangers still die in the
end, but this time it was more their own doing than because of the
Yankees' vaunted pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Having failed early to pummel struggling Yankees pitcher David
Cone, the Rangers saw a fifth-inning breakdown by Darren Oliver and
a seventh-inning breakdown by their left-handed relievers cost them
in an 8-6 loss at Yankee Stadium yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had a 2-0 lead in the fifth and a 6-5 lead in the
seventh, but a three-run homer by Bernie Williams and a two-run
triple by Tino Martinez allowed the Yankees to prevail in their
home opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same old New York,'' Rangers second baseman Luis Alicea said,
shaking his head. ``Seems like every time we get close, we can't
put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss makes the numbers more gruesome. The Rangers are 11-33
against the Yankees since Game 1 of the 1996 divisional playoffs
and 8-29 in New York since the start of the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play very well today,'' first baseman Rafael
Palmeiro said. ``We had some chances to score some runs and didn't,
and we didn't play very good defense. We gave 'em some runs, and
that probably cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver was probably as frustrated as anybody in the Rangers'
clubhouse, trying to figure out afterward how a well-pitched game
turned into such a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to hold a 2-0 lead, Oliver gave up a leadoff single to
Roberto Kelly to start the bottom of the fifth inning. He got
Alfonso Soriano to pop out, but Chuck Knoblauch hit another high
pop that dropped for a single in short left, and Derek Jeter
followed with a bloop single to right, scoring Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill popped out, but Oliver left a changeup over the
plate to Williams and saw it smacked over the left-center-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver had his way with us before Bernie hit that home run,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A flare here, a flare there,'' Oliver said. ``Just long enough
to keep the inning alive and bring Bernie up. I felt fine. I was
making good pitches all day and doing what I wanted to do. Even the
pitch to Bernie. I wanted to throw a changeup there, it just
drifted back over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run aroused the crowd and brought the playoff
atmosphere back to Yankee Stadium. But, temporarily at least, the
Rangers refused to give in.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer hit a two-run double in the sixth to tie the score,
and, after Greer dropped a fly ball to give the Yankees a run, the
Rangers scratched home two more runs in the seventh with the help
of Ruben Mateo's surprising sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   But the bullpen couldn't hold the 6-5 lead. Manager Johnny Oates
brought in Mike Munoz to face the Yankees' big left-handed hitters,
and it didn't work. O'Neill and Williams singled off him, Tino
Martinez smacked a two-run triple, and Ricky Ledee later hit a
two-out single to right off Mike Venafro to give the Yankees an 8-6
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching wasn't sterling, but the Rangers, despite scoring
six runs, were still lamenting afterward about their inability to
hammer Cone early. Cone allowed 10 of the first 20 batters he faced
to reach base through four innings, but the Rangers managed only
two runs in that span. They hit into two double plays, Gabe Kapler
was thrown out trying to steal, and Mateo struck out with the bases
loaded to end the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just something we have to overcome,'' Greer said.
``The past history is we usually play solid baseball against these
guys, but we haven't been able to put them away. We don't get a hit
at the right time. The only way to change that is to go out and win
a few games.'' nn

NEW ENGLAND LEAD IN COLLEGE DOMINANCE SLIPPING, SURVEY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New England's dominance in US higher education is
eroding, as the region's share of both college students and federal
research money declines, compared to other booming regions,
according to a survey by the New England Board of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   The region, long a national center for higher education, can
still boast one dubious distinction: It continues to be home to the
nation's most expensive public and private colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which will be released later this month, says
enrollment at New England's nearly 280 colleges has dropped from a
peak of 827,293 students in 1992 to 795,317 in 1997, and board
officials believe that number has dropped further in the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The six states' share of the nation's total college enrollment
has fallen from 6.4 percent in the mid-1980s to 5.5 percent in 1997
and is estimated to be below that today. (About 5 percent of the US
population lives in New England.)
</P>
<P>
   The decline is partly due to the region's slow population
growth, board officials said. That's the same trend that has cost
Massachusetts two seats in Congress since the 1980s, while states
such as California and Florida have gained seats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, schools in other parts of the country increasingly
offer cheaper alternatives, officials stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a historical view of opportunities in America, there are
just more people going to schools in the South and West,'' said
John Harney, executive editor of the board's Connection magazine.
``Students now have more choices in going to schools in other parts
of the countries. It's also usually less expensive to go to school
there.''
</P>
<P>
   New England is also losing its share of research and development
money from the federal government, though the region continues to
lead the nation in such grants. According to the report, New
England institutions' share of research and development money from
Washington has fallen from 10 percent in 1983 to 8.1 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   However, even with a boom in scientific programs at schools in
states such as Florida, Texas, and California, the region received
$2 billion in academic research and development projects. That
leads the nation, at $153 per capita, compared to $96 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   New England colleges and universities are still attracting
record numbers of applicants. But a history of low public support
for higher education has made New England's colleges and
universities the nation's most costly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite five years of tuition cuts for state residents at
Massachusetts public colleges, New England's public four-year
universities charged state residents $4,619 in average tuition and
required fees between 1999 and 2000, compared to a national average
of $3,356, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year private institutions in Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont charged
students $19,710 in average tuition and fees, while universities
around the country on average charged $15,380, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, according to the board's ``Facts 2000'' report,
the average tuition and fees have increased by $1,800 at public
campuses and by more than $7,800 at the region's private
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Although there may be a variety of reasons why New England's
colleges and universities are more expensive, the clearest
explanation comes from the region's historical lack of state
support for higher education, Harney said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the 1997 fiscal year, the six New England states
all ranked in the bottom 10 in higher education appropriations as a
share of state tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While state support for higher education in New England exceeded
$2.2 billion in fiscal 2000, the money amounted to only $169 per
capita, compared to a national average of $209, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, for better or worse, New England has chosen
that higher education not be a taxpayer burden and that the burden
should instead fall on the shoulders of students,'' Harney said.
</P>
<P>
   New England's scientific preeminence and consistent ability to
attract federal funds arises from its role as a center of
expertise, which the government has drawn on since World War II,
Harney said.
</P>
<P>
   New England's universities still depend on Washington for
research money, according to the report. Sixty-nine percent of the
region's university research dollars come from the federal
government, compared to 58 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much of the population has moved to the West and to the
South, so has much of the political representation,'' Harney said.
``That helps those regions draw more of the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the region's eroding lead in other areas, New England
continues to attract students from elsewhere. According to the
report, 25 percent of freshmen enrolled at New England campuses
come from other states, up from 20 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 5 percent are international students, many from
Pacific Rim Countries, the report said. Foreign enrollment
reportedly has jumped 45 percent alone in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   New England's colleges and universities, however, have had less
success in attracting minority enrollment. New England's
approximately 78,000 African-Americans, Latinos, and Native
American students represent 10 percent of the region's student
population, though they account for 14 percent of the region's 18-
to 24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, African-American, Native American, and Latino
enrollment has increased significantly, rising 38 percent, 41
percent, and 54 percent respectively in New England from 1990 to
1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means, I think, is there's still a lot of cachet
that goes along with going to college in New England,'' Harney
said. ``But we also haven't done as good a job as we could in areas
such as recruiting minorities.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans began rallying support on
Wednesday for their plan to offer insurance coverage of
prescription drug costs to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries,
even as the White House called the proposal ``a major
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The AARP, a leading voice for older Americans, cautiously
welcomed the proposal, but noted that the Republicans had offered
only an outline, without providing details of how the plan would
work.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert and a dozen other Republican
representatives unveiled their proposal as winds blustered around
them in an outdoor ceremony on the Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Medicare beneficiaries who choose this voluntary plan
will never have to pay retail prices for their prescription drugs
again,'' said Hastert, who supervised development of the proposal
by a group of 15 lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the government would subsidize a variety of
private insurance plans covering prescription drugs for people who
are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted that the coverage would be ``affordable,
voluntary and available to all,'' as signs at their rally said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican proposal, insurers would pool the
purchasing power of large groups of Medicare beneficiaries to
negotiate discounts from drug manufacturers, as labor unions and
employers now do for workers and some retirees.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they intended to impose a limit on the
amount of money that any Medicare beneficiary would have to pay for
prescription drugs in a year _ ``a monetary ceiling beyond which
Medicare would pay 100 percent of beneficiaries' drug costs,''
according to a summary of the proposal. Lawmakers refused to say
what the ceiling would be; congressional aides said the annual
limit could be in the range of $2,000 to $3,000 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Horace B. Deets, executive director of the AARP, formerly known
as the American Association of Retired Persons, said the Republican
proposal ``has merit and should be explored carefully.'' It is, he
said, a major improvement over earlier Republican proposals that
would have provided drug coverage only to older Americans with low
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, the government would pay the cost of
drug insurance for people with low incomes, perhaps up to 35
percent or 50 percent above the poverty level. (A couple is
classified as poor if it has income less than $11,250 this year.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, under the Republican plan, the government would pay
most drug costs for people with very high pharmaceutical expenses.
This would relieve insurers of perhaps 25 percent of the total
cost, allowing them to charge lower premiums to all beneficiaries,
the Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   Max Richtman, executive vice president of the National Committee
to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, which represents five
million beneficiaries of those programs, said: ``We are
disappointed. The drug benefits in the House Republican plan would
not be part of the standard Medicare benefits package. The
Republicans would provide a significant subsidy for the poor, and
there's nothing wrong with that. But the Republicans offer no
assistance for middle-income seniors, no assurance they would be
able to obtain or afford private insurance for drug costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats plan to highlight their commitment to Medicare drug
benefits in political events over the next two weeks, when the
House is in recess, and they hope to use the issue to regain
control of the House in this year's elections. With Wednesday's
proposal, House Republicans will be able to offer their own plan.
</P>
<P>
   Independent observers say a compromise is possible, though by no
means assured. President Clinton and congressional Republicans
generally agree on the amount to be spent, up to $40 billion over
five years, though House Republicans said they wanted to use a
small amount of that money to make basic medical care more
accessible to elderly people in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction from the White House and House Democratic
leaders was negative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's health policy coordinator, Chris Jennings, said: ``The
House Republican proposal is a major disappointment. The rhetoric
is good, but it is not matched by the reality of the policy.
There's no defined benefit. We don't know what benefits we're
buying here. And we don't know what the premium would be.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, said
Republicans had ``waited until the middle of an election year to
begin talking about prescription drug coverage'' for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are cynically making health care promises they
won't fulfill,'' Gephardt said. ``Like their efforts on managed
care reform, this is a sham proposal that was designed to comfort
the health insurance special interests instead of providing real
relief for health care consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Medicare generally does not cover prescription drug costs for
people outside the hospital, and one-third of the 39 million
Medicare beneficiaries have no insurance to cover drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office says that spending on outpatient
prescription drugs averages $1,539 for each Medicare beneficiary
this year, and it predicts that spending will rise to $2,075 a
person in three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas of California, one of the Republicans' top
health care experts, said: ``Our proposal would provide the same
financial assistance to low-income people as the president's. But
the benefits under our plan are richer.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans contend that their proposal is more generous
than Clinton's because the average amount paid out for each
beneficiary in a year _ the ``actuarial value'' _ would be higher.
When the president's plan starts in 2003, Thomas said, it would
provide drug coverage with an average value of $525 for each
Medicare beneficiary, while coverage under the Republican plan
would be worth an average of $620 to $720 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican proposal accepts the general approach
favored by many drug companies, and the main trade group for the
drug industry, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, has been frantically lobbying Congress. But Jackie
Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the trade association, said it had no
comment on the House Republican proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature for us to comment,'' she said.

RENO MAKES CUBAN BOY CASE A PERSONAL CRUSADE 
</HEADLINE>
 (With CUBAN-BOY) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The custody battle over Elian Gonzalez has thrust
Attorney General Janet Reno into what is most likely to be one of
her last starring roles as she returned to her hometown of Miami on
Wednesday in a gesture that transformed a Justice Department legal
fight into a one-woman crusade.
</P>
<P>
   The case has seemingly energized the 62-year-old Reno in the
final year of her stewardship at the Justice Department. At
considerable risk to her credibility and reputation, she began a
personal mission Wednesday to reunite Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Associates said that Reno went to Miami because she feels
comfortable in the fiery politics and passions that have swirled
through Miami's Cuban-American community since 6-year-old Elian was
pulled from the Atlantic Ocean off of Florida on Thanksgiving after
fleeing Cuba with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, they said, Reno made the trip to show that she is
willing to take every conceivable step to resolve the issue
peacefully. They added that she wanted to underscore the point that
she had tried every reasonable approach, in case a subsequent law
enforcement action by the immigration service is necessary to take
custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the associates said, Elian's case, in contrast to
seemingly endless partisan squabbles with Congress, has presented
her with a powerful issue to demonstrate that she can be what she
hoped to be from the start _ a forceful advocate for children.
</P>
<P>
   But her trip remains a gamble. If she succeeds in returning to
Washington with Elian without provoking an outburst from Miami's
Cuban-American community, it would represent an achievement for the
Justice Department. But it would be an even bigger boost for Reno's
standing, seriously depleted after years of bloody battles with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   However, if she returns without the boy, or if her presence
sparks demonstrations that frustrate legal efforts to transfer
custody of the boy to his father, it would serve as a stunning
personal blow to the attorney general, leaving her perhaps
irreversibly damaged as she enters the final months of her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dangers, her associates said she has thrown herself
into the case with a vigor _ deciding nearly a week ago that she
would fly to Miami if the opportunity arose. They said she has
worked on the case like an entry-level lawyer, poring over briefs
and carefully monitoring the negotiations involving the Justice
Department, Cuban officials and representatives of the Elian's
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Her working style has shifted to accommodate her interest in the
case. Reno, who has often annoyed her aides by her inability to
turn over even minor issues to subordinates, in recent days has
delegated much of her workload. That has allowed her to concentrate
on Elian, sometimes spending entire days riveted on the legal
strategy in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, even her public demeanor has loosened up, in
contrast to her often pinched and uncommunicative presence at her
weekly news conferences. Instead, she has been a forceful and
voluble advocate for the Justice Department, pressing for what she
has said the law unequivocally requires, the speedy reunification
of Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   She told reporters that she had been deeply moved by her meeting
last week with Gonzalez, a session that aides said had confirmed in
her mind the wisdom of granting the father custody, even if it
meant sending the child back to Cuba, whose government Reno has
been careful to criticize as a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's aides said her expression of such sentiments reflect her
confidence that she has stayed in touch with the Cuban-American
community and the politics that shaped her and Miami during the 15
years she prevailed there as a local prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   She still reads The Miami Herald daily and has kept up with
rising and falling fortunes of local politicians. She remains
fearless that her personal presence will calm a potentially
volatile population, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reno has experienced first hand the violence that can
erupt in the cross hairs of law and politics. In 1980, as the state
attorney for Miami-Dade County, Reno watched as the city erupted in
a riot after prosecutors in her office failed to win a conviction
against four white police officers charged with the beating death
of black insurance salesman.
</P>
<P>
   But her decision to go to Miami reflects a deeper longing that
has stirred her ever since she became attorney general, her
associates said, a desire to demonstrate that federal law can be
used on behalf of children and families _ a promise that her
critics have complained has resulted in better speeches than
programs at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's efforts in behalf of children have sometimes gone awry.
Early in Reno's career at the Justice Department, she gave the
final go ahead for the tear gas assault in April 1993 at Waco _ in
part because of reports of child abuse inside the Branch Davidian
compound.
</P>
<P>
   But the tear-gas operation, which was supposed to allow those
inside to flee, instead ended in a deadly fire in which some 80
people, including many children were killed _ a disaster that Reno
once said she thinks about every day.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's case has provided Reno with a clear-cut example of how
the attorney general can exercise power to improve the life of a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always talking about wanting to save a one child a
time,'' one government official said. ``Here's a real chance to
save one little boy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The new championship banner climbed the flagpole at
Yankee Stadium, curling in the frigid gusts of spring, and the
Yankees stood along the first-base line for a few moments Wednesday
and could reflect on the accomplishments of last summer. Then they
dispersed to their dugout for the first home game of the 2000
season, a revised roster facing new problems and obstacles,
starting all over.
</P>
<P>
   The solutions remain the same for the Yankees. One week into the
season, they aren't playing like a juggernaut that has won
consecutive championships; they are grasping for hits and runs and
pitching consistency. But it's a team capable of willing itself
into victory on days when it has the look of a loser, and Wednesday
the Yankees played poorly before pulling out an 8-6 victory over
the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, the center fielder, slammed a three-run homer
in the fifth inning and the first baseman, Tino Martinez, had a
double, single and triple. A crowd of 48,487, diminished by
no-shows who likely would have filled Yankee Stadium Tuesday if not
for the postponement of the home opener, waited in 44-degree
weather through a game of 3 hours 33 minutes. Wrappers and bags
loosely showered the field, swept by a cold wind. It was a nasty
day, a long, ugly game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play long, ugly-looking games,'' said David Cone, the
Yankees' starting pitcher, who was charged with four runs in
five-plus innings. ``But we win of lot of games like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no subtle mastery, no acute opening day strokes to be
admired in memory by middle-aged fans two generations from now.
This was strictly paint-by-the-numbers with thick crayons. Cone
required 40 pitches to get through the third inning, after his
catcher, Jorge Posada, took off his mask, turned and argued
face-to-face with the home plate umpire, Tim Timmins. The Yankees'
bullpen was charged with two blown saves in two innings. A Yankee
third baseman made an error for the third consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   As they often did in the first week of the season, the Yankees'
hitters worked themselves into favorable ball-strike counts before
squandering opportunities: In the fourth inning, Williams grounded
to short with the count 3-1, Shane Spencer popped out on a 3-0
pitch and Posada hit a weak bounder on two balls and no strikes.
</P>
<P>
   These flaws are not isolated, a few mistakes on one bad day. The
Yankees have not played well in their first seven games, their
defense erratic, their offense sporadic, the starting pitching
responsible for an epidemic of base runners. Cone, Clemens and Andy
Pettitte have started five games collectively and none has been
credited with a victory. ``We're not clicking on all cylinders
where we are into the swing of things,'' said Derek Jeter.
``Hopefully, we'll get something going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees looked inert in the early innings, and felt the same
way, as if they all needed a good dose of caffeine. It was cold and
windy, the bunting on the facade whipping in the wind and breaking
free of the long ropes used to tie it down. It was a perfect day to
hibernate, and for four innings, the Yankees looked dormant. ``It's
like when you're feeling lazy,'' said Ricky Ledee, the left
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Something almost always pushes them through the sluggishness,
however, a collective will or a sense of responsibility, and time
and again over the last few years, they have revived themselves to
win games like this. As they returned to the dugout to bat in the
bottom of the fifth inning, trailing 2-0, somebody yelled ``Let's
go!'' _ words echoed by others, Ledee said, until they were all
yelling, all contributing to a din.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Kelly, who had 1 hit in his first 11 at-bats this
season, singled to center field off the Rangers' Darren Oliver, and
two batters later, Chuck Knoblauch lifted a looper over the head of
shortstop Royce Clayton and in front of the outfielders, the ball
falling into a triangle of Rangers. First and second, one out.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was next, trying and failing to check his swing at one
pitch over his head. He fouled off a two-strike pitch, worked the
count to 3 balls and 2 strikes and dumped a single into right
field. Kelly scored, Knoblauch stopped at third. Jeter later spoke
of the at-bat with seeming embarrassment, but he kept the inning
going.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, who drove the offense in the first week of the
season, popped high in the infield, and carried his bat with him as
he trudged toward first, appalled. Two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Williams followed O'Neill to the plate; they are playing
together for their seventh season. ``We've got such a close-knit
group,'' said O'Neill, ``and a lot of that is because we've been
together so long. Everybody knows what it feels like to not come
through. Everybody knows what a great feeling it is to pick up a
teammate after that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver meant to throw Williams a fastball over the outside
corner, to the target set by the Texas catcher, Ivan Rodriguez, but
his pitch drifted over the middle of the plate and Williams
hammered it, the ball landing in the netting over the fence in
left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way to pick me up,'' O'Neill said to Williams in the Yankees'
dugout, but in fact, Williams had lifted all of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   They were ahead, 4-2, but blew that lead, and after
re-establishing a lead of 5-4, they blew that as well, falling
behind, 6-5, in the top of the seventh inning. Mike Munoz, who is
part of a Ranger pitching staff rebuilt with left-handers almost
specifically designed to combat the Yankees' left-handed hitters,
entered the game to pitch to O'Neill in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill pulled a single to right, however. Williams smacked a
single to center, O'Neill pausing as neared second, and then
speeding around the bag, taking third. Martinez came to bat,
already with two hits against left-handed pitchers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   When he faces a succession of left-handers, Martinez tends to
keep his front shoulder tucked in, rather than jumping out
anxiously. He had 2 hits in 10 prior at-bats against Munoz, but
this time, he lined a ball into the right-center field gap. O'Neill
scored, Williams sprinted around third and scored, and Martinez
slid into third, the Yankees leading again, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, a blast of wind hit the upper deck and
littered the field with a blizzard of paper, drawing a cheer from
the crowd. The temperature dropped rapidly, Posada said, ``like 20
degrees.'' Mariano Rivera took the mound in the ninth, froze out
the Rangers and the Yankees escaped to the clubhouse, somehow
taking a victory with them. &QL;

VARGAS IS NEW AND IMPROVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR, Calif. _ Fernando Vargas spends a lot time in front of
the mirror these days, nodding his approval and patting himself on
the back for a decision well made.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he's never fought while out of shape. One generally doesn't
remain undefeated and win a world championship at only 21 if one
isn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   However, dreams of attaining greatness danced in his head. He
wanted more. He wanted a body that works at absolute peak
efficiency and looks godlike, and he did something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas hired an accomplished personal trainer, brought him to
his Big Bear training camp and together they've redesigned him in
little more than a month: In short, he's ripped in comparison to
the old, not-so-defined Vargas, he seems to have inexhaustible
stamina and he's bursting with confidence as a result.
</P>
<P>
   His fight with Ike Quartey will be as much an unveiling of a
new-and-improved specimen as the fourth defense of his IBF junior
middleweight belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always trained hard,'' said Vargas, a resident of Oxnard,
Calif. ``We've now just taken it to a totally different level, to a
scientific level.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... When you look at it, fighters who've been really
successful, like Evander Holyfield, have had personal trainers. I
wanted that. And I can't tell you how good I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Vargas has always worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   He trained in a traditional manner: Long, steady runs and
minimal weight training outside the gym, sparring and bag work in
it. Countless fighters train this way.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked well. He proved in a grueling, come-from-behind
12- round victory over Winky Wright in his last fight that he was
in excellent condition and probably could continue to win
consistently had he changed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   However, the typical struggle to make weight was proof that
something was lacking. He went to sleep hungry often in the days
leading up to a fight, which taxed his energy and took a mental
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting weight meant cutting meals, cutting water, stuff like
that,'' he said. ``I'm only four pounds over weight now (11 days
before the fight). I don't even want to talk about how much I
weighed at this time for my last fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I always wanted to stay in bed. I felt tired all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter John Philbin _ or ``Doc,'' as Vargas calls him out of
respect for his knowledge _ and the cutting-edge approach to
fitness he's honed as assistant strength coach with the Washington
Redskins the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   His techniques are complicated to the uninitiated. However, the
basic concepts are simple:
</P>
<P>
   _ He has dictated Vargas' strict, high-carbohydrate diet.
</P>
<P>
   _ He has introduced him to stretching.
</P>
<P>
   _ He has strategically strengthened Vargas' muscles through
weight and other resistance training.
</P>
<P>
   _ And has tried to replicate the three-minute bursts of energy
and one-minute rest of an actual fight in cardiovascular training.
</P>
<P>
   While Vargas was eased into the program to avoid injury, he
quickly discovered things he never knew were possible.
</P>
<P>
   The diet has helped him maintain a constant supply of fuel and
help keep his weight down. That would be a load off the mind of
most fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The full-body stretching has allowed his body to do new things.
Before Philbin came along, Vargas, although a world-class athlete,
couldn't touch his toes. Now, he can all but put his head to his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really astonishing. I just feels so much easier to
throw punches from different angles,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin has been extremely careful when it has come to weight
and other resistance training, strengthening all muscles but
generally not building bulk. A variety of exercises were done with
relatively light weight and many repetitions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Philbin did no weight-lifting exercise that
isolated Vargas' biceps or triceps muscles to avoid building bulk
and hindering Vargas' ability to snap punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional thinking (in boxing) is that weight training
will slow down a fighter's punches. That can happen with improper
weight training,'' Philbin said.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin apparently didn't overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm faster and 110 percent stronger,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   The cardiovascular work has been particularly invigorating for
Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin has geared interval training _ mostly running _ to
prepare Vargas for the requirements of boxing: three minutes of
intense activity and one minute rest between rounds. That, combined
with some long-distance running and the resistance training, has
Vargas feeling superhuman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can throw punches and punches and punches (during sparring)
and I don't get tired. That's crazy,'' he said. ``Mentally, I feel
like I never get tired. And making weight is so easy. I'm eating
only good meals. I could make weight now. I feel so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quicker, stronger and I don't get tired. I'm so happy with
the Doc's work.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also happy with the way he looks.
</P>
<P>
   Before, Vargas' physique was nothing special. He was solid but
his muscles weren't defined. One observer even said he saw ``baby
fat'' on Vargas' young bones before Philbin arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Now, while he's no bodybuilder, he has been transformed. He
looks leaner, more defined, more fit.
</P>
<P>
   The change in his abdominal muscles is most conspicuous and
impressive: He's gone from flat to rippled, which prompts him to
lift his shirt proudly to show anyone interested in seeing what
about five weeks of work can do.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't hire Philbin to look good. However, aesthetics did
cross his mind when he made the decision to shape up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't see a lot of Mexicans ripped,'' he said. ``I
think it makes me even more marketable. It's the difference between
a million dollars and 25 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Roy Jones. If he didn't look like he does, would
people be as interested in him?''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas trainer, Eduardo Garcia, couldn't care less about how his
fighter looks. His only concern: results.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-school trainers might've resisted bringing Philbin into
camp. Not Garcia. He knew it was something Vargas wanted and was
willing to give Philbin and his new-fangled ideas a chance.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for him to see the benefits. He believes
Vargas is still as quick as ever and seems to be stronger and in
the best condition of his career. The new diet, he added, has been
a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   However, most important is what is going on inside the fighter's
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fernando has 18 fights and no losses and my son Robert
(Garcia) has 33 fights and only one loss. Obviously, the way we've
been doing things turn out OK,'' Garcia said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``... But mentally Fernando feels better because he likes what
he's doing. That's the most important thing. Of course, we won't
really know if it's as good as they think it is until he fights.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a fact of which Philbin is well aware.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to work with Vargas on a regular basis. After only
five solid weeks of work, this project is in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
   However, Philbin's job security might depend on the result of
the fight. Vargas must win or people will ask: ``What was the
point?''
</P>
<P>
   No one likes a good-looking loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the worst-case scenario, let's ask hypothetically, what if
he loses?,'' Philbin said. ``They'll say, `All the fancy stuff,
that science stuff, get rid of it. OK, he looks great but he can't
fight.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The question would become: `Why?''' &QL;

 &HT;    Take flag off Statehouse, S.C. Senate says
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ A new era in remembering the old Confederacy
emerged Wednesday as the South Carolina Senate approved 36-7 a bill
to remove the controversial Confederate flag from atop the
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which still must be approved by the state House,
came on the 139th anniversary of the attack on federal troops at
Fort Sumter in Charleston that started the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, worked out by pro-flag and anti-flag forces in the
Senate, would move the battle emblem to a Confederate soldiers'
monument in front of the Capitol. It looks destined to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our flag got abused,'' Sen. Glenn McConnell (R-Charleston)
told colleagues Wednesday evening. ``It got taken by politicians
and got used for racial causes. It got taken by hate groups who
stained it with their hands by taking it for their causes. But
that's not the long-term legacy of that flag. It doesn't belong for
that. And it communicates negative things to part of our population
because of those who misused it.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, who runs a Civil War memorabilia shop, has been a
crucial player in the apparent compromise. Senators applauded his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Another key player was Sen. Darrell Jackson (D-Columbia), a
member of the black legislative caucus. He kept members of the
NAACP, whose push for an economic boycott brought embarrassment to
the state, apprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had not been for the NAACP,'' Jackson said, ``maybe we
would not be here and it would be another generation 10 years from
now who would be fighting this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of flag supporters, many from Charleston, sang
``Dixie'' while waiting to get in the Senate gallery after a lunch
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Looking up to the lobby balconies from below, Sen. Arthur
Ravenel (R-Mount Pleasant), who had called the debate
``Armageddon'' for the dignity of the battle emblem, waved to
supporters and urged a reprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of his favorite songs,'' said Jacqueline Lear of
Charleston, who helped start the singing of ``Dixie.'' ``He keeps
telling us, `I'm for you. You be for me.'''

OUTSIDE THE TEMPLE, OLD JAPAN FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 16) 
 By PAULA DEITZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With their clusters of pagoda-roofed structures set among groves
of trees, temple and shrine enclosures in the cities and towns of
Japan are like small ancient kingdoms left behind from another time
as the bustle of modern life eddies around them. During the
Tokugawa period (1603-1867), so writes the historian Sumiko Enbutsu
in ``Old Tokyo,'' temple towns were first built on the periphery of
old Edo, now Tokyo, to fortify the city against military invasions,
which never happened. The forecourts of these compounds, once
populated with religious pilgrims, eventually became gathering
places and fairgrounds for people of fashion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, in a culture that wastes no space, these green enclosures
serve as quiet neighborhood parks except on designated days, most
often on Sundays, when the grounds explode with market stalls and
crowds jostling in search of a piece of old Japan or of
contemporary wares in that tradition. As purveyors of traditional
crafts and textiles, temple markets and shrine sales, like Japanese
gardens, are a strong link to the past. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The almost startling serenity of the Buddhist temples and Shinto
shrines found at the heart of these colorful throngs, and their
pleasant clamor of haggling, reinforces the view of the easy
rapport between the sacred and secular spheres of Japan. With wide,
inviting verandas under extended eaves, the temples and shrines
attract passers-by who make a ritual of tossing coins into a bin in
the hope that their prayers will be heard. Hanging from trees and
strings in shrine courtyards are slips of white paper with prayer
wishes that flutter in the breeze. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Add to this picture the festivals that are a phenomenon of
Japanese shrine and temple life. On a first trip to Tokyo, one
might be surprised to come upon a stately performance of Bugaku
dances at the Meiji Shrine on Culture Day (Nov. 3), but festivals
with their processions and banners in celebration of historic and
religious occasions are a weekly if not a daily occurrence in
Japan. When they are incorporated into a temple or shrine setting
on a market day, there is nowhere in the world one would rather be
than in the exhilarating flow of costumes and products that tell
more about Japan than exported electronic devices ever could. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On just such a spring Sunday in Tokyo, along Nakamise-dori, the
old narrow street lined with open market stalls leading up to the
Asakusa temple, brigade after brigade of firemen paraded on their
way to a shrine for the annual service in memory of firefighters
who have died in the line of duty. Firemen have always been revered
in this country of wooden houses, and old firemen's coats with
emblems of their profession, like ginkgo leaves, are a popular item
on the vintage clothing market. This day, as they marched through
the temple gates, they twirled white streamers hanging from signs
painted with Japanese characters. Some carried tall green bamboo
ladders for a later display of acrobatic stunts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the pageantry subsided, shoppers rejoined their own
procession from shop to shop, almost a hundred in the area, a few
owned by families going back more than a century. Wares included
everything from old cutlery to handmade toys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Handkerchiefs are a necessity in Japan, where public restrooms
even in chic restaurants or departmental stores do not dispense
paper towels. Instead, women delve into their pockets to unfold
some gorgeous piece of froth with flowers or other traditional
designs to dry their hands. As a result, one of the best buys in
the Asakusa market is handkerchiefs; I particularly liked one set
of 12 in white batiste, each printed with the flower of the month:
cherry blossoms for April, morning glories for August, and so on.
One soon gets over the ``too pretty to use'' inhibition in Japan,
where everything is beautifully presented and packaged. In a
country where gift giving is paramount, women often present
handkerchiefs to one another. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During iris season in early June, stalks of artificial iris
decorate signposts on the streets, and in the market stalls there
are fixed paper fans with iris motifs of every imaginable variety.
Late spring is also the time to rummage through racks of yukatas,
the crisp cotton summer kimonos printed in traditional
indigo-and-white patterns: geometrics, stylized waves, dragons or
historic figures for men; florals, bamboo stalks, fans or
butterflies for women.. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yukatas are a major item in the market street adjoining Tokyo's
Togenuki Jizo Temple, which is patronized by elderly Japanese who
go there to pray for good health. (The name of the temple literally
means ``to remove the thorn.'') Young Japanese friends in tow may
smile tolerantly as one goes through the racks of yukatas worn by
their aged parents on muggy summer nights. Though only a few on the
market are still hand-printed with stencils and resist-dyed in
vats, the designs for all of them are bold and seductive. A
hydrangea pattern with generous-sized blossoms was a good choice
(for $20), as it also signified the seasonal cult for hydrangeas.
(At Sanzen-in Temple, on the outskirts of Kyoto, 3,000 hydrangeas
bloom each June.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Arai Yakushi, a temple in northwest Tokyo dedicated to a
Buddha of medicine who cures eye diseases, the courtyard was
surrounded by hydrangeas in full bloom. Shaded by cherry trees
planted along the walkways, the grounds were animated by market
wares right up to the temple steps. One stone bodhisattva standing
on a lotus flower base near the entrance was overseeing a domain of
blue-and-white china garden seats for sale. On earlier spring
mornings at dawn, when the weather is nippy, merchants heat up
their morning miso soup, filling the air with a fragrant steam. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having already developed a taste for iris fans, I could easily
recognize a masterpiece in one washi, or handmade paper, fan with
boldly painted green stalks and delicate smudges for the purple
iris. It came from the workshop of Issei Yamauchi, who has attained
the status of ``living national treasure,.'' and cost about $48.
Displayed next to it was a box of rusted metal buckles for samurai
sword hilts. Cleaned up they would equal any preserved by museums.
White rabbits, symbols of longevity, adorned everything from
blue-and-white dishes and tea bowls to bean bags for children.
</P>
<P>
   But the real business at hand was the piles of blue-and-white
textiles that are the essence of the rural culture of Japan. Amy
Katoh, an American-born woman living in Tokyo, has become a trusted
collector of these traditional fabrics. Wearing a baseball cap, she
is unmistakable as one of the perennial early shoppers. In her
books and in her Tokyo shop, called Blue &AMP; White, she honors the
basic frugality of Japanese farm life that shaped rustic domestic
objects now treasured for their beauty as well as their
practicality. They include farmers' coats, gardeners' coats,
sleeping kimonos and coverlets that, much stitched or mended, or
quilted in a technique called sashiko, take on a character that is
both personal and historical. To identify and buy one of these is
to walk away with a genuine national treasure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   On this same Sunday in June, at the Togo Jinja flea market, a
shrine sale near the central Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Amy Katoh and
her loyal entourage created a spontaneous festival in the guise of
a hat show. Suddenly, on an arched bridge overlooking a pond,
clipped azalea hedges and a bamboo wisteria trellis, a band of
young musicians (cello, flute, recorder and guitar) struck up a
song about hats composed for the occasion. Keeping time, a line of
women fetchingly behatted snaked around the market booths looking
every bit like an unusual academic procession. The hat designer,
Ryoko Kodama, had taken fragments of old textiles from pattern
books, colorful ragweave, braided strips, and tie-dyed and pleated
fabrics, mostly in indigo but with sparks of red, to fashion some
30 hats. Both humorous and svelte, they brought down the house as
everyone at the market got into the mood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ragweave, not unlike rag rugs from New England, can be found in
this market in long segments (about $2 each) suitable for table
runners or sewed together to form large coverlets lined with
patchwork in faded country plaids. It is a very homey technique in
contrast to the racks of sophisticated silk kimonos that are a
fixture of these sales. Because clothing in Japan is often sold
after death, there is always a surplus of fine garments to be
recycled through these sales, both kimonos and the hip-length outer
wrap in wool or silk called haori. In blue and white, a short
gardener's jacket for sale for about $50 with a round family crest
on the back carried with it all the integrity of this time-honored
profession. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Displayed against the massive posts of a shrine pavilion was a
collection of richly grained storage chests, or tansu, with iron
fittings that often serve as the only furniture in a traditional
Japanese home. Their architectural configurations and drawers are
designed for very specific household functions . Though everyone
mills around with head lowered so as not to miss a priceless
antique, it pays to look up and notice how the crowd moves along
the shrine path in waves under a series of great torii gates like
the pilgrims of old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though not an actual temple or shrine, the immense Tsukiji
wholesale fish market in Tokyo has become an almost sacred place to
visit in the early morning hours. In itself it is an amazing sight,
but equally illuminating are the surrounding market streets where
vendors sell everything associated with the preparation and service
of fish, from the split bamboo regulation baskets to green bamboo
sake cups. This is where local residents stock up on festive table
settings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Takayama, a small city nestled into the Hida Mountains _ a
little over four hours northwest of Tokyo by train _ the morning
markets are famous for their local products as well as their
settings. Having retained the look of an old Japanese town lined
with wooden buildings and merchants' houses (Takayama craftsmen
helped build Kyoto), it boasts the only local government
headquarters surviving from the Edo period. This complex of wood
and whitewashed buildings with upturned roofs, along with its rice
warehouses and an enclosed garden, was in continuous use from 1692
until 1969. The Takayama Jinya, as it is called, has become a
dramatic backdrop for an early-morning market where farm women sell
produce and crafts particular to this mountainous region. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the Japanese love of children and their
ingenuity for homemade dolls and toys, one of the good-luck charms
sold to children in this market is rag dolls of different sizes
(about $3 for a small one), usually red, dressed in blue and white
with a tucked-in kerchief (a uniform not unlike that worn by the
women at the booths). Tied around one shoulder with red thread is a
little red-and-white sack of medicinal herbs to ward off illness. A
small tinkling bell completes this irresistible composition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the booths specialize in bonsai of azalea, maple,
cotone-aster or spruce and in potted seasonal plants like
columbine, tree peonies, iris and hydrangea. Along Takayama's
narrow streets, these plants are artfully combined into miniature
gardens on the stone-block sidewalks, their brilliant greens
glowing against the dark wood latticed facades. (Some markets, like
Omicho in the western city of Kanazawa, also sell seeds, including
the Japanese Snow of Dawn morning glory, with only 10 seeds to a
packet.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The morning market in Takayama continues a few blocks away on
the other side of the Miyagawa River that runs through town. Booths
are set up between two main bridges above steep stone banks dotted
with willow trees. The temples in the side streets are never far
from the action. Among the wooden products for sale (for $2.85) are
the elegantly austere flat-bottomed ladles with long handles that
appear at stone temple and shrine fountains all over Japan for
washing one's hands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pottery is always in abundance, and it does not take long to
distinguish quality. From a basket of wheel-thrown bud vases or
weed jars for $3.50 each, it is easy to select interesting pinched
shapes and variegated glazes. I have chosen one unusual and
appealing tea cup at a time at various markets to form a useful and
memorable collection. In this sake-brewing region, everything that
pertains to the drink is sold in Takayama: old storage jars,
bottles and cups.
</P>
<P>
   In Kyoto, when Toji temple was founded in the eighth century, it
was one of only two Buddhist temples the Emperor permitted to be
built in the city proper. Boasting the highest pagoda in Japan
(five stories, 180 feet) and massive structures with multitiered
brackets, this is a major architectural complex with a lotus pond
and gardens. Its stucco walls and tree-lined avenues are a serene
background for antiques on market days, the first Sunday and the
21st of each month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bright blue tarpaulins and red, yellow and blue umbrellas
shading individual booths make a garish contrast with the temple
buildings, but the wares strewn out on tatami mats cover the whole
range of Japanese culture. Among stacks of old baskets were
weathered winnowers, the shallow scoops used by Japanese gardeners
to gather dead leaves. Here were elegant plates brushed with
delicate calligraphy, a pottery tea bowl in a deep black glaze with
touches of red, old kettles, sake bottles and fragile fans
decorated with flying cranes. Among the textiles were homespun
indigo garments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the afternoon, as shoppers and dealers were
leaving, one could imagine the succession of historic occasions
that filled these courtyards in the past. Today, by providing space
for a kind of commodities exchange, the markets have transformed an
urban landscape into a cultural experience. Wandering off through
the back streets of Kyoto at dusk, I walked through many a covered
market serving a local neighborhood. Emerging finally along one of
the narrow canals that flow through the city, I came upon a perfect
hydrangea bush cascading over the edge alongside a tree filled with
the glimmering lights of fireflies _ a sacred place of its own.
This is the memory I've preserved when wearing the yukata in the
blue-and-white hydrangea print.

MATH TEACH URGE MOVE BACK TO FUNDAMENTALS
</HEADLINE>
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an about-face, the nation's most influential group
of mathematics teachers announced on Wednesday that it was
recommending, in essence, that the arithmetic be put back into
mathematics, urging teachers to emphasize the fundamentals of
computation rather than focus on concepts and reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
galvanized math educators from kindergarten through high school by
preaching that it was more important for students to understand how
they arrived at an answer, rather than the answer itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the teachers de-emphasized such basic
computational skills as memorization of multiplication tables. As
the proposals were put in place by hundreds of school boards,
parents and even some teachers and university mathematicians began
to rebel.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after being on the defensive for years, the
council issued a revision that critics and even some supporters of
the old curriculum said was a retreat. While not abandoning its
original agenda, the council added strong language to its
groundbreaking 1989 standards, emphasizing accuracy, efficiency and
basic skills like memorizing the multiplication tables.
</P>
<P>
   The message, said Joan Ferrini-Mundy, chairwoman of the
committee to revise the standards, is: ``Get the right answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the revised standards at the group's national
convention, which was attended by 18,000 math teachers,
Ferrini-Mundy said that students must be fluent in arithmetic
computation, use efficient and accurate methods, and understand
those methods. They should know basic addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division combinations as well as understand
them.
</P>
<P>
   The new document, the 402-page ``Principles and Standards for
School Mathematics,'' is the first major revision of the council's
influential standards. The change is likely to have a huge impact
on the way mathematics is taught, since the council's document is
the closest thing this country has to a national curriculum in
mathematics. The 1989 standards have been adopted in part or in
whole by 49 states, according to Glenda Lappan, president of the
council of math teachers. The standards have shaped what goes on in
countless classrooms, dictated the design of standardized tests and
inspired widely used textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, for instance, fourth- and eighth-grade
mathematics tests introduced last year give partial credit for the
right answer, and full credit only if the student is able to
explain how he or she arrived at that answer. For more than a
decade, students as young as kindergartners have been encouraged to
use calculators rather than computation; memorization, even of
multiplication tables, has been spurned, and children have been
given credit for arriving at reasonable rather than accurate
answers, the implication being that there is no one right way of
doing math. The council's documents have urged this approach as a
better way of teaching minority students, female students and
others perceived as disadvantaged or afraid of math.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the council said they were not conceding error;
rather, they said, they had been misunderstood. In trying to make
mathematics more accessible and to make the point that mathematics
learned without understanding will soon be forgotten, they had,
perhaps, preached too fervently, some council members said. The
previous stress on arriving at reasonable rather than accurate
answers had been too readily interpreted as a way of ``dumbing
down'' math, they said, when the intention was to reach more
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned to be more careful in our language,'' said Alan
Schoenfeld, one of the authors of the new high school standards and
a professor of education and mathematics at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Lee V. Stiff, president-elect of the mathematics teachers'
council, insisted that despite the protests of parents, the old
standards had not done any harm. Asked about what could be done
about ``the lost generation of students,'' Stiff snapped back:
``There was no such generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiff said he still subscribed to the philosophy that, ``If I
only teach it the way I understand, then only students who
understand it the way I do will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the old standards said that while encouraged by
the revisions, they feared they might be too subtle to radically
change the course set in 1989, especially given the huge investment
in textbooks, testing and teacher training to comply with the
earlier standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This document does throw a bone to the basic skills crowd,''
said Tom Loveless, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy
at the Brookings Institution. ``The overall tone is less strident.
But it doesn't underline and put in bold letters that it is
important for basic skills to be learned.''
</P>
<P>
   California was the first state to embrace the 1989 standards and
has been at the center of the parental backlash. A group of
California parents called Mathematically Correct has denounced the
standards as ``fuzzy math,'' saying that many teachers become so
preoccupied by exploration that children never learn the standard
rules they need to move on to higher-level algebra and calculus.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to such criticism, California has introduced highly
specific math standards for each grade, specifying, for instance,
that children in fifth-grade should be able to add, subtract,
multiply and divide with decimals, or be able to multiply and
divide fractions.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1999, 200 mathematicians, physicists and other
scholars wrote an open letter to Richard Riley, the secretary of
education, urging him to withdraw his department's endorsement of
10 mathematics programs found to be in compliance with the National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards of 1989.

ISRAELI HIGH COURT ORDERS RELEASE OF 8 LEBANESE PRISONERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Reversing itself, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that Israel is not justified in holding Lebanese detainees as
bargaining chips for missing Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered that 8 of 15 Lebanese detainees who have been
imprisoned without charges for more than a decade be released
immediately. In the closed-door hearing, the court said that the
eight men did not ``pose a danger to state security'' and that
``absent any other reason for their arrest,'' their long detention
was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The seven others, including two former high-ranking guerrilla
leaders, were not included in the petition because of technical
reasons; they were originally represented by a different lawyer.
But legal experts said the ruling was broad and should apply to
them, too _ unless the government could find another reason to
detain them.
</P>
<P>
   After the court ruled, the Israeli prison authorities said they
would release 13 of the detainees next week _ all the men in their
custody. The two others, the guerrilla leaders Mustafa al-Dirani
and Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, are being held in a secret location by
the army, and Justice Minister Yossi Beilin indicated Wednesday
that the government would try to retain them as security risks.
</P>
<P>
   International and local human rights groups, which have strongly
criticized Israel, saying the men were kept as hostages, received
the court's decision with relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad that it took so long and that for 15 years the
judicial system collaborated with the state on holding persons as
hostages,'' said Dan Yakir, an Israeli human rights lawyer. ``But
I'm very happy that the court came to the inevitable conclusion
that such practices are not legitimate in a democratic society that
is premised on the protection of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cautiously worded statement, Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who
is also the defense minister, expressed his opposition to the
prisoner release but said he would abide by the court's ruling. As
a general, Barak oversaw the mission to capture Dirani from Lebanon
in the early 1990s, and he still displays as a memento the gun that
was found under Dirani's pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Wednesday that he would have preferred to have kept
the men locked up ``for a certain period.'' He has pledged to
withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon by July, and to do so
in the context of a peace agreement or at least an ``arrangement''
with Syria or Lebanon or both. If there is an agreement or
arrangement, Israel will negotiate for the release of its missing
soldiers _ or their bodies _ and that would be a moment to use the
detainees as ``chips.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator who was captured in
1986 after parachuting out of his jet in Lebanon, deplored the
court's decision. ``I feel the same way I felt the day that Ron was
captured,'' Batya Arad said today. ``I see in this decision a
betrayal of Ron by the justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the sensitivity of the case, the court delayed
releasing the full text of its decision today so that it could be
reviewed for classified information. Instead, it issued a terse
one-paragraph summary of the 6-3 ruling by a nine-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   The summary said Israeli law on administrative detention, or
detention without trial, did not grant the Defense Ministry the
right to detain individuals who did not threaten state security.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Chief Judge Aharon Barak wrote a decision upholding such
detentions, saying the government had sufficient authority. But he
also wrote Wednesday's decision, in which he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the embargoed decision, Judge Barak, who is not related to
the prime minister, wrote that he had been plagued by the original
decision in the intervening years, according to an official who
read the full ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really touching,'' the official said. ``He writes that he
is aware that he ruled differently three years ago but that ever
since he couldn't stop thinking and rethinking about the mistake he
made and that judges shouldn't be afraid to admit mistakes and
change their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say they believe that the ruling is part of the
continuing normalization process, in which Israel is dropping
several discriminatory or coercive policies that it justified as
necessary to defend its security.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the detainees, Zvi Rish, described their reaction
as ``very thrilled and surprised.'' But they did not ``express it
vocally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight detainees have been imprisoned in Israel for 11 to 13
years. All were between the ages of 16 and 18 when they were
abducted from southern Lebanon in the late 1980s. They were
convicted in Israel for membership in Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed
Shiite Muslim group, and received sentences of one to three years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   When their sentences expired, they were placed under
administrative detention as bargaining chips.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other detainees were never charged or convicted.
Five others were freed in December. And last week, Israel released
Ghassan al-Dirani, a nephew of Mustafa al-Dirani, after a Tel Aviv
judge ordered him freed on compassionate grounds. Ghassan al-Dirani
is considered to be mentally ill as a result of the interrogation
he suffered in the captivity of pro-Israeli Lebanese militiamen
before he was secretly transferred to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, after he returned to his homeland, the Lebanese
authorities picked him up on what they said was an outstanding
warrant. He is once again being held in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli justice minister, Beilin, said the Supreme Court's
decision Wednesday was ``correct and important, ending the very
problematic detention of these prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week the court is expected to rule on a related case. Human
rights advocates have challenged the detention of Lebanese citizens
in the Khiam prison, which is run by the Israeli-backed South
Lebanese Army in the border zone.

FUJIMORI APPEARS TO FALL SHORT OF FIRST-ROUND VICTORY IN PERU
ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ President Alberto Fujimori on Wednesday fell just
short of reaching a first-round victory in his re-election bid,
meaning that a runoff will be held by early June, a surprise
development that elated the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The government announcement set off euphoria in the streets,
where news of a Fujimori victory was awaited. Such a victory would
probably have brought violence and made his administration an
international pariah and the source of constant instability, given
the criticism of the election's fairness at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   With 97.68 percent of the official vote counted, authorities
said on Wednesday night, Fujimori's total official vote count rose
a bit, to 49.84 percent, tantalizingly close to the needed 50
percent. But election officials said there were too few uncounted
votes outstanding and that Fujimori could only hope to add at most
five-hundredths of 1 percent to his result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democratic forces have triumphed!'' Alejandro Toledo,
Fujimori's leading opponent, shouted from a balcony overlooking
tens of thousands of supporters in the San Martin Plaza in downtown
Lima. Waving a flag and flashing a victory sign, he added, ``Our
people have won despite all the games and tricks. On to the second
round!''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials said on Wednesday night that Toledo won 40.31
percent of the vote, in the latest count. A candidate needed more
than 50 percent to win outright in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement of victory for Fujimori would have put Peru on a
collision course with the United States and the Organization of
American States, both of which said that quick counts after
Sunday's election indicated that neither candidate had won, and
that a second round would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When the results trickled in this week, and election monitors
raised many charges of improprieties, diplomats at the Organization
of American States already had begun discussing economic and
political sanctions to reverse the vote, and if necessary to strip
the government of its recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a business school professor, this week said he would
accept nothing short of a runoff and promised to lead nonstop
demonstrations culminating in a national strike on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori had no immediate comment on Wednesday night. Toledo
boasted that it was the two days of demonstrations that stopped
Fujimori from stealing the election, and that the mostly peaceful
marches across Peru had moved the international community to back
democracy here.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Portillo, the head of the national election commission,
dismissed that claim, telling the news media that reports of
computer and vote fraud were proved false by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can think what you like,'' Portillo said. ``It was
impossible to falsify or adulterate the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo repeated his demand on Wednesday night that all the
networks open their airwaves to the opposition, and that dirty
campaign tricks be halted.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics, like microphones that went dead at opposition
rallies, egg-throwing mobs meeting opposition candidates, and smear
campaigns orchestrated in the press, came under intense criticism
by the Organization of American States and the Atlanta-based Carter
Center and several international election observer teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we will show the world that Peru can hold a clean
process,'' Toledo told the throng in downtown Lima on Wednesday
night, one of many that gathered expectantly in cities across Peru.
``I want to be clear that I will be respectful of the institutions
of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   International pressure on Fujimori to hold a second round of
voting rather than declare an outright majority in the first round
mounted through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Pickering, the U.S. under secretary of state for
political affairs, telephoned Prime Minister Alberto Bustamante to
say that U.S. relations with Peru would be seriously strained if a
second round was not held.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversations have been stark but decent,'' a State
Department official said. ``There is no doubt in our minds they
know the way we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassadors of France, Britain and several other European
nations also said there was enough evidence of voter fraud _
including pre-marked ballots and a series of unexplained counting
delays _ to require a second round to ensure the credibility of the
next government.
</P>
<P>
   But senior Latin American diplomats here expressed concern that
the tough language by Pickering and other American officials might
be having a negative effect. Several Cabinet officials complained
openly of blatant interference in Peru's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States stand ``has triggered a very nationalistic
reaction,'' one Latin American diplomat said, adding, ``There is
very strong resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lima government appeared to be testing a nationalist
response to the international pressures when Fujimori's running
mate, Francisco Tudela, scolded foreign governments and media on
Tuesday night for conspiring to ignore the will of the Peruvian
people and push an election result to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had this kind of international intervention in our
political process before,'' Tudela said in a television interview,
which was repeatedly broadcast on a pro-government channel on
Wednesday. ``We are not a banana republic. We Peruvians need to
defend our national sovereignty.''

LEFT-HANDERS WEREN'T RIGHT SOLUTIONS FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rangers expect to have a strong bullpen, mainly
because they have two All-Stars in right-handers Jeff Zimmerman and
John Wetteland, and two other hard-throwing right-handers in Tim
Crabtree and Francisco Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handers, however, are expected to do their part, and
that didn't happen yesterday in the Rangers' 8-6 loss to the New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were 0-for-9 against Cordero, Crabtree and
Zimmerman. They were 5-for-5 off left-handers Mike Munoz and Mike
Venafro in their decisive three-run seventh inning rally. So much
for the theory the Yankees are vulnerable to left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a job to do,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``That's why we have those left-handers out there, to get
left-handed hitters out.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz took over in the seventh with the Rangers leading 6-5. He
was given the daunting task of retiring Paul O'Neill, Bernie
Williams and Tino Martinez. He couldn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bit rusty,'' said Munoz, who hadn't pitched in a game in
eight days. ``I didn't have a real good feel for what I was doing.
It's been awhile. I don't want to make excuses, but it's been
awhile since I've been out there.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, a left-handed hitter, started the rally by lining a
first-pitch breaking ball into right field for a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``We noticed he was hacking at first-pitch fastballs all day,''
Munoz said. ``So, we tried a first-pitch breaking ball and he still
swings at it. It's one of those situations, you throw a first-pitch
fastball and you may hear a lot of questions. So, you throw a
breaking ball first pitch, and he hacks at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz managed to jam Williams, a switch hitter who was 0-for-11
against left-handers coming into the game. But Williams fought it
off and blooped it into right-center for a single, moving O'Neill
to third. That brought up Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the kind of situation where you hope something will go
right at someone, a line drive or a fly ball, and get you out of
the inning,'' Munoz said. ``It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Martinez ripped a 2-0 pitch into right-center for a
two-run triple that gave the Yankees a 7-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Oates brought in Crabtree to face right-hander Shane Spencer and
switch hitter Jorge Posada, and he got both on weak ground balls,
keeping Martinez at third.
</P>
<P>
   But Oates then went with Venafro to face Ricky Ledee, a
left-handed hitter who normally sits when the opposing team starts
a left-hander. Ledee answered the challenge with a single up the
middle to drive home Martinez with the Yankees' final run.

SPEED LED COWBOYS TO PURSUE GALLOWAY OVER JOHNSON, JONES SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ So, you like the thought of receiver Joey
Galloway in a Cowboys uniform this season.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that the Cowboys traded two first-round picks to
Seattle for him and will be idle for the first 48 selections of
this weekend's NFL draft, you still like Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Well, how about Keyshawn Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever consider the possibility of Cowboys quarterback
Troy Aikman throwing Johnson the ball?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones did.
</P>
<P>
   And he traded for Galloway, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said yesterday that Johnson, the former New York Jets
receiver who was traded to Tampa Bay for two first-round draft
picks, was the subject of considerable discussion at the Cowboys'
Valley Ranch training complex the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And Jones said he knew Johnson might by available when he
acquired Galloway in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did know he might be available,'' Jones said. ``I had
visited with \Rformer Jets coach\S Bill Parcells about a trade last
year. It didn't go anywhere. But I had the sense that Keyshawn
might have been available \Rfor the Cowboys this year.\S But in our
opinion, we just liked what Joey brought to the table and how it
went with what we were trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the situations weren't exactly the same. The Cowboys
traded the 19th pick in Saturday's draft, along with next year's
first-round pick, to Seattle, while the Jets got two picks in
Saturday's first round (No. 13 and 27.)
</P>
<P>
   Also there were different deadlines. The Cowboys needed to act
fast with Galloway because several teams were bidding for his
services. Actually, the Cowboys' megabucks deal with Galloway
prompted Johnson to squawk about a holdout if he didn't get a new
contract, forcing the Jets to move him.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway's contract, which is worth $42 million over seven years
and included a $12 million signing bonus, set the market value for
Johnson, who got $56 million over eight years, including a $13
million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   To Jones, the decision was not about timing but about the skills
of the two players, both 28, and how they fit with Aikman's skills
and the Cowboys' new stretch-the-field offensive philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that the 6-foot-3 Johnson has seemingly been more
productive, catching 305 passes for 4,108 yards and 31 touchdowns
with two Pro Bowl appearances in four seasons. Galloway (5-11) has
caught 283 passes for 4,457 yards and 37 touchdowns and has been to
the Pro Bowl once in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys liked Galloway's blazing speed, which is the reason
he has more yards and more touchdowns, over Johnson's size and sure
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it,'' Jones said. ``It was debated long and
hard about which was better with Aikman's skills _ someone who
would go up and get the ball like Alvin Harper vs. laying under it.
We went the speed route. That was the difference. We made the
decision to go with the speed in Galloway.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his goal during the off-season was to build the
Cowboys into a Super Bowl contender. He said getting Galloway was a
step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will carry that same line of thinking into the draft,
despite having only five picks, none in the first and third rounds.
The Cowboys have one pick in the second, fourth, fifth, sixth and
seventh rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes there is enough quality in the draft that he will
be able to get a good player with his second-round pick. The
Cowboys' philosophy is to take the best available athlete, although
they plan to focus on linebackers and cornerbacks early.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones, who has made 25 draft-day trades since he bought
the team in 1989, also will listen to trade offers to move down to
acquire additional picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this long enough that you get some interesting
opportunities on draft day,'' Jones said. ``In the ideal situation,
we'd consider moving down and picking up another pick. It'd have to
be a high third pick. I could see scenarios where that could
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the quality depth in this draft puts the Cowboys in a
good situation. And if there are still good picks available when
it's their turn to pick in the second round, then more teams are
likely to call them for a trade. This gives them a choice of
drafting a good player or trading down to get an extra pick and
still get a good player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a year for us to not have a pick in the first
round,'' Jones said, ``this is the year.'' nn

TALLADEGA LOOMS AS ANOTHER NO-REPEAT CUP WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somehow, a NASCAR Winston Cup season that began with
back-to-back-to-back ``boring'' races has produced a series-record
eight different winners.
</P>
<P>
   Incongruous, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Only if you are Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte, Jeff Burton, Dale
Earnhardt, Ward Burton, Rusty Wallace, Dale Earnhardt Jr. or Mark
Martin. Only if you have been trying to become the first repeat Cup
race winner of 2000, a scenario that carries absolutely no
guarantee heading into NASCAR's longest and fastest racetrack this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The high-banked, 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway is a sister
track to the 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway. Since 1988,
Daytona and Talladega are the only tracks where NASCAR requires use
of a carburetor restrictor plate to keep speeds from routinely
topping 210 mph.
</P>
<P>
   While the plate has sucked approximately 300 horsepower out of
the equation, it hardly has reduced the level of competitiveness at
the Alabama racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Like Daytona, Talladega features a trioval down the
frontstretch, perfect for last-lap heroics heading toward the
checkered flag. Unlike Daytona, Talladega's turns are banked at 33
degrees, two degrees steeper than DIS.
</P>
<P>
   Talladega is an interstate-style four lanes wide track, easily a
full lane wider than Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Talladega's backstretch is nearly 4,000 feet long, and at times
freight trains of cars seem to occupy every inch of available
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, Talladega has been the site of seven of the 10 most
competitive races in Cup history. The 1984 Winston 500 produced 75
lead changes in 188 laps before it was won by Cale Yarborough.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the season-opening Daytona 500 was a study in
single-file racing, with only nine lead changes among seven drivers
before Jarrett emerged as the winner _ under caution. NASCAR
shouldered most of the blame for how its Super Bowl played out. The
sanctioning body's new uniform shock and spring package widely was
lambasted by drivers and crew chiefs struggling to find an
aerodynamic balance for their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``government issued'' shocks and springs were
mandated in the name of safety and reducing costs. But the aero
compromise was significant enough that NASCAR has allowed the teams
to use shocks of their choice at the front of their cars for
qualifying and race-day setups leading into Sunday's DieHard 500.
NASCAR-issued shocks and springs, however, again will be in place
at the rear of all cars.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the diameter of the four holes in all NASCAR-issued
carburetor restrictor plates has been reduced by a thirty-second of
an inch, to seven-eighths of an inch, to further control speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Total effect of the revised rules remains open to debate,
beginning with Martin, a two-time winner at Talladega who never has
hidden his dislike for plate racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the Daytona 500 was boring this year, and I'm sure
the only reason they say that is because there were no big
wrecks,'' said Martin, driver of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus.
``The fans want the cars in a wad, therefore NASCAR wants the cars
in a wad, and they weren't in a wad at Daytona, so they're gonna do
something to get 'em in a wad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the fans will enjoy what they see Sunday. I'm sure of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more diplomatically, Mike Skinner said he left a recent
test concerned about how good the racing would be on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put every shock we ran for the last four years on the
front of the car,'' said Skinner, driver of the No. 31 Lowe's
Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``And without putting the rear shock package
to go with it, it was basically useless. And you've got a smaller
restrictor plate, which is basically going to bunch the cars up
even more, if that's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, who finished fifth and sixth at Talladega as a
rookie last year, said the revised package should make the cars
more comfortable in 195 mph rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given some stability back to the cars,'' said Stewart,
driver of the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac Grand Prix. ``But there's
only about four guys who have figured it \Rplate racing\S out and
really know how to do it right. Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Dale
Jarrett and Bobby Labonte.''
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, only Gordon, a three-time series champion, has
yet to win a Cup race in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into NASCAR's longest and fastest racetrack, that's
incongruous, isn't it?

   ``But I got ticked off with the way the European racing system
works,'' said Brack, a native of Sweden. A 10-time winner in 37
road/street starts in developmental formulas, Brack is finding the
hoopla surrounding his debut in CART's Toyota Grand Prix of Long
Beach this weekend a bit overdone.
</P>
<P>
   Because he really does know how to turn right.
</P>
<P>
   Brack's road-racing resume includes series titles in the Renault
Clio Scandinavian Championship (1992) and Barber Saab Pro Series
(1993), as well as third- and second-place finishes in Formula 3000
in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Brack's last road-racing start was
in a FIA F3000 race in Hockenheim, Germany, on Oct. 13, 1996. Brack
was leading the race when he was disqualified for rough driving.
</P>
<P>
   His last road-race pole and victory were scored at Silverstone,
England, on Aug. 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In his last 11 Formula 3000 races, Brack won four times, not
including that controversial DQ in Germany. In three years of
Formula 3000, Brack posted five poles, 11 top-three and 14-top five
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Formula 3000, that's a step below Formula One,'' said Brack,
34. ``Well, you would think you'd earned yourself a position in
Formula One with a good team, right? But what happened was I got a
test drive in a junk team \RArrows\S and drove that car a few
times. And I just couldn't see myself going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that, if I wanted to race, I had to bring like $10
million. Well, OK, fine, you can have your Formula One. I'm out of
here. I want to race to win. I couldn't see \Rfor\S myself a bright
future in Formula One. I don't have that kind of money. Secondly,
even if I had it, I wouldn't put it in a junk Formula One team,
because they rip you off.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, then I took the decision to go to America and look for an
Indy-car ride. I eventually ended up in the IRL, but it could have
been CART.''
</P>
<P>
   During his three-year stint in the all-oval IRL, Brack won the
1998 series championship and 1999 Indy 500 for Indy-racing legend
and team-owner A.J. Foyt of Houston. Brack joined Team Rahal at the
end of last season, fully intent on rediscovering the joys of road
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 82-lapper through downtown Long Beach will be the 17th
edition of America's most successful street race. Ironically, the
LBGP began life as a Formula One race, before pricing itself out of
the market after 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about Long Beach,'' said Brack, driver of the
No. 8 Shell Reynard/Ford-Cosworth. ``I watched the race in person
in 1996. It's a spectacular event, one I always wanted to drive.
Now I'll get the chance.''

to make its European debut in 2001 in either England or Germany.
Craig told The Associated Press a European race probably would be

   The English site is the 1.5-mile Rockingham Motor Speedway in

putting on a European race would cost about $6 million _ about the
same as an American venue.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the 2001 CART schedule will remain at 20 races, with
one U.S. event almost surely to be dropped. Reports have suggested
that Gateway International Raceway outside St. Louis would be the

FORMER TCU COACH TOHILL DIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When former TCU football coach Billy Tohill died in a
Birmingham, Ala., hospital late Tuesday, the scene was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fought hard,'' his wife, Bobbie, said. ``He really didn't
want to give up ... but it was time. His body finally just shut
down on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tohill, 61, will be buried at 11 a.m. tomorrow at Jefferson
Memorial Gardens in Hoover, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew him during his coaching career at TCU (1971-73)
and afterward remembered him yesterday as a ``man's man'' who never
quit on a friend _ or a foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be the toughest guy I ever knew,'' said former TCU
athletic director Frank Windegger, recalling that 27 years ago,
Tohill ``walked away from death.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the spring of 1973 when a badly mangled Tohill was
pulled from the wreckage of his car on the South Freeway in Fort
Worth after he lost control, flipped ``over'' a cement truck, and
landed on the access road. One leg was eventually amputated below
the knee, but Tohill survived, vowing to return and coach the
Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one believed it at the time, but by the time we started
two-a-days, he was back, with a prosthetic leg,'' said Gerry
Boudreaux, one of Tohill's assistants at the time. ``It was truly
amazing, but that was Billy. He was a man's man and very blunt and
outspoken. There were people he rubbed the wrong way, but you
always knew where you stood with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a tremendous will. And anytime you had to go to battle,
you wanted Billy on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   Tohill arrived in '71 as an assistant on the staff of new head
coach Jim Pittman, and suddenly became the head coach when Pittman
died of a heart attack on the sideline at Baylor at midseason. When
TCU finished 6-4-1, the two were named co-coaches of the year in
the Southwest Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an eventful era, and a lot of guys left because it was
a tough regime,'' former safety Harold Muckleroy said. ''We lost
about 40 players, including the group \Rof five black players\S who
left because of a racial controversy. It was a sad thing, because
those guys didn't do anything wrong; they just objected to the rule
\Rno facial hair\S. They considered it a cultural thing and coach
Pittman considered it a matter of obeying the rules regardless of
whether or not you agreed with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy was like that, too. He certainly wasn't politically
correct, and you couldn't say that everyone liked him. But those
who stayed, loved him. When he came back after that accident, he
refused to use the cart they provided for him, because he wanted to
walk the field. You could see blood oozing out of that wound, but
he kept walking. To me, Billy Tohill was a king.''
</P>
<P>
   After 5-6 and 3-8 seasons in '72 and '73, Tohill was replaced by
Jim Shofner. He moved to Birmingham to coach the local World
Football League entry, then coached at two high schools and as an
assistant at Alabama-Birmingham before going into private business
with a string of fast food restaurants. He had been in poor health
in recent years, partly from hepatitis contracted from blood
transfusions after his accident, in addition to various other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He suffered a lot,'' Bobbie said. ``He fought a lot of
battles, and he won some and lost some. But he had a full life ...
and he lived it right up to the end.'' nn

JOHNSON GETS HIS RAISE AND A NEW TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one of the most stunning trades in Jets history,
Keyshawn Johnson left New York Wednesday when he signed an
eight-year, $56 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In
exchange, the Jets will receive Tampa Bay's two top picks, giving
New York four first-round selections.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-voluble Johnson left in his wake the suggestion that he
would still be a Jet if Bill Parcells were still in charge, and
that the two sides came achingly close to negotiating a new deal in
1998 that would have avoided the standoff that prompted the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what could have prevented me from getting
traded,'' Johnson said Wednesday in a conference call from his
Tampa, Fla., hotel. ``I'm sitting here happy as pie but shocked. No
man is invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Bill stepped aside, and Bill Belichick took over, I felt
confident they would still be able to do something,'' said Johnson,
who will receive a $13 million signing bonus, an enormous raise
from the $2 million he would have earned with the Jets next season.
``Once the second Bill left, it was left to the newcomers and it
didn't come together because Parcells wasn't as involved as you
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who said he reveled in the love-hate relationship Jets
fans had with him, added: ``I wanted to stay in New York as bad as
anybody ever. Bill Parcells tried to address the issue. The new
people came in and they wanted to go in another direction. He had
to play with the team. There were disagreements with him over the
situation. He had to let people do their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson revealed Wednesday for the first time that a year and a
half ago, Parcells approached Johnson about reworking his original
deal, which did not include any voidable years. Steve Gutman, the
Jets' president who negotiated that original contract, had been
especially proud that Johnson had received no voidable years, but
had there been, Johnson might never have been traded.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and Johnson's agent, Jerome Stanley, worked out a deal
during the 1998 season that would have cut the remaining years off
his original six-year contract if Johnson gave back about $2
million of his original $6 million signing bonus. Then, the team
put together a long-term deal that would have kept Johnson in New
York for the rest of his career. But the NFL Management Council,
the league's labor relations arm that must review all contracts to
make sure they comply with the salary cap, rejected the unusual
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said it was because of concerns over how the new deal
would affect the Jets' salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1999 off-season, Johnson said, Parcells asked him if
he would play for him in 1999 without a new deal and told Johnson
he would make sure his contract situation would be addressed after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stanley, Johnson told him he did not have to have a
new contract right now and that all they wanted was to communicate
with the Jets about when the contract might be addressed. No
contract demands were ever given, Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no `We need this money today,''' Stanley said.
Johnson added that he had not made up his mind to hold out of this
summer's training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also claimed that communication with the club was
very limited: he never met the new owner, Robert Wood Johnson IV,
and the last time he spoke to Al Groh was three weeks ago when Groh
released his statement saying the team would neither trade the
receiver nor renegotiate his contract.
</P>
<P>
   And Keyshawn Johnson knew that he would likely be traded when,
at the owners' meetings two weeks ago, Groh compared the receiver
asking for a new contract to a child asking for an increase in his
allowance, a remark that infuriated Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Would Johnson still be a Jet if Parcells were in charge? Johnson
said he spoke to Parcells when the team gave Stanley permission to
begin negotiating with Tampa Bay late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have a contract of some sort with the Jets,''
Johnson replied. ``If you want to take a percentage, Al had more of
a percentage in this than Bill Parcells and the rest of the staff.
He didn't want to do it. I'm not saying Al Groh is a villain.
Parcells tried to get something done before. When you're the boss,
you try and let people make decisions. He's the boss, somewhat.
He's helping more than pulling the triggers. He's not the final
decision maker in the thing. Al Groh makes the personnel decisions.
Parcells is going to step aside in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he would have probably taken less money than he got
from Tampa Bay to remain with the Jets. The Jets declined to
comment on the receiver's analysis of the events leading to the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a savior,'' he said at the news conference. ``I'm not
a hired gun. I'm going to help them try to reach all of their
goals. I'm a win now person. That's the first thing I think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   When the trade became official, the Jets released a statement
and did not make Groh or Parcells available to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made this trade with Tampa Bay fully aware that
Keyshawn has been a wonderful player for the Jets and that it will
be a challenge to replace him,'' Groh said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with Johnson talking about how much he would enjoy
living near the water in Florida and spending more time with his
children, the Jets were already exploring the options those trade
picks have brought and their own two first-round picks. They talked
to many teams in the league about the possibility of moving up and
down on draft day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Keyshawn Johnson said, the Jets' fortunes rest not in his
hands, but on what the Jets do with those four picks. Johnson will
get to see firsthand what the Jets get for him. The Jets play at
Tampa Bay Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It,'' the receiver said, ``is circled on my calendar.''

IT'S ABOUT TIME: PALFFY GETS PLAYOFF CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Pain? Real pain? For Ziggy Palffy, it is not the
sprained right shoulder that has sidelined him the past month.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the thought of Detroit strongman Darren McCarty
crashing him into the boards tonight in Game 1 of the Kings
first-round playoff matchup with the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going home every April when everyone I knew was still
playing,'' Palffy said Wednesday at Joe Louis Arena. ``It was the
feeling that no matter how well you played it was never good
enough. Nobody cares how many goals you score, just how many
playoff games you've won.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects the Kings to win many against the mighty Red
Wings, but it clearly has been a breakout season for Palffy and his
new team.
</P>
<P>
   During his first four full seasons in the NHL, Palffy scored
more than 40 goals three times for the New York Islanders. But the
once-proud Islanders never even got close to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd see him in the summers and he always seemed down about
that,'' said teammate Jozef Stumpel, a fellow Slovak and a friend
since grade school. ``A guy that good is going to get his chance
one day, but it took a long time for him. Now he has his chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity nearly was derailed in mid-March when he took a
vicious hit by the Mighty Ducks' Vitaly Vishnevski and missed 12
games. For a player who had been sidelined just three games before
this season, it was a reality check.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy also spent much of the season battling lower-back
soreness. The Kings' first line of Palffy, Stumpel and Luc
Robitaille each missed extended playing time due to injuries and
played only 50 games together.
</P>
<P>
   But the time in the trainers' room may have strengthened more
than his back and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he surprised some people,'' trainer Pete Demers said.
``He took this very seriously. He did what had to be done. He is an
elite athlete, but that can make it tougher to dedicate yourself to
the other things. He was outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy finished with 27 goals and 66 points despite missing 18
games. But he also impressed the hard-to-please Murray with his
playmaking and defensive ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed that from him almost more than we needed the
scoring,'' Murray said. ``We needed him to play within our system
for us to be successful. All he had to do before was score, which
is hard enough. But sometimes it can be even harder to get an
offensive player to play the total game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although those were the fringe benefits this season, Palffy was
brought here to score.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, out of the playoffs five of the previous six years,
were looking to upgrade their offense when they moved into the new
Staples Center in October. Palffy was their man, coming over last
summer with Bryan Smolinski for Olli Jokinen and prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy also brought some baggage.
</P>
<P>
   As the only true scorer on a poor team, he had a reputation for
being quirky and a little selfish. Winning and qualifying for the
playoffs has tapered those edges.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few days, he has been standing up in the
players-only meetings,'' Murray said. ``He has things to say and he
wants people to know just how important this is for the
organization. He is saying never take this for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, 28, said he never expects to become a team leader. He
carried the offensive load with the Islanders and that was enough.
Here, there is captain Rob Blake and other veterans.
</P>
<P>
   But he also learned a lot about expectation playing in New York.
The Nassau Coliseum was not Madison Square Garden, but he saw how
fans and media could turn quickly on players.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I scored I knew I was going to be OK,'' Palffy
said. ``If they saw it slip that might have changed, but I was the
go-to guy. The only time I saw a little trouble was with my
contract (last season). But I think people understand that that
wasn't about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy held out for half a season before receiving a five-year,
$26 million contract. But the Islanders were losing a bundle and
played before sparse crowds. They had to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him carry a great weight on the Island,'' Smolinski
said. ``Not only was it a struggling team, he was the only player
people could look to. Here he is surrounded by better players and
it has made him more well-rounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the challenge is the Red Wings. Earlier this season, Palffy
was flattened by McCarty along the boards and stayed down for
almost a minute. The Kings did not retaliate, but won 3-2. That
game, played Feb. 18 at Joe Louis Arena, was considered a turning
point in the team's maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a marked man and he knows it,'' said teammate Bob Corkum,
who often defends the other team's best player. ``We'll be trying
to move Sergei Fedorov off the puck the same way. Sometimes you hit
them, some times you miss. Those are special players.'' &QL;

SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATORS REACH COMPROMISE ON CONFEDERATE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   By DAVID FIRESTONE  (EDS: This story has been added to the New York
Times front page) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a breakthrough that seems likely to end a lengthy
and racially charged debate, the South Carolina Senate voted
Wednesday to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Capitol
dome and place a smaller version in a less prominent site on the
statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours earlier, the state House of Representatives
passed a bill making South Carolina the last state in the union to
enact a holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The King
Day bill passed with no real debate in the House on an 82-35 vote.
Because the Senate had already passed a similar bill, the measure
is now almost certain to be enacted after differences on wording
are worked out and Gov. Jim Hodges signs it.
</P>
<P>
   The flag issue has been much more divisive and has convulsed the
state's political culture for years, as black and white residents
argued over whether the Confederate battle flag is a symbol of
slavery and oppression, or of a noble Southern heritage. But the
compromise proposal passed Wednesday on an overwhelming 36-7 vote,
reflecting months of pressure from business and political leaders,
and an economic boycott of the state by the NAACP. Many
legislators, both black and white, who swore just weeks ago that
they would never approve this compromise changed their minds
Wednesday, saying they were acting in the best interests of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires one last technical vote by the Senate on
Thursday and will then go to the House in a week or two. David
Wilkins, the House speaker and a supporter of the flag, has
introduced a similar measure there, and many senators said they
were confident this compromise would pass in the lower chamber.
Although the measure could still unravel, the support for the
compromise by hard-line senators on both sides of the issue seemed
likely to smooth its eventual passage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, which leaders of both sides acknowledged
they found distasteful, the rectangular Confederate battle flag
would be removed from the dome and from the two legislative
chambers. A square version of the flag, which was used by the Army
of Northern Virginia in the Civil War, would fly on a 20-foot pole
next to the 30-foot monument honoring the Confederate dead that
stands in front of the capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The flag would stand between the monument and the Capitol.
Although it would be more prominent to those walking in front of
the statehouse, it would no longer fly in a position of
sovereignty, visible through much of the capital city. Reflecting a
concern that other Confederate monuments might also come under
attack, the measure also requires that no Confederate or
African-American history monuments on public property throughout
the state be removed or altered, and no public area named for any
historical figure can be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise proposal has been opposed by the NAACP, but in
the debate over the bill Wednesday, most of the black legislative
leaders who have been fighting the flag said they reluctantly
decided it was an acceptable way to end the divisiveness. It may
not spell an immediate end to the boycott, but supporters said they
hoped the NAACP would eventually come around once they saw the
measure was supported by the black legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I love the NAACP, I love South Carolina even
more,'' said Sen. Darrell Jackson, a black Democrat from Columbia
who has led the anti-flag forces. ``I'm doing what's best for the
state of South Carolina. Because 25 years from now, my sons will be
rearing their families in this great state. And maybe they will
look back and say, thank God for the men and women who had courage
to do right thing, although it wasn't a popular thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the white leader of the flag supporters, Sen. Glenn
F. McConnell of Charleston, said that while he loved seeing the
flag atop the statehouse dome, he had come to the conclusion that
moving it was the best thing for the future of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're acting because we all know the reality of where we
are,'' said McConnell, whose vote on this matter carries enormous
weight among the flag supporters. ``Like General Lee when he was
confronted with Appomattox and said, `There's nothing left for me
to do than get terms from General Grant.' It is very difficult,
extremely difficult for us on our side to vote to move that flag.
And it has been equally difficult for our brethren on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag first ascended the dome in 1962 during the centennial
observances of the Civil War, and several speakers during
Wednesday's debate noted that Wednesday is the 139th anniversary of
the day the war began in the waters off Charleston. The presence of
the flag, which stayed up in the 1960s as a gesture of defiance to
the Civil Rights movement, had engendered a passionate and often
bitter dispute over the origins of the war, exposing the vast
differences in the perception of history between blacks and many
whites.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually the pressure to move the flag extended well
beyond the black community. Almost every business group and
religious organization in the state urged that it come down, both
on economic and moral grounds. Mayor Joseph P. Riley of Charleston
recently led a widely publicized 120-mile protest march from the
seacoast to Columbia. Scores of sports and cultural events, along
with many conventions, canceled their plans to come to South
Carolina because of the boycott.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The seven senators who voted against the plan were all white,
and several bitterly accused their colleagues of selling out.
Senator Harvey S. Peeler Jr., a Republican from Gaffney, warned
that race relations in the state would worsen if the flag comes
down.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John E. Courson, a white Columbia Republican who keeps
the Confederate battle flag in his office near a bust of Gen.
Robert E. Lee, said the soldiers monument was the best place to
honor the flag, allowing the state to finally proceed with a less
divisive future.

   RUSSIA: CAPITALIST ADVICE
</P>
<P>
   An independent-minded pro-capitalist economist will serve as
adviser to President-elect Vladimir Putin, Putin's spokesman said.
Putin has yet to outline a detailed economic program. But his
selection of Andrei Illarionov, 38, is a sign he will follow a
program of free-market reforms. Illarionov has criticized Russian
dependence on the International Monetary Fund.

   BRITAIN: PUTIN TO MEET QUEEN
</P>
<P>
   Russia's president-elect, Vladimir Putin, will meet Queen
Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle during his trip to Britain next
week, Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said. Blair's spokesman,
Alastair Campbell, said the prime minister and Putin would discuss
the Russian economy, the Chechnya conflict, the Balkans and
cooperation in fighting crime and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: U.S. TO SKIP EXPO
</P>
<P>
   The United States will not take part in Expo 2000, opening in
Hanover on June 1. A statement issued in Berlin by the United
States commissioner for Expo, William Rollnick, said he had been
unable to raise sufficient funds from the private sector. The mayor
of Hanover, Herbert Schmalstieg, said ``nobody will miss the United
States.'' More than 190 other countries will take part.
</P>
<P>
   SWITZERLAND: KOSOVARS EXPELLED
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland has expelled the first group of Kosovo Albanians who
sought refuge during the fighting in Kosovo last year. The 60
people flown to Pristina are the first of up to 30,000 Kosovars who
officials plan to return forcibly by the end of this year. A
full-scale effort is set to begin in June, when financial
incentives being offered for returning voluntarily expire.

   ASIA
</P>
<P>
   CHINA: U.S. TALKS SET
</P>
<P>
   China said it would resume talks with the United States on
limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, ending a suspension that
followed the bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade. The policy
reversal follows China's rejection of a formal American explanation
that the bombing was accidental. Resumption of the talks leaves
human rights as the only area in which Beijing has so far refused
to resume talks with Washington since the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN: GOVERNOR REPLIES
</P>
<P>
   Facing growing criticism, Gov. Shintaro Ishihara of Tokyo said
he was not referring to Korean residents of Japan when he used a
derogatory term commonly used to disparage Koreans and other
foreigners at the end of World War II. While he expressed regret
that Koreans were offended, Ishihara said he still considers
foreigners who enter or stay in Japan illegally ``very
troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN: SHARIF APPEALS
</P>
<P>
   The ousted prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, convicted last week of
hijacking and given a life sentence, has appealed the verdict. A
two-judge panel will hear arguments in the case, though no date has
been set. Sharif's six co-defendants, all of whom were acquitted,
remain locked up, each under investigation on corruption charges.

   ISRAEL: SETTLERS EXPANDING

   For the second day in a row, Jewish settlers in the West Bank
started an expansion project without government approval to protest
a government freeze on approving new construction. They began
bulldozing near Efrat on Tuesday and continued near Har Hilo, where
they said they plan to build 230 homes. The police acted when a
Peace Now protest threatened to lead to a confrontation.

   Dissident students closed seven departments or schools at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico in what they announced as
a 24-hour strike. An attempt to re-open talks with the dissidents
failed Tuesday after only one session. The students, who led a
nine-month strike that ended Feb. 6, are demanding the release of
about 30 protesters still in jail after the strike.

<P>
   BRAZIL: POLICE VERDICT VOIDED
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court in the Amazonian state of Para has overturned
the acquittal of three commanders of a police detachment that
killed 19 unarmed peasants four years ago. The original verdict in
last August's trial set off outrage in Brazil because of reports of
bribed jurors and what rights groups called procedural
irregularities. A retrial was ordered, after which the 147 men the
officers led are also expected to be judged on the same charges.

RENO MEETS WITH ELIAN'S MIAMI RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Taking a dramatic step to end the custody standoff over
Elian Gonzalez, US Attorney General Janet Reno traveled to Miami
Wednesday night to meet with the great uncle who has refused to
hand the boy over to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision to intervene personally came after a reunion
between father and son was canceled, apparently after Elian
expressed reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's planning to work out a resolution, trying to meet with
the parties concerned to seek a cooperative settlement,'' Justice
Department spokesman Myron Marlin announced in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While Elian's father waited in Washington, Reno and her small
entourage met with the relatives at the Miami Beach home of Sister
Jeanne O'Laughlin, the Barry University president who earlier
hosted a reunion between Elian and his grandmothers. It was not
known whether Reno would meet with the 6-year-old boy who has
sparked an international tug of war.
</P>
<P>
   One change was clear: the Miami clan headed by great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez seemed for the first time to accept that Elian and
his father would return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family is becoming more reconciled and facing what
perhaps could be pain . . .,'' said O'Laughlin, who was initially
neutral in the dispute but now wants to see Elian remain in Miami.
``It is my hope and prayer that as the child becomes acquainted _
reacquainted _ with his father there will be peace in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   A transfer of custody was tentatively set for Thursday morning
at the Opa-locka airport outside Miami, where security was being
tightened. But in a battle that twists and turns daily, it was
uncertain whether Elian would actually be leaving, whether his
father would be arriving, or whether any resolution would be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   With demonstrators vowing to form a human chain to protect him,
federal officials want to avoid having to use force to remove Elian
from his great-uncle's house in Little Havana. Lazaro Gonzalez's
earlier announcement that Elian was not headed to Washington met
with cheers.
</P>
<P>
   As about 100 demonstrators gathered outside the Miami Beach
mansion, a stark contrast to the modest home where Elian has been
staying since he was found floating at sea Thanksgiving Day, the
much-anticipated meeting began around suppertime. Joining Reno were
Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner and a
few other federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez and his daughter Marisleysis, who left the
hospital where she is once again being treated for stress-related
ailments, represented the family that has been fighting for custody
of Elian. They are appealing a federal court ruling that upheld
Reno's right to return Elian to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
and to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gregory B. Craig, the attorney representing the
father, demanded anew that the Justice Department order the
relatives to bring or send Elian to his father, who arrived in the
United States last week. ``Every day of delay does enormous damage
to Elian,'' Craig said. ``It is time for the Justice Department to
instruct Lazaro Gonzalez to follow the law and do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, had announced Tuesday night that the reunion would take
place Wednesday. But that event fell through, and Wednesday Santos
stressed that it was never intended as a handover of Elian.
Instead, he said, it was meant to provide a forum for the family to
decide the boy's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez proposed O'Laughlin's house as a neutral site
for a meeting between the Miami relatives and Elian's father, who
chose to remain in Washington and meet with officials at the Cuba
Interest Section Wednesday night. The Cuban government, however, no
longer considers her neutral, since she has made clear her
preferences about where Elian should live.
</P>
<P>
   Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez called Reno's trip to Miami,
her hometown, a ``good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Miami, where she served as state's attorney for 15
years, Reno also planned to meet with exile community leaders but
did not plan to deliver the government letter outlining the
specifics of the custody transfer. That letter had not been
delivered by Wednesday afternoon, although even Elian's most ardent
Miami supporters are starting to accept the inevitability of his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I expect to see and all that Americans demand to see . . .
is that whatever happens happens the American way,'' said Miami
Mayor Joseph Carollo, who, like many of the Cubans in the
800,000-strong exile community in Miami, opposes returning Elian to
Cuba until the federal court case is settled, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials expressed frustration at Wednesday's events and
that the boy has not been returned to his father a week after Juan
Miguel Gonzalez arrived in Washington from Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time the (US) government do what it is legally obligated
to, return the boy to his father,'' Ricardo Alarcon, president of
Cuba's National Assembly, said on national television Wednesday
night. ``What has happened shows the moral bankruptcy of the
kidnappers in Miami who are doing everything they can to delay
this, and that they're desperately running out of options.''

U.S OUTLINES PLAN TO SETTLE CLAIMS OF BOMB WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., N.M., Wash.)  By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flanked by members of Congress and a woman whose
father is dying of a disease he contracted assembling atom bombs,
the energy secretary on Wednesday announced a plan to compensate
3,000 nuclear weapons workers for sickness or death caused by
exposure to radiation or chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary, Bill Richardson, said that under the plan, which
requires congressional approval before it can begin, the Department
would evaluate claims filed by families of workers or the workers
themselves and decide the compensation on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects that many of the cases would be filed by
families on behalf of workers who were already dead, in some cases
dead for many years. Half, he estimated, would be for workers with
cancer, a quarter for workers with lung problems caused by
beryllium, a toxic metal that in the '50s and '60s was used almost
exclusively in nuclear weapons manufacture, and the remainder for
workers sickened by asbestos or suffering from assorted other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates for workers contended that the Energy Department
was a poor choice of agencies to advocate for workers, after
decades of poor safety and health processes and denial of problems.
Within the Energy Department, said Robert Alvarez, a former
official there and expert on nuclear weapons manufacturing,
compared the choice to putting tobacco companies in charge of
compensation to smokers.
</P>
<P>
   About 600,000 people have worked to produce nuclear weapons
since late 1943, when the Manhattan Project, the World War 2 effort
to build an atom bomb, began. The number of claims anticipated by
the department is one half of one percent of that number, although
others suspect there will be far more.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were almost all employees of contractors, not the
federal government itself. For years the contractors, on orders
from the Energy Department at the Atomic Energy Commission that
preceded it, routinely fought all claims of injury; as a result,
officials say now, many of those who died early or lived for years
with devastating illnesses never bothered to file claims.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the compensation program would cost about $400
million _ an average of about $67,000 per case.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday officials stressed that the new policy, which has been
in the works for about a year, was a historic and compassionate
shift, after five decades of denying that anyone had received
enough exposure to be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remembered the important lesson, that statistics are people
with the tears washed off,'' said Dr. David Michaels, the assistant
secretary for environmental safety and health.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress gives its approval, the Energy Department would
weigh claims by considering a worker's years of employment and the
maximum exposure to radiation or dangerous chemicals that was
possible in that job. It would then apply a formula to o determine
the payment. Depending on the amount, a worker or survivors would
receive a lump-sum payment or reimbursement of all medical costs
and partial compensation for lost wages.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does not go along, then the Department will simply
change its policy on workmen's compensation claims brought against
it, telling its contractors to drop opposition in cases that met
its new, relaxed criteria, and not asserting the statute of
limitations as a defense. That approach could still provide
compensation but probably at a lower amount, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the eight representatives and three senators who joined
Richardson, all with active or defunct weapons plants in their
districts or states, pledged to try for quick action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a proud generation,'' said Sen. Patty Murray of
Washington, ``They had a right to be proud, but they also have a
right to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep.Tom Udall, a Democrat, whose district includes the Los
Alamos National Laboratory, Wednesday introduced a bill that would
pay all medical expenses or a $200,000 lump sum, double the
administration's proposal. He said that the package proposed by
Richardson was just a starting point.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims and their relatives expressed gratitude for the
government's action.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Dietz, of Brooklyn, N.Y., a psychotherapist whose
father, Frederick, died of leukemia in 1969, at 57 years old, after
working as a research chemist at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, said, ``It's a relief to me, it's substantiating a
reality that we always had a little bit of a hunch about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very nice to have someone say, yes, there was a reason
for his death that really is related to what he was doing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vikki Hatfield, of Kingston, Tenn., appearing Wednesday with
Richardson, said her father Leon Meade, a machinist, had done
weapons work from 1949 until his retirement in 1985, and had later
developed diseases from beryllium and asbestos he was exposed to on
the job. Now 69, his weight has dropped from 190 pounds at
retirement to 120 now. ``He's six feet tall so you can imagine
there's not much there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The family has spent $400,000 on medical care, selling acreage
from the farm where they formerly kept dairy and beef cattle; there
is no longer anyone able to do that work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get this disease on the farm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield said her mother could not leave her father even
briefly. ``He doesn't want to be alone; he's afraid of dying and he
doesn't want to do it by himself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give him back what he's lost, you can't stop the
pain he's going through,'' she said. ``But we have to move forward
and we have to do the right thing.''

Mariah Carey seemed adrift during her live performance at Madison

the mix made it sound like a backing track. (Michelle V. Agins/The

After World War II, R. Buckminster Fuller founded a company to

Blackberry 957 is roughly the size and shape of a Palm device but
is closer in spirit to the original Blackberry pager, the 950, than

Wednesday they have implanted a miniature pump inside the heart of
a patient, the first device of its kind to be used on a human in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by batteries, the Jarvik 2000, about the size of a wine
cork, fits directly into the heart's left ventricle and the tiny
turbine pushes oxygenated blood throughout the body when the heart
is no longer able to pump properly.
</P>
<P>
   The historic operation brings scientists a giant step closer to
a goal they have pursued for decades: a permanent alternative to
the heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major advance. We're all looking forward to it,'' said
Dr. Patrick McCarthy of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, commenting on
the landmark procedure. McCarthy is director of the heart
transplant and artificial heart pump programs at the renowned heart
research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope (it) will be better tolerated than larger
pumps,'' added McCarthy, who hopes to test the device.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Heart Institute doctors declined requests for interviews
about the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The Jarvik 2000 was developed by Dr. Robert Jarvik, the pump's
New York-based inventor, and Dr. O.H. Frazier, chief of
cardiopulmonary transplantation at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview, Jarvik said this device puts inventors
close to achieving a ``forgettable heart,'' an artificial pump that
allows people to resume normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Heart Institute said the device has been implanted as
a ``bridge to transplant,'' meaning a way to buy time for a dying
patient until a donor heart is available. One of the pump's
developers said a second device will be tested in Oxford, England,
as a permanent booster to keep a heart going for the rest of a
patient's life.
</P>
<P>
   A similar device pioneered by Dr. Michael DeBakey of Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston has been implanted as a bridge to
transplant in 28 people in Europe. DeBakey said nine of the
patients have been successfully transplanted with donor hearts and
are ``leading a good life. In general, the results are quite
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Both pumps are descended from a category of pumps called left
ventricular assist devices, or LVADS. But the Jarvik and DeBakey
devices are the tiniest yet, completely internal except for a
single wire that extends outside the body. Risk of infection is
minimal, and the pumps will fit into women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Jarvik 2000, DeBakey's device is a miniature axial flow
pump, but it is inserted into the aorta. DeBakey expects to begin
testing his device, which he calls an ``auxiliary aorta,'' in the
United States this year after receiving approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very enthusiastic about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Heart Institute received permission from the FDA to
implant the Jarvik 2000 in a limited number of patients, the
institute said. Houston is the only site of the pilot study.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands could benefit from the technology. About
40,000 people have end-stage congestive heart failure, meaning
their hearts have gradually degenerated into weak, flabby organs
that do not pump strongly enough. The ideal therapy is a
transplant, but the number of donor hearts has leveled off at 2,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, patients whose diseased hearts get a chance to
``rest'' while on the artificial pumps may actually recover much of
their natural heart function, and have the pump removed. In this
case, the mini-pump will function as a ``bridge to recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping the chronically ill, the devices could
save people who suffer sudden damage through a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey said many patients implanted with his device have been
able to rise from their hospital beds and resume some normal
activity. He said he recently had dinner in a restaurant with two
of his implant patients in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvik's name is associated with an earlier artificial heart,
the Jarvik-7, which was first implanted in a Utah patient named
Barney Clark 1982. Four others would get the Jarvik in the next two
years but only one lived beyond a year. It is still in use as a
bridge to transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Heart Institute said the Jarvik 2000 has been 10 years
in the making. Early research on the pump was supported by funds
Frazier set aside from money he was paid to remove hearts from
donors.

SEEKING RESOLUTION, RENO MEETS WITH ELIAN'S MIAMI RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs to add 7 grafs at end)  
(See also CUBAN-BOY-RENO) 
 By RICK BRAGG and LIZETTE ALVAREZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno arrived in
Miami on Wednesday evening and met face to face with Elian
Gonzalez's relatives here to try to persuade them to hand him over
peacefully, hoping that she might bring an end to a volatile
custody fight that has smoldered since November.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, the country's highest law enforcement official, met with
the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other family members at
a neutral site _ the , gated Miami Beach home of Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, president of Berry University.The Roman Catholic nun
opened her home to a January meeting between the 6-year-old boy and
his grandmothers from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ``is planning to work out a resolution,'' said Myron
Marlin, a spokesman for Reno, in a meeting with reporters in
Washington, D.C., Wednesday afternoon. ``She realizes it is a tall
order, but believes she may be the one who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be a true last-ditch attempt at winning
cooperation from the family, which has resisted previous appeals
from Justice Department officials to work out a peaceful plan for
handing over the boy. Doris Meissner, the U.S. immigration and
naturalization services commissioner, accompanied Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was expected to offer to use her plane to fly Elian's Miami
relatives to meet with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in
Washington and arrange an eventual reunion.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno and Gonzalez family members met behind closed doors,
Justice Department officials held off delivering a letter to the
family that would have required them to hand the boy over to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Wednesday night that if there
was no progress in the talks between Reno and the family, she was
prepared to hand the family that letter Wednesday night. Before the
talks, officials had said the letter demanded the handover of the
boy as early as Thursday morning. .
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear, as they talked, if the child's reunion with
his father would take place soon, perhaps later this week, or if it
the meeting would turn out to be just one more delay.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to have Elian and his Miami relatives travel to
Washington to meet with the boy's father Wednesday morning fell
through late Tuesday night when the boy said that he did not want
to go, said Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel Gonzalez came to the United States expecting to be
given custody of his son,'' said Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for
Elian's father. ``He has been here for seven days and Elian is
still in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The custody standoff has grown more tense almost from the minute
Elian stepped on dry land. He was found floating on Thanksgiving
Day in an inner tube in the Atlantic after his mother and 10 others
drowned in a failed crossing from Cuba. The boy's Miami relatives
and much of the Cuban exile population in South Florida have
refused to send him back to a communist dictatorship that his
mother died to escape. But the boy's father has insisted on his
son's return and many people, especially outside Miami, agree that
he has the right to speak for his child.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez requested that he, his wife, Angela, their
daughter Marisleysis and Elian leave their house in Miami's Little
Havana on Wednesday _ and the throngs of demonstrators and dozens
of reporters and camera crews _ for the less stressful atmosphere
of O'Laughlin's waterfront home on Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sensed a need to have some space,'' said O'Laughlin,
later adding that Elian seemed much at ease there. Elian and his
Miami relatives apparently planned to stay the night, if not
longer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the family seemed resigned to handing over Elian,
she said: ``I think the family is becoming more reconciled and
facing what, perhaps, could be pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said Elian's relatives were not talking about handing
over the boy Thursday, and would wait to hear what Reno had to say.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the family was joined at the nun's house by two of their
lawyers. As of late evening, Reno had not spoken with reporters
about what was said in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If family members expected to be free of the demonstrators who
have gathered outside their home for months, they were
disappointed. '
</P>
<P>
   Police stood in front of demonstrators as Reno arrived and
police cars lined the streets and surrounding areas. Two police
boats patrolled a canal behind the house.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, the crowd swelled to about 400 and became
more agitated. Demonstrators chanted a rhyme in Spanish, ``Reno,
you coward! Miami is on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, the demonstrators had been just steps away,
but on the beach, demonstrators were much farther from the house.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the demonstration, Ramon Saul Sanchez, staged a
sit-in on one of the main causeways linking the beach to the
mainland when rafters from Cuba were sprayed with a water cannon by
the U.S. Coast Guard last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez said only that ``the plan is that we pray. We pray
that the family can come together and work it out among themselves.
That would be the best thing for for them, for the boy, and the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she hoped the change of scenery would help, no
matter when and how the boy's transfer would come about.
</P>
<P>
   The government-appointed psychiatrists and psychologists who
spoke to Lazaro Gonzalez about the best way to hand the boy over
said that Elian has the love of two families, but their
disagreements are hurting the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family in Miami needs to solve this in a positive and
constructive way,'' said Jerry Wiener, emeritus professor in
residence at psychiatry and pediatrics at George Washington
University School of Medicine. ``They are blaming the kid for
something they just don't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiener said the meeting between the boy's father and the Miami
relatives, which was canceled late Tuesday, had offered promise,
``but it was very discouraging the meeting was called off.''
</P>
<P>
   That meeting, arranged by Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., was
not intended as a handover of the boy but as a chance for both
sides to meet and try to come to a compromise, in the boy's best
interest, said Jorge Mas Santos, who heads the Cuban American
National Foundation in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But at midnight, Lazaro Gonzalez said Elian had told him he did
not want to go, and that the meeting was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way you deal with a 6-year-old,'' Wiener said.

DESPITE INJURY, SMOLINSKI WILL PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Not only will Bryan Smolinski play tonight, just 11
days after suffering an apparent season-ending knee injury, he will
be a major player in the Kings' offensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, diagnosed with a partially torn medial collateral
ligament in his right knee, skated with the team for the second
consecutive day and will play in his usual spots on the power-play
and penalty-killing units when the Kings meet the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing,'' said Smolinski, who is wearing a
heavybrace on the knee. ``Something definitely happened down there,
but it never seemed quite as bad as it sounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski knew he was hurt when Phoenix's Travis Green rolled
over on his right leg with just 16 seconds remaining in a 2-1 loss
April 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't a pop, it was more of a tweak,'' he said. ``The
next day the swelling wasn't so bad and I had good range of motion.
It wasn't like I couldn't sleep at night. They said I'd be out six
weeks, but I had a good feeling I could come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski's return adds depth to an offense that on paper does
not match up well with Detroit. It allows enforcer Ian Laperriere
to return to the third line where he is better suited. Smolinski
also has 40 games of playoff experience from his days in Boston and
Pittsburgh. Laperriere has 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told him we weren't going to use him unless he could
give us what he did before,'' coach Andy Murray said of Smolinski,
who was tied for fourth on the club with 56 points. ``If he
couldn't do that, we didn't want him. His situation has really
improved in a short amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S THAT SPELL? Murray had only one word on the blackboard
Wednesday: Composure. Winger Bob Corkum said lack of composure
undid his Phoenix Coyotes two years ago after they defeated Detroit
in the first game of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just beside ourselves,'' he said. ``After we won
thatgame we said, `Hey, we're going to beat these guys.' Hockey is
a game of not getting too high or too low. Yet they were in the
dressing room acting like it was over. That did more to hurt us
than anything they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit went on to win the series in six games and took their
second consecutive Stanley Cup title. Corkum confirmed his status
as one of the game's toughest players by finishing the series after
breaking his foot in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum was struck on the foot by a Nicklas Lidstrom slap shot
but continued to play after receiving pain-relief injections.
</P>
<P>
   FISET IN: Stephane Fiset is the Kings' starting goaltender for
the series based on his strong finish (5-0-1 in his last six games)
and his record (2-0-1) against the Red Wings this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tremendous confidence in both our goaltenders, but
Steph has really stepped up,'' Luc Robitaille said. ``The team
really has rallied around him.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that way two years ago when Fiset dropped the first
two games in round one against St. Louis. Kings coach Larry
Robinson pulled Fiset in favor of Jamie Storr, but the club was
swept in four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was two years ago, I don't even want to think about
that,'' Fiset said. ``We have a much different team and the
attitude is great. We're not ruling anything out just because we
are playing the Red Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   MODRY IN, BERG OUT: Defenseman Jaroslav Modry wanted to make it
tough on the Kings to keep him out of the lineup. He scored two
goals in the final week that helped cement their playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Modry, who appeared in just 25 games, will play tonight in
place of Aki Berg. Modry faced Detroit three times this year and
the Kings were 2-0-1. The knock on him was he played
inconsistently, but the added playing time down the stretch seemed
to eliminate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see Aki in this series,'' Murray said. ``But Modry has
earned his shot. He plays very well against the Red Wings.'' &QL;

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ State Senate leaders say they will pass a bill
early next week that will make New York the first state to require
that tobacco companies modify cigarettes to lower the risk of
smokers accidentally setting fires.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the assembly on Monday. Passage by the Senate
would put the bill's fate in the hands of Gov. George Pataki. The
governor's spokesman, Michael McKeon, would say only that the
governor would ``take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But several legislators and anti-smoking advocates predicted
that he would sign it, if for no other reason than not to be seen
as the Capitol's only defender of tobacco industry interests.
</P>
<P>
   If it becomes law, the bill will represent a major, long-sought
victory for anti-smoking advocates and some firefighters' groups,
who contend that it will prevent hundreds of fires set by careless
smokers each year. They also argue that it will jump-start the
issue in Congress, where it has languished for years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would strike yet another blow to a besieged tobacco
industry, which has lost its aura of invincibility in the last few
years, agreeing to pay the states $246 billion to compensate for
tobacco-related health care costs, seeing several states raise
tobacco taxes, and fending off a growing rash of lawsuits from
smokers, some of them successful.
</P>
<P>
   The New York bill would require that a cigarette go out rather
than keep burning when no one puffs on it for a mandated period of
time; that period of time has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The change would cut down on sales, anti-smoking advocates and
sponsors of the bill said, because a smoker who walks away from a
lighted cigarette for a few minutes would come back and, rather
than finding only ashes, would find a stub that could be lighted
again.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies began test-marketing less flammable cigarettes
in the 1980s. They have taken several approaches, including
changing the chemical composition or the thickness of the paper.
Several brands are on the market now, including Merit, Virginia
Slims, More and Eve Lights.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say they are not yet convinced that those products
meet their customers' standards for taste, though anti-tobacco
lobbyists maintain that smokers do not notice a difference. The
changes do not affect the cost of making the cigarettes, industry
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision has been made that we will pass the bill early
next week,'' said state Sen. Frank Padavan, a Republican from
Queens who has sponsored the measure for four years. ``There is
widespread support for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Padavan said he smokes More cigarettes, made by R.J. Reynolds,
and has not noticed a difference in taste since they were altered
to stop burning.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, confirmed
that a vote would be held on Monday or Tuesday. Given that the bill
is likely to have unanimous support among the 25 Senate Democrats
and has been sponsored by 15 of the 36 Republicans, its passage is
assured.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for the Philip Morris Cos., the
world's largest cigarette maker, said the industry's opposition was
not motivated by a fear of lower sales, but rather the desire for a
single national standard for flammability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this should be addressed at the federal level,'' he
said. ``We're going to continue to fight this.''
</P>
<P>
   The requirement that all cigarettes sold in New York meet a fire
safety standard would go into effect on Nov. 1, 2001. The bill
provides for heavy fines for failure to comply.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides that if the federal government establishes a
national standard, the New York law will automatically be voided.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes are the leading cause of fatal fires in New York,
resulting in 48 fire deaths statewide in 1997, the most recent year
for which figures are available, according to the state Office of
Fire Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
   Congress began considering fire safety standards for cigarettes
in the 1980s, but the idea met with fierce opposition from tobacco
companies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Each year he has introduced the bill, Padavan has won a few more
Republican co-sponsors. But not until this week did Bruno indicate
that he was willing to permit a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Legislature was deeply embarrassed by revelations
that a lobbyist for Philip Morris had paid for expensive meals and
other gifts for more than 100 legislators _ often apparently in
violation of the state's ethics law _ and then had failed to report
the spending, as required. Eager not to be seen as under the
influence of an increasingly unpopular industry, lawmakers in
December approved new lobbying restrictions and an increase of 55
cents per pack in the cigarette tax, to $1.11, the highest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But Padavan maintained that a more prosaic factor had changed
the minds of his colleagues on the fire safety bill. He said they
no longer feared that the industry would be unable to comply.

JETS CONSIDERING MORE DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also see FBN-JETS-TRADE) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No team in the National Football League has ever been in the
position in which the New York Jets currently find themselves:
owners of four first- round picks in the college draft, which takes
place this weekend. Oh, so many choices; oh, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   After trading the star wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson to Tampa
Bay for the Buccaneers' two first-round selections, the Jets now
hold four No. 1 picks: 13, 16, 18 and 27. The Jets have the power
to completely manipulate the direction of the draft and amazingly,
are working the telephones to discuss making more trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's the Jets' world,'' said one general manager on
a division rival team, ``and that makes me a little nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is making everyone nervous. Now the question is this: What
will the Jets do with all of that draft-day firepower? The answer
is, not even the Jets know, or at least right now they do not know.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the Jets have contacted at least a
half-dozen teams _ maybe more _ in the past 48 hours about a
possible trade, according to one of the teams the Jets have spoken
with. The man doing most of the dialing is Bill Parcells, who is
clearly directing the Jets' draft, probably his last before he
rides off into the television analyst sunset.
</P>
<P>
   The main theory making the rounds now _ and these theories
change hourly _ is that the Jets are considering moving up between
Baltimore's fifth spot and Pittsburgh's eighth spot to draft
Michigan State's Plaxico Burress, a 6-foot-5{-inch, 229-pound
player with grace and size. He reminds the Jets of another player _
guess who? _ Keyshawn Johnson. The Jets are also looking at the
defensive linemen Corey Simon of Florida State and Shaun Ellis from
Tennessee. They may also covet Bubba Franks, the Miami tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells spoke to the Ravens on Tuesday and asked if they would
be interested in a possible trade, and the Ravens said they would
be, depending on their own circumstances. In addition to the fifth
pick, Baltimore also has the 10th pick in the first round. The two
teams may talk later this week or on draft day.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has spoken to other teams with selections in the top 10
of the first round, including Philadelphia, Arizona and Pittsburgh,
team executives said. Parcells has also called Cincinnati to
inquire about the disgruntled Pro Bowl wide receiver Carl Pickens,
who wants to leave the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not work out a trade with Baltimore or another team
with a top-five pick, there is the possibility that the Jets might
use a combination of their second and third-round picks to entice,
say, Tennessee to give up the 30th pick in the first round. Thus,
league executives say, do not be surprised if the Jets end up with
five first-round selections by the time the draft gets under way on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells may be taking the approach of the former Dallas Cowboys
Coach Jimmy Johnson, who was constantly stockpiling picks. Johnson
was like a magician, turning one first-rounder into two.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are telling teams they have ruled out packaging the
picks and moving up to the No. 1 overall spot, which Cleveland
owns. But the Jets once said they were not going to trade Johnson,
either.
</P>
<P>
   When a team has four No. 1 picks, it can almost say, or do,
anything it wants. &QL;

<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno arrived in
Miami on Wednesday evening and met face to face with Elian
Gonzalez's relatives here to try to persuade them to hand him over
peacefully, hoping that she might bring an end to a volatile
custody fight that has smoldered since November.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, the country's highest law enforcement official, met with
the boy's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and other family members at a
neutral site _ the gated Miami Beach home of Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, president of Berry University. The Roman Catholic nun
opened her home to a January meeting between the 6-year-old boy and
his grandmothers from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ``is planning to work out a resolution,'' said Myron
Marlin, a spokesman for Reno, in a meeting with reporters in
Washington on Wednesday afternoon. ``She realizes it is a tall
order, but believes she may be the one who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno left after a meeting of two and a half hours. It was not
immediately clear if she had met with the boy, or whether an
agreement to surrender him had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Her effort appeared to be a true last-ditch attempt at winning
cooperation from the family, which has resisted previous appeals
from Justice Department officials to work out a peaceful plan for
handing over the boy. Doris Meissner, commissioner of the U.S.
immigration and naturalization service, accompanied Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was expected to offer to use her plane to fly Elian's Miami
relatives to meet with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in
Washington and arrange an eventual reunion.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno and Gonzalez family members met behind closed doors,
Justice Department officials held off delivering a letter to the
family that would have required them to hand the boy over to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Wednesday night that if there
was no progress in the talks between Reno and the family, she was
prepared to hand the family that letter Wednesday night. Before the
talks, officials had said the letter demanded the handover of the
boy as early as Thursday morning. .
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear, as they talked, if the child's reunion with
his father would take place soon, perhaps later this week, or if it
the meeting would turn out to be just one more delay.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to have Elian and his Miami relatives travel to
Washington to meet with the boy's father Wednesday morning fell
through late Tuesday night when the boy said that he did not want
to go, said Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel Gonzalez came to the United States expecting to be
given custody of his son,'' said Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for
Elian's father. ``He has been here for seven days and Elian is
still in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The custody standoff has grown more tense almost from the minute
Elian stepped on dry land. He was found floating on Thanksgiving
Day in an inner tube in the Atlantic after his mother and 10 others
drowned in a failed crossing from Cuba. The boy's Miami relatives
and much of the Cuban exile population in South Florida have
refused to send him back to a communist dictatorship that his
mother died to escape. But the boy's father has insisted on his
son's return and many people, especially outside Miami, agree that
he has the right to speak for his child.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez requested that he, his wife, Angela, their
daughter Marisleysis and Elian leave their house in Miami's Little
Havana on Wednesday _ and the throngs of demonstrators and dozens
of reporters and camera crews _ for the less stressful atmosphere
of O'Laughlin's waterfront home on Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sensed a need to have some space,'' said O'Laughlin,
later adding that Elian seemed much at ease there. Elian and his
Miami relatives apparently planned to stay the night, if not
longer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the family seemed resigned to handing over Elian,
she said: ``I think the family is becoming more reconciled and
facing what, perhaps, could be pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said Elian's relatives were not talking about handing
over the boy Thursday, and would wait to hear what Reno had to say.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the family was joined at the nun's house by two of their
lawyers. As of late evening, Reno had not spoken with reporters
about what was said in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If family members expected to be free of the demonstrators who
have gathered outside their home for months, they were
disappointed. '
</P>
<P>
   Police stood in front of demonstrators as Reno arrived and
police cars lined the streets and surrounding areas. Two police
boats patrolled a canal behind the house.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, the crowd swelled to about 400 and became
more agitated. Demonstrators chanted a rhyme in Spanish, ``Reno,
you coward! Miami is on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, the demonstrators had been just steps away,
but on the beach, demonstrators were much farther from the house.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the demonstration, Ramon Saul Sanchez, staged a
sit-in on one of the main causeways linking the beach to the
mainland when rafters from Cuba were sprayed with a water cannon by
the U.S. Coast Guard last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez said only that ``the plan is that we pray. We pray
that the family can come together and work it out among themselves.
That would be the best thing for them, for the boy, and the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she hoped the change of scenery would help, no
matter when and how the boy's transfer would come about.
</P>
<P>
   The government-appointed psychiatrists and psychologists who
spoke to Lazaro Gonzalez about the best way to hand the boy over
said that Elian has the love of two families, but their
disagreements are hurting the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family in Miami needs to solve this in a positive and
constructive way,'' said Jerry Wiener, emeritus professor in
residence at psychiatry and pediatrics at George Washington
University School of Medicine. ``They are blaming the kid for
something they just don't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiener said the meeting between the boy's father and the Miami
relatives, which was canceled late Tuesday, had offered promise,
``but it was very discouraging the meeting was called off.''
</P>
<P>
   That meeting, arranged by Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., was
not intended as a handover of the boy but as a chance for both
sides to meet and try to come to a compromise, in the boy's best
interest, said Jorge Mas Santos, who heads the Cuban American
National Foundation in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But at midnight, Lazaro Gonzalez said Elian had told him he did
not want to go, and that the meeting was cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way you deal with a 6-year-old,'' Wiener said.

BIG CHINESE WEB PORTAL ABOUT TO ISSUE STOCK IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 1st graf to change `Thursday' to `later this week'; subs 3rd

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The first of China's leading Internet companies is set
to go public in the United States later this week _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering, from Sina.com, is the first of what
are expected to be many such Nasdaq listings in the months ahead.
But investors who buy the stock will not actually own a stake in
China's most popular Internet portal. Instead, they will own a
piece of the Sina.com's offshore Web sites _ a fraction of its core
business.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be buying a stake in the company's marginal Hong
Kong, Taiwan and North American portals. Sina.com, incorporated in
the Cayman Islands, holds various licensing agreements with a
Chinese company that owns the Chinese portal.
</P>
<P>
   People in China's Internet industry are closely watching the
offering, somewhat aghast that American investors may be willing to
accept a company gutted of content. Sina.com's performance will
determine whether other Chinese Internet companies take the plunge
or choose to wait until China's ever-shifting regulations change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it will fly,'' a Chinese Internet entrepreneur
said Wednesday at an industry party in Beijing called ``The Bubble
Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com, founded by a 32-year-old Beijing University graduate,
became the hottest Web site in China last year after it posted
reports of the NATO bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, within minutes of the official press.
</P>
<P>
   And it provided more information than any other mainland source,
relying heavily on foreign news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main Chinese portal is linked to nine different
``channels,'' Web sites that offer everything from news to online
shopping for cellular phones, flowers, even food. The company's
free and fast e-mail accounts and timely news updates have made it
the most popular portal in China for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the IPO, however, will own none of that, thanks to
regulations intended to allow Chinese Internet companies to raise
capital on overseas stock markets while adhering to China's
longstanding ban on foreign investment in the telecommunications
and media industries. Those rules are supposed to change when China
joins the World Trade Organization. And the country has welcomed
private foreign investment in the Internet. Venture capitalists
estimate that as much as $1 billion has flowed into Chinese
Internet start-ups in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   But the country remains fearful of allowing ownership of its new
e-businesses slip overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com quickly grew from a handful of people to more than 500
Wednesday in Zhongguancun, Beijing's answer to Silicon Valley.
Investment bankers were soon offering the company bundles of cash,
and it subsequently raised nearly $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's boldness won it fans, but not among China's
conservative officials, who made it clear that Sina.com would not
be given approval to list abroad unless the company toed Beijing's
line. To win regulators' favor, the company dropped news from all
sources other than the state-run press and removed links on its
site that led users to foreign media sites.

   CSECTION-RATES (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ After years of criticism
that the C-section rate in the U.S. should come down, the rate is
going up again, and some prominent obstetricians are beginning to
say that may not be such a bad thing. Some say the emphasis on
lowering the rate has caused complications to mothers and babies;
some are even suggesting women should be offered the option of a
C-section before they go into labor. Needless to say, federal
officials who still want the C-section rate lower are skeptical,

SOTHEBY'S DENIES CONSPIRING WITH RIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sotheby's has denied conspiring with its rival
auction house Christie's to fix commissions for buyers and sellers
and has asked a federal judge to dismiss civil suits filed against
them.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to suits filed in the Federal District Court in
Manhattan, lawyers for Sotheby's denied each of the allegations
contained in the civil complaint against the two auction giants.
</P>
<P>
   The response, filed on Wednesday, was the first formal denial
issued by the auction house since Christie's disclosed in late
January that it had turned over information to the Justice
Department, which is investigating a possible antitrust conspiracy
between it and Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for its cooperation in the department's 3-year-old
inquiry, Christie's received a promise of leniency. The criminal
inquiry is continuing, and people close to the investigation have
said that Sotheby's was under pressure from prosecutors to reach a
plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Horowitz, a spokeswoman for Christie's, said on Wednesday
that the company had not filed its response to the civil suits but
would do so soon.
</P>
<P>
   The potential damages to both houses from the civil suits are
enormous. Litigants in antitrust cases can win triple damages, and
the tab could run into the tens of millions of dollars if the
plaintiffs are successful, antitrust lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The first civil suit was filed in federal court in Manhattan two
days after Christie's disclosed its agreement with the Justice
Department. Since then, at least 55 other actions have been filed
and consolidated in a single complaint that contends the two houses
defrauded buyers and sellers through a secret price-fixing scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The suits have been consolidated before federal Judge Lewis A.
Kaplan of the Southern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The suits contend that, beginning as early as 1992, executives
of the two houses met secretly to fix the commissions charged to
buyers and sellers. They also contend that the executives agreed to
stagger and coordinate auction dates to avoid competing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suits, the conspiracy robbed sellers and buyers
of the ability to negotiate better commissions.
</P>
<P>
   In its response, Sotheby's denied all allegations of wrongdoing
in specific and dry legal language. It did say, however, that
unidentified employees had coordinated sale dates with their
counterparts at Christie's. But Sotheby's said the coordination was
designed to allow prospective buyers to attend sales at both
houses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the civil suits, Sotheby's faces separate suits
from shareholders. On Feb. 21, its chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, and
its chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, both resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's was bought by the French investor Francois Pinault in
1998, and is privately held.

ADVERTISING: NEW RESEARCH METHODS SEEK TO LEARN WHAT YOU REALLY
THINK 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An executive at Media Direct Partners in New York
noticed the problem in a focus group of several dozen balding men.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which was developing direct response advertising for
a surgical hair replacement company, heard nearly all the men in
the focus group say they were not bothered by hair loss _ yet many
were wearing hats during interviews that took place indoors on a
warm day in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the people in the focus groups weren't
necessarily saying what they felt or thought,'' said David
Reinbach, Media Direct's new business manager. ``They were saying
what they thought we wanted to hear or what they wanted us to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   It is probably the worst-kept secret in the advertising research
business. Much of the research measuring advertising effectiveness
relies on verbal responses to questions about what consumers think
and feel. But what people actually think and feel is not
necessarily what they tell researchers, for reasons that could
include anything from not wanting to appear critical to perhaps not
being fully conscious of their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an estimated $87.5 billion was spent on advertising,
but no one can say with absolute certainty what actually works.
Advertisers typically use long-established tools like focus groups
and quantitative surveys to judge advertising _ and about $120
million is spent in advertising research _but the process is at
best an inexact social science.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem is that advertisers cannot read the consumer's
mind _ yet. But they are working on it. In the last several years,
new research methods have been developed that could make it easier
to gauge that ultimate wild card _ the emotions. Several of the
tools, like brain-wave tracking or measurement of the skin's
reaction, rely on physiology to get at what consumers really want _
whether they know it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Such research is valuable to advertisers because _ as in a lie
detector test _ reactions typically cannot be consciously
controlled by the respondent. Companies want to know how consumers
feel so they can create advertising and products that resonate with
the public and better predict their success.
</P>
<P>
   Research to measure emotional response has existed for decades.
What is new is that computers, video and other technologies have
made the research less expensive to conduct and less invasive for
the consumers who participate in the tests, typically for a nominal
fee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the methods at this point are hardly in the mainstream,
and there is skepticism. One problem with physiological measurement
is that it is hard to interpret what the results mean, said Jim
Spaeth, president of the Advertising Research Foundation in New
York. The body or brain can signal arousal at a certain point in a
commercial, but it may not be clear whether the response is
positive or negative. Does the heightened interest mean the person
likes what he sees or is irritated by it?
</P>
<P>
   Inner Response, a consumer research firm in Charlotte, N.C., is
marketing a new tool called MindView that tracks basal skin
response to a television commercial or other stimuli. The
measurement is taken by tiny sensors placed on the upper palm of
one hand, which are wired to equipment that tracks the skin's
subtle reactions, 10 times a second.
</P>
<P>
   What MindView is tracking is the automatic responses that the
skin has to stimuli. Jack Shimell, president of Inner Response,
compared it to the way muscles automatically tense in reaction to
potential danger. Such a response can be seen in cats when they
unconsciously arch their backs in fear, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're a trained spy or something, you're not able to
control it,'' Shimell said. ``It's revealing what you're
unconsciously feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The MindView data is combined with data from other sources to
come up with a ``viewer involvement profile,'' he said. Inner
Response has been working with skin conductance measures for 11
years, for clients that have included Miller Brewing, McDonald's
and Coca-Cola. Company But last year it perfected the MindView
system, which Shimell said was cheaper, easier and achieved results
faster. Ten years ago, a test would have required renting studio
time and costly equipment at a price tag of about $100,000, or
about 10 times today's price, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Capita Research Group has created a system based on
electroencephalogram brain-wave measurements that NASA uses to
gauge the alertness of commercial airline pilots. The consumers
being tested wear headsets while watching commercials. Their
engagement levels, or attention levels, are picked up five times a
second and graphed like an EEG, then overlaid on the television
commercial for the client's use.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called engagement index graphically shows the ebb and
flow of attention, but it does not answer why engagement levels
vary. The index is usually used as a diagnostic tool in conjunction
with other data, said David B. Hunter, Capita's founder and
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can measure eyeballs watching, but that doesn't tell you
if it's sinking in,'' said Hunter, who sold his direct response
agency to invest in Capita, which he took public. ``And that's what
our system addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Another measure to determine what consumers feel uses pictures
instead of words. Marketed by AdSAM Emotional Response Modeling,
this system was developed over six years by Dr. Jon Morris, a
professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said his system does not rely on physiological response.
It asks consumers to check off pictures representing their feelings
after watching a commercial. For instance, the pleasure scale shows
emotions ranging from smiling to frowning.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of using visual cues is that it measures emotion
without the biases of language. It is also cross-cultural, which is
increasingly important for companies trying to reach a broad
market, he said. And like the other methods, the research has
applications far beyond measuring advertising impact. AdSAM was
used recently to determine whether consumers wanted a cosmetics
counter to become self-service, Dr. Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising industry, though intrigued, has yet to embrace
new ways, critics say. Robert F. Lederer, publisher of Research
Business Report, an industry newsletter, said one reason might be
because the research industry is a bit stodgy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market researchers are a very conservative lot and can be
difficult to adapt and accept new ways of doing things,'' Lederer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, advertising agencies have long investigated the idea of
measuring emotion, Spaeth said. Several major agencies already have
their own techniques to measure emotions. And researchers have
tried many other ways to get at consumers' feelings, from
psychological testing to hypnosis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem with using physiological data is determining
what it all means, he said. ``It could all be tremendously
valuable,'' he said, ``if we could really understand how to use
those measures.''

BILL TO ALLOW INDIAN CASINO MAY BE WEIGHED IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Republican leader of the State Senate said
Wednesday that he might take up a measure that would allow an
Indian casino to be opened in the Catskills, potentially moving the
state closer to approving the contentious plan.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader,
come nearly a week after the U.S. Department of the Interior
granted the St. Regis Mohawk tribe permission to open a $500
million casino in the Catskills, provided that the state also
approves the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, a strong proponent of casino gambling, has
maintained that he has the authority to approve such a plan on
behalf of the state. But he has also proposed a bill seeking
approval from the Legislature to open a casino in resort areas like
the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's comments are significant because he has been extremely
reluctant to consider such gambling measures in the past, given the
intense opposition that such proposals face from antigambling
groups like the Roman Catholic Church and the state's Conservative
Party.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, Bruno had been adamantly opposed to the
governor's bill for constitutional reasons. He took exception to a
provision in the bill that would permit slot machines in Indian
casinos, saying that the State Constitution forbids slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday afternoon, Bruno reiterated his
opposition to the provision in the governor's bill that would allow
slot machines on Indian reservations. But he said he would consider
taking up the measure as long as that provision was removed. ``I'm
looking at it because we may take some action,'' Bruno said, adding
that ``the biggest question we have is the constitutionality'' of
allowing slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department's decision last week helped clear the
way for the Mohawks to operate eventually a $500 million casino in
the Catskill community of Monticello, where government officials
and business leaders have hoped that gambling might bolster the
economy of a fading resort area that was once commonly known as the
borscht belt.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the Mohawks to operate the casino on a
30-acre parcel that was put in trust for the tribe, whose
reservation is on the Canadian border. The casino, which would be
only 90 miles from New York City, is expected to employ 3,000
people and draw 9 million visitors a year. In 1997, a measure that
would have legalized casino gambling statewide was defeated in the
Senate amid intense opposition from antigambling groups. The
Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, has repeatedly
said he favored opening casinos in the Catskills and other resort
areas, and he has pushed legislation through his chamber that would
permit casino gambling in the state.

CHINESE WARN HONG KONG MEDIA ON COVERAGE OF TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 7th graf to Wang quote) 
By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A senior Chinese official warned the news media here
Wednesday not to spread or advocate separatist ideas in coverage of
Taiwan's political transition.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Wang Fengchao, the deputy director of the Chinese
government's liaison office in Hong Kong, said journalists should
be selective in how they report news about Taiwan. Wang's remarks
came after a Hong Kong television station broadcast an interview
with Taiwan's vice president-elect, Annette Lu, in which she said
Taiwan should be only a ``remote relative and close neighbor'' of
China.
</P>
<P>
   China interpreted Lu's remarks as a sign that she favors
independence, and the Chinese media unleashed a stream of invective
at her. An editorial in Wednesday's People's Daily said Lu had
``evil intentions to alienate the relations between people across
the Taiwan Strait.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang is the first mainland Chinese official based in Hong Kong
to call on the local media to curb themselves since this former
British colony reverted to Chinese rule in July 1997. And his
remarks alarmed journalists and pro-democracy politicians here.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's news media have reported both sides of the Taiwan
story. Newspapers and television stations widely covered the recent
election, while pro-Beijing papers here often telegraph changes in
the Chinese government's policy toward Taiwan. But Wang's comments,
made at a seminar organized by a pro-China media association here,
indicate that China would prefer a one-way street.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said the Hong Kong news media should not report different
voices on the issue of Taiwan's independence, but should make
choices based on the interests of the Chinese nation. He said the
local government should police the media by enacting a law that
outlaws subversion and sedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong's media has the re- sponsibility to uphold the
integrity and sovereignty of the country,'' Wang said. ``This has
nothing to do with press freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is very serious,'' Margaret Ng, a pro-democracy
legislator, said of Wang's comments. ``It is not only his
admonition to the press, which is bad enough, but he also wants a
new law, which presumably would be more restrictive. This is not
good for one country, two systems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One country, two systems'' is the agreement between Britain
and China under which Hong Kong is to retain its own legal system
and a free press for 50 years after the handover. China often
promotes it as a model for Taiwan's eventual reunification with the
mainland, though officials in Taiwan, including the
president-elect, Chen Shui-bian, say it is not suited to their
circumstances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government, which is careful not to pick fights with
China, issued a statement Wednesday evening saying it supports the
principle of a single China. But Anson Chan, the acting chief
executive, reminded Beijing that freedom of the press is guaranteed
under the territory's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that the Hong Kong media is free to comment and
report on all matters of current interest,'' said Chan, who is
sitting in for Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive. Tung is in San
Francisco, finishing a trip to the United States that included a
visit with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that China has been annoyed by
coverage of Taiwan in the Hong Kong news media. Last year China's
deputy prime minister, Qian Qichen, publicly rebuked Radio
Television Hong Kong for giving airtime to a senior Taiwanese
official who sought to explain President Lee Teng-hui's policy of
``state to state'' relations between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Qian's complaints, the long-time director of
Radio Television Hong Kong was reassigned to a job in Hong Kong's
trade and economic office in Japan.

KANSAS EDUCATION BOARD EXPLAINS SCIENCE STANDARDS DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, Kan. _ A year after they first appeared before the Kansas
Board of Education, the state's new science standards were back
Wednesday, at least in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   One board member asked to start a dialogue on the standards in
Kansas newspapers and to sponsor ``informative debates'' to explain
the board's intent when it passed them.
</P>
<P>
   That motion failed. But the board did approve 6-3 a cover letter
for the standards, which will go out soon to the state's 304 school
districts. The letter will explain the board's efforts to
``strengthen'' the standards and clarify what students in Kansas
schools should learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the calls and e-mails I've received, the public
doesn't understand what the board did,'' John Bacon, a conservative
board member from Olathe, said in proposing the public relations
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What the board did in August was approve science standards that
contain microevolution, or variation within a species, but not
macroevolution, or change from one species to another.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, which are curriculum guidelines for school
districts, also do not mention the age of the earth or the big-bang
theory of the universe's origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of those items in the standards does not prevent
schools from providing instruction in those areas,'' the cover
letter says. ``While it is the hope and intent of the state board
that all schools will teach up to the standards, each school also
has the ability to teach beyond the standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the cover letter were moderate board member Harold
Voth of Haven and conservative board members Bacon, Linda Holloway
of Shawnee, Mary Douglass Brown of Wichita, Steve Abrams of
Arkansas City and Scott Hill of Abilene. The same six board members
voted in August for the revised science standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's public relations motion was challenged by moderate board
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has any elected body made a decision and then had to go out
and debate the decision made?'' Janet Waugh asked. ``The board took
action. Now the consequences are to be followed through.'' Waugh is
a moderate board member from Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh also questioned why Bacon would suggest publicly defending
the board's decision eight months after the fact. The education
community already understands the magnitude of the board's
decision, and the ball has been rolling for a few months now on
writing new tests based on the standards, she said. School
districts soon will receive copies of the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   The time to speak was last fall, Waugh said. Now, with an
election cycle under way, any public campaign would be
inappropriate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this board table is the proper platform for an
election campaign,'' Waugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six members who supported the science standards are
up for election this year: Holloway, Brown, Abrams and Hill, of
Abilene .
</P>
<P>
   Holloway has announced her intention to run, and Brown and
Abrams said they planned to. Hill has said he will not seek a
second term.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill supported Bacon's suggestion to engage in discussions
with the public about the science standards. Hill said the issue
was one of the most emotional he had ever encountered.
</P>
<P>
   And it's frustrating for the board to continually be attacked by
the Kansas science community, Hill said. At least one speaker each
month has addressed the science standards at the board's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sat here for six months, listening to the science
community rant and rave,'' Hill said. ``Do we ever get an
opportunity to say what we actually passed? Or do we have to listen
to this one-sided diatribe forever and ever?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown seconded Hill. She said she didn't understand why members
of the science community continued to pester the board when the
decision was ``over and done with.''
</P>
<P>
   Waugh explained: ``It's not over and done with, because I do
think it probably will be a re-election issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's motion failed 5-4, with Voth and fellow moderates Waugh,
Val DeFever of Independence and Bill Wagnon of Topeka voting
against it. The board must have six votes to pass a motion.
Moderate Sonny Rundell of Syracuse was not at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The board met Wednesday at Troy High School in northeast Kansas.

ADVANCE MICRO POSTS STRONG EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 EARNINGS-NYT By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Driven by strong sales of its Athlon
microprocessors, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. posted first-quarter
earnings on Wednesday that were nearly double even Wall Street's
revised estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Although Advanced Micro said last week that it expected to
report sales of more than $1 billion for the quarter, a record, the
strength of its financial results still surprised many analysts.
Advanced Micro's growth was all the more startling on a day when a
key analyst reduced his estimates for the Microsoft Corp., citing
slower than expected personal computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended April 2, Advanced Micro reported
earnings of $189.3 million, or $1.15 a diluted share, compared with
a loss of $128.4 million, or 88 cents a share, in the period a year
earlier. Sales rose 73 percent, to $1.09 billion from $631.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Advanced Micro to report earnings of 58
cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. In
February, before Advanced Micro first revised its outlook for
first-quarter results, analysts expected profit of 32 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Before Advanced Micro reported the results, its shares closed at
$68, down 31.25 cents. In after-hours trading, they surged as high
as $76.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Advanced Micro's strong results could help
stabilize the Nasdaq and technology stocks in general, especially
if it is followed by other companies meeting or exceeding
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMD had the best quarter in its history,'' said W.J. Sanders
III, the company's chairman and chief executive. ``Each of our
product groups reported significant growth in the first quarter.
With a stronger product portfolio than at any time in our history,
we look forward to continuing growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Advanced Micro was fielding for the first
time in years a product line that can compete with the Intel Corp.
In the past, Advanced Micro either lagged behind in performance or
was unable to produce its fastest chips in high volumes, but these
problems appear to have been addressed with Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   Although a handful of companies produce microprocessors
compatible with those made by Intel, Advanced Micro has been the
most aggressive in terms of meeting, and at times beating, Intel in
absolute performance and has the broadest product line of all the
competitors. During the quarter, Advanced Micro shipped the
industry's first 1-gigahertz microprocessor. Although Intel rapidly
matched it, the symbolic value was significant.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway began using Advanced Micro chips again in January after
a long hiatus and Compaq, IBM and CyberMax have announced products
using Athlon processors. And last week, Dell Computer, which is the
only one of the top 10 computer makers that has never used Advanced
Micro processors, confirmed that it was in talks with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Although Advanced Micro's strong results seem at odds with news
of a weak quarter for computer makers, that is not really the case,
said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter. ``The talk that you're hearing out of Microsoft and Micron
about weak PC sales entirely relates to the corporate market,''
where purchases were deferred until the release of Windows 2000 on
Feb. 17, he said. ``The retail market, which is AMD's primary
market, was just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The other factor was that Advanced Micro finally appears to have
its manufacturing house in order. ``We heard their yields went
through the roof,'' Murphy said. ``Give them credit. They've done a
great job of getting even with, or even a little ahead of Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   Although primarily known as a maker of microprocessors
compatible with those of Intel, Advanced Micro benefited from
strong sales of cellular phones and electronic devices, which
increased demand for its flash-memory chips. At $327 million, sales
for Advanced Micro's memory division were up 150 percent over those
in the quarter a year earlier. The company said it expected that
demand for flash-memory devices would continue to exceed supply for
the rest of the year and into 2001.

JAMES VORENBERG, WATERGATE PROSECUTOR'S ASSISTANT
</HEADLINE>
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Vorenberg, a professor and former dean of
Harvard Law School who played pivotal roles in watershed legal
events including the Watergate investigation, died Wednesday in
Boston. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Elizabeth.
Vorenberg collapsed on Monday after he taught his law school class.
</P>
<P>
   A legal advocate who was identified with civil rights and a
liberal approach to criminal justice issues, Vorenberg's most
visible public role came in summer 1973 when he was one of the
senior assistants to the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald
Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I would have done without him,'' Cox said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg, by then an authority on criminal law who had
extensive Washington experience, was selected to organize the
office that had been established to investigate such matters as the
burglary at Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate complex
and assertions of campaign sabotage by the Committee to Re-elect
the President.
</P>
<P>
   His responsibilities included gathering a staff of accomplished
young lawyers. He was one of those in Cox's office who settled on
the approach of conducting a broad, multifaceted investigation that
would, as it turned out, quickly put Cox on a collision course with
the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start with the assumption we'll look into everything,''
Vorenberg told reporters on June 15 of that year, as the atmosphere
of crisis grew in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the ``Saturday night massacre'' on Oct. 20, 1973,
when Cox was dismissed in an effort by President Nixon to limit the
Watergate investigation, Vorenberg had become a part-time member of
the special prosecutor's staff because he had returned to teaching
at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Heymann, another Harvard professor who was a senior
member of Cox's staff, said that it was largely because of the
organizational work done by Vorenberg that the special prosecutor's
office was able to survive the political turmoil and continue the
investigation that would lead to Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was central to creating something that, from then on, was
too powerful and too legitimate to be stopped,'' Heymann said,
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg's earlier work on the national level included
executive director from 1965 to 1967 of a commission appointed by
President Johnson to study the growing problem of crime in America,
the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the
Administration of Justice. It was known as the Katzenbach
Commission for its chairman, then Attorney General Nicholas
Katzenbach.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Katzenbach report was one of the most
comprehensive studies of modern criminal justice issues and it
helped shape decades of policy with what were then novel ideas that
crime was a complex problem with social roots.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach said that Vorenberg, in his post as executive
director of the commission's staff, had been the architect of many
of the report's observations that fighting crime required solutions
like rehabilitation services and larger court staffs that were far
more complex than those that had been relied upon traditionally,
such as simply increasing budgets for the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new insight,'' Katzenbach said, crediting Vorenberg.
``It was significant because it pointed out to lay people that you
didn't solve the problem by just putting police in. You had to have
a balanced criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   In more recent years, Vorenberg continued legal scholarship on
similar criminal justice issues. He published one widely noted
academic article, for example, suggesting that the U.S. tradition
of giving prosecutors unfettered power had gone too far and
proposing limits on their authority.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, where he taught criminal law and was director of the
school's Center for the Advancement of Criminal Justice, he worked
to broaden the police understanding of legal principles. One
program that he sponsored brought police commanders to Harvard
University for fellowships, and many officers who later became
police chiefs are former fellows.
</P>
<P>
   (End Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   He was named the dean of the Harvard Law School in 1981. His
eight-year tenure was somewhat stormy because there were bitter
disputes over tenure decisions involving professors who advocated a
legal analysis known as critical legal studies, which asserted that
law was not neutral, as had long been taught at establishment
institutions like Harvard. Critical legal scholars say law is an
oppressive tool of the rich and powerful. While the battles over
critical legal studies were being waged, some black Harvard law
students protested, saying that there were not enough minority
members of the law school faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg was widely credited with keeping the venerable law
school intact during that period. At the same time, he quietly
assembled one of the most accomplished minority law school
faculties in the country, a Harvard professor, Charles J. Ogletree
Jr., said.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the tumultuous faculty upheavals of the 80's,''
Ogletree said, ``Jim was very levelheaded in focusing on minority
diversity and in attracting minority faculty members to Harvard Law
School.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Vorenberg was the model of the well-credentialed
and sober New England lawyer (although he was wry enough to publish
a cookbook with a friend who was also a university dean, Jack
Greenberg, and call it ``Dean Cuisine: The Liberated Man's Guide to
Fine Cooking,'' Sheepmeadow Press, 1990.)
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg was son and grandson of presidents of the Gilchrist
Co. department store in Boston. He went to Phillips Exeter Academy,
Harvard College and Harvard Law School, where he was president of
The Law Review. He was a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Felix
Frankfurter in 1953 and 1954.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Jill
Alberts of New York, Amy Vorenberg of Concord, N.H., and Eliza
Vorenberg of Los Angeles; two stepchildren, Amy Troubh of Newton,
Mass., and John Troubh of New York; and 10 grandchildren.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His first marriage to the former Dorothy Greeley ended in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, some of his friends said he often played a role
behind the scenes in helping his students and minority and female
lawyers break through the barriers of a profession that had
welcomed him easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a powerful role in mentoring young, unknown lawyers.
I was one of them,'' said Margaret H. Marshall, the chief justice
of the highest court in Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court.
Marshall is the first woman to occupy that position.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 14 years Vorenberg had been suffering from
Parkinson's disease. His wife said he never acknowledged that it
slowed his step or made it more difficult for him to continue
helping to bring young lawyers along. When his voice weakened to
the point that he could no longer be heard in large lecture rooms,
he simply started using a microphone. &QL;

HOW NOT TO CONDUCT LABOR TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the reams of U.S. labor and employment
law, there is a glaring omission. Somewhere there should be a law
that requires a third-party transcription of every labor
negotiation-related phone call, casual restaurant discussion and
formal bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   The result couldn't be any more expensive or troublesome than
the we-said, they-said explanations and finger pointing that follow
failed labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since things fell apart between Associated Wholesale
Grocers and Teamsters Local 955 in Kansas City, Kan., area grocery
customers and curious observers have begged the media to ``just
tell us the truth.'' Consumers are weary and suspicious of the
competing full-page ads and TV commercials battling for their
sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I heard detailed explanations from Doug Carolan,
president and chief executive of Associated, and Bobby Davidson,
president of the Teamsters local, about the impasse that occurred
when the union contract expired April 1. Listening was both a
privilege and a pain, given the animosities and economic fallout
for so many.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, both men came with allies and attorneys to sit at
conference tables at The Kansas City Star. Both were pleasant and
passionately concerned about protecting the interests of their
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the end result of a couple of hours of listening is this:
There are two versions of ``the truth,'' and only a very busy fly
on the wall _ which also would have to have been buzzing around
(BEGIN ITALICS)inside(END ITALICS) some key participants' heads _
could stitch the two versions together into ``the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   I was not that fly, so my hindsight is based on hearsay, but
here are some of my, no doubt, imperfect perceptions:
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, metaphorically speaking, the union still was playing
a neighborhood softball game when the company was winding up with a
hard fastball pitch in a whole new ball game. It's impossible to
say whether the signals were sent and missed or never sent.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the union negotiators thought they'd still be able
to play ball even after Mama called them home to dinner; instead,
they were thrown off the field before they realized it was getting
dark.
</P>
<P>
   Union reps contend they are not ``at an impasse,'' as the
company states. The Teamsters say that they will go back to the
bargaining table at any time and that they repeatedly and
specifically tried to address every issue the wholesaler brought
up. The offer seems to be too late; Associated has no intention of
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Associated says the union's proposals ``didn't go far enough''
to help them control costs. The union counters that it offered to
make changes but that the company refused to give them specific
targets to hit. Every company has the right to shave expenses, but
it seems it could have shared specific cost-cutting goals and
planned procedures earlier in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Associated says the Teamsters ``failed to grant'' them
negotiating sessions when they wanted them last fall to avoid
down-to-the-wire problems. It's clear the union reps didn't
understand that Associated was treating last October with the same
urgency as if it were March.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, by the way, acknowledged canceling or postponing a
few negotiating sessions because of family illnesses or scheduling
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters say Associated failed to bargain in good faith, as
the law requires, right up to the end of the contract. That does
seem to be so. In many collective bargaining cases, even if new
terms weren't agreed to by the contract expiration date, extensions
were received and bargaining continued. That's the model the
Teamsters assumed still existed. It obviously did not.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty days in advance of the contract expiration date, an
Associated human resource officer asked the local union presidents
from Kansas City and Springfield to meet him at a Bob Evans
restaurant in Springfield to discuss the status of the
negotiations. At the restaurant, the officer gave the union reps
Associated's notice of intent to contract out the warehouse and
delivery jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same moment, other Associated managers were announcing
the decision on bullhorns, standing in the warehouses. The union
officers asked for a delay in the announcement so they could talk
to their members first. It looks to me as if the company was
begging for a wildcat strike (which didn't happen) and was
disingenuous in setting up the restaurant meeting with the union
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale company is being patently ridiculous when it
attempts to separate the grocery stores it supplies from the labor
strife. Owners of the grocery stores are members of Associated's
board of directors. They are Carolan's boss. Any board,
particularly of a cooperative organization, that does its duty
knows exactly what the corporate policy and intent is.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear to me that Associated decided well in advance of
the contract expiration date that it would turn over operations of
its warehouse and delivery operations to nonunion subcontractors.
Regardless what language Associated used, union workers were locked
out when the contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   The new employment offers extended to the warehouse workers are
superior financially to the re-employment ``opportunities'' offered
the truckers. It's impossible to judge the pros and cons of the
re-employment offers in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
   A loyal union member would say it's heresy to suggest accepting
the nonunion re-employment offer from CSI, the subcontractor chosen
by Associated to take over warehouse operations. I certainly
couldn't counsel either way.
</P>
<P>
   But it does appear that the re-employment offer on the table for
warehouse workers is financially comparable to their current union
wages and benefits. Provided the CSI offer is in good faith and
stays in place, it is a way for warehouse workers to keep their
jobs and maintain their current standards of living.
</P>
<P>
   The re-employment offer to the truckers is a mess. The
late-breaking offer from Associated was that the truckers may
``lease to own'' their tractors over two years _ at $100 a month _
if they choose to go to work for, and stay employed with, Perryman
Refrigerated Lines, the delivery subcontractor chosen by
Associated.
</P>
<P>
   A tractor for $2,400? Sounds good, right? I don't think so. The
expenses of owning and operating your own tractor, dependent on the
delivery hours the company will give you and the government will
allow, make a good living nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, some of the tractors that would be sold already
have hundreds of thousands of miles on them. Maintenance needs are
staggering. Again, I couldn't counsel anyone, but I wouldn't leap
at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I'm saddened by a pitiful lack of communication,
lack of understanding and seeming lack of good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Who is most at fault?
</P>
<P>
   Ask the fly that wasn't there.

SOFIA COPPOLA'S SECOND CHANCE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   Graham Fuller is the movie columnist for Interview magazine and the
editor of ``Loach on Loach,'' about the director Ken Loach.  
 By GRAHAM FULLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Virgin Suicides,'' the dreamy first feature film
written and directed by Sofia Coppola, five sisters, ages 13 to 17,
who live in a leafy Michigan suburb in the 1970s inexplicably and
matter-of-factly kill themselves. Their story, an unsolved mystery
laced with lust, obsession, longing, fantasies and gilded memories,
is recounted 25 years after by a neighborhood boy, now a rueful
adult, who worshiped Therese, Mary, Bonnie, Lux and Cecilia Lisbon
from afar.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides' lyrical 1993 novel, the movie
might have been a prurient wander through the bedrooms of its
lovely nymphs, an exploitative riff on teen-age angst, or a
cautionary drama _ think ``Five American Beauties, Interrupted'' _
with an earnest social message. But what Coppola has made of it is
a haunting metaphysical celebration of adolescence with the aura of
a myth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on the surface, there is something wrong with this picture:
how can a film in which a quintet of apparently normal girls commit
suicide possibly be a celebration, and why would a filmmaker
attempt to make it so unless she is uncommonly perverse? Not that
Coppola omitted all the details of societal decay and cosmic
malaise that Eugenides wove into his novel _ although anyone who
speaks at length with her would doubt she possesses an ounce of
perversity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, David Lynch, for one, has carefully hidden his
penchant for all-American degeneracy under a boyish ``Gee whiz!''
persona. But Coppola is apparently guileless, or so it seemed to me
when we met to talk about her remarkable debut.
</P>
<P>
   While she recently married the director Spike Jonze, whose film
``Being John Malkovich'' suggests a Dada-like weirdness in his
world view, Coppola comes across as an unassuming woman a good deal
younger than her 28 years. She talks eagerly about her film, but
answers must be coaxed from her and we will to get to those later.
First, like the unseen narrator, who with his friends tried to
unravel the irresolvable riddle of the legendary Lisbon sisters, we
need clues.
</P>
<P>
   Delving into Coppola's career immediately prompts another
mystery: why would she even want to make movies? Her initial forays
into the film business as an adult were thankless. At the age of
17, she designed the costumes and opening credit sequence of and
co-wrote Francis Ford Coppola's segment of ``New York Stories''
(1989). It was a precious tale about a privileged little girl, and
Coppola was suspected of diverting her father, the director of
``The Godfather'' and ``Apocalypse Now,'' from his auteur's vision.
</P>
<P>
   Worse was in store. Shortly after, she agreed to play Mary
Corleone in her father's ``Godfather Part III'' (1990) when Winona
Ryder pulled out of the film at the last minute. Coppola's
performance was as mannered as it was plucky, but it scarcely
warranted the critical mauling it received.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely painful,'' she recalled. ``If it had been my
dream to be an actress and that's what I'd been training to do, I
think it would have hurt so much more, but I didn't have all my
hopes wrapped up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola said: ``A lot of people thought Sofia was pursuing an
acting career and that I gave her a big break because I was her
father. But I'd gone to her when she was about to go back to school
and said, `Look, I'm in a spot _ can you help me?' If you compare
her so-called bad performance with the work of seasoned actresses,
then it's clear she had no training, but I thought her awkwardness
as a non-professional was touching. As so often happens, the
criticism was a way people could punish me through her.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola avoided movies for the next few years and, by her own
admission, became a dilettante. After leaving the California
Institute for the Arts in 1991, she was the co-host of Comedy
Central's short-lived talk show ``High Octane,'' took photos for
magazines, designed her own clothing line and modeled.
</P>
<P>
   She felt the absence of a vocation. ``I could do a little of
this and a little of that, but I never had the patience to study
one thing and become an expert at it,'' she said. ``I was mixed up
about what I was supposed to do and afraid I would wake up one day
not having done anything with my life. I realize now it helps to be
a generalist if you want to make films.''
</P>
<P>
   She never consciously decided to become a filmmaker, but in 1995
became fixated on adapting ``The Virgin Suicides.'' At the time it
was a fool's errand, given that Muse Productions, an independent
company run by Chris and Roberta Hanley, owned the rights and had
signed another filmmaker to direct his own adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   Going against her father's advice to adapt a book for which the
rights were available, Coppola says she wrote down the word
``opening'' and started highlighting scenes from the novel. ``I
didn't think about plot because the book jumps around so much in
time,'' she said. ``And I didn't realize until after I'd written my
script that at the end of each act there's a party scene, but
that's because I didn't think in terms of acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Muse Productions passed on the first adaptation and
invited Coppola to direct her script. Her father, who said his
daughter had been a visually oriented child with little interest in
literature, was impressed with the clarity of her script _
``Although it was an odd subject from my point of view,'' he said _
and came on board as one of the film's producers.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola, meanwhile, proceeded to direct a 14-minute
black-and-white film she had written with a friend. A deft moral
fable about a smug high school ringleader whose plan to poison some
of her fellow students ends in her ostracism, Coppola's ``Lick the
Star'' revealed her particular taste for images of bland suburban
landscapes and of adolescent girls caught in a state of dreamy
self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   One overhead shot of a girl submerged in a bath, reminiscent of
John Everett Millais' painting ``Ophelia,'' was echoed in the
opening moments of ``The Virgin Suicides'' when Cecilia Lisbon
attempts suicide for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola now dismisses ``Lick the Star'' as ``like an old term
paper,'' but it demonstrated her facility for storytelling through
the use of tableaus and montages, rare in Hollywood filmmaking with
its reliance on uncluttered frames and sequential cutting. She got
the chance to give full rein to her impressionistic style when she
filmed ``Virgin Suicides'' on location in Toronto in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coppola suggested some key crew members to his
daughter, his involvement during shooting was minimal. ``I visited
the set for three days,'' he said. ``The rest of the time I was
available on the phone and Sofia did call me with a couple of
problems _ for example, when one of the young actresses broke out
in a rash and Sofia was getting pressure to fire her. So I was a
kind of a Yoda.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner, who plays the Lisbon sisters' dowdy and
obsessively controlling mother opposite James Woods as their weak,
ineffectual father, said she ``required Sofia to help me stay
brave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed to the body padding, to the brown polyester dresses,
to wearing no makeup _ and every time I stepped in front of a
mirror, I shuddered,'' she said. ``But Sofia constantly told me
that my work was good and that what I was doing was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst, who gives an iconographic performance as the
sexually precocious 14-year-old Lux, had her own concern. After Lux
is seduced and unaccountably abandoned by her smitten beau, Trip
Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), on the school football field after the
homecoming dance, she begins to smuggle random males onto the
family rooftop for sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first movie in which I've played a promiscuous
character,'' Dunst said, ``and I was worried it wouldn't be done in
a classy way, but Sofia knew exactly how to handle my scenes. I do
think, though, that this would have been a completely different
movie if a man had directed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola uses the suicides bookending the film as a framing
metaphor for the passing of the teen years _ of which the Lisbon
sisters, frozen for all time by their deaths, are idealized
symbols. Coppola is also fascinated by what she describes as the
``epicness'' of teendom.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the most calamitous event in the movie is not
Cecilia's fatal plunge from her bedroom window, which ignites the
story, or the concluding suicides of her sisters, but Trip's
callous desertion of Lux. The close-up of Lux traveling home alone
by taxi in the blue light of dawn after her sexual humiliation is
the bleakest image in a film that otherwise luxuriates in
epiphanies of post-pubescent girlhood _ not that it shrinks from
realities like menstruation or one sister's capacity for meanness
to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought `The Virgin Suicides' was about suicide at
all,'' Coppola said. ``The reason I got involved in the first place
was that I didn't want to see a film of this book that was going to
be morbid, violent or sexual. What I loved about it when I first
read it was that it's like a celebration of first love and how that
haunts you forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its real theme is loss and the idea that things happen in life
that you have no explanation for. The story is made up of memories
and fragments of memories, and the feeling I got from it is that
you can never figure out what they all mean until you stop trying,
and then you just remember the essences of people _ and of the time
when they were suddenly gone and how it changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Everyone goes through something like that.'' In May
1986, Gian-Carlo Coppola, the older of her two brothers, was killed
in a speedboat accident at the age of 22. ``That was my experience
of loss,'' she said, ``although I didn't consciously realize its
connection to the story until after I'd started filming. But even
if someone's life is very short and you can't find a logical
explanation for it, you do end up with the feeling that their life
wasn't lived in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Eugenides' novel nor Coppola's film probes the
psychological or sociological reasons its heroines kill themselves.
The book cites, with calculated half-heartedness, some statistics
about teen suicides. Coppola, not remotely interested in whys, has
fun satirizing a predatory, narcissistic television newswoman who,
after Cecilia's death, stalks her grieving sisters on their
doorstep and is given to trite analyses of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tragedy at its core, the film is driven by idylls
and reveries. There is an intensely feminine pastoral interlude _
complete with a unicorn and glowing images of the sisters _
inspired by the boys' reading of the dead Cecilia's diary and its
revelation that the libidinous Lux had a crush on a hunky
garbageman.
</P>
<P>
   There are the exotic ``vacations,'' depicted as a series of
snapshots, on which the boys imagine accompanying the sisters
(including the resurrected Cecilia). Lastly, we witness the boys'
``rescue'' of the four surviving girls in which they drive the
sisters away from their doom seconds before we see what has already
come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola clearly intuited how to evoke cinematically the mythical
aura in which the novel enshrouds the Lisbon girls, turning them
into phantoms in the boys' minds _ the kind of phantoms of
long-gone love objects most of us harbor.
</P>
<P>
   However, when asked if he felt the film enhanced this mythic
quality, Eugenides said he always believed that having live actors
play the girls, while unavoidable, ``would rob them of some of the
mysteriousness or unknowability I tried to give them in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My own feeling is that the point of view in the movie comes
more from the girls than is the case in the book,'' he said. ``The
audience is constantly reminded that the story is being told by the
boys, that all this information is therefore suspect, but it's hard
to keep that in mind when you're watching a 20-foot-tall Kirsten
Dunst on the screen. She seems very real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he added, ``I always knew that the film would be
Sofia's vision of my book. What else could it be? Some translation
had to take place. The book was never written to be a movie. Many
people thought it couldn't be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Having been the one to pull it off, Coppola admitted it was a
relief to find a career. ``I like the idea of directing another
film,'' she said. ``But there's something to be said for going into
something when you're completely naive and don't know what you're
getting yourself into. I felt so strongly about `The Virgin
Suicides' that I never stopped to think about the end result or
that people would actually watch it.''

 Peter Applebome, a deputy metropolitan editor of The New York
Times, is the author of ``Dixie Rising: How the South Is Shaping
American Values, Politics and Culture.''  
 By PETER APPLEBOME

<P>
   His signature song is a hillbilly howl with barbed wire
honky-tonk lyrics. Hers is a spooky, Christ-haunted vision of life
after death. His music is alternately raw as cedar bark and
mordantly aware _ like a character in a Cormac McCarthy novel who
reads Cormac McCarthy novels. She's anguished and ethereal at the
same time, more folk or rock than anything recognizably country.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy and Julie Miller, a husband and wife team of prodigious
talent, certainly aren't the flavor du jour of country music. Only
those who traverse the dusty corners of off-brand country even know
who they are. But in their own way, they have become both a minor
phenomenon and a resonant window onto one of the richest veins in
American music these days.
</P>
<P>
   As Nashville, the music machine, has become bigger and blander,
Nashville the city _ along with its kindred planet in Austin, Texas
_ has become the center of an increasingly diverse and intriguing
array of American music rooted in country with strains of folk,
rock, bluegrass, rockabilly and blues.
</P>
<P>
   At various times called Americana, alternative country, No
Depression or insurgent country, it's really too loose and untidy a
mongrel, or pack of vaguely allied mongrels, to fit into any real
niche _ certainly not the niche played on country radio. It's so
amorphous that No Depression magazine, the most clued-in
publication following the music, describes itself as ``the
alternative country (whatever that is) bimonthly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millers, who record separately under their own names but
write, play and sing on each others' records, are a perfect example
of the various strands that make up the music. Whether it adds up
to something likely to break out of its own obscure corner of the
music world is something a lot of people are trying to figure out.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to call anyone a real standard bearer for Americana or
alt.country. The Byrds, Emmylou Harris and Gram Parsons, with
tentacles in both rock and country, are its pioneers, and Steve
Earle perhaps its most evolved model. The short-lived band Uncle
Tupelo created one ragged rock-oriented variation of the beast in
offspring like Wilco, the Jayhawks and Son Volt.
</P>
<P>
   Artists ranging from Lucinda Williams to Jimmie Dale Gilmore to
Joe Ely fit somewhere under the umbrella, as do country legends
deemed too country for country like George Jones or Johnny Cash.
Its best artists, Jim Lauderdale, Mike Henderson, Robbie Fulks,
Wayne Hancock, Kim Richey, Kimmie Rhodes, are all semi-unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   There's a huge Texas branch (Robert Earl Keen, Charlie Robison,
Bruce Robison, Jack Ingram, Kelly Willis, the Derailers), a Chicago
branch ( Fulks), an Appalachian folkie subset (Iris DeMent, Gillian
Welch) and assorted stray dogs (Junior Brown, the Mavericks, Kevin
Welch, Kieran Kane), stray dinosaurs (Don Walser) and stray threads
(Appalachian Gothic! Conjunto! Western Swing! Country Punk!) of
various shapes and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   If it had a keyword, it would be ``twang.'' It's an elusive
enough category that if, say, Bob Dylan or Tom Petty, or Hank
Williams, Bob Wills or Buck Owens, for that matter, popped up for
the first time today, they'd probably be seen as more or less
alt.country. After all, where else would they fit?
</P>
<P>
   Still, if no one defines the form, the Millers manage to touch
almost all its most compelling elements. He has a rich, expressive
voice that's one part pre-Garth Nashville and one part Stax/Volt
Memphis, and his newest album, ``Cruel Moon'' (HighTone HCD8111),
ranges from the country soul of ``Sometimes I Cry'' to the primal
swamp rock of ``Somewhere Trouble Don't Go.''
</P>
<P>
   But his quintessential song is a mournful backwoods howl, ``Does
My Ring Burn Your Finger,'' with lyrics the Millers wrote together
that stand right up in hillbilly heaven. ``When I gave you my heart
it was not what you wanted/ Now the walls say your name and the
pictures are haunted/ Does my ring burn your finger? Did my love
weigh you down?/ Was a promise too much to keep around?''
</P>
<P>
   If Buddy Miller's music is country to the core, Julie Miller's
newest album, ``Broken Things'' (HighTone HCD8103), is half fragile
folk, half jangly rock characterized by her wispy, girlish voice
and wounded minor key sensibilities. But it has the same intensely
personal footprints and the same moments of jagged magic, like her
``All My Tears,'' a mix of old-time religion and sophisticated rock
that's been recorded already by Harris and the jazz singer Jimmy
Scott but is given a definitive reading by the Millers on ``Broken
Things.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Millers, now in their mid 40s, have been playing
professionally since the mid 1970s and they complement each other
perfectly. She's the main writer and gives their music its
spiritual tinge. He's one of the most distinctive guitarists and
singers in Nashville and an increasingly sure-footed producer,
working out of the studio he built in their house.
</P>
<P>
   She began with the Texas progressive country of Jerry Jeff
Walker and Ray Wylie Hubbard and detoured through Christian music.
He came out of bluegrass and hard country like Merle Haggard and
Porter Wagoner. He's on the ground. She's in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The two have careered around from Austin to New York to Los
Angeles to Nashville over the years, playing at the fringes of the
music business, and Miller in particular has gained a reputation as
a stellar guitarist and band leader through his stints with Harris
and Earle.
</P>
<P>
   The Millers are still at the fringe in Nashville. ``There's a
big area of Nashville that's big business, medical technology, that
sort of thing,'' she said recently before a show at the Bottom Line
in New York. ``It's there, but I don't know anything about it; it's
not part of my life. And it's pretty much the same way with the big
Nashville music machine. It's there. If people want to do that,
it's fine, but it doesn't have anything to do with me.''

JACKSON ENJOYING `GOOD FORTUNE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Underachieving a year ago, unstoppable this season, the Lakers
have undergone an amazing transformation in a short period, but
coach Phil Jackson _ the favorite for coach of the year _ isn't
ready to declare this his best coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   But as he deflects credit for the Lakers' 65-13 record (with
four games to go), Jackson does take pride in the dominant run they
put together from just before the All-Star break to last week _ a
period in which the Lakers won 30 of 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game-to-game thing, I think,'' Jackson said of coaching
success. ``It's just like some days you hit them right and your
intuition's good, and the coaching staff are in sync, and other
times you're not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one of those situations where we were in sync for
a couple months. That run we had that was a 30-something-game run,
31 games that we played together that were well done, was as well
orchestrated as any teams I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is saying something, considering that as Chicago Bulls
coach, Jackson won 72 games in 1995-96, 69 games in 1996-97 and 67
games in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan had a lot to do with those numbers, of course.
But Jackson dismisses the notion that he takes pride in winning
without Jordan's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the fact that Michael was maybe the most
competitive player I ever coached in my life, and one of the great
players,'' Jackson said. ``And I think it's quite obvious that
playing without him one year we had a really good record (55-27 in
1993-94), the other year (47-35 in 1994-95) we struggled a little
bit as we changed our lineup and our roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have the horses to win in this game, and it's
great to coach a great season without talent, beating your head
against a wall in many situations, and feeling like every play is
critical to your odds. It's another to have talent and to measure a
season and measure a team and the process of how you want to teach
and coach in a long-term aspect. That's been my good fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that fortune repeats, and Jackson rides Shaquille O'Neal
and Kobe Bryant to a title, will be known soon enough. The playoffs
begin in nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we do in the playoffs is altogether different,'' Jackson
said. ``Michael was a big-time playoff player. And so were the
players that grew up with him in the '90s, and they learned how to
do it in critical situations. We're going to have to find out about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   KNIGHT TIME: O'Neal's recent two-game absence gave the Lakers'
backup centers a chance to make an impression. The final tally:
Travis Knight averaged 3.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 1.5 blocks and 4.0
fouls in 19.0 minutes. John Salley averaged 4.0 points, 4.5
rebounds, zero blocks and 3.5 fouls in 15.5 minutes. They combined
to make 6 of 22 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, they won't be rusty if needed in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good just to get out and kind of feel comfortable,''
said Knight, who is averaging just 6.4 minutes in 59 games.
``Sometimes, if you get in there for five minutes, it's tough to
really relax and get into the flow of the game. But you get in
there for eight, 10 minutes, you can kind of feel it a little bit
and relax.'' &QL;

   But they've become critics' darlings and their recent tour,
their first, went so well that even they were surprised by the
turnout. ``We'd look at all these people and think, `Is someone
else coming on after us?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Millers' modest visibility doesn't exactly put them at the
sales level of the Dixie Chicks or Garth Brooks, but like Lucinda
Williams, who had huge success with her 1998 album ``Car Wheels on
a Gravel Road,'' the Millers are a reminder that alt.country acts
can occasionally find recognition outside the Nashville machine.
</P>
<P>
   But the Millers' story is also a reminder of just how hard it is
to be heard. Alt.country acts don't get played on country radio or
have videos on country music television. Their labels tend to be
small, scrappy independents like HighTone, where the Millers
record, Sugar Hill, Vanguard, E-Squared, Compass, Rounder,
Bloodshot, Philo, Lucky Dog, Oh Boy or the Nashville artists'
collective Dead Reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's enough talent and critical mass in the alt.
country world that a lot of people are trying to figure out how to
make it work. There's the alternative country press, online and
off. There are Internet lists, like one called Postcard2
(topsoil.net/postcard2.htm), where the faithful debate fine points
of alt.country minutiae like obsessive honky-tonk Trotskyites.
</P>
<P>
   There's an Americana record chart, kept by Gavin, the trade
magazine of the radio industry. The chart is based on reports from
93 stations, most of them small, which usually mix some of the
alternative country artists with mainstream country, a format known
as album adult alternative or TripleA.
</P>
<P>
   Shows on the Public Broadcasting System like ``Austin City
Limits'' and National Public Radio take the music much more
seriously than country radio does, and an Americana live showcase
and radio show, the ``Western Beat Roots Revival,'' graduates to
Country Music Television this summer. There's even a fledgling
trade group, the Americana Music Association
(www.americanamusic.org) formed in March to promote the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much talent there, it deserves a hearing,'' said
Jessie Scott of Gavin, which has had an Americana chart for five
years. ``This could be the next big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Next big thing might be a bit much to ask for. The alt.country
cast of characters is considerably short on the glitz and sex
appeal that dominates the music business from country to pop to
soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the alt.country folks are a little straggly,'' said
Miller, whose Circle of Dust baseball cap and Neil Young couture
give him all the glamour of a guy who should be fixing the
transmissions on old Chevys. ``I'm an old hippy. I'm too old to try
to put on a suit and play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And if much of the music is terrific, some comes across as
good-natured amateurism or roots rock weirdos in funny outfits
trying to sound like music a half century out of date. ``It's like
any other alternative music,'' he said. ``A lot under that umbrella
is just an excuse for playing medicore songs out of tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet country has always veered between the mainstream and the
backwoods, usually swinging back toward its roots when it got too
bland and homogenized. It's pretty darn bland right now, and
country radio is seeing its audience melt away, shrinking by 25
percent since 1994. The most talked-about song on country radio is
``Murder on Music Row'' by George Strait and Alan Jackson, which
rails against Nashville's long day's journey into pop.
</P>
<P>
   And, if it's not likely to attract the hot young mass audience
Nashville is lusting after, the Millers' music _ smart, evocative,
technically proficient, lyrically inventive _ at least has the
potential to reach a sophisticated audience, from college students
to the NPR/PBS constituency, that's a quiet, but sizable hunk of
the populace.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how to link the music with the audience is the hard
part. ``I don't care too much about what label they put on it,''
Miller said. ``Americana's fine. I'm just glad there's a place for
us. I'm so out of it; when I made my first record, I thought I was
making a country record. Then I found out it was alternative
country or whatever it is. Like Julie says, `I like to think what
we do is country and what they play on the radio is the
alternative.' But that's the way it's always been. Radio is
basically like McDonald's _ you know, a billion customers served.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a lifetime of scuffling around the edge of
solvency, he's not complaining. Their next project is their first
record together, a series of country duets a la Dolly Parton and
Porter Wagoner, and Miller is booked with projects for the rest of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I never could have foreseen this,'' he said. ``When I
lived in L.A. I spent the end of every month trying to figure out
which guitar I had to sell to pay the rent.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from Europe.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There has been no shortage of bravura performers
exported from London to Broadway over the years who dazzle with
their extroversion and breadth and an expansiveness that seems to
reach toward the very last row.
</P>
<P>
   One thinks of Zoe Wanamaker as Sophocles' Electra and her
uncontainable grief spilling over into the auditorium last season,
or of Janet McTeer's Nora, in ``A Doll's House'' several years
before that, slamming the door on Torvald, but not before her
feverish energy seemed capable of igniting all of Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back still further, one can place in the same category
the New York stage debut of Jeremy Irons as Henry, the lovesick
dramatist at the bruised heart of ``The Real Thing.'' As he cried
out ``please, please, please don't!'' toward the climax of the
second act, when the cuckolded playwright experiences for the first
time the weight of feelings beyond words, Irons pierced the air
with the very heartache that was stabbing at him.
</P>
<P>
   The performance won him the 1984 Tony Award for best actor,
while Tom Stoppard's drama won four additional awards, including
best play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Real Thing'' is back on Broadway this season, opening
Monday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in an acclaimed revival that
originated last summer at the Donmar Warehouse here and that later
transferred to a commercial run in the West End.
</P>
<P>
   As in London, Stephen Dillane plays Henry, the carefully
reined-in author of a drama about adultery called ``House of
Cards.'' In the course of the play (not the play within the play),
Henry's own deliberately constructed carapace against emotion
cracks apart.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Dillane in her own Broadway debut is Jennifer Ehle as
Annie, the actress who becomes the playwright's second wife and who
teaches him a lesson or two about pain. In 1984, Glenn Close won
the first of her three Tony Awards for the role.
</P>
<P>
   But expecting a simple repeat of the affect of that earlier
production would be a mistake. The tone of the current ``Real
Thing'' is set by its much-lauded leading man, Dillane. While some
Britons on Broadway may act with a capital A, the wiry,
tousle-haired Dillane is too much the purist for that. By contrast,
in playing Henry, he simply, woundingly (italics)is.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in getting out of the way of the story,''
Dillane said over fish stew in London one wintry lunchtime. It was
shortly before transplanting himself to New York with his partner,
Naomi Wirthner, an actress, and their two young sons, ages 8 and
nearly 2. ``It's important not to let the audience ever feel
conscious of somebody doing anything. What interests me is the
transformative power of the writing rather than the skill of the
actors.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Dillane disappears onstage. You don't
play Hamlet eight times a week on the West End for the director
Peter Hall, as this actor did over the course of six months in 1994
(``Tired isn't the word''), without possessing an innate charisma
that perhaps you are loath to identify in yourself.
</P>
<P>
   As Vanya at the Young Vic in 1998, Dillane found rancor and
tenderness in a potentially languid play: Chekhov has rarely seemed
so animated. And yet, among all his theater work _ London runs in
``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' ``Hurlyburly'' and ``Angels in America''
included _ his performance in ``The Real Thing'' has been the one
to attract awards.
</P>
<P>
   As the linguistically deft wordsmith who is emotionally
blindsided by his more impulsive wife, Dillane won The Evening
Standard drama award for best actor, followed by nominations for an
Olivier and a London Critics' Circle award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acting can often be about being camp and showing off,'' he
said, explaining his preference for a naturalism so intense it has
made audiences at ``The Real Thing'' remark that they felt they
were hearing his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that's what acting is,'' Dillane said.
``Watching somebody do something that they've sort of worked out so
that they can do the same thing every night and present it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, for some people there is something truthful in
that,'' he continued. ``But I can't help feeling very often that
the play itself is not being served and that there is a far greater
good to be had than is being had. It's an entirely personal
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Dillane, who grew up in suburban London, the son of an
Australian surgeon, speaks with unusual clarity about acting
because he came to it as a second profession.
</P>
<P>
   After studying history and politics at Exeter University, he
began a career as a journalist. At 25 he made the leap to drama
school, enrolling at the Bristol Old Vic. Reading ``Hamlet,'' he
said, along with ``The Empty Space'' by the director Peter Brook
when he was a journalist impelled him to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of old Tom's moments beyond language,'' he said,
referring to Stoppard. ``I felt there was some relationship with
these extraordinary bits of writing that would be nourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   How do others assess his gift? Sam Mendes, artistic director of
the Donmar and a recent Oscar winner for his direction of
``American Beauty,'' said Dillane possesses a ``technique that is
entirely sublimated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think these people can't do it on a big stage and then
they do,'' Mendes said. ``They have audiences leaning forward in
their seats.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ehle, playing opposite Dillane ``is always different, and
it's always real; it just seems to come through his pores.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leveaux, the director of the new production, is well
equipped to compare the Henrys then and now in a way that Dillane,
who never saw Irons in the part, cannot. ``Stephen is a sort of
time bomb in a way,'' Leveaux said.
</P>
<P>
   With Dillane, he added: ``There is a flexibility and immediacy
that perhaps people don't associate with the stage or the artifice
of language-based plays. He starts from the premise that the
audience is very bright, and that, of course, is what ultimately
delivers him.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, at least at present, is an actor's actor; one of
those performers spoken of almost with awe within the industry who
has yet to achieve broad public recognition that he may not, in any
case, want. (After all, not many ascending London performers would
refuse an American agent in favor of the same agent back home,
Michelle Braidman, that he has had all along.)
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Dillane has appeared with Sandra Bullock, albeit in
``Stolen Hearts,'' which is among the actress' least-known films.
And as Michael Nicholson, the real-life British journalist who
smuggled a Bosnian girl back to London in ``Welcome to Sarajevo''
in 1997, he provided the unsentimental center to a film made much
more stirring for having Dillane's cool at its core.
</P>
<P>
   In May, he will be seen as Karenin in what looks _ on the basis
of an early preview _ to be an astonishingly immediate television
retelling of ``Anna Karenina'' for Britain's Channel 4; already on
release in England, though not yet in the United States, is the
Thaddeus O'Sullivan film ``Ordinary Decent Criminal,'' with Dillane
playing an Irish policeman in ardent pursuit of Kevin Spacey's
cheeky Dublin crook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems at a certain point I end up entering into this debate
about fame,'' Dillane said, ``as if I have any say in it, as if I'm
somehow doing something or not doing something to attract it. And
I'm not. I'm just going along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting better at having no expectations,'' Dillane said
of his career. ``Once you start saying, `Yes, I want this,' then
you're setting things up for yourself that get in the way. It's
better to go about your business and see what turns up.''

A SHOT AT THUMB-WRESTLING WITH ROGER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   Franz Lidz, a senior writer at Sports Illustrated, is the author of
``Unstrung Heroes,'' and writes frequently about film.  
 By FRANZ LIDZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching ``Siskel and Ebert at the Movies'' was a bit like being
fed intravenously: you never tasted anything, but eventually you
felt a kind of ghostly satiation.
</P>
<P>
   The show's appeal derived less from its film snippets and
critical insights than from the banter between the cheery, chubby
Roger Ebert and the diffident Gene Siskel, a dour presence with the
silhouette of a roll-on deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, these two Chicago newspapermen lacked the easy
rapport of, say, Hope and Crosby, or the bittersweet camaraderie of
Laurel and Hardy. What they shared was a chafing testiness _ a
novelty among TV co-hosts. Throwing up their arms with evident
dismay, they bickered and bellyached like Beckett tramps trapped in
some Movie Theater of the Absurd. You sensed they could barely
stand each other, an impression reinforced every time Siskel
snapped ``Roger, that's ridiculous!'' and unleashed a laugh that
was pure triumphant scorn.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel died at the age of 53 in February 1999. Since then, his
chair has been warmed by the rumps of reviewers drawn from a
defective Gene pool. Sessions have tended to play out like first
dates: guest critics seem more intent on pleasing Ebert than on
engaging him.
</P>
<P>
   So when Ebert invites me onto the show to play Siskel, I ask,
``Which would you prefer _ a courtship or a marriage?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it best when the other critic acts as if it's his
show,'' he says, ``and he doesn't know what the hell I'm doing on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be a cinch, I think. After all, how hard can talking
about films be? Some of the most prodigiously dim people I know are
on the tube, filling air time with blab.
</P>
<P>
   Before blowing into the Windy City, I screen the five films
under discussion, and consult a television boxing commentator for
tips. Be playfully pugnacious, he suggests, and act like you hate
Ebert. ``Nobody cares what you say on TV, it's how you say it,'' he
advises. ``Lean forward and pounce. Begin your arguments with `Yes,
Roger, but. ...' or `Roger, have we seen the same film?'''
</P>
<P>
   What if we agree?
</P>
<P>
   ``Agree! You (italics)never(end italics) agree. What do you
think this is, a symposium? People tune in to see you duke it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   I arrive a day early for a sparring session with one of Ebert's
producers. ``A dry run,'' he says. We face off in a make-believe
movie theater erected on the same sound stage on which Nixon
debated Kennedy and sweated away the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   I play Nixon. Nervous under the lights, I step steadily into an
opinion, then, in my mind, hear a playback of what I've just said.
It sounds idiotic. I stop uncertainly, scold myself for goofing up,
collect myself and move forward before collapsing on the far side
of a not-terribly-coherent thought. ``You'll be fine, tomorrow,''
the producer assures me. ``Just relax and ad-lib.''
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps not the best counsel. The last time I ad-libbed
on television was on a Stupid Pet Tricks segment of David
Letterman's show. ``My parrot is learning to speak Waring
Blender,'' I cracked. ``But I can't let him get too close to mine.
He thinks it's a Jacuzzi.''
</P>
<P>
   As I was hurriedly ushered off the sound stage, I noticed how
Letterman's eyebrows were set in perplexed diagonals. I didn't
achieve instant stardom, nor did my parrot.
</P>
<P>
   So the next morning I approach the Ebert show with determined
intrepidness. In the production office, I spy a chubby man
gathering up a dozen DVDs and videos in his arms. ``Ah!'' he
announces. ``Freebies.'' It's Ebert, and I can't follow the advice
to hate him. He's too darn cheery. We stroll to the sound stage,
chatting amiably about everything except the movies we're about to
critique. Ebert says he doesn't want to lose the edge of
spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Our first film is ``Mission To Mars.'' Ebert opens with a flurry
of praise for its special effects and elegant camerawork. Like
Groucho Marx in one of the early Marx Brothers features, I feel a
strange interlude coming on. When Ebert gives the picture a
``marginal thumbs down,'' I lean forward, curve my lips into a
smirk and say: ``Yes, Roger, but. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Awarding the movie seven enthusiastic Martian thumbs down, I
brand it yet another paean to product placement: ``The Earthship is
saved by gravity-free Dr. Pepper, and human DNA turns out to be
composed of M &AMP; Ms. I don't know about you, Roger, but this film
critic is 60 percent Goobers and 40 percent Raisinets.''
</P>
<P>
   I look at Ebert, whose brows are set in Letterman-like
diagonals. ``Sit up straight,'' someone shouts at me. ``Your voice
is scratchy. Drink some water.'' Spread your hands on your knees,
says somebody else, and keep still. I try to do both, but can't:
I'm too busy drinking.
</P>
<P>
   We start again. ``Don't keep your legs apart.'' We start again.
``Don't look at the TV monitor.'' And again. ``Don't. ...'' And
again. And again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   Several Martian Ice Ages later, we get around to ``Ghost Dog:
The Way of the Samurai.'' Sitting stiffly, legs together, eyes
straight ahead, I raise my thumb to this fairy-tale fusion of Mafia
movies and samurai epics. A Spaghetti Eastern, I call it.
Alarmingly, Ebert raises his thumb, too. When the cross talk
bridges back to me, I growl, ``Roger, have we seen the same film?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought we both liked it,'' he says, brows now
permanently perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, (italics)I(end italics) liked it more.''
</P>
<P>
   We blunder on. When Ebert cheers the flimsy whimsy of Anjelica
Huston's ``Agnes Browne,'' I rally. ``Roger, as Tom Hanks said in
`Apollo 13': `Huston, we have a problem. ...''' Somebody cuts in:
``You can't say that. It sounds scripted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scripted. Too bad the movie wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   After three rounds of film talk, I'm gabbed out. My conversation
is all preoccupied pauses and hesitations, a soft fluttering of ums
and ahs. I feel like Annie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   I try to snap awake before jabbing at ``The Ninth Gate,'' a
wannabe thriller set in the always exciting world of rare book
collecting. The plot _ if that's the word for it _ has something to
do with a Satanic text illustrated and autographed by Lucifer
himself. (It's a limited edition.)
</P>
<P>
   I put on a waxy smile as I sense my TV career waning. Gamely, I
begin: ``My idea of hell used to be four blank walls and a radio
that only picked up `A Prairie Home Companion.' ... Ebert turns his
thumb down, too. I briefly consider reversing myself and giving
``The Ninth Gate'' its only favorable review. While I consider,
Ebert jabbers on and time runs out.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember the name of the final film. I have a feeling
Ebert liked it, and I didn't. Or maybe it was the other way around.
I do remember a producer hurriedly ushering me off the sound stage,
out the studio and into a waiting taxi.
</P>
<P>
   He called me at home the next day. ``Sorry, but we can't run the
segment,'' he said funereally. ``It's way too ... disjointed.''
</P>
<P>
   I think the footage ended up thumbs down in Lake Michigan.

AFTER `MILLIONAIRE' DEBACLE, FOX MAPS PROGRAMMING CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping a last official hand-rinse eliminates any lingering tar
left by the ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire'' fiasco, the
Fox Network is moving away from violent pets, crashing trains and
deadly swarms of insects and toward ghosts, UFOs and Egyptian
mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Fox executives put word out Wednesday about the results
of the internal investigation the network commissioned into how
Rick Rockwell, the bridegroom at the center of the marriage show,
had managed to hide the fact that he had been the subject of
restraining orders.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, Fox executives said, absolved both Fox and
the production company responsible for the show, Next
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by a law firm that has often worked for Fox's
parent company, News Corp., , essentially blamed Rockwell for not
fully disclosing his past.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives expressed hope that this would close the book on
the special, which displayed 50 women vying for the hand of a
supposed multimillionaire, which set ratings records for Fox before
blowing up in a surge of bad publicity over Rockwell's background.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the effort to slam that book closed are the
changes that Sandy Grushow, the president of Fox Entertainment, has
ordered in Fox's programming, changes that will be most apparent
starting in two weeks, when the May ratings sweeps month begins.
</P>
<P>
   For the first sweeps month since announcing a policy eschewing
``exploitative specials,'' Fox has announced a list of specials
that include ``Ghosts, Fact or Fiction,'' ``Paranormal: Do You
Believe?'' ``UFOs The Best Evidence Caught on Tape 2'' and
``Opening the Tombs of the Golden Mummies _ Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening the Tombs'' is the special Fox is exhibiting as an
indication of its new direction in sweeps-month programming. It is
the second special Fox has produced in conjunction with the
Egyptian government, both based on the live opening of ancient
tombs. This one, however, is being planned with a consciously more
serious intent, starting with the host, the former ABC News anchor
Hugh Downs.
</P>
<P>
   One element of the show will involve the investigation of a
so-called prophecy, issued, Fox executives say, by several seers.
The seers predicted that an official hall of records, which might
house items like the blueprint for the pyramids, might be in a
chamber under one of the Sphinx's paws.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts special will purport to display videotape evidence of
``allegedly ghostly phenomena.'' The paranormal special will
include psychics and seances.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such tabloid touches, these shows are a far cry from
what Fox was offering in the last May sweeps, which included ``When
Good Pets Go Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   They also represent a sharp departure from some of the specials
that might have showed up in May had Grushow not ordered them
canceled in the aftermath of the multimillionaire scandal, like
``Plastic Surgery Nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Grushow said Fox would no longer be in the business
of offering ``exploitative material.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Fox executive also said the one remaining weekly series
that seemed to fit the genre of crashing vehicles, ``World's
Wildest Police Videos,'' was ``heading for changes in the future.''
At the least, those changes are expected to include a title change
to ``Police Videos.'' &QL;

HALLMARK'S CROWN MEDIA POSTPONES STOCK OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Hallmark Cards Inc. subsidiary that had
been set to sell stock today in one of its companies on the Nasdaq
has put the offering on hold after that exchange's composite index
fell 7.1 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the initial public offering gets the green light, it
will be the first time that people outside the greeting card giant
can own a little piece of Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   The planned IPO is for Crown Media Holdings Inc., an Englewood,
Colo., company that owns three cable television channels with
almost 55 million subscribers around the world. In 1999, Crown
Media lost more than $103 million on revenue of close to $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Media could not say Wednesday when it would reconsider
making the offer. The company is hoping to sell up to 20 percent of
its outstanding stock, or 12.5 million shares. The company is owned
by Hallmark Entertainment Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Hallmark Cards.
</P>
<P>
   The company consists of three cable channels _ Hallmark
Entertainment Network, the Odyssey Network and the Kermit Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Media's cable channels license programming primarily from
a division of Hallmark Entertainment, which includes the Hallmark
Hall of Fame library, the Jim Henson Co. and other third-party
entities. Hallmark Entertainment and the Jim Henson Co. each own
half of the Kermit Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday, when the Nasdaq continued its recent sell-off,
Crown Media expected to offer the stock at $19 to $21 a share. If
the stock sold out at those prices, it would give Crown Media
between $237.5 million and $262.5 million in new capital.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it planned to use the proceeds for a variety of
purposes, including:
</P>
<P>
   $30 million earmarked to pay accrued and unpaid licensing fees
to Hallmark Entertainment Distribution, a subsidiary of Hallmark
Entertainment, for the use of television programs it owns.
</P>
<P>
   $50 million set aside for additional licensing programming,
including about $25 million to license programs from Hallmark
Entertainment Distribution.
</P>
<P>
   $20 million to enhance technical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The rest for expanding distribution and advertising sales staff
and financing other unnamed general corporate expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark will retain 100 percent of Crown Media's class B, or
``supervoting,'' shares, which have 10 votes for each share of
class A stock, the type being sold to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark ``is raising capital without giving any control up,''
said Mark Minichiello, a principal with Spin-Off Advisors in
Chicago. ``Because of the way the deal is structured, there is no
shareholder voice.''
</P>
<P>
   So who would want to buy the stock?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' Minichiello said. ``Probably people
in that industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Minichiello said, is that Crown Media is losing
money, ``and they don't want to pay for those losses out of their
pocket, so they want to raise the money this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Roth of Renaissance Capital Corp. in Greenwich, Conn.,
said the timing for any IPO was bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``All IPOs are going to be a tough sell right now,'' Roth said.
``There is going to be a tremendous liquidity problem with some of
those stocks, even if the fundamentals remain intact.''

SEEKING RESOLUTION, RENO MEETS WITH ELIAN'S MIAMI RELATIVES

<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno came to
Miami on Wednesday evening and met face to face with Elian
Gonzalez's relatives here to try to persuade them to hand him over
peacefully, but left with no agreement to bring an end to a
volatile custody fight that has smoldered since November.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, the country's highest law enforcement official, met with
the boy's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and other family members at a
neutral site _ the gated Miami Beach home of Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, president of Berry University. The Roman Catholic nun
opened her home to a January meeting between the 6-year-old boy and
his grandmothers from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ``is planning to work out a resolution,'' said Myron
Marlin, a spokesman for Reno, in a meeting with reporters in
Washington on Wednesday afternoon. ``She realizes it is a tall
order, but believes she may be the one who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno left after a meeting of two and a half hours. At a news
conference Wednesday evening, O'Laughlin said no agreement had been
reached and the family's lawyers would continue their talks with
Reno by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's effort appeared to be a true last-ditch attempt at
winning cooperation from the family, which has resisted previous
appeals from Justice Department officials to work out a peaceful
plan for handing over the boy. Doris Meissner, commissioner of the
U.S. immigration and naturalization service, accompanied Reno.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno and Gonzalez family members met behind closed doors,
Justice Department officials held off delivering a letter to the
family that would have required them to hand the boy over to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Reno delivered no letter to the family and gave them no deadline
for the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Reno may have been swayed by the relatives'
passion, O'Laughlin replied, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to know how it will turn out at this point,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Reno listened attentively to the relatives' pleas
and took notes. The family reiterated to her that it wants Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to travel to Miami to see his son.
``She was very respectful and they were very honest,'' O'Laughlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Elian bounced from lap to lap. He even
crawled into Reno's lap, O'Laughlin said. ``He was precious with
her,'' she said, adding that the boy is more at ease now that he is
away from the heated atmosphere in Little Havana. ``He has some
space and some quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives, the nun said, told Reno repeatedly they wanted to
be a family again.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to have Elian's Miami relatives travel to Washington
to meet with the boy's father Wednesday morning fell through late
Tuesday night when the boy said that he did not want to go, said
Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel Gonzalez came to the United States expecting to be
given custody of his son,'' said Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for
Elian's father. ``He has been here for seven days and Elian is
still in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The custody standoff has grown more tense almost from the minute
Elian stepped on dry land. He was found floating on Thanksgiving
Day in an inner tube in the Atlantic after his mother and 10 others
drowned in a failed crossing from Cuba. The boy's Miami relatives
and much of the Cuban exile population in South Florida have
refused to send him back to a communist dictatorship that his
mother died to escape. But the boy's father has insisted on his
son's return and many people, especially outside Miami, agree that
he has the right to speak for his child.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez requested that he, his wife, Angela, their
daughter Marisleysis and Elian leave their house in Miami's Little
Havana on Wednesday _ and the throngs of demonstrators and dozens
of reporters and camera crews _ for the less stressful atmosphere
of O'Laughlin's waterfront home on Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sensed a need to have some space,'' O'Laughlin said
earlier in the day, adding that Elian seemed much at ease there.
Elian and his Miami relatives apparently planned to stay the night,
if not longer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the family seemed resigned to handing over Elian,
she said: ``I think the family is becoming more reconciled and
facing what, perhaps, could be pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the family was joined at the nun's house by two of their
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   If family members expected to be free of the demonstrators who
have gathered outside their home for months, they were
disappointed. '
</P>
<P>
   Police stood in front of demonstrators as Reno arrived and
police cars lined the streets and surrounding areas. Two police
boats patrolled a canal behind the house.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, the crowd swelled to about 400 and became
more agitated. Demonstrators chanted a rhyme in Spanish, ``Reno,
you coward! Miami is on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, the demonstrators had been just steps away,
but on the beach, demonstrators were much farther from the house.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the demonstration, Ramon Saul Sanchez, staged a
sit-in on one of the main causeways linking the beach to the
mainland when rafters from Cuba were sprayed with a water cannon by
the U.S. Coast Guard last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez said only that ``the plan is that we pray. We pray
that the family can come together and work it out among themselves.
That would be the best thing for them, for the boy, and the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she hoped the change of scenery would help, no
matter when and how the boy's transfer would come about.
</P>
<P>
   The government-appointed psychiatrists and psychologists who
spoke to Lazaro Gonzalez about the best way to hand the boy over
said that Elian has the love of two families, but their
disagreements are hurting the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family in Miami needs to solve this in a positive and
constructive way,'' said Jerry Wiener, emeritus professor in
residence at psychiatry and pediatrics at George Washington
University School of Medicine. ``They are blaming the kid for
something they just don't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiener said the meeting between the boy's father and the Miami
relatives, which was canceled late Tuesday, had offered promise,
``but it was very discouraging the meeting was called off.''
</P>
<P>
   That meeting, arranged by Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., was
not intended as a handover of the boy but as a chance for both
sides to meet and try to come to a compromise, in the boy's best
interest, said Jorge Mas Santos, who heads the Cuban American
National Foundation in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But at midnight, Lazaro Gonzalez said Elian had told him he did
not want to go, and that the meeting was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way you deal with a 6-year-old,'' Wiener said.

 &HT;    RENO FAILS TO BREAK STALEMATE OVER ELIAN'S RETURN
 &HT;    EDs: New top and revisions throughout 
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ Attorney General Janet Reno failed to break the
stalemate over 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez Wednesday,
despite meeting with the boy and his Miami relatives for nearly
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, there is no agreement,'' said Barry University
President Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, who hosted the meeting at her
Miami Beach home.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Reno reportedly went to the Miami office of
the U.S. Attorney and held a conference telephone call with lawyers
for the family and Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   Reno held out hope that the family might fly to Washington, D.C.
_ perhaps even traveling with her as early as Thursday_ for a
possible meeting with Elian's father, O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family, however, said they wanted Elian's father to
travel to South Florida to meet with them, saying that Elian's
cousin, Marisleysis Gonzales, was still too ill to travel. She has
been Elian's main caretaker, but was hospitalized over the weekend
after suffering from nervous exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Elian played with toys and watched the Cartoon Network while
Reno and the relatives met, O'Laughlin told reporters after the
meeting broke up. Occasionally, she said, Elian sat in the laps of
the adults.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions, which began after a buffet supper, were
described by O'Laughlin as being ``cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Reno nor the Miami family spoke to reporters after the
meeting broke up about 9:30 p.m. (ET).
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father remained in a suburb of the Washington, where he
has been staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat since his arrival
from Cuba last week. He told supporters Wednesday that he has grown
exasperated with the repeated delays in gaining custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'I came here seven days ago, I came to get my boy, I
watch him on TV and they still haven't brought him to me,''' said
the Rev. Joan Brown-Campbell, former head of the National Council
of Churches, who met with Gonzalez Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris
Meissner, Reno arrived in Miami about 6 p.m., hoping to resolve the
standoff peacefully and to avoid sending federal marshals to
retrieve the boy in the face of angry Cuban exile protestors.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have prepared a letter ordering the
family to turn the boy over _ perhaps within days at an airport
north of Miami _ in case the family fails to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But delivery of the letter is apparently still on hold, with the
chance that further negotiations might bring about a family
conference.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin, a personal friend of Reno's, hosted a January
reunion between Elian and his two Cuban grandmothers. The boy and
his Miami relatives moved to her gated home at mid-day Wednesday in
an effort to escape the tension surrounding the family's tiny
Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   Boisterous crowds of Cuban exiles have staged an
around-the-clock vigil outside the home for much of the past week
and have vowed to form a human chain to keep the boy from being
removed.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 protestors jeered as Reno's motorcade pulled up to
O'Laughlin's home at 6:40 p.m., with some holding signs depicting
Reno with devil's horns. Miami Beach police erected metal fencing
to keep the demonstrators on the far side of a divided road in
front of the home, and dozens of officers patrolled the area.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have been unwilling to turn the boy over
without assurances that he would not be quickly taken back to Cuba.
They have also demanded that Elian be allowed to go home with them
after any initial meeting with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of events came after a failed attempt at a family
conference late Tuesday. About 11 p.m., officials from the powerful
Cuban American National Foundation announced that the Miami
relatives would travel to Washington Wednesday with Elian for a
meeting with the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, however, Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales,
backed out, saying that Elian feared his father and that the two
sides apparently misunderstood the terms for the meeting. Gonzalez
said he learned that Elian's father expected the Miami relatives to
turn the boy over before their meeting, and the Miami family
refused to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Although the quickening pace seemed to indicate the standoff
might soon be resolved, there was still a chance for further
delays. Without the family's cooperation, Reno was expected to send
the letter informing them when and where Elian should be turned
over.
</P>
<P>
   If the family failed to abide by the letter, Justice Department
officials said they would probably go to a federal court seeking an
order that they cooperate. It was unclear how long it might take to
obtain such an order.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives might also try a last-second court move,
perhaps asking the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
for an emergency injunction blocking the hand-over. The family's
appeal of their lawsuit in the case is pending in that court,
scheduled to be heard on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   It also remained unclear whether Juan Miguel Gonzalez would
remain in the U.S. once he is reunited with his son. He has said he
would be willing to stay pending the legal appeal if the Miami
family voluntarily turned over his son, and if an entourage of
Elian's teachers, classmates and others could join him from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   According to members of a team of mental health experts
appointed by Reno to help ease the boy's transition, Reno and INS
officials want both sides of the family to go to a secure, neutral
location for an extended reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``INS proposed that the families come together at a neutral
location without any outside people present and that they might
remain together for one or two weeks,'' Dr. Jerry Wiener told CNN.
Wiener and the other team members met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez
last weekend and briefly with Elian's Miami relatives on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian would see that some peace would be made, and the Miami
family would be able to continue to have a relationship with him,''
Wiener said.
</P>
<P>
   But even after their meeting with Reno, the Miami family seemed
to be holding to its position that they wouldn't readily turn the
boy over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said before the meeting that she felt the family was
``becoming more reconciled'' to the likelihood they might lose
their fight over the boy. Afterwards, she still held out hope for a
peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely believe that with all the concern and prayer in
this community that there will be a peaceful and nonviolent
solution,'' she said.

   BUCHANAN WOOS HOFFA: Patrick Buchanan, who is seeking the Reform
Party's presidential nomination, suggested Wednesday that he might
give James P. Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters' union, an
important position in trade negotiations if Buchanan is elected
president. Appearing at a Teamsters' rally in Washington, where
more than 3,000 union members protested a China trade bill,
Buchanan had kinds words for Hoffa, who shares many of Buchanan's
hard-line views on trade. In a reference to the U.S. trade
representative, Buchanan said, ``If I get there, it won't be
Charlene Barshefsky sitting down in Beijing, it'll be Jim Hoffa.''

   McCAIN TO BOYCOTT FUND-RAISER: Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said
Wednesday that he would boycott an enormous Republican fund-raising
gala to be held here on April 26 in honor of the party's presumed
presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. But the reason cited by
McCain, who was Bush's main rival in the primaries, was not sour
grapes. It was ``soft money,'' the unregulated donations to
political parties that McCain has been trying for years to banish.
Much of the $15 million that the event is expected to raise falls
into that category, and for that reason, McCain said, he will be
taking a pass.

   BUSH AD ON YAHOO!: For months, Gov. George W. Bush has had a
link on his Web site (www.georgewbush.com) called a tax calculator.
You put in your marital status, number of children, annual income
and percentage of income from a second earner, and it tells you how
much you would save under Bush's proposed $483 billion tax cut.
With tax returns due on Monday, the Bush campaign has begun to
advertise the tax calculator on Yahoo!, the popular Internet
portal. A caution: The calculator only accepts income up to
$100,000; more than half the savings under the Bush plan would go
to taxpayers with incomes above that.

   IN LINE FOR ARCHER'S SEAT: Since the creation of west Houston's
7th Congressional District in 1965, the seat has been held by only
two men _ both Republicans _ former President George Bush and Rep.
Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who is
retiring this year after 30 years in office. The third person to
hold the seat will very likely be state Rep. John Culberson. In a
Tuesday night runoff, Culberson crushed his well-financed opponent,
Peter Wareing, to capture the Republican nomination. Wareing, a
Houston businessman, reportedly spent more than $3 million, four
times what Culberson spent. But the big money was not enough to
overcome Culberson's grass-roots organization, as he collected 60
percent of the vote to Wareing's 40 percent. In one of the most
reliably Republican districts in the country, Culberson is expected
to win easily in November.

   MISSTEP FOR FLORIDA SENATE HOPEFUL: In going after the
Republican nomination in this year's contest for Florida's open
Senate seat, Rep. Bill McCollum, who was one of the House managers
of President Clinton's impeachment trial, has raised more than $3.5
million, three times as much as the other primary contender, state
Education Commissioner Tom Gallagher. But McCollum is paying a
price for one of his most recent cash-raising efforts _ a letter to
Spanish-speaking voters in which he wrote about the international
custody battle over Elian Gonzalez, accusing Fidel Castro of
``politically manipulating the life of this small 6-year-old boy.''
That pitch struck Bob Poe, the chairman of the Florida Democratic
Party, as political manipulation on the part of McCollum, and he
accused the congressman of seeing ``dollar signs in Elian's
tragedy.'' Then the editorial writers of The St. Petersburg Times
weighed in, accusing McCollum of ``breathtaking cynicism'' and
adding, ``Castro should send a letter complaining that the
congressman has stolen his idea.''

   HOT ISSUES IN VIRGINIA: Taxes and education are the latest hot
issues in the Virginia Senate race, in which George Allen, the
state's former governor, is trying to unseat Charles S. Robb, the
two-term incumbent Democrat. Last Friday, Allen, a conservative,
proposed a 10-year, $345 billion education package, whose
centerpiece is a $1,000-a-year tax credit for such educational
expenses as computers, books and tutoring. Then on Monday, Allen
proposed a 10-year, $278 billion tax package that would end the
so-called marriage tax penalty and the inheritance tax and also
provide a tax break for long-term care of the elderly. Robb said he
had already proposed or endorsed each of those forms of relief and
that Allen was becoming a ``political kleptomaniac.''

COST OF HANFORD CLEANUP COULD DOUBLE, SAY OFFICIALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ The already astronomical cost of treating
millions of gallons of radioactive waste at the Hanford Nuclear
Reservation could nearly double, threatening to again delay the
long-awaited cleanup, federal officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   BNFL, Inc., the lead contractor at the former nuclear weapons
production facility, recently told the U.S. Department of Energy
that it seriously underestimated the cost of cleaning up decaying
underground tanks that hold most of the world's high-level nuclear
wastes.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the company estimated the cost at just under $7
billion. Now, it says the price go as high as $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't justify the original cost estimate,'' said Mike
Lawrence, BNFL's Hanford waste treatment project manager. ``It was
flat wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy officials, meanwhile, said BNFL officials are flat wrong
if they think the agency and Congress will accept that kind of
price hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing it at the numbers we have now is pretty heavy lifting,''
said Richard French, manager of Energy's Office of River
Protection. ``Doing it at these new numbers is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   French said the Energy Department will decide how to proceed
after it gets a detailed proposal from BNFL on April 24. If it
rejects the proposal as too costly, the department has other
alternatives, including finding another contractor, French said.
</P>
<P>
   But that could mean missing deadlines recently set by the state
Department of Ecology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts them in serious jeopardy,'' French said. ``It's not to
say it's impossible, but it would take extraordinary action on the
part of the Energy Department.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials and members of Washington's congressional
delegation Wednesday expressed concern about the cost increase, but
said they would withhold judgment until BNFL presented its
proposal. Lawrence said the company could trim the price to about
$9 billion by restructuring the financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary concern has been not on how it was funded or
financed, but with getting the (treatment) plant in the ground and
running,'' said Mike Wilson, manager of the state Ecology
Department's nuclear waste program.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford has 54 million gallons of radioactive waste in 177 large
steel-and-concrete underground storage tanks, and 67 tanks are
suspected to have leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden jump in the cost of treating tank waste is the latest
impediment in the decade-long Hanford cleanup effort. It also
renewed criticism of Energy's approach in removing dangerous
liquids that threaten groundwater supplies and the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Energy opted for privatization. BNFL would invest about
$400 million and secure private financing to build and operate a
treatment facility, with the promise of returns of 35 to 40
percent. The federal government would not have to pay the company
until the start of treatment, which turns the waste into glass for
long-term storage.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is scheduled for full operation in 2009, with cleanup
completed in 2028.
</P>
<P>
   BNFL in 1998 estimated the cost at about $6.9 billion, and
launched the design of the facility that will encompass four major
buildings on 67 acres. The company also was to refine its estimates
and present a firm price. Energy officials said the approach would
avoid cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, the BNFL manager, said the company realized its
original estimate was too low as it developed the technology and
the design became more detailed. The process of turning volatile
waste into stable glass has been used before, but never on the
scale required at Hanford, Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most technical, challenging job in the country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   BNFL estimates that about half the $13 billion would come in the
cost of interest on longterm financing. By paying down the debt
earlier, the cost could be cut to about $9 billion, Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   BNFL already has invested some $300 million on design and
testing, Lawrence said. Come April 24, he said, the company will
propose a facility that can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with Energy, the federal government will
have to pay BNFL for its costs so far, regardless of whether it
accepts the BNFL proposal. French, the Energy Department official,
said his agency will thoroughly test the cost figures before
deciding whether to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the privatized approach said Wednesday the huge jump
in the estimated price has proved they were right two years ago
when they branded it a boondoggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise we're looking at a failure and a mess,'' said
Tom Carpenter, nuclear oversight director of Government
Accountability Project, a citizens' watchdog group. ``I just wonder
if this company knows what they're doing.''

   Advanced Micro Earnings Sharply Exceed Forecasts
</P>
<P>
   Driven by strong sales of its Athlon microprocessors, Advanced
Micro Devices posted first-quarter earnings that were nearly double
Wall Street's recently revised estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro reported earnings of $189.3 million, or $1.15 a
share, sharply exceeding Wall Street expectations of 58 cents a
share. Before Advanced Micro reported the results, its shares
closed at $68, down 31.25 cents. In after-hours trading, they
surged as high as $76. Analysts said the results could help
stabilize the Nasdaq and technology stocks in general, especially
if other companies meet or exceed estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro's growth was all the more startling on a day when
a key analyst reduced his estimates for Microsoft, citing slower
than expected personal computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's Denies It Fixed Prices

VALUE OF ELECTIVE CAESARIAN SECTIONS UP FOR DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Overland Park, Kan., obstetrician James
Mirabile has been getting requests from some pregnant patients
lately to have Caesarean deliveries, even though they have no
medical need for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, the idea would have been medical heresy.
The nation's obstetricians were performing far too many Caesarean
sections, public health experts and insurance companies agreed. The
numbers had to come down.
</P>
<P>
   But Mirabile says he'd be willing now to entertain patients'
requests for elective C-sections.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they're aware of the risks associated with surgery
_ and this is major surgery _ you have to advocate for your
patient,'' he said. ``I think as more women become vocal about
their health care, as they look at alternatives, this is going to
become more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mirabile's patients have asked for is becoming a topic of
impassioned debate among parents and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, the wisdom of elective Caesareans will be
debated at a two-day conference sponsored by Truman Medical Center
that will draw obstetricians from around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that women should be offered the choice of Caesarean
section is an extreme position for which there is no scientific
basis and no precedent in medical history,'' said Marsden Wagner, a
Washington perinatologist and former World Health Organization
official.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue in publications like the New England Journal of
Medicine that efforts to lower the Caesarean section rate may be
seriously injuring mothers and babies.
</P>
<P>
   Others even say an elective Caesarean is now no more hazardous
than a normal vaginal delivery and ought to be a woman's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other medical condition we give the patient the options
to deal with it. This is the only area where we deny the patient
the choice,'' said W. Benson Harer Jr., president-elect of the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of the procedure, it's the principle of a
woman's right to control her body,'' Harer said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say this idea is preposterous. Caesareans remain
risky operations that ought to be done only to maintain the
well-being of mother or infant. In most situations, vaginal
deliveries are far safer.
</P>
<P>
   Harer, chief of staff of Riverside County Regional Medical
Center in California, brought the elective C-section issue to the
fore in a front-page editorial in the current ACOG Clinical Review.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed that the risks, benefits and costs of Caesarean
section and vaginal delivery were so balanced that perhaps it was
time to give women the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Harer said recent research suggests vaginal deliveries could
cause pelvic damage that makes women more prone to urinary and
fecal incontinence, sexual problems and to a downward slippage of
the uterus called prolapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an enormous problem with older women with organ
prolapse and incontinence,'' he said. ``This frequently doesn't
show up until after menopause. The incidence is vastly higher in
women who have given birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said these kinds of risks, however, are most common among
women who have delivered four or more children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They exaggerate the possible risk of vaginal birth and they
underestimate the risk of Caesarean,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   In a Caesarean section, the baby is delivered through incisions
in the mother's abdominal wall and uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Common reasons for a Caesarean section include prolonged labor
in which the baby does not progress through the birth canal;
infections, such as herpes, that a mother can pass to her baby
during a vaginal delivery; and multiple births that make vaginal
delivery risky.

   ... make vaginal delivery risky.
</P>
<P>
   Woman who have C-sections run the usual hazards of major
surgery: infections, injury to internal organs, neurological damage
from anesthesia. The risk of death is significantly higher than for
a vaginal delivery.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1988, the rate of Caesarean sections in the United
States rose from 5 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors attributed the rise to fears of malpractice
lawsuits and to the frequent use of fetal monitors, which can
inaccurately indicate that a baby is in distress.
</P>
<P>
   As one of its Health People 2000 goals a decade ago, the
Department of Health and Human Services included lowering the
Caesarean section rate nationwide to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With Caesareans running an extra $3,000 in surgical costs per
delivery, the estimated savings by reaching that goal were $1
billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, the Caesarean rate inched steadily lower,
declining to 20.7 percent of all births in 1996. But new federal
statistics show the decrease may have bottomed out. By 1998, the
rate had crept up a bit to 21.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the efforts to lower the C-section rate may be harming
both mothers and babies, Harvard Medical School obstetrician
Fredric Frigoletto said.
</P>
<P>
   In an article last year in the New England Journal of Medicine,
Frigoletto and other health experts looked at relatively rare, but
potentially disastrous complications that may be occurring more
frequently as doctors perform fewer Caesareans.
</P>
<P>
   One potential risk is vaginal deliveries by women who have had
prior C-sections. Although vaginal births after Caesareans are safe
for most women, in about 1 percent of cases they can cause the
uterus to rupture along the surgical scar. The rupture could prove
fatal to the baby and require a hysterectomy for the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Frigoletto studied data from hospitals in four states and found
that uterine ruptures increased during the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   While the data don't include injuries to babies, Frigoletto said
that could be significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the fetal mortality rate is greatly understated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frigoletto also found evidence that obstetricians are performing
more vaginal deliveries with forceps or vacuum extraction. The
stress can cause skull fractures and bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many babies need to be permanently damaged or lose their
life, how many women need to lose their reproductive capabilities
before the pendulum has swung too far?'' Frigoletto said.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner took issue with Frigoletto's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In vaginal deliveries after Caesarean, the risk of uterine
rupture is significant only among women whose labor is induced by
drugs that cause intense contractions, Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   The risks of forceps and vacuum extraction, he said, have become
a problem because doctors use them too often.
</P>
<P>
   An issue rarely raised by physicians is the psychological effect
of Caesareans, said Anita Woods, president of the Kansas City
chapter of the International Caesarean Awareness Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of women come to ICAN because they are devastated.
They feel confusion, anger, disappointment,'' Woods said. ``Some
women use the word rape, feeling violated by so many interventions.
There is a complete loss of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' first child was delivered by Caesarean. Since then she
has had two vaginal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not feel I gave birth to my first child,'' Woods said.``I
had my son surgically removed.''
</P>
<P>
   After 12 hours of labor, Woods had not completely dilated. Her
doctor told her she needed a C-section.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I was cheated,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have asked obstetrician Mirabile about having a
C-section ``think it's an easier way to have a baby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The women usually lose interest in elective Caesareans after
learning insurance probably would not cover the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, for example, will not
pay for a Caesarean section unless there is a medical reason for
it, said Frank J. DiTirro, the company's chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To proceed with Caesarean as a choice doesn't meet the
standard of medical care,'' DiTirro said. ``I would suspect the
majority of managed care companies and physicians would have a hard
time justifying it.''

RENO, ELIAN'S RELATIVES FAIL TO AGREE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Attorneys met late into the night Wednesday and the
letter from federal officials ordering the Miami relatives of Elian
Gonzalez to hand over the boy Thursday morning went undelivered for
a second day.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno traveled to Miami Wednesday to
personally seek cooperation in reuniting the 6-year-old with his
Cuban father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the father's lawyer to end the 4{ month
custody battle, Reno and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner met for three hours with
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, his attorneys and other
family members but ended the talks apparently without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Meissner left the meeting without issuing a statement.
But Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, at whose Miami Beach home the meeting
was held, said afterward that there had been no resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would like Juan Miguel to come here to meet with them and
to become reunited with each other,'' she said of the relatives'
bargaining stance. ``There was no letter handed over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no deadline but she (Reno) had made suggestions that
the family might travel to Washington tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Reno was continuing meetings late Wednesday with
the family's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said Elian, who was given over to his uncle after he
was rescued at sea on Thanksgiving Day, was present at the meeting.
Elian's mother was fleeing Cuba for the United States with Elian
when the boat they were in sank and she drowned.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington the father's lawyer, Gregory Craig, told
reporters: ``It is time for the Justice Department to instruct
Lazaro Gonzalez to follow the law and do the right thing. This son
needs his father.'' He said that while Juan Miguel Gonzalez had
come to the United States expecting to take custody of his child,
he had now been here for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Reno came to Miami with a letter instructing the family to bring
the boy to Opa Locka Airport north of Miami at 9 a.m. Thursday for
the trip to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come to a cooperative agreement, then there might not
be a need for the letter,'' said Maria Cardona, U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   If no agreement could be reached, Reno was expected to
personally deliver the letter. Reno met with Gonzalez and his
daughter, Marisleysis, at O'Laughlin's home where they had sought
refuge and where a meeting between the boy and his two grandmothers
was arranged last January.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of the meeting, U.S. immigration
officials expect the boy to be reunited with his father as early as
Thursday afternoon, perhaps in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's visit came after a bizarre turn of events Tuesday night
when U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., brokered a deal between
Craig, the attorney representing the boy's father, and the Cuban
American National Foundation, an anti-Castro group based in Miami.
At a Washington news conference late Tuesday, Jorge Mas Santos,
foundation president, announced that the great-uncle, two other
family members and Elian would travel to Washington Wednesday to
meet with the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   Then, less then two hours later, Lazaro Gonzalez emerged from
his Little Havana home to announce to the small crowd of supporters
that he was canceling the trip because the boy did not want to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were certainly trying to facilitate this meeting happening
but we were not expecting to find Lazaro Gonzalez come out late
last night and call off the meeting,'' Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was greeted with shouts of ``Liberty for Elian'' from about
300 demonstrators who had gathered outside O'Laughlin's home. The
crowd was not overly hostile to Reno, though one woman held up a
sign that read, ``Janet Reno how can you decide Elian's future when
you killed so many children at Waco, Tx.``
</P>
<P>
   One demonstrator, Moses Delval, had mixed feelings about Reno's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very courageous for her to accept,'' Delval said. ``And
we are thanking her for that. I believe she is applying justice and
applying God's wisdom in the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez of the Democracy Movement, which has led a
campaign of civil disobedience in support of Elian remaining in the
United States, reiterated that Miami's Cuban exile community will
abide by the family's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have consistently asked the people that we must respect
what the family wants to do regardless of whether that is something
that is not what people have been advocating will happen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also faulted Elian's father for not coming to Miami to
meet with his relatives, and suspects that he has not done so
because of orders from Cuban President Fidel Castro.

 PLANETRX SCARES INVESTORS  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR;   &LR; When PlanetRx said Wednesday it would have an
announcement after the markets closed, jittery investors assumed
the worst and hammered the online pharmacy's stock to an all-time
low.
</P>
<P>
   But the news turned out to be benign: The company said its
president, Michael Beindorff, would become chief executive, while
the current CEO, William Razzouk, would remain as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The stock's plunge _ it was down 20 percent on a day when Nasdaq
slumped 7 percent _ reflects Wall Street's increasing distaste for
e-tailers after weeks of hearing that various Internet stores are
on life support. Exacerbating Wednesday's reaction, earlier in the
day Web site Redherring.com reported that Healthshop.com, a San
Francisco holistic health site, was shuttering its e-commerce
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``B2C is dead on Wall Street,'' said Caren Taylor, vice
president at E-Offering, an online investment bank in San
Francisco. ``In this sort of market, people will believe the glass
is half empty, not half full.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor and others said that PlanetRx has some encouraging
developments coming up, while the CEO of Healthshop said he still
hopes to salvage his firm by finding a buyer or merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``PlanetRx is being painted with the same brush as other B2C
companies, even though it is an exceptional company with good
strategy and management,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at its current burn rate, the South San Francisco,
Calif., firm's money could dry up this year, she said. In the
fourth quarter, PlanetRx lost $52.17 million on $5.1 million in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Beindorff said the firm will work to moderate
its spending rate without sacrificing growth. ``We're not going to
take a machete and slice and dice everything we're doing,'' he
said. But even with belt-tightening measures, ``we're going to have
to deal with the financing issue sometime during the course of this
year,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Beindorff said the company's first-quarter results, to be
announced Tuesday, would reflect ``significant ramp-up'' from its
relationship with Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager that
acts as the HMO middleman for prescriptions for 40 million
individuals. Express Scripts bought 20 percent of PlanetRx in
October and made the company its exclusive Internet pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Beindorff also said PlanetRx is in ``intense negotiations'' with
potential brick-and-mortar partners. ``We have concluded a physical
distribution network is important to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After falling $1 to $4, PlanetRx edged up 3 cents in after-hours
trading. Since hitting $26 the day after its October IPO, the stock
has fallen steadily. Rival Drugstore.com closed Wednesday at $8.25,
down $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   At Healthshop.com, CEO and founder Glenn Zweig said the board
had decided to discontinue selling products and lay off a
substantial number of its 70 employees.
</P>
<P>
   It is continuing to operate as a content site, offering
articles, personalized health programs and community services,
while it searches for a buyer or merger partner. ``We didn't want
to get to a point where there was no cash in the bank and we had to
file Chapter 11,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the site, initiated in January 1999, had attracted $31
million in backing _ including an investment by drug giant
Warner-Lambert _ running an e-tailer ``is an incredibly expensive
proposition,'' Zweig said. ``You have to look in the mirror and
say, `Are we there?' We decided it would be wiser to focus on
strategic alternatives.''

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: ENCRYPTION IS BEST BET FOR SENSITIVE DATA FILES  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: &LR;  I'm the ethics chairman at a local psychological &LR; 
 &LR; association. A psychologist's laptop, with case notes in it, &LR;   &LR; was
stolen. with case notes in it. It was password-protected, &LR;   &LR; thank
goodness. We, rightfully, have very strict codes &LR;   &LR; concerning
client confidentiality. But I'd like to know whether &LR;   &LR; the thief
can get into the protected material. And are there &LR;   &LR; other ways to
enhance security? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You didn't mention what kind of password protection
you're using. If it's just the log-on password that comes with
Windows, I'm afraid I have bad news for you. That password is just
for individual settings so that more than one person can have a
personal desktop on the same computer. You can bypass the password
and access the desktop _ and the files _ simply by clicking cancel
in the log-on dialog box.
</P>
<P>
   To really protect your data files, you should encrypt them, just
like they do in the spy movies. There are lots of encryption
programs out there, ranging from shareware to industrial-strength
commercial products such as Network Associates' PGP, which stands
for pretty good privacy. (There's a free version of PGP, but it's
only for noncommercial use.) Once a file is scrambled with a good
encryption program, only the person who has the software ``key''
can decrypt it. And, trust me, a garden-variety laptop thief won't
be able to break the encryption.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Q: My company recently installed Office 2000. In each program
within the suite, the pull-down menus are truncated to show only
the most recently used functions. At the bottom of the menu, a
little, double-down arrow allows me to expand the menu and see all
the functions, but it's annoying. I want all of the available
functions in each pull-down menu to be shown at all times. Can I do
this?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Can you do this? Is Paris a city? To make expanded menus
the default, do this: Go to the Tools menu in any Office 2000
program and choose Customize. Now tab over to the Options page. In
the section on Personalized Menus and Toolbars, uncheck the box
labeled ``Menus show recently used commands first.'' Now click
Close. From now on, you'll see nothing but long menus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My PC at home is unable to play some of the more
graphics-intensive CDs like the new Disney ``Toy Story 2 Action
Game.'' I was told that my video card has only 2 megabytes of
memory, and the game requires 4. Does this mean I need a new video
card? If so, where can I get one, and can I install it myself? My
system runs on a Pentium II chip and Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: Video memory is just like regular computer memory. Every
time you think you have enough, somebody comes up with a product
that gobbles up more. Many of today's shoot-'em-up action games can
use 16 or even 32 megs of video memory.
</P>
<P>
   The video memory in your PC may be embedded on the motherboard,
or it may be on a removable video card. Either way, it may be
possible to simply add video memory, so the first thing to do is
contact the PC maker about that. If it's not possible to upgrade
the video you already have, then it's time to buy a new 3-D card _
which you can easily install
</P>
<P>
   Before you go shopping, though, open up your PC to make sure
there's a place to put the card. You'll need an open PCI or AGP
expansion slot (if you already have a video card, you can use its
slot. The PCI slots are the white ones, which all newer PCs have.
The AGP slot is smaller, usually black or brown, and it's located
just above the PCI slots. You may or may not have an AGP slot. If
you do, consider getting an AGP card, because they're designed for
high-speed graphics.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Don't like your keyboard? Why not replace it? Keyboards are a
snap to install _ you just plug them in and maybe load a little
software _ and a good one with the right ``feel'' to the keys can
make working on the PC a lot more comfortable. You can get
keyboards with special keys for quick access to the Internet and
your computer's entertainment features, such as the volume. And
there are several ergonomic keyboards on the market that may help
reduce the risk of stress injuries to your hands and arms. Basic
keyboards start at under $25 and go up from there.

MRS. CLINTON CAMPAIGNS UPSTATE AS GIULIANI CATCHES YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILI CENTER, N.Y. _ ``Rudy decided to cancel today,'' a News 10
television reporter, microphone in hand, shouted to Hillary Rodham
Clinton at a crowded news conference outside a diner here five
miles southwest of Rochester on Wednesday afternoon. ``Is it a
coincidence that you decided to come to Rochester?''
</P>
<P>
   It was not, though Clinton did not quite say that to the
reporter, Elizabeth Chernack of WHEC-TV in Rochester. Instead, the
first lady settled back to swing at this hanging curveball of a
question about Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's abrupt decision to scrap an
upstate campaign swing so he could attend the home opening game of
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm happy to be here,'' Clinton said. ``I have enjoyed
coming to the Rochester area talking about the issues. I'm going to
keep doing that. Traveling all over the state and as many places I
can, as many different settings, talking about what I would do in
the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady never quite stated it, but pretty much everything
she did here on Wednesday _ her fourth upstate visit in six days _
was intended as a reminder of which candidate for the U.S. Senate
had not shown up as promised. She fit in an interview with a
Buffalo News reporter who found himself with unexpected free time,
since Giuliani was not going to be around to interview.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly every opportunity, Clinton managed to slip into her
remarks the number of times she had been upstate and the places she
had visited. And Tuesday night, Clinton, who was supposed to visit
only Buffalo on this trip, added a quick trip to Rochester, which
was the second of two cities Giuliani was supposed to visit. She
stayed just long enough for a glass of iced tea and a sit-down chat
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   At Yankee Stadium, Giuliani brushed off questions about his
absence upstate, saying he had ignored the advice of political
advisers to do what he loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're just talking about raising money, we can raise money
anytime,'' Giuliani said. ``The Yankees don't open every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's schedule was to have included both fund-raisers and
lunches with women who support him.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady on Wednesday avoided a question about whether
she, too, wished she had been at the Yankee opener.

QUESTIONS OF MANAGEMENT DOG JDN REALTY
</HEADLINE>
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First the founder was in charge. But then came an accounting
scandal, and he stepped aside _ sort of. Replacing him were two
executives: his wife and the man who oversaw accounting. But then
another accounting scandal became public on Wednesday, and they
stepped aside, too _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running the company? A member of the board of directors
who has supposedly been overseeing the company's executives since
the day it went public in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This is JDN Realty, an Atlanta real estate investment trust that
was one of the industry's most respected firms. It is also one of
the prime developers for Wal-Mart Stores. But in the last two
months, JDN disclosed that it had been making under-the-table
payments to its own executives, that it improperly billed its two
largest clients, that it defaulted on its loans and that it would
have to restate all of its earnings for five years. Law firms have
filed class-action lawsuits. Its stock has dropped 43 percent since
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you look into this, the stranger it gets,'' said
Patrick S. McGurn, a vice president at Institutional Shareholder
Services, which advises large investors on corporate governance
issues. ``There is so much wrong with this that it's almost the
plot for a satire.''
</P>
<P>
   Management experts say JDN's travails offer a case study of the
problems that can befall a public company that continues to operate
like a private one. And at a time when companies are going public
at a record rate, and many are flouting widely accepted management
guidelines, the lessons are particularly relevant. At the core of
JDN's troubles, corporate governance specialists say, is a board
that is too closely aligned with management to be an effective
advocate for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The directors are a small inbred group _ mostly men who have
business ties to JDN or personal ties to J. Donald Nichols, the
founder, and his wife, Elizabeth. Most have been board members
since the company went public in 1994. The board lacks a nominating
committee.
</P>
<P>
   JDN executives and board members declined to comment. A lawyer
investigating the company on behalf of the board said the directors
had responded aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interests of the shareholders have been paramount in their
minds,'' said John Latham, a partner at Alston &AMP; Bird in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   To analysts and investors, however, JDN's problems _
jeopardizing almost every relationship the company has and
undercutting its financial statements for five years _ are deep
enough that an independent board would have discovered them sooner.
Even after they become public, the company has reacted in ways that
have ensured bad news will continue to dribble out, the critics
say.
</P>
<P>
   In February, for example, Nichols was one of two JDN executives
on a conference call to analysts in which she emphasized that her
husband did not seem to have benefited personally from the
off-the-books payments. And Wednesday, the company said it would
not publish its 1999 earnings by the end of this week, violating a
two-week extension it had received from the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The company also acknowledged that the billing ``discrepancies''
with its two largest customers, Wal-Mart and Lowe's, a home
improvement retailer.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed on Wednesday, Nichols resigned as
chairman, having already stepped aside as chief executive in
February, Latham said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, as one of the two companies JDN wrongly billed for the
construction, leasing and sale of shopping malls, is concerned
about the latest disclosures, said Les Copeland, a spokesman for
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we have to pay something we shouldn't, we take that
very seriously,'' he said. If anything, Copeland added, ``We're
going to overreact to it and manage it very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   After setting up his own firm, Nichols got his first break by
helping Wal-Mart build a store near his boyhood home in Franklin,
Tenn. His real estate business expanded in the 1980s, thanks in
part to Wal-Mart's rise as the nation's biggest retailer. JDN went
public in March 1994, and its stock consistently outperformed other
real estate investment trusts, giving shareholders a 79 percent
return between January 1995 and January 2000. Real estate indexes
returned about 50 percent during that same period.
</P>
<P>
   JDN ``had a superior growth rate and a predictable earnings
stream,'' said Andrew Jones, a real estate analyst at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   The executives did it by establishing solid relationships with
retailers like Wal-Mart, Lowe's and Home Depot. JDN won a
reputation for finishing its projects on time and, seemingly, on
budget. Retailers, Jones said, ``will pay a little bit more for
predictability.'' In the highly leveraged real estate business, a
small amount of additional cash flow makes a big difference to
profits.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, JDN continued to operate with largely the same
board. Until Nichols resigned on Wednesday, it included him and his
wife, along with William B. Green, a bank and real estate executive
who knew the Nicholses from Tennessee, where the couple continue to
live; Craig Macnab, a Nashville financial executive who also once
worked at J.C. Bradford, where Nichols got his start, and one of
the underwriters of JDN's first stock sale; and Haywood D. Cochrane
Jr., a Nashville health-care executive who says he met Nichols
shortly before JDN's initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the two directors who have joined in the last six years, one
is William G. Byrnes, a retired Alex. Brown executive whom Nichols
has praised for the role he played in JDN's public offering. The
other, Philip G. Satre, is the president of Harrah's Entertainment
and also has a Tennessee connection.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence of the coziness between the directors and
executives, critics say, is the lack of a nominating committee.
Without one, the choice of directors often falls solely to the
chief executive. ``That in itself ends up leading to a lot of
cronyism on boards,'' said Ann Yerger, the director of research at
the Council of Institutional Investors.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of public companies in the United States have
nominating committees, according to a study by Korn/Ferry
International, a recruiting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But executives of many public real estate investment trusts,
known as REIT's, often continue to run them more like the private
firms they once were, governance specialists said. As REIT's have
stumbled, investors have turned more attention to their management
structures.
</P>
<P>
   At JDN, management experts said, a more independent board may
not have been able to prevent the off-the-books payments, but it
probably would have responded more forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 14, the company announced that two executives, Jeb L.
Hughes and C. Sheldon Whittelsey, had received $4.9 million in
payments that JDN's earnings statements did not reflect. Many of
the payments, the company said, were approved by Nichols. The
payments, which analysts said could have come in the form of cash
or real estate, ranged from 4 percent to 20 percent of JDN's annual
earnings between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols may have made the payments, Jones at Morgan Stanley
said, in an attempt to retain the executives at a time when private
real estate firms were doing much better, and paying more, than
public REIT's.
</P>
<P>
   The company offered no explanation, however. It did announce
that Nichols was stepping aside as chief executive but that he
would remain chairman, in charge of maintaining ``tenant
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   McGunn, the shareholder adviser, said the company should have
dismissed Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   Latham, the board's lawyer, said the directors chose to weigh
Nichols' mistakes against the importance of his ties to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols' wife and chief financial officer, William J. Kerley,
then took over as co-chief executives, and the board began
investigating the payments, as well as searching for a chief
executive. On Wednesday, Kerley resigned, Nichols returned to her
job as company president, and the board named one of its members,
Macnab _ the former J.C. Bradford employee _ to the top job.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors, meanwhile, are trying to figure out when
the next piece of news will come and what it will contain.

 TAKING THE DESKTOP WITH YOU  &HT;     By BECKY WARING 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How many times have you gone on a business trip
and forgot to transfer some crucial files to your portable? Or
needed to look up a phone number or appointment time but lacked
access to a computer?
</P>
<P>
   A rapidly multiplying class of Internet sites aims to free you
from the constraints of traditional PCs and software by putting
office applications on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The names give the concept away _ nearly all include the word
``desk.'' Desktop.com, MyInternetDesktop.com, FreeDesk.com,
MagicalDesk.com, Visto.com and MyWebOS.com are just a few of the
entries.
</P>
<P>
   These sites typically offer online hard-disk space, e-mail,
calendar, address book, to-do lists and Web bookmarks. Some also
provide full office suites with word processors, databases and
spreadsheets. The key attraction for all is being able to access
your personal data anywhere you can connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While you might assume that since they are Web-based, these
sites are platform-independent, that is not quite true. You can
access most of them from any Windows, Mac or Linux computer, but
most require Windows to get full functionality, such as
synchronizing data with your desktop organizer. The truly versatile
sites also let you look up certain data from cell phones and Palms.
For example, Visto.com's address book, calendar and e-mail can all
be accessed from Web phones.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect that sales of information appliances will
overtake those of PCs within a couple of years, so the ability to
store personal data on the Web will grow rapidly in importance. To
allay concerns about sensitive information residing on a central
server, most of these services provide strong security safeguards
and privacy policies. However, their nature is such that anyone
with your password can access your data, so it's important to
change it frequently and not use common words.
</P>
<P>
   While these sites are usually supported by advertising, many
charge for premium services, such as disk space beyond the usual 10
or 20 megabytes, or a small monthly fee. MagicalDesk charges $5 a
month after a free trial period, which includes 20 MB of storage,
or $10 a month for 50 MB of storage. Visto.com, one of the oldest
and largest desktop sites with more than 800,000 users, offers 15
MB of free space and charges $25 per year for each additional 25
MB.
</P>
<P>
   How well do these sites work? It's hard to argue with the
concept of replacing PC-based application software with Web
equivalents that are always up-to-date, cost practically nothing,
and can be accessed anywhere. However, Bill Gates is in no danger
of losing his day job. The reality of the present offerings is that
they won't displace your application software any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Why? For starters, it usually takes many times longer to
accomplish a task on one of these sites than with regular software.
Just entering a contact or appointment requires clicking through a
bunch of forms, and having to log on to a site and go to the
bookmark page to add one bookmark to your list is just plain silly
when you can accomplish the same task with one click in your
browser. Furthermore, aggregating a wide variety of tasks (from
reading news to storing files) on one page generally means that
none of them are really done well. The Web applications are
rudimentary compared to their PC counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that it is unlikely that you will want to
integrate these sites into your daily routine until they improve in
performance and usability.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the best way to use them is to enter everything in your
usual computer-based personal information manager (PIM), such as
Microsoft Outlook or the Palm Desktop, and synchronize with the Web
version. You can then use the sites for reference while you're on
the road, without the hassles of entering data directly into the
Web site, or dealing with slow Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if there should be an Internet outage or slowdown
just when you need to look something up, you will be out of luck.
But on the whole, data stored on secured Web sites is probably
safer than on your PC (unless you are among the few who actually
back up files!).
</P>
<P>
   Here's an overview of some of the key players.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop.com
</P>
<P>
   Desktop.com is probably the most ambitious undertaking. Founded
by the team behind Four11 and RocketMail (since sold to Yahoo), it
aims to aggregate features of popular Web sites, such as shopping,
search, news and e-mail, with Web-based applications, all on one
platform. Third-party developers can also add applications to the
core set, extending its functionality.
</P>
<P>
   Users can customize their Desktop.com home page by choosing the
search service that will be attached to the search button, the
shopping and news sites that interest them most and so on. Any
needed passwords are stored for you _ a big convenience.
Desktop.com comes in two versions, an ``Express'' version that uses
only HTML for access from any platform, and a full version for
Windows only.
</P>
<P>
   MyInternetDesktop.com
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, MyInternetDesktop.com's claim to fame is that
it works with all major platforms and browsers, and soon on cell
phones and Palms. It doesn't require Java, ActiveX or plug-ins, the
technologies that usually cause compatibility problems. And it also
lets developers add on to its capabilities, like Desktop.com.
</P>
<P>
   That said, MyInternetDesktop's interface is among the least
visually appealing and most cumbersome to work with. The main page
has lists of applications, like e-mail, calendar and address book.
Clicking on these opens each in a separate window, which are easy
to get drowned in.
</P>
<P>
   Visto.com, MagicalDesk
</P>
<P>
   Our favorite sites were Visto.com and MagicalDesk. Both require
Windows to sync data, but they are relatively mature compared to
most sites in this category, and have the best user interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Visto.com emphasizes workgroup collaboration features, such as
file sharing, conference call setup, calendar sharing and so on. It
also offers cell phone access to your address book, calendar, to-do
list and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   MagicalDesk's applications are limited compared to those on most
of the other sites, but they are easy to get at, not to mention
easy to look at. The calendar is by far the easiest to read of all
the sites, and you can customize the display of the home page and
applications to suit your needs.
</P>
<P>
   MagicalDesk also offers MagicalViewer ($5 per month), a program
for Windows and Mac that lets you view 250 different file formats,
even if you don't have the original applications. This is great for
sharing files with others.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; FreeDesk, MyWebOS
</P>
<P>
   FreeDesk and MyWebOS are the two sites we looked at that offer
full office suites. Again, it is hard to imagine using these sites
for everyday work, as opposed to occasionally when traveling. For
example, printing a document in FreeDesk currently requires
downloading and then opening it with Microsoft Word or Excel. And
since both use their own document formats, exchanging files with
others requires importing and exporting, usually to Word or Excel.
</P>
<P>
   FreeDesk and MyWebOS are working hard to add features, but it
will be a long time before they can compare to mature PC-based
office applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest challenge for the office suite sites is probably
the coming competition from Microsoft and Sun. Sun's StarPortal
will offer Java-based apps, and Microsoft, of course, will have the
enormous advantage of file format compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that desktop sites are a great idea that has
yet to be well-implemented. The nature of the Internet is that
sites are thrown up before they are ready for prime time in order
to stake out the territory. They want to grab users before the big
portals, like MSN, AOL, Yahoo and Excite, get into the act.
</P>
<P>
   But the kitchen sink approach of the portals means that there
will still be a need for full-featured, well-designed desktop
sites.

MEDIABYTES: ZDNET SEES BLUE SKIES, DESPITE BREAKUP WITH
CORPORATE  PARENT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The newest Internet media powerhouse looks an
awful lot like an old one. San Francisco's ZDNet, cut loose in the
breakup of tech publishing titan Ziff-Davis, is now on its own.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost inevitable. Ziff-Davis had been lumbering along
with nearly $1.2 billion in debt. It was one of the first so-called
old media firms to issue a tracking stock for its Internet
property, and ZDNet immediately started outperforming its parent.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis then sold off its research division, its magazines,
its ZDTV cable channel and its trade shows (including Comdex), and
what was left was ZDNet: 400 employees around the world, including
160 in San Francisco, publishing one of the top 15 Web
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet will still license content from the former Ziff-Davis
magazines _ such as PC Magazine and SmartBusiness (formerly PC
Computing) _ that built its popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ZDNet faces questions about how it will survive without its
close ties to much of that content, as Shelby Bonnie _ newly
installed CEO of crosstown archrival Cnet _ is quick to point out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of advantages to the integrated Ziff-Davis
company,'' Bonnie said. ``It had publishing assets, online assets,
television assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The ZDNet team had excellent access to other parts of
Ziff-Davis, Bonnie said, and ``the lack of doing that has to be not
as advantageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rosensweig, the CEO of ZDNet, disagreed. ``I don't think
we've lost any of the benefits,'' he said. ``To me, we get the best
of all worlds under this scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does ZDNet keep the Ziff content, but ``what we get is
clarity,'' Rosensweig said, adding, ``clarity breeds a plan. A plan
breeds confidence, and confidence breeds success.''
</P>
<P>
   He proudly points out that ZDNet has already toted up six
consecutive profitable quarters, and he has no plans to follow
Cnet's move to dip into profits for a $100 million ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers on the Net can always be manipulated to make any
argument, but Bonnie makes a persuasive case for Cnet's lead in
traffic over ZDNet. Rather than looking to Media Metrix, which uses
a ranking methodology that rankles many Webmasters, Bonnie looks to
Securities and Exchange Commission filings. After all, the
companies have to stand behind their own numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In their most recent filings, which cited figures from December,
ZDNet boasted 371 million page views for the month, which worked
out to about 12 million per day. Cnet claimed 14.7 million page
views per day, which works out to 455 million for the month.
</P>
<P>
   Rosensweig declined to discuss the competition with Cnet
(although ZDNet Vice President Dan Farber notes that even with
Cnet's advertising blitz, ZDNet still posted 40 percent audience
growth from the fourth quarter over the third quarter).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rosensweig said ZDNet will focus on hammering away at
its mission of serving all tech audiences, from newbies to systems
professionals, and will continue to expand internationally.
</P>
<P>
   I met with Rosensweig last month in a borrowed office at ZDNet's
headquarters in the cavernous former fashion center at Eighth and
Townsend streets. ``This was my office at one moment in time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's based in New York, although he prefers to put it in a
more cyberspace-coy kind of phrasing: ``I am everywhere. I am a
piece of data, traveling over the transom.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means: He gets to San Francisco every couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL ITEMS, BIG DEMANDS: As a father on paternity leave, I
often must bring my baby, Harry, with me on assignment. The folks
at ZDNet were quite accommodating, taking turns holding the
6-month-old little guy while I interviewed Rosensweig.
</P>
<P>
   Rosensweig kept a cell phone the size of a cigarette lighter on
his desk, and it rang several times, interrupting us. Finally I
said, ``Isn't it funny how something so small can run your life?''
</P>
<P>
   Rosensweig pointed at Harry, and said, ``You tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGINE A SANDY BEACH: Brisbane, Calif.'s Imagine Media, the
publisher of Business 2.0 magazine, is on a major expansion drive.
Not only is Business 2.0 doubling in frequency and putting on
conferences, but the company is also launching five new magazines
starting this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to find people, like its competitors at magazines and
dot-coms throughout the Bay Area, Imagine decided that its best
corporate headhunters would be its own employees. It ran an
in-house contest, with the top prize being a trip for two to
Hawaii, for those workers who could recruit the most qualified
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were much more successful than we expected,'' said Steve
Leibman, vice president of human resources. The contest yielded 325
referrals in the first three months of this year, and 48 of those
people were hired. (All told, Imagine hired 105 people in the first
quarter.) New hires came at all levels, from entry level marketing
folks to the vice president for Business 2.0's online business
(that's Nicole Brown, who jumped from Red Herring).
</P>
<P>
   Although Imagine isn't publicly traded in the United States, its
parent company, the Future Network Plc, is on the London Stock
Exchange, and Imagine is thereby able to offer stock options _ a
crucial currency in today's mad recruiting world.
</P>
<P>
   The person who brought in the most applicants was herself a new
hire, Anika Cunningham, who started in December as marketing
manager for the forthcoming Revolution magazine. Revolution will
cover dance culture and technology and will launch July 5 (and is
not to be confused with two other new magazines of the same name _
one from Britain's Haymarket Group that will cover the digital
economy, and one that will serve nurses).
</P>
<P>
   With the zeal of a new convert, Cunningham referred 25 people to
Imagine recruiters; about half were interviewed and four were
hired. Three more are still in the interview process, and she
believes two are on the verge of getting offers.
</P>
<P>
   She's one of five employees who won the Hawaiian trip, and she's
heading there next month to celebrate her boyfriend's birthday. One
of the best perks of the prize: the week away doesn't count as
vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   The contest worked so well that Leibman is keeping it going in
the second quarter. The top five prize-winners will be finalists in
a drawing for a new lime-green Volkswagen Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MORE CONFERENCE: Red Herring does it. Industry Standard does
it. So, maybe to prove its chops as a New Economy magazine,
Business 2.0 is going to do it, too: Put on a conference.
</P>
<P>
   The conferences are generally wildly profitable, drawing hefty
fees from attendees as well as substantial sums from sponsors. But
do Internet economy execs need one more schmooze fest? ``You can go
to one conference a day and never work,'' concedes Michela O'Connor
Abrams, president of Imagine Media's Business Division.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, of course, believes her conference will be worth
attending. Attendance will be limited to 500 people, at $2,495 each
(that's $1.25 million right there), and Abrams plans to sign up 10
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the conferences can pose some ethical
quandaries for journalistic outfits, Abrams said Business 2.0's
October confab in Monterey will draw strict lines: Sponsors won't
get the right to speak or make presentations at the conference, and
the editorial team, led by magazine editor Jim Daly, will speak at
the conference and help determine the content of the panels.
</P>
<P>
   GROK THIS: A popular newsletter among media junkies is the
Industry Standard's Media Grok, which gives pungent critiques of
tech news from various outlets. On Monday, the Grok skewered ``old
media'' for awaiting ``the boom's bust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the sky falling yet?'' The Grok wondered. ``That's not a
story you'll find on new-media sites ...''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really? Wired News on Tuesday led its page with the
headline, ``Why the Bubble's in Trouble.'' And doesn't the Grok
read the Industry Standard, which had a photo of a roller coaster
on its latest cover with the headline: ``The End of the Beginning:
After a gravity-defying run, the Internet business is falling back
to earth ...''

SOME OLYMPIC SPORTS FACING CUT IN FUNDS 
BY RICHARD SANDOMIR  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A plan proposed by the new head of the U.S. Olympic Committee
would redeploy funds to sports that traditionally produce the
highest medal counts, while paring funds to less successful sports.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Blake, the chief executive and secretary general of the
USOC since February, will tell the organization's transition
committee of his plan. If it approves the proposal, Blake is
expected to present all or part of it to the 19-member USOC
executive committee on Friday. ``We have to look at the sports
where the payoffs would be the greatest,'' he said from Boston,
where he will outline his 30-page plan to the committees.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We're not cutting off any sport at the knees. This
is not a cold turkey situation. This will be phased in, and we've
done a lot of homework to understand the infrastructures that will
be needed to keep the sports viable. Some sports will get less
money, but it doesn't mean they won't get enough to survive or
sustain themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake refused to say which sports would endure financing cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``Generally about half would benefit, half would
get less support.'' The USOC provides money to 45 national
governing bodies, 39 of which sanction Olympic sports. For the 1997
to 2000 Olympic quadrennium, the USOC will distribute grants
totaling $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get this money out of thin air,'' he said. ``We're
accountable to our sponsors to show we're spending the money
prudently.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake said there will be degrees of budgetary additions and
cuts, depending on an assessment of where the money would be better
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've ranked sports by capability and medal potential,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He then added that he was looking at the national governing
bodies as ``business partners and the USOC as an investor in them.
We have a portfolio of sports to evaluate in terms of how best to
serve the American public's interest in terms of winning at the
games.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the intention was not to eliminate financing to any
sport, but to redistribute money ``without throwing the baby out
with the bathwater.'' He said the USOC will provide those national
governing bodies with less money with some help in improving their
fund-raising capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is destined to stir debate and rouse criticism. Blake
scoffed at a suggestion that by taking funds from underperforming
sports to enhance the medal potential of already strong sports, he
is fostering a front-runner view.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Williams, a 1968 Olympic biathlete who is the lawyer for the
U.S. Biathlon Association, said, ``We're hoping the leadership of
the USOC will support all sports on the Olympic program including
the sports that are underdeveloped so they'll come to achieve the
success of the developed sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake was hired with a mandate to provide broad change to the
USOC. Since February, he has reviewed the organization's operations
and management, looking to streamline the bureaucracy to make
decisions more timely and eliminate redundancies. As a result, he
is also expected to dismiss employees, most of them in middle
management.

ONE LESSON AT COLUMBIA: NO LYING TO PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It wasn't quite the end of Western Civilization, but
when a Columbia University student lied to get out of his homework,
it did turn into a federal case.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the student is losing.
</P>
<P>
   According to a court ruling published on Wednesday, the student,
Puneet Bhandari, was taking Contemporary Civilization, a required
survey of Western thought from Plato to Marx. It is a demanding
course with lots of reading. Bhandari apparently found the pace
rough.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1998, he came to his professor, Gregory J. Downey
Jr., to ask for more time, wrote Judge John G. Koeltl of the
Southern District Court in a March 24 ruling that was printed
Wednesday in The New York Law Journal. The student told his
professor that he and his brother, Parag, had been in a car that
was struck by a drunken driver. Parag was on life support, the
student said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, he told his teachers that his brother had died.
</P>
<P>
   Downey gave Bhandari all the time he needed, and ultimately he
finished the course. His misfortune brought teacher and student
closer, the judge said, and when Bhandari began applying to medical
school last year, he asked Downey for a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The professor said on Wednesday that he was happy to oblige and
wrote a glowing letter that spoke of how well this good student had
coped with his brother's difficult death. It was the letter that
finally unraveled what the judge called Bhandari's ``egregious''
and escalating lies.
</P>
<P>
   A medical school interviewer asked about his brother, and
Bhandari said he was doing well as an investment banker. Puzzled,
officials at the unnamed medical school inquired at Columbia.
Bhandari acknowledged that he had lied, the judge wrote, and he was
ordered expelled. He appealed to the dean of Columbia College, who
reduced the punishment to a two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Still unhappy, Bhandari _ by now a senior only months from
graduation _ asked the court to block the suspension with a
preliminary injunction. The judge sided with Columbia. ``Mr.
Bhandari's conduct reflected substantial dishonesty over a
prolonged period in dealing with a professor,'' Koetl wrote in a
ruling that dealt only with the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Bhandari's lawyer, Arthur R. Block, said on Wednesdayy evening
that he could not discuss the case without speaking to his client,
who was not available. A Columbia spokesman said that Bhandari was
no longer registered but that the university could not comment on
the case because it was still in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Downey said on Wednesday that he was still unnerved by the
experience, which has made him more suspicious of students and
their excuses. ``Some students will fudge, and some students will
ask for extensions with no story, but I've never seen anything like
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was still not sure if Bhandari has a brother. ``I
have no idea what parts of the story he made up,'' the professor
said. ``It's an amazing case to me.''

FISET MIGHT BE KEY TO KINGS' SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their last playoff memory was the lowering of a broom that swept
them into summer. But they bristle at the notion it could happen
again. Not this year, with a new coach and a new system that a lot
of the same players have embraced like religion.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Los Angeles Kings are a lot like the Lakers, only minus
the tsunami-sized expectations. Never mind that Stephane Fiset has
been as dominant as Shaquille O'Neal down the stretch, no one is
conceding the Stanley Cup trophy to the Kings, who open the
playoffs today at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, first-year coach Andy Murray's minions aren't even
favored to skate into the second round. On paper, the best-of-seven
series against the Red Wings shapes up as a mismatch on par with
Erin Brockovich vs. PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is so deep it has a former league MVP, Sergei Fedorov,
centering its third line. Detroit is so deep the Kings may have to
split up their dynamic defensive duo of Rob Blake and Mattias
Norstrom to try to adequately cover the Red Wings' giant of an
offense.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Kings' claim to fame is they've made the playoffs
in two of the past three years, Detroit can boast of winning two of
the previous three Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit may have history and His Coaching Excellency, Scotty
Bowman, on its side. But we like the Kings' chances because of
Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   He was a nail in the Red Wings' wheel during the regular season,
posting a 2-0-1 record against them. In those games, Detroit
outshot the Kings 102-72 but was outscored 10-6. Fiset's .941 save
percentage against Detroit was proof of what he is capable when he
gets into a tread-sized groove.
</P>
<P>
   A bad wheel took Fiset out of circulation for two weeks in
March. But since returning to action March 23 from a left groin
strain, Fiset has been like cellophane wrap around the goal mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In his last seven appearances, he stopped 185 of 198 shots for a
.934 save percentage. Not coincidentally, the Kings were 4-0-3 in
those games on their way to a momentum-making 5-1-3 finish.
</P>
<P>
   When Fiset makes a stop, it has the same effect as O'Neal
swatting an opponent's shot. It sets the offense in gear and wears
on the opposition. Not to take anything away from Chris Osgood, who
tended the net nicely for Detroit during its 1998 title run, but
the Kings like their goaltender in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two weeks is probably the best I've seen him play,''
said Kings defenseman Rob Blake of Fiset, a member of the Colorado
team that won the 1996 Stanley Cup crown.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Fiset's final seven starts came on the road, so it's
doubtful a jolting Joe Louis crowd will unnerve him much. As
focused as Fiset looked Tuesday during the Kings' final practice
before departing L.A., live octopuses couldn't faze him.
</P>
<P>
   The way Fiset was snaring pucks, it appeared he was the one with
eight arms. ``There wasn't a shot he wasn't trying to get out
there,'' Blake said. ``It didn't matter how out of position he was,
he was trying to make the stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You respect guys who give their all like that every time
they're on the ice,'' Blake added. ``When you see that, you don't
want to let the guy down.''
</P>
<P>
   We're counting on Blake playing much better than he did two
years ago against St. Louis. He contributed nary a goal in that
four-and-out first-round series. It says here he's primed to show a
network audience that Nicklas Lidstrom isn't the best blueliner on
the ice and in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom, we're not worried about. He's the Kings' answer to the
Red Wings' Chris Chelios: Smart, steady and with stamina to spare.
He was the only player on the team to appear in every game this
year, and he led all the Kings' defensemen in plus-minus at
plus-22.
</P>
<P>
   We're expecting a Kevin Elster-like hat trick from Ziggy Palffy,
who should be nice and rested after sitting out the last 12 regular
season games with a sprained shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope his shoulder is healed because he's going to have to
carry the weight of the Kings' scoring load. Of course, after four
full and (futile) seasons of trying to get to the playoffs with the
New York Islanders, Palffy, 27, ought to be able to do double
shifts on adrenaline alone.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille is no stranger to the playoffs, but the 14th-year
veteran does need to re-acquaint himself with the back of the net.
After collecting 24 points during a torrid 15-game point-scoring
streak that ended March 2, Robitaille mustered just four goals in
the final 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille is the franchise leader in postseason game-winning
goals with eight, so he has the muscle memory to make Osgood's life
miserable. If he can't, it may not matter in the end how well Fiset
plays in the net.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this is not the same Fiset whose confidence was
shaken two years ago, first by the St. Louis skaters and then by
then-Kings coach Larry Robinson, who benched him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we can beat them,'' Fiset said, speaking of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings can steal one of the first two games in Detroit,
it's not at all a distant possibility. &QL;

ASSEMBLY ASKS TOUGHER PENALTIES IN SEX CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A proposal that would toughen penalties for
sexual assaults and provide more relief for victims was unveiled on
Wednesday by Assembly leaders, six years after the Senate first
tried to muster support for similar legislation and four years
after Gov. George Pataki joined the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by advocates for victims' rights, the speaker of the
Assembly, Sheldon Silver, outlined a plan that basically addresses
the same issues as those earlier efforts. Both versions would
increase mandatory sentences for a range of sex crimes, including a
maximum life sentence for a person convicted a second time of
sexual relations with a minor, and would eliminate the option of
bail after conviction for a sex-related felony.
</P>
<P>
   But the Assembly's plan also goes a step further by calling for
such costly measures as specialized training for nurses who examine
victims, guaranteed financing every year for rape crisis centers,
more treatment in prison for sex offenders and closer supervision
after their release. It also seeks to increase penalties for people
who entice their victims on the Internet
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a comprehensive bill that goes far beyond what
passed the Senate in terms of its treatment of the Internet, in
terms of its treatment of victims, in terms of its reaching out for
all aspects and all people involved in this field,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has submitted sexual assault legislation every year since
1997, and the Senate has passed it every year. In addition, the
Senate passed its own bills on sexual assaults in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the governor has proposed several minor amendments,
and Senate leaders said they expected to pass it again.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for Pataki, said they were
pleased that the Assembly leaders had decided to take action.
``We're looking forward to seeing the Assembly bill,'' she said.
``We're hopeful the legislature is serious about comprehensive
sexual assault reform, because it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Senate aides cautioned that the Assembly had not yet
finalized its plan in a written bill, they said the differences
between the two proposals appeared to be minor and could be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will agree to a bill before the year is out,'' said
Sen. Dale Volker, a Republican from the Buffalo area.

NEW YORK TO SPEED CONVERSION OF BUSES
</HEADLINE>
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New
York state lawmakers struck a deal on Wednesday that will move the
city's bus fleet _ by far the largest in the country _ much more
quickly away from diesel power and toward cleaner-fuel vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents the most sweeping environmental change in
the history of New York City's transit system, a change long sought
by legislators and clean-fuel advocates and one that many other
U.S. cities have already made.
</P>
<P>
   It came after Democrats in the State Assembly, joined later by
Republicans in the Senate, pressured Gov. George Pataki and the MTA
to make greater strides to clean up emissions from buses, which are
believed to contribute to asthma and other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said that disagreements over how many compressed
natural-gas buses and so-called electric hybrid buses the MTA would
buy over the next five years had become a major sticking point in
negotiations over how to divide $3.8 billion from a transportation
bond act that will be presented to voters in November. About $1.5
billion of that amount is to go to the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, about 44 percent of all buses bought in the
agency's next capital plan will be powered by natural gas or
hybrid-electric technology, in which the wheels are driven by
electric motors that draw their current from a small diesel engine
on board.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement raises the total number of buses the MTA will buy
over the next five years to 1,257 from 1,056. In all, the purchases
will expand the fleet by a little fewer than 100 buses, after buses
are retired and replaced. Officials say the overall capacity of the
bus system will increase about 11 percent, because of plans to buy
more of the large express buses, which provide service between
Manhattan and Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the 11 percent increase in seats, overcrowding
will probably continue to plague the system because bus ridership
has increased 38 percent from 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not move New York nearly as far as many other
large cities, like Los Angeles, Atlanta and Tempe, Ariz., which
have stopped buying diesel buses. Even so, environmentalists hailed
the changes because of the influence New York City's huge fleet has
on bus manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a clear message to the entire diesel industry that it
needs to eliminate its toxic soot emissions or it will be out of
the bus business in New York,'' said Richard Kassel, a senior
lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been
pushing for an end to diesel buses.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also agreed to install special pollution traps, by
2003, on the exhaust pipes of every diesel bus in its fleet _ more
than 3,000 vehicles _ and to use very low-sulfur fuel in the tanks
of all diesel buses. MTA also promised to speed up the retirement
of older diesel buses.

EDITORIAL: BARAK'S PATH TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, April 13:
</P>
<P>
   Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, is engaged in an intricate
balancing act involving the three main elements of his quest for a
Mideast peace settlement. As negotiations with Syria have stalled,
and with Israel's July deadline for withdrawal from Lebanon
nearing, Barak has sensibly shifted his attention to reaching
preliminary agreement with the Palestinians on a peace deal. His
four-hour meeting with President Clinton Tuesday night should help
energize this new negotiating push.
</P>
<P>
   The two men agreed on an accelerated meeting schedule and a
stronger American presence at the bargaining table. Next week
Clinton will meet with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Barak
returns to the United States in late May, shortly before the target
date for an agreement outlining settlement terms on boundaries,
Palestinian statehood, provisions for Palestinian refugees and
Jewish settlements and the future status of Jerusalem.
Working-level talks on these issues are going on outside
Washington. Direct American participation will make it easier to
bridge some of the gaps between the two sides. But the hard
decisions must come from Barak and Arafat. Clinton should use his
meeting with Arafat to press for direct talks between the two
leaders next month.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Clinton also discussed ways to smooth Israel's
departure from Lebanon, which now appears likely to take place
without a Syrian agreement. Barak hopes to minimize the risks by
following the withdrawal provisions of a U.N. resolution that the
Arab world has long endorsed. Israel deserves U.N. cooperation,
including an enhanced role for U.N. peacekeepers in the border zone
Israel will be vacating.
</P>
<P>
   As the Palestinian talks quicken and the withdrawal date from
Lebanon approaches, Israel will be counting on strong support from
the United States. If a peace agreement is eventually signed with
Syria, considerable new American financial aid will be required to
carry out its provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Israel is now needlessly complicating its relations with the
White House and Congress by persisting in its plan to sell an
advanced AWACS airborne radar system to China. The Pentagon rightly
worries that Beijing may one day use this system to support
aggressive military action across the Taiwan Strait. Conceivably,
the airborne radar could be used to track and target American
fighter planes patrolling the strait. Israel should defer to
American objections and freeze delivery of the Awacs-equipped
planes. Barak needs to concentrate his energies on negotiating
peace, not courting unnecessary conflicts with Washington.

MODEM COMPANY GROWING IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET

<TEXT>
<P>
   The company has a hot new technology, ripe for hype, whose
details are understood only by engineering experts. Its stock has
tripled since October and is valued at about 40 times last year's
sales _ despite losing more than one-quarter of its value Wednesday
in a stomach-churning decline.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that short-sellers, who bet against companies
they think are overvalued, believe they have found an easy target
in Terayon Communication Systems, a company based in Santa Clara,
Calif., that is in the hotly competitive business of making cable
modems and other networking equipment. On Tuesday, a conference
call conducted by Terayon executives to discuss first-quarter
earnings turned into a surreal free-for-all as short-sellers using
fake (and juvenile) names repeatedly attacked the company's
honesty.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Terayon is not a stock for the faint of heart. After
soaring from below $50 in early November to a midday high of
$285.25 in early March, the company's stock has plunged. It closed
Wednesday at $119.75, down $43. But even after its recent decline,
Terayon has a market valuation of almost $4 billion, not bad for a
company that is less than a decade old and has never turned an
annual profit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet underneath the mud, Terayon is growing exceptionally fast
and establishing itself as a leader in the market for advanced
cable modems and other communications equipment. In 1997, Terayon
had $2 million in sales. Last year, sales were about $90 million.
Next year, the company's sales could top $500 million, according to
Wall Street analysts who follow the company.
</P>
<P>
   With growth like that in an environment where technology
companies can go from start-ups to profitable giants in a decade,
Terayon cannot be dismissed simply because it is young and losing
money. This year, analysts expect that the company will be
profitable on a cash basis for the first time, although several
noncash charges will wipe out its bottom-line earnings.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Terayon reported first-quarter sales of $59.3
million and profits of $1.9 million, or 6 cents a share, before
one-time charges, up from sales of $15.9 million and a loss of $4.3
million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just aren't too many companies that have this kind of
revenue momentum,'' said Steven D. Levy, a Lehman Bros.
telecommunications equipment analyst, who calls Terayon a buy, his
highest rating. ``In a market where we're paying for growth, it is
very reasonable that this stock has gone up as much as it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Terayon's main business is making cable modems, the boxes that
enable consumers to connect to the Internet at very high speeds
over standard cable lines. With Internet users looking for faster
access to bandwidth-hogging music and multimedia applications, the
cable modem market is exploding. Kinetic Strategies, a research
firm based in Phoenix, estimates 15.9 million cable modems will be
installed in North America by the end of 2003, up from 2 million
today. Companies vying for a piece of the market include Broadcom,
Nortel Networks, Motorola and even Cisco Systems, all much bigger
than Terayon.
</P>
<P>
   But Terayon supporters say the company has an edge over its
competitors in the cable modem business, thanks to a superior
technology. Most other companies use a method known as TDMA, or
time division multiple access, to transmit data over cable lines,
while Terayon uses S-CDMA, or synchronous code division multiple
access.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that CDMA offers better performance than
TDMA. CDMA offers ``greater capacity and far superior immunity to
noise,'' the electrical interference that distorts data
transmission, the Gilder Technology Report wrote in February. As a
result, cable operators that use Terayon modems can offer
high-speed Internet access to subscribers even over older cable
systems that have not been upgraded at great expense.
</P>
<P>
   But in what may be the biggest controversy surrounding Terayon,
the company's detractors argue that Terayon and analysts friendly
to it have overstated the advantage of Terayon's technology. The
reason: Big cable companies have created a consortium called
CableLabs that will certify that all new modems work
interchangeably on a single standard, called DOCSIS. Most U.S.
cable operators will buy modems only if they meet that standard,
and so far CableLabs has not incorporated Terayon's CDMA technology
into DOCSIS. In addition, any company that wants to qualify for
DOCSIS must agree to license its technology to other modem
suppliers without asking for royalties.
</P>
<P>
   That locks Terayon in a neat Catch-22, critics of the company
say. Terayon's technology advantage will not help it crack the
crucial U.S. cable market _ unless it agrees to give up its
advantage, for nothing. They note that Terayon has so far had
little success winning customers among big U.S. cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have bought this stock on the thought that the
company will receive a royalty stream from other cable modem
manufacturers may be sorely disappointed,'' said James Chanos, a
well-known short seller who has bet on a decline in Terayon's
stock. Short-sellers sell stock they have borrowed, hoping to buy
it back later when its price has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   But bullish analysts say that Chanos and other short-sellers
have overplayed their hand on this crucial issue. Terayon already
has a DOCSIS-certified modem that uses TDMA technology, and the
company has a good chance of winning CableLabs approval in the near
future for a modem that will use both CDMA and TDMA technology.
More important, the company is establishing itself as a leader in
the huge Asian cable market, having recently won important
contracts in China and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company will be successful whether or not they're in the
U.S. standard. They're doing very well in Canada. They're doing
very well in Asia,'' said Tim Long, a communications equipment
analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``We're just expecting phenomenal
growth.'' Long rates Terayon a short- and long-term buy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, bullish analysts argue that Terayon is copying
Cisco's very successful strategy of using highly valued stock for
strategic acquisitions. Terayon's cable modems are only one part of
a nine-pronged strategy that will eventually include data, voice
and multimedia transmission equipment over wireless, cable systems
and phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone from being a middle-of-the-pack cable modem
company to having a nice suite of products,'' said Ned Brines,
manager of the $850 million Phoenix Engemann Aggressive Growth
fund, which owns about 70,000 Terayon shares. ``They're either
going to be dramatically larger, or they're going to be part of
someone else.''
